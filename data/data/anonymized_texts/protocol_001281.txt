Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be random ly assigned in 
a blinded fashion to either BI 695501 or EU-approved Humira with a 1:1 allocation 
ratio in the first phase of this trial (induction). Each patient will receive a loadi ng 
dose of 160mg of BI 695501 or EU-approved Humira (Day 1), followed by 80 mg 
of BI 695501 or EU-approved Humira 2 weeks later (Day  15), thereafter 40 mg of 
BI 695501 or EU- approved Humira every second week.
Initial randomization will be stratified according to prior exposure to infliximab 
(yes/no) and to screening SES-CD(<16 or ≥16). No caps will be put on any of 
these strata.
At W eek 4,clinical response will be assessed and only patients who are classified
as responders by achieving a decrease in CDAI ≥70 will continue on trial and enter 
the maintenance phase. The hematocrit value required to determine CDAI score at 
Week 4 will be assessed locally and confirmed via central laboratory assessment.
Patients who are originally random ized to EU-approved Humira will switch to
BI695501 at Week 24 .
In addition, every effort should be made for all patients who complete the total 
48-week treatment period or who discontinue the trial medication early during the 
maintenance phase, to have an End of Treatm ent Visit as soon as possible after 
completion/discontinuation and to return for a Safety Follow -up Visit 10 weeks 
after the last dose of trial medication .
No. of patients: 
total entered: Approximately 130evaluable patients will be randomized
each treatm ent: Initially patients will be allocated to treatment in a 1:1 ratio to receive BI 695501 or 
EU-approved Humira

Safety criteria: Safety assessments include continuous AE monitoring and local tolerability 
assessment, physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body 
temperature), TBtest (IGRA ), 12-lead ECG, injection site reaction assessment, and 
laboratory tes ts.
Statistical m ethods: This trial isintended to generate additional information for the comparison of 
BI695501 withEU-approved Humi rainpatient s with active Crohn’s disease .
The statistical model for the analysis of the prim ary endpoint will be a log-linked 
binomial regression model. The model will include the stratification factors (prior 
exposure to infliximab [yes/no] and baseline SES-CD [<16 or ≥16]) and treatment 
as fixed, categorical effects..
For the prim ary and secondary endpoints, point es timates (risk difference for binary 
endpoints) together with their 90% and 95% CIs will be calculated, but will be 
interpreted in a descriptive manner.
The safety population will consist of all patients who receive at least one (full or 
partial) dose of either of the trial treatments during any dosing period. The analysis 
of AEs will be based on the concept of treatment -emergent AEs. That means that all 
AEs with an onset after the first dose of trial medication up to a period of 10 w eeks 
after the last dose of the trial medication will be assigned to the current treatment 
for evaluation.

Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatm ent 
will also be considered as treatment -emergent. Other AEs will be assigned to the 
appro priate trial phases, i.e.,screening or post-treatment. Safety endpoints and 
AESIs will be presented descriptively; in addition RRand risk difference together 
with 95% CIs will be presented.

1Patients will be randomized to each treatment in a 1:1 ratio ( BI 695501: EU -approved Humira ).
2Patients who do not achieve a clinical response at Week 4 will be excluded from the maintenance period and will have 
their EoT visit at Week 4 . Every effort should be made for all patients who discontinue to return for a Safety Follow -up 
Visit 10 weeks after their last dose of trial medication. 
3A chest X -ray is to be taken at Screening . Alternatively, results from a chest X -ray taken within 12 weeks of Screening
can be used.
4Patients must have a negative TB screening assessment, including an IGRA (e.g.
,QuantiFERON®TB Gold). In 
addition, a TB test willbe performed at Week 24 before switch from EU -approved Humira to BI 695501 ,at EoT visit ,
and ma y be performed at any time during the trial if the investigator considers it clinically necessary.
5Females only: a serum pregnancy test at Screening and a urine pregnancy test on Day 1 (baseline); a urine pregnancy test 
will be performed at the applicable visits thereafter.
6Height to be measured at Screening only; weight at every physical examination.
7Includes measurement of blood pressure and pul se rate (both sitting after 5 minutes rest). The patient’s body temperature 
will also be recorded.
8Findings of ALT or AST >1.5 times the ULN or hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL at Screening are criteria for exclusion.
9Adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent. Adverse events continuing at the EoT Visit must be 
followed to resolution or follow -up as agreed by the investigator and medical monitor. For patients who complete the 
trial or who discont inue the trial early, new AEs will be captured until the end of the 10 -week safety follow -up period.
10CDAI determination: where applicable, exclude the day of bowel preparation for colonoscopy due to misleading impact 
on assessment of pain and liquid sto ol frequency .The CDAI evaluation at Visit 1.1 will be performed based on the 
CDAI diary provided to the patient at Visit 1 (a minimum of 7 days must be allowed between visits for completion of the 
diary) .For subsequent CDAI evaluations, the diary will be provided to the patient at the previous planned visit. At 
Visit 4 (Week 4), the hematocrit value to determine CDAI score will be assessed locally and confirmed via central 
laboratory assessment. At visits whe re no physical examination is p erformed, weight must be measured for use in CDAI 
determination.
12IRT will be contacted prior to every trial medication administration visit.
13Contact IRT to confirm whether or not patient has achieved a clinical response (CDAI decrease ≥70). Patients who are 
non-responders will have an EoT visit and every effort should be made to ensure that they return for a Safety Follow -up 
visit 10 weeks afte r their last dose of trial medication. Patients achieving a cli
nical response at Week 4 will be eligible to 
continue in the trial (maintenance period) as shown in Flow Chart B.
14Trial medication should be administered every 2 weeks (±1 day up to Visit 4). Patients will receive each dose of trial 
medication at the trial site until Week 22, trial medication will be administered by suitably qualified, designated 
unblinded trial personnel (Third party blinding). All assessments an d procedures should be performed prior to trial 
medication administration, unless otherwise stated.

1. INTRODUCTION
MEDICAL BACKGROUND 1.1
Crohn’s disease is a chronic relapsing, remitting inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal 
tract characterized b y abdominal pain, fever, and bloody  or mucus -containing diarrhea
(R13-2231). The disease affects the gastrointestinal tract discontinuously  from mouth to anus, 
but most comm only the ileum and colon (40%), followed by  the small bowel only  (30%), and 
the colon only  (25%) ( R13-2232, R13 -2233). It occurs in a relatively  young population, most 
commonly  developing in people between the ages of 20 and 29, and there is no marked sex 
difference (R13-2231, R15 -0886). Although the etiology  of CD is still unknown, it is widely  
accepted that it is caused by a combination of environmental, immune ,and bacterial factors 
in genetically  susceptible individuals ( R16-1919, R16-1918, R16 -1917 ).
The incidence of CD in Europe and North America is approximately  161 to 319 cases per 
100,000 people ( R13-2231 )and is less common in Asia and Africa ( R16-1920 , R16 -
1923). 
Historically , CD has been more common in the developed world (R16-1922 );however, rates 
have been increasing, particularly  in the developing world ,since the mid -1970s ( R16-1923, 
R16-1922).
Because of m yriad symptoms, clinical status is measured using clinical indexes. The most 
widely  used in clinical trials is the CDAI  (R97-2689 ). At the mucosal level, the extent of 
disease can be graded following ileocolonoscop y according to the SES-CD(R14-2969,
R15-6247).
Current treatment options
Medical treatment for CD has two main goals: achieving remission and, once that is 
accomplished, maintaining remission (prevention of flare s). Treatment is ,thus, aimed at 
controlling the ongoing inflammation in the intestine, the cause of IBD symptoms.
Medical t herap y used in clinical practice includes 5-ASA and antibiotics (for colonic 
disease), corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs, and biologic agents . The latter is the 
newest class of drugs to be used in IBD and include sthree of the available anti –TNF -alpha
agents (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) ,as well as vedolizumab (Enty vio®) and 
natalizumab (Ty sabri®).Biologic therapies offer a distinct advantage in the treatment of IBD 
since their mechanism of action is targeted. Unlike corticosteroids,
which tend to suppress the 
entire immune sy stem and thereby  produce major side effects, biologic agents act more 
selectivel y. However, immunosuppression -related side effects ,such as an enhanced incidence 
of infections ,are also described for biologic agents.
Nutritional support also has a role as primary  therapy  or as adjunct to other treatment. When 
medical treatment is unsuccessful or with certain complications, surgery  is indicated. More 
than 70% of patients with ile al disease will require surgery  at least once durin g the course of 
their disease. Due to therapeutic failures and serious side effects of present therapies, 
alternatives continue to be needed.

DRUG PROFILE 1.2
BI695501 is a monoclonal antibody being developed as a proposed biosimilar to the 
TNF -alpha blocker, adalimumab (US- licensed Humira and EU -approved Humira). 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human ized monoclonal IgG1 antibod y specific to human 
TNF -alpha. It has human -derived heav y and light chain variable regi ons a nd human 
IgG1: kappa constant regions and is produced in a mammalian cellexpression sy stem 
(R15-5978, R15 -4915
).
For a more detaile d description of the BI 695501 profile , please refer to the current IB ,and 
for Humira ,to the SmPC or US Prescribing Information .
Humira binds specifically  to TNF -alpha ( nottoTNF -beta) and blocks its interaction with the 
p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Humira has also been shown to l yse cells expressing 
surface TNF in vitro in the presence of complement and modulate biological responses that 
are induced or regulated by  TNF, including changes in adhesion molecules responsible for 
leukocy te migration (endothelia l leukocy te adhesion molecule -1, vascular cell adhesion 
molecule -1, and intercellular adhesion molecule -1) (R15-5978
).
In contrast to rheumatological indications, where binding and neutralization of s oluble TNF 
is the prominent feature of adalimumab’s phar macody namic activity , clinical efficacy  in IBD
requires additional effects attributable to interaction of adalimumab with tmTNF, 
subsequently  leading to reverse signaling (T cell apoptosis, inhibition of cytokine release 
from macrophages) and induction of complement dependent c ytotoxicity /
antibody -dependent cell -mediated c ytotoxicity .The contribution of each of these effects is
still a matter of scientific debate.
Humira (adalimumab) has received regulatory  approval for CD in the US, the EU, and many  
other countries ( R15-5978 , R15 -4915).
Humira has a generally  favorable clinical safety  profile, and is not associated with AEs that 
would suggest a high risk to patients participating in this trial. I n patients treated with 
Humira, most common adverse reactio ns (incidence >10%) include infections (e.g., upper 
respiratory , sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache ,and rash, abdominal pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, nausea,
and vomiting. Allergic reactions (e.g., allergic rash, 
anaph ylactoid reaction, fixed dr ug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been 
observed in approximately 1% of patients.
Cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in patients receiving anti -TNF 
therap y. Some cases have been fatal, the majorit y of which we re in patients concomitantly  
receiving other immunosuppressive medications.
Tuberculosis reactivation or new TB infections have been observed in patients receiving 
Humira and other TNF -inhibitors, including patients who had previousl y received treatment 
for latent or active TB.

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF- blockers, including Humira, more 
cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF -blocker -treated adult patients 
compared to control -treated adult patients. M alignancies were rare side effects in clinical 
trials of Humira , withnon-melanoma skin cancer and ly mphoma most frequently  reported ; 
other malignancies included breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma.
Humira was evaluated in over 1500 adult patients with modera tely to severely active CD 
(CDAI ≥220 and ≤450) in trials that were performed prior to approval , with some patients 
followed for at least 3 years of open -label adalimumab . In the European Medicines Agency
SmPC, 
three randomized, double -blind, placebo -contr olled studies were reported for Humira , 
which assessed the efficacy  and safet y of Humira for the treatment of CD(R15-4915).
The anal ytical similarit y between BI 695501 and US -licensed Humira was assessed in a 
single -dose PK study  in the cy nomolgus monkey  and a local tolerance study  in rabbits. 
Additionally , the PK similarity  between BI 695501, US -licensed Humira and EU -approved 
Humira was assessed in a Phase I clinical trial ( 1297.8 )in healt hy volunteers. The results of 
these studies are provided in the IB.
The PK similarity  of BI 695501 to US -licensed Humira and EU -approved Humira was 
demonstrated in a healthy volunteer study  (c03070713 ). Single s.c. doses of 40 mg 
BI695501, US -licensed Humira and EU -approved Humira were generall y well tolerated b y 
healthy  male subjects. There were no notable differences between the 3 treatment arms with 
respect to safet y, tolerability , and immunogenicity. Including both Phase Istudies, a total of 
175 subjects were exposed to BI 695501.
Overall, the AEs seen in healthy  subject s for BI 695501 and both EU- approved Humira and
US-licensed H umira were in line with the known safet y profile presented in the US 
prescribing information for Humira ( R15-5978) and in the SmPC for EU -approved Humira 
(R15-4915 ).
A Phase III trial(1297.2) in patients with moderate to severe RAis ongoing . A total of 
645patients with moderate to severe RA were included in this blinded trial and are being 
treated with either BI 695501 or US -licensed Humira , monitored by  an IDMC.

2. RATIONALE, OBJECTIVE S, AND BENEFIT - RISK 
ASSESSMENT
RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL 2.1
The CD trial1297.4 is intended to generate comparative PK, efficacy , safety ,and 
immunogenicit y data in an indication where these modes of adalimumab’s action are 
important. The aim is to explore similarity  of sTNF and tmTNF -related effects, initially  
established by  the extrapolation approach which is based on comparative analytical testing 
and preclinical models, and has allowed extrapolation across indications.
The1297.4 trial will also address switching between EU-approved Humira and BI 695501, as 
well as treatment of infliximab pre -treated patients after secondary  resistance, both scenarios 
reflecting daily  clinical practice in the future.
The primary  outcome measure is defined as CDAI at Week 4,  
 
 
TRIAL OBJECTIVES 2.2
The primar y objective of this trial is to compare the clinical efficacy  ofBI695501 with
EU-approved Humira in patien
ts with active CD.
The secondary  objectives of this trial are to compare the efficacy andsafet y ofBI 695501 
with EU-approved Humira across the induction and maintenance phases, as covered b y CDAI
andsafet y monitoring.
BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT 2.3
Patients enrolled into this equivalence trial are expect ed to derive similar benefit and risk 
from the trial treatment across both arms. This is based on the similarity  observed during 
preclinical, anal ytical, functional ,and toxicological testing between the investigational 
medicinal product and the comparator .
Patient risk will be minimized in this trial by  implementing conservative eligibility  criteria.

Adverse events, bod y temperature, vital signs, ECGs ,and safet y laborator y results as well as 
immunogenicit y will be monitored at different time points during the trial and during the 
long-term safet y follow -up period up to 10 weeks after the last administration of trial 
medication.
Although rare, a potential for DILI is under constant surveillance by  sponsor s and regulators. 
Therefore, this trial requires timely  detection, evaluation, and follow -up 
of laboratory
alterations inselected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients´ safet y, see also 
Section 5.3.6.1.
All safety aspects will be r egularl y monitored b y bot h the sponsor and a CRO during the 
Medical Qualit y Review Meetings .
To avoid a risk of reactivating TB and other infections, TB tests (IGRA), HBsAg
(qualitative), hepatitis B antibody  (qualitative), hepatitis C antibodies (qualitative), HIV-1 
and HIV -2 antibody  (qualitative) will be performed to exc lude patients testing positive.
In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-inhibitors, including Humira, more 
cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF -inhibitor -treated adult patients 
compared to control -treated adult patients. Therefore, a possibl y increased risk for the 
development of malignancies cannot be excluded.
The PK similarity  of BI 695501 to US -licensed and EU -approved Humira was established in 
the P hase I trial 1297.8 ( c03070713). Additionally , there were no notable differences with 
respect to safet y, tolerability ,and immunogenicity between BI 695501 andUS-licensed and 
EU-approved Humira in this Phase I  trial,and the dose of 40 mg BI 695501 was safe and 
well tolerated in healthy  male volunteers. The observed blinded AE profile in the P hase III 
trial 1297.2 has thus far revealed no unexpected safety . The review of safety  data by  the 
IDMC todate has not suggested any  clinicall y relevant differences in safety profile between 
Humira and BI 695501.
There have been no major clinically  relevant findings with respect to clinical laboratory  
evaluation, vital signs, ECGs, or injection site reactions (including anaph ylactic or allergic 
reactions) . Based on extensive preclinical, anal ytical, functional, and toxicological testing 
carried out prior to initiation of this trial, and the Phase I data described above, BI 695501, as 
a proposed biosimilar to H umira, is expected to show a similar efficacy , safety , 
immunogenicit y
,and PK profile in patients with CD .

3. DESCRIPTION OF DESIG N AND TRIAL POPULATI ON
OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1
This is a n exploratory ,randomized, 56-week, double -blind, parallel arm, multiple dose, 
active comparator trial of BI 695501 and EU-approved Humira , with a 48- week treatment 
period and a 10 -week follow -up period (starting after last dose of trial medication at Week
46)in patients with moderate lyto severe lyactive CD,and a primary  endpoint assessment at 
Week 4.
The trial will consist of a Screening period of up to a maximum of 28 day s, a 48-week 
treatment period consisting of an induction period from Baseline to Week 4and a 
maintenance period from Week 5to Week 48, and a 10-week safety  follow -up period
(starting after last dose of trial medication at Week 46)
.
Approximately  130 evaluable patients with moderately  to severely  active CD will be 
randomized into the trial. Patients will be randomly  assigned to receive either BI 695501 or 
EU-approved Humira according to the randomization ratio and the stratification factors as 
described in Section 7.6. Each patient will receive a loading dose of 160 mg of BI 695501 or 
EU-approved Humira (Day  1), followed by  80 mg of BI 695501 or EU-approved Humira
2weeks later (Day  15), and thereafter 40 mg of BI 695501 or EU -approved Humira every  
2week suntil the en d of the treatment period (Week 46; with End of Treatment [EoT] 
evaluations at Week 48 ). Trial medication will be administered by  s.c. injection.
AtWeek 
4, patients will be assessed and those who are classified as responders ( CDAI 
decrease of ≥ 70 compared to baseline ) will continue on trial and enter the maintenance phase. 
Patients who are originally  randomized to EU -approved Humira will switch toBI695501 at 
Week 24 .
Patients will undergo up to 27 visits (including 13trial medication administration only visits) 
over the duration of the trial ( 56weeks). The trial procedures to be undertaken at each visit 
are shown in Flow Chart Aand Flow Chart B .
The primary  endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients in each treatment group with a 
clinical response (CDAI decrease of ≥70 compared to baseline) at W eek 4. The primary  
analysis will take place when the last patient has completed the Week 4 asse ssments .For 
more details, please refer to Section 7.4.1.
Patients who discontinue the trial will, at discontinuation, have an EoT visit (see Flow 
Chart Aand Flow Chart B ). Every  effort should be made for all patients who complete the 
total 4 8-week treatment period or who discontinue the trial medication early , to return for a 
Safety  Follow -up Visit 10 weeks after their last dose of trial medication.
Patients may  return for unscheduled visits should their medical condition warrant urgent 
attention at the discretion of the investigator.
An overview of the trial design is shown in Figure 3.1: 1.

DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 3.2
CONTROL GROUP(S)
The current trial is being performed to compare the clinical efficacy  of BI695501 with 
EU-approved Humira in patient s with moderate lyto severe lyactive CD.Additionally , the 
safet y of BI 695501 will be assessed during long -term treatment and after switching from 
EU-approved Humira.
This is a n exploratory , randomized, 56-week, double- blind, parallel arm, multiple dose, 
active comparator trial of BI 695501 and EU-approved Humira, with a 48-week treatment 
period and a 10-week follow- up period (starting from Week 46) ,in patients with moderate ly
to severe lyactive CD.
Patien ts will be randomized according to a 1:1 ratio to either BI 695501 orEU-
approved 
Humira in a blinded fashion. A tWeek 4, patients will be assessed and those who are 
classified as responders ,by achieving a decrease in CDAI  ≥70, will continue the trial and
enter the maintenance phase.
SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION 3.3
In view of the TNF -blocking mechanism of adalimumab, care has been taken to exclude 
patients likely  to be at greater risk of severe infection, severe immunosuppression or severe 
heart failure (see Section 3.3.3 ).
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial(i.e.,who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.

3.3.4 Removal of patients from therapy or assessments
Removal of individual patients 3.3.4.1
An excessive withdrawal rate from the trial can have a severe negative impact on the 
scientific value of the trial. Every  effort should be made to keep patients in the trial as 
scheduled. This includes careful patient selection and appropriate explanation of the trial 
requirements and procedures prior to enrolment as well as an explanation of the 
consequences of premature withdrawal .
Patients who do not meet all of the inclusion criteria or who meet one or more of the 
exclusion criteria will not be randomized, will be considered screen failures. The primary  
reason for the scr een failure will be recorded on the eCRF .Patients may  be rescreened if the 
investigator considers that the reason for screen failure may  be resolved after a suitable 
period.
Patients have the right to withdraw from this trial at any  time for any  reason.

Two situations can occur in this trial and need to be documented accordingly:
a) An individual patient is to be withdrawn from the trial if:
The patient decides to discontinue participation in the trial by  withdrawal of consent. In 
this case, no more invest igations will be performed. The patient does not have to justify  
the decision.
b) Based on assessment b y the investigator, an individual patient is to be discontinued 
from treatment with the investigational compound if :
Lack of efficacy : absence of a clini cal response at Week 4, defined as a decrease in CDAI 
of ≥70.
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational product 
or other trialmedication .
Development of a toxicity or AEwhich warrants treatment discontinuation including ,but 
not limited to ,SAEs or SUSARs .
The patient can no longer be treated with trial medication for other medical reasons ( such 
assurgery , AEs, other diseases, or pregnancy ).
The patient has an AE that is categorized as a serious infection (infe ctions requiring i.v.
antibiotics or meeting the regulatory  definition of a nSAE [including, but not limited to 
systemic fungal infections, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C]).
The patient has repeatedly  shown to be non -compliant with important trial procedure s 
and, in the opinion of both, the investigator and sponsor representative , is not willing or 
able to stick to the trial requirements in the future.
If a patient permanentl y discontinues from trial medication for an y reason, every effort 
should be made for the patient to attend the E oT Visit as soon after trial discontinuation as 
possible. For patients who discontinue the trial medication earl y (and do not withdraw 
consent), every  effort should be made to follow the patient s for efficacy  assessments Week 
48, wherever possible. In addition, every  effort should be made for all patients who complete 
the total 4 8-week treatment period or who discontinue the trial early , to return for a safet y 
follow -up visit 10 weeks after the last dose of trial medication.
Given the patient’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for earl y treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up as outlined in Flow Chart A or Flow Chart B , as appropriate,
and Section 6.2.3 .
For all patients the reason for withdrawal (e.g.,AEs) must be recorded in the eCRF . These 
data will be included in t he trial database and reported.

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial
In the US and EU, Humira has received health authority approval for the treatment of CD, 
RA, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ank ylosing spond ylitis,and juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis. The doses of BI 695501 and EU-approved Humira selected for this trial follow the 
approved posology  of Humira for the treatment of CD (a loading dose of 160 mg, followed 
2weeks later b y a dose of 80 mg ,then 2week slater and subsequently  every  2 weeks by 
40mg, all by  s.c. injection ).
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
Once patients have completed screening, have met all of the inclusion criteria and no t met 
anyof the exclusion criteria, randomization willoccur on Day  1 through a standard 
randomization visit call, using the IRT s ystem.Patients will be randomized to each treatment 
in a 1:1 ratio ( BI 695501: EU -approved Humi ra) according to the stratificatio n factors 
defined in Section 7.6 .
Each PFS of trial medication will be labeled with the trial code and a unique medication 
identification number. The I RT s ystem will be used for the randomization, allocation ,and 
supply  of trial medication throughout the trial. The I RT will assign each patient unique 
medication numbers for each drug administration (each s yringe will have a unique 
medication number) .Details of the I RT s ystem will be provided in the ISF.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Each patient will receive 160 mg (loading dose) of BI 695501 or EU -approved Humira at the 
Baseline Visit (Day  1) followed by  80 mg of BI 695501 or EU -approved H umira 2weeks 
later (Day  15/Week 2), and then 40 mg of BI 695501 or EU -approved Humira at Week 4 
(primary  endpoint).
At Week 4 (Day  29), patients achieving a clinical response (defined as a decrease in CDAI 
≥70) will continue receiving their randomized treatment (40 mg BI 695501 or E U-approved 
Humira every  2weeks) in a blinded fashion. The hematocrit value required to determine 
CDAI  score at Week 4 will be assessed locall y and confirmed via central laboratory

assessment. At Week 24, p atients originall y randomized to EU- approved Humira will switch 
to receive 40 mg BI 6 95501 every  2 weeks . All patients will then continue to receive BI 
695501 at the same dose until Week 46.
Patients not achieving a clinical response at W eek 4will not receive an yfurther treat ment
with trialmedicat ion, but will be followed up for safet yafter 10 weeks (Safety  Follow -up 
Visit) .
Prefilled sy ringes will be used for the administration (see Section 4.1.1 )and all patients will 
receive their injections at the trial site througho ut the trial until Week 22 , and 
BI695501/ EU-approved Humira will be administered b y a dedicated, unblinded member of 
trial personnel (third party  blind ing). From Week 24 onwards ,when all patien ts will be 
receiving BI 695501 when all patients will be recei ving BI 695501, any suitably  trained trial 
personnel may administer the medication to the patient .However, patients and other trial 
personnel must remain blinded with respect to the initial assignment to EU-approved Humira 
or BI 695501.
After the first injection in the induction period (Visit 2) and the injection at Visit 1 4(when 
patients originall y randomized to EU- approved Humira will switch to receive BI 695501) , 
patient s
will remain at the clinical site for at least 1 hour for observ ation of any  AEs.
Dose modification is not permitted during this trial. If a patient misses a dose of trial 
medication then the dose should be administered as soon as possible , in accordance with the 
visit schedule presented in Flow Chart A and Flow Chart B . 
In the event of an anaph ylactic or other serious allergic reaction, the administration of trial 
medication will be discontinued immediately and appropriate therap y instituted .Every  effort 
should be made to ensure that patients who discontinue trial medication are followed up as 
described in Section 3.3.4.1 .
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
Blinding 4.1.5.1
This is a double -blind trial, therefore pati ents, investigator s,and every one involved in trial 
conduct (except the trial personnel administering the trial medication –third party  blinding) 
will remain blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after database 
lock. The unbli nded trial personnel receiving, handling, and administering the trial 
medication will not be involved in any  other trial assessments or procedures.
Details of blinding procedures are described in Appendix 10.1 , Medication Blinding 
Procedures.
The randomization code will be kept secret by  Clinical Tri al Support up to database lock.
The secondary  packaging (boxes containing PFS) will be identical for both BI 695501 and 
EU-approved Humira, allowing the blinding of the site pharmacy during the first 22 weeks of

treatment .Thereafter, all patients will receive BI 695501 and the drug supplies will not 
require blinding via secondary  packaging.
The data will be unblinded at the time point of the primary  anal ysis (see Section 7.4.1 ), only  
for individuals involved in the primary  analy sis and reporting.
Access to the randomization code will be controlled and documented. All persons directl y 
involved in the conduct of the trial will have no access to the treatment a llocation prior to 
final database lock.
Unblinding and breaking the code 4.1.5.2
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator / Pharmacist / investigational drug 
storage manager via IRT. It must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identit y of 
the trial drug must be known to the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or otherwise assure safety  of trial participants . If unblinding is required in the 
interest of the safet y of a patient, and time allows, the investigato r will discuss the matter 
with the Medical Advisor before unblinding whenever possible. If the code is broken for a 
patient (via the IRT) the sponsor must be informed immediately . The reason for unblinding 
must be documented in the patient’s source documen ts and the appropriate eCRF along with 
the date and the initials of the person who broke the code.
The process for breaking the blind will be handled through the IRT. Instructions for this will 
be described in the IRT user manual that will be provided to each site.
Due to the requirements to report SUSARs , it may be necessary  for a representative from the 
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomization code for 
individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only  be given to 
authorized P harmacovigilance representatives and will not be shared further.
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling , and re -supply
The investigational products will be provided by Boehringer Ingelheim or a designated CRO . 
They  will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of GMP .Re-supply  to 
thesites will be managed via an IRT s ystem, which will also monitor expiry dates of supplies 
available at the site s
.
Fordetails of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.
4.1.7 Storage conditions
All trial medications must be kept in a secure place with limited access under appropriate 
storage conditions and handled according to GMP and GCP. The medication must be stored 
in a refrigerator at a controlled temperature (2 to 8°C [36 to 46°F]) and must not be frozen. A 
temperature log will be kept at the trial site, and will be completed (with a minimum and 
maximum reading) on each working day . Syringes will be kept in the outer carton in order to 
protect from light. Detailed storage conditions will be described on the trial medication 
labels.

Surgical bowel resection is not permitted within 6 months prior to randomization (Day 1), or 
at an y time throughout the trial. If patients need surgery  during the trial, they  must 
discontinue.
Restrictions on diet and life sty le 4.2.2.2
Male patient s with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use a medicall y 
acceptable method of contraception during the trial and for 6 months after the last dose of 
trial drug. 
Restrictions regarding women of childbearing potential 4.2.2.3
A serum β -hCG test will be performed at Screening in women of childbearing potential. 
Thereafter, a local urine pregnancy  test will be performed as i ndicated in the flow c harts (see
Flow Chart A andFlow Chart B ). Any woman with a confirmed positive pregnancy  test 
during screening is not eligible for the trial. A positive urine pregnancy  test du ring the 
treatment periods of the trialrequires immediate interruption of trialtreatment until a serum 
β-hCG test is performed and found to be negative. If the serum β -hCG test is positive, the 
patient must be discontinued from trial medication .
Women of childbearing potential must use the contraception methods described in the patient 
information and in Section 3.3.2 .
TREATMENT COMPLIANCE 4.3
Compliance will be assured by  administration of all trial medication by  the dedica ted trial 
personnel considered qualified to perform the s.c.injections. The measured plasma 
concentrations will provide additional confirmation of compliance.
Patien ts who are non -compliant (for instance, who do not attend scheduled visits or violate 
trial restrictions) may  be discontinu ed from the trial treatment by the investigator after 
consultation with the sponsor or sponsor’s representative, and the eCRF will be completed 
accordingl y.

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 5.2
The assessments described in the following sections will be made at the time points indicated 
in Flow C hartAand Flow Chart B .
5.2.1 C DAI
Evaluation of CDAI will be performed by the investigator at the visits indicated in the 
Flow Chart A and Flow Chart B .
The CDAI is a validated instrument to measure disease severit y in CD ( R97-2689 ). It is the 
most widely  used clinical index for the evaluation of disease activity  and remission in 
inflammatory  CD in clinical trials . It has been recommended by  the International 
Organization for the study  of IBD and the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization for

defining CDactivity  (R02-0112 , R15-4343 ) and has been accepted by  the regulatory  
authorities ( R13-2623 ).
The CDAI score is composed of eight factors as shown in Table 5.2.1: 1 .The patient is 
required to keep a s ymptom diary  for 4of these 8 variables (number of liquid stools, 
abdominal pain, general well- being ,and use of antidiarrheal drugs) for 7 consecutive days 
before each CDAI eval uation. Hematocrit results are integral to the CDAI calculation and 
will be assessed at each visit by  the central laboratory  as part of the safety  laboratory  anal yses 
(see Section 5.3.3 ). The Visit 1 hematocrit results will be us ed for the calculation of CDAI at 
Visit 1.1 in order to determine eligibility of the patient to be included in the trial. At Week 4, 
the hematocrit value required to determine CDAI score will be assessed locally  and 
confirmed via central laboratory  assessm ent. At Visit 8 (Week 12), the hematocrit value from 
the central laboratory  assessment at Visit 6 (Week 8) will be used to determine CDAI score.
At visits where CDAI evaluation is performed and no phy sical examination is planned, body  
weight must be measur ed for use in CDAI determination.
TheCDAI score is a sum of the eight factors after adjustment with a weighting factor; CDAI 
scores range from 0 to approximately  600. The day  of bowel preparation for colonoscopy  and 
the day  of colonoscop y will be excluded from the CDAI assessment. This is to prevent 
misleading influences (pain and liquid stool frequency ) on CDAI evaluation.

5.2.2 Endoscopy
Endoscopies will be performed for the evaluation of SES-CD and mucosal ulceration at the 
visits indicated in Flow Chart A
Lesions detected b y endoscopy  (ileocolonoscop y) will be scored b y means of the validated 
SES-CD, as described below. The same endoscopist at the trial site will complete the 
SES-CD for each endoscopy  immediatel y after the procedure. The investigator (or designate) 
will record each endos copy  and send the video to the central imaging laboratory . A central 
reading of all endoscopies will be performed b y an independent blinded reviewer and the 
findings scored using SES-CD. Eligibility  at Screening must be confirmed using the centrall y 
read s cores prior to randomization.

The results for SES-CD and mucosal ulceration will be returned to the trial sitefrom the 
central imaging laboratory for entry  into the appropriate eCRF.
SES-CD 5.2.2.1
The SES-CD was developed as a reproducible measure that could be used to assess response 
to therap y in CD ( R14- 2969 ,R15-6247 ) using an endoscopic index capable of assessing the 
severit y of mucosal lesions in colonic or ileocolonic CD. The scoring s ystem is repre sented in 
Table 5.2.2: 1 below. The index is relatively  complex and must be performed by  an 
experienced endoscopist who has been trained in the precise and specific data recording 
procedure required.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 5.3
5.3.1 Physical examination
A phy sical examination will be performed at the visits indicated in Flow Chart A and 
Flow Chart B .
Whenever possible, the same person should perform the phy sical examination throughout the 
trial (i.e., for all patients at each trial site). The physical examination will include assessment 
of general appearance, skin, head, neck, throat, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, and 
neurological s ystems, thyroid gland, musculoskeletal sy stem/limbs, respiratory  tract ,and 
abdomen. Clinically  relevant abnormal findings will be reported as baseline conditions or 
AEs.
Body weight will also be meas ured. Height will be measured at Screening only.
5.3.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed at the visits indicated in Flow Chart A and Flow Chart B .
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be taken following at least 5 minutes rest 
while the patient is in a sitting position. The patient’s body  temperature will also be recorded.
The investigator must assess all vital signs findings at each visit. If the investigator finds an y 
clinically  relevant abnormalities, these must be reported as AEs/SAEs as appropriate (see 
Section 5.3.6 ).
5.3.3 S afety laboratory parame ters
Blood and urine samples for determination of serum chemistry , hematology ,urinaly sis,and 
other tests will be taken at the times indicated in Flow Chart A and Flow Chart B .
The laboratory  parameters listed in Appendix 10.2 will be measured .
The investigator must assess all laboratory  results. The investigator will evaluate any  change 
in laboratory  values and all clinical laboratory  tests will be reviewed for potential clinical 
significance at all time points throughout the trial. The investigator should endeavor to 
provide a reason for all results deemed not clinically  significant. If the investigator

determines a laboratory  abnormality  to be clinically  significant, it will be considered an 
AE/SAE (see Section 5.3.6 ); however, if the laboratory  value abnormality  is consistent with a 
current diagnosis, it will be documented accordingl y.
Blood and stool samples will be anal yzed by a central laboratory . The central laboratory  
vendo r will also provide the materials for blood sampling. Instructions for the labeling, 
storage ,and shipment of the samples can be found in the L aboratory  Manual. Details of all 
blood variable units , reference ranges , and blood sample volumes can be found in the 
Laboratory  Manual.
At Week 4, in order to assess clinical response during the visit, the hematocrit value required 
to determine CDAI score will be assessed locall y and subs equently confirmed via central 
laboratory  assessment.
Pregnancy  testing will be performed by  a central laboratory  using serum at Screening or by a 
local laboratory  using urine at al l applicable visits thereafter.
It should also be noted that additional samples may be required if medically indicated, e.g., at 
unscheduled vi sits to follow safet y findings.
5.3.4 Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead ECG (I, II, III, aVR, aVL , aVF , V1 –V6) will be recorded using a computerized 
electrocardiograph at the visits indicated in Flow Chart A and Flow Chart B .
All ECGs will be recorded for 10 -second duration after the patients have rested for at least 
5minutes in a supine position. ECG assessment will alway s precede all other trial procedures 
at the same time point (except blood drawing from an i.v.cannula which is alread y in place) 
to avoid impact of sampling on the ECG quality .
The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will 
be stored in the patient’s medical file.
The investigator or a designate will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and 
whether it is clinically  significant, if abnormal. Additionally , any  occurrence of re -or 
depolarization disorders, arrh ythmic disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed. ECGs 
may be repeated for quality  reasons (like alternating current artefacts, muscle movements, 
electrode dislocation) and the repeated ECG will be used for anal ysis. Additional 
(unscheduled) ECGs may  be collected by  the investigator for safet y reasons.
Abnormal findings will be reported as AEs (during the trial) or baseline conditions (at 
Screening ) if judged clinically  relevant by  the investigator. Any  ECG abnormalities, judged 
as clinically  relevant, will be monitored carefull y and, if necessa ry, the patient will be 
removed from the trial and will receive the appropriate medical treatment. Additionally , 
evaluation of these ECGs will be performed b y a board certified cardiologist.
Information about the details of ECG collection and the parameter s assessed will be provided 
in the I SF.

5.3.5 O ther safety parameters
Tuberculosis assessment 5.3.5.1
A chest X -ray will be reviewed by  the investigator or designee at Screening. If chest 
radiographs have been taken within 12 weeks of the Screening Visit then the chest 
radiographs do not need to be repeated (as long as they  show no clinically  significant 
abnormality  and no signs or sy mptoms suggestive of lung disease that would exclude the 
patient from the trial). T he results must be entered into the eCRF.
AnIGRA (e.g., QuantiFERON®-TB Gold ) will be used to assess TB status at Screening and, 
for patients who continue to the maintenance phase, at Visit 14 W eek 24 (before s witch from 
EU-approved Humira to BI 69550 and at EoT ( Week 48 or earlier for patients who 
discontinue d treatment during the maintenance phase )
.In the event of an indeterminate result 
at Screening, the test should be repeated. If a second indeterminate result is obtained then the 
patient must be excluded from the trial participation .
In the event of an i ndeterminate or positive result during the stud y, the test should be repeated 
and if a result is positive ,then the patient will discontinue receiving the study  treatment and 
followed up for safet y. The patient will be referred to the specialist as required by  local 
regulations.
5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
Definitions of AEs 5.3.6.1
Adverse event
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not con sidered re lated to the medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an AEis at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may  arise from use 
of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorization or from occupational 
exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off -label use,
overdose, misus e, abuse ,and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
Boehringer Ingelheim 12Dec2017
BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 48of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
AnSAE is defined as any AE which:
results in death,
is life -threatening, refer ringto an event in which the patient is at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might cause death if 
more severe,
requires inpatient hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization ,
results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,or
is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
or
is deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
upon appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardize the patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions .
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospitaliza tionbut might jeopardize the 
patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias ,or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization ,
or development of dependency  or abuse. An y suspected transmission via a medicinal product 
of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
Cancers o f new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the 
cancer .
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Importa nt Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by  their nature, can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as given 
above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided in the I SF. These events should 
alway s be reported as SAEs as described above .
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g.,the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. 
AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE s (see above ).

BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 49of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters:
an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥2 fold UL N measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
marked peak aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN
These lab oratory findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these 
laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” 
provided in the I SF.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalo pathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab oratory
results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these 
parameters are analy zed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results 
meet the criteria of hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist 
should be followed .
For further details see Appendix 10.4 .
Anaph ylactic reactions
Serious infection (defined as infections requiring i.v. antibiotics or meeting the regulatory  
definition of an SAE)
Hypersensitivity  reactions .
Protocol -specified AESIs can be classified as serious or non- serious but all AESI s must be 
reported in an expedited manner similar t o SAEs on an SAE form (i.e. ,non-serious AESIs 
must be reported on the SAE form and follow SAE reporting timelines).
Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are eas ily tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of AEs
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reaso nable possibility  of a causal 
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an AE. An adverse reaction, in 
contrast to an AE, is characterized by the fact that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an occurrence is suspected.

Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re- challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases , and relevant 
history .
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class
A plausible time to onset of the event relati ve to the time of drug exposure
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
No medicall y sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. ,pre-existing
or concomita nt diseases, or co -medications)
The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed 
to drugs (e.g. ,Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome)
An indication of dose- response (i.e. ,greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g.,pre-treatment cases, diagn osis of cancer or chronic disease within days/weeks of 
drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into account 
the pharmacological properties of the com pound (e.g. ,after 5 half -lives) .
Of note, this 
criterion may  not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despit e 
removing the original trigger .
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanat ion (e.g. ,
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug conc erned)
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
Adverse event collection and reporting 5.3.6.2
AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files.

BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 51of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF(s) by  the 
investigator :
From signing th e informed consent onwards through the REP (defined as 10 weeks after 
last administration of trial medication ), until the individual patient’s end of trial:
- A ll AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESI s
However, if an individual patient discontinues trial medication prematurel y but stay s in 
the trial (i.e.,iffurther visits incl. telephone visits , or vital status assessments are planned )
from then on and until the individual patient’s end of the trial ,the investigator must report 
related SAEs and related AESI s.
After the individual patient’s end of trial:
- T he investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for AEs but should 
only report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the investigator may 
become aware .
The above instructions are summarized schematically  below.
The REP is defined as 10 weeks after the last trial medication application. All AEs which 
occurred through the treatment phase and throughout the REP will be considered as on 
treatment (see Section 7.3.4 )
. Events which occurred after the REP will be considered as 
post-treatment events.
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI S AE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) t o the 
sponsor’s /sponsor’s designee’s unique entry  point (specific contact details will be provided in 
the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available. In specific 
occasions the investigator could inform the sponsor /sponsor’s designee upfront via telephone. 
This does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.

c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 52of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and the BI SAE form. The investigator should determine the causal relationship 
to the trial medication and any possible interactions between the investigational drug(s) and a 
non-i nvestigational medicinal product/auxiliary  medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE i n the eCRF and SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination ,and laboratory  test results, if they  are 
judged clinically  relevant by  the investigator.
Ifsuch abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as baseline 
conditions .
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they  have resolved, have been sufficiently  characterized , or no further information 
can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare case s pregnancy  mayoccur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled into
this clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report immediately  
(within 24 hours) a potential drug exposure during pregnancy (DEDP )to the 
sponsor ’s/sponsor’s designee’s unique entry  point (specific contact details will be provided in 
the ISF). The Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the s ponsor’s /sponsor’s designee’s unique entry  point on the 
Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE 
and/or AESI, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not t he SAE form 
is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy  an SAE 
form must be completed in addition.

The primary  efficacy  endpoint (CDAI  decrease of ≥70 compared to baseline) is a standard 
outcome criterion that iswidely  accepted for regulatory  purposes to demonstrate efficacy  on 
signs and s ymptoms of CD.  
Therefore, the appropriateness of all measur ements applied in this trial is assured and is in 
line with guidance from regulatory  authorities ( R13-2623 ).

DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS 6.2
Study  procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in Flow Chart A , Flow Chart B ,and 
the respective protocol sections. Refer to Section 5 for explanations of procedures.
6.2.1 Screening and run -in period(s)
The Screening period in this trial will comprise t wo separate visits. Once the patient has 
provided informed consent (before an y trial -specific procedures or assessments are 
performed), meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria (see 
Section 3.3 ), the trial site will enter the screened patient into the sy stem using the IRT.
Screening Visit 1, Day  -28 to Day  -14
The following will be performed/collected:
Demographic information (including gender, date of birth, ethnicity , and race), and 
medical and surgical history  (including CD history  and history  of opportunistic infection)
Infection screen (HBsAg, antiHCV ,and HIV test, per the investigator’s discretion and/or
where mandated b y local authorities )

12-lead ECG (see Section 5.3.4 )
Previous and concomitant therap y (see Section 4.2 )
Assessment of AEs (see Section 5.3.6 )
Following completion of the above screening procedures at Visit 1, p atients who are eligible 
to continue will receive a patient CDAI diary  to complete their daily  symptoms during the
7-dayperiod immediately  before Visit1.1.Sites must ensure that sufficie nt time is allowed 
between Visit 1 and Visit 1.1 to allow completion of the CDAI diary .
Screening Visit 1.1, Day  -9
At V isit 1.1, the patient CDAI  diary  will be reviewed by  the investigator in order to assess the 
CDAI  score. The hematocrit result and weight measurement from V isit 1 must be used to 
calculate the CDAI score at V isit1.1(see Section 5.2.1 ). Only  patients with moderate to 
severe CD, defined as CDAI score ≥220 and ≤450 will undergo an end oscopy  at V isit 1.1
(see Section 5.2.2 ). Evidence of mucosal ulcers in at least one segment of the ileum or colon
and a SES-CD score ≥7 (or ≥4 for patients with isolated ileal disease ) must be confirmed b y 
central independent reviewer(s) prior to randomization.
Once patients have completed screening at Visit 1.1 , have met all the inclusion criteria and 
have not met an yof the exclusion criteria, randomization willoccur on Day 1 (-1/+2) through 
a standard randomization visit call, using the IRT sy stem. Patients will be randomized to each 
treatment in a 1:1 ratio (BI 695501: EU -approved Humira) according to the stratification 
factors. Patients will be randomly  assigned in a blinded fashion to BI 695501 or EU-approv ed 
Humira as described in Section 4.1.3 and Section 7.6 .
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
Prior to Week 24, BI 695501/ EU-approv ed Humira will be administered by a suitably  
qualified, designated unblinded trial personnel . From Week 24 onwards, when all patients 
will be receiving BI 695501, it will not be necessary for the trial personnel administering the 
medication to be unbli nded .However, patients and other trial personnel must remain blinded 
with respect to the initial assignment to EU-approved Humira or BI 695501. All 
administrations of trial medication will be performed at the trial site. Trial medication will be 
administered every  2weeks ( -1/+2 day s at Visit 2, ±1 day  up to Visit 4and±3 day s from 
Visit 5 onwards).

7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL 7.1
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel arm, multiple dose, multicenter, multinational,
active comparator trial of BI 695501 and EU -approved Humira.
The primary  objective of this trial is to compare the clinical efficacy  ofBI695501 with
EU-approved Humira in patients with active CD at the end of the induction phase at Week 4 
by means of the RR .
The primary  endpoint ( Section 5.1.1 ) will be analy zed using a log-linked binomial model , 
which will include stratification factors as covariates (i.e., prior exposure to infliximab 
[yes/no] and screening SES-CD (<16 or ≥16).
NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES 7.2
This exploratory  trial is intended to generate additional data in patients with active CD.
Therefore , no formal confirmatory  hypotheses for the pr imary  efficacy  analy sisare defined.
PLANNED ANALYSES 7.3
The primary  anal ysis set will be the FAS according to the intention to treat principle. The
FAS will consist of all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of trial medication, 
and have all efficacy  measures relevant for the CDAI , measured at baseline and at least once 
post-baseline.
A PPS of patients who have followed the CTP in all essential criteria will be created for 
sensitivity  anal yses. Patients included in the FAS who have important protocol violations 
relevant for efficac y prior or at Week 4 will be excluded from the PPS. Protocol violations 
will be assessed on a case- by-case basis. 
A protocol violation will be considered important if 
it can be expected to have a distorting influence on the assessment of the primary  endpoi nt. 
Important protocol violations may include:
Incorrect trial medication taken until Week 4
Violation of treatment compliance until Week 4
V
iolation of inclusion/exclusion criteria
Further details on the definition of the different analy sis sets will be provided in the 
TSAP.
All patients treated with at least one (full or partial) dose of either of the trialtreatments 
during an y dosing period will be included in the safet y evaluation (SAF).
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
Primary  efficacy  analysis:
Boehringer Ingelheim 12Dec2017
BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 63of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
The primary analyses will be performed on the FAS. Patients will be assigned to the 
treatment they  were randomized to receive.
The primary  anal ysis of the observed proportion of patients with a clinical response (CDAI 
decrease of ≥70 compared with baseline) at Week 4 will be based on log -linked binomial 
model. No missing data imputation for primary  analy sis endpoint need to be taken into 
account due to FAS definition. However, for pre -specified criteria non -responder imputation 
(NRI) will be applied (see Section 7.5 ).
The statistical model can be described as follows:
(M1) Response to treatment at Week 4 = treatment + prior infliximab exposure + 
screening SES -CD
This model includes the stratification factor, prior exposure t o infliximab, and treatment as 
fixed, categorical effects and it will be investigated whether the baseline SES- CD will be 
included as a continuous or as a categorical effect :
Treatment (BI 695501 ,EU-approved Humira)
Prior exposure to infliximab (Yes/No)
Baseline SES-CD ( <16 or ≥16)
The relative risk estimate together with its 90% and 95% CI(ratio scale) will be produced.
Further efficacy analyses:
As sensitivity  anal yses to the primary  analy sis, the primary  endpoint will also be anal yzed on 
the PPS with NRI.
The following explorative hypotheses are not intended to support any  biosimilarity  claim for 
BI 695501; however, the framework of non -inferiority  testing will be used to compare 
efficacy  of BI 695501 versus EU -approved Humira in a descriptive way .
Thefollowing hypotheses will be investigated :
H0:RRof proportion of patients with a clinical response (CDAI decrease of ≥70 
compared with baseline) at Week 4 (BI 695501 versus EU -approved Humira) is less than 
or equal to 0.76
H1:RRof proportion of patien tswith a clinical response (CDAI decrease of ≥70 
compared with baseline) at Week 4 (BI 695501 versus EU -approved Humira) is greater 
than 0.76
Two-sided 90% CI will be used for the comparison .

The applied margin (0.76 on the ratio scale for CDAI 70) does preserve 39% of the historical 
effect of adalimumab over placebo (based on a meta- analy sis of GAIN and CL ASSI C1; see 
Appendix 10.3 for furt her details). 
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analys es
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints 7.3.2.1
To support the primary  objective, the secondary  efficacy  endpoints detailed in Section 5.1.2
will be anal yzed descriptively  based on the FAS.
For the proportions, the risk difference will be comput ed and presented together with its 9 0% 
and 95% CI and interpreted in a descriptive manner.
Secondary  safet y endpoints 7.3.2.2
The secondary  safet y endpoints detailed in Section 5.1.2 will be based on the SAF and 
presented descriptivel y. In addition ,RRand risk difference together with 95% CIs will be 
presented .
7.3.4 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA cod ing dictionary .

BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 65of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature. No hy pothesis testing is planned .No formal inferential analy ses are 
planned for safet y comparison. The anal yses will be based on the SAF.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of AEs will concentrate on treatment -emergent AEs. To this 
end, all AEs occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP will be considered 
‘treatment -emergent’. The REP is defined as 10 weeks after the last dose of trial medication. 
Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be 
considered as ‘treatment -emergent ’. Other AEs will be assigned to the appropriate trial 
phases, i.e., screening or post- treatment. For patients switching from EU -approved Humira to 
BI 695501, AEs occurring after the first dose of BI 695501 will be assigned to BI 695501 for 
the overall AE analysis. AEs occurring before the first dose of BI 695501 will be assigned to 
the ongoing treatment.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by s ystem organ class 
and preferred term after coding according to the current versi on of MedDRA. In addition, RR
and risk difference together with 95% CIs will be presented for the overall population (details 
will be specified in the TSAP) .
Laboratory  data will be analy zed quantitativel y as well as qualitatively. The latter will be 
done via comparison of laboratory data with their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribut ion 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared with findings before start of treatment.

INTERIM ANALYSES 7.4
No classic interim anal ysis will be performed . Instead, an overview of the diff erent anal ysis 
time points is given below.
7.4.1 Primary analysis
The primary analysis will take place when all primary  efficacy  endpoint data are available 
and cleaned (i.e. ,approximately  4 weeks after the last patient has been randomized) .The 
cut-off date will be the date on which the last patient completes the Week 4 v isitandwill be
the sam e for all patients. A database snapshot will be taken w ith regard to this cut -off date; it 
will include all data available in the database up to and including the cut-offdate and will be 
used for performing the analy sis.Only cumulative results will be presented, i.e. ,patient level 
data will be excluded. Details regarding statistical anal ysis will be outlined in the TSAP. 
Only  a selected team, not involved in any other trial activities, will have access to the 
unblinded snapshot data and will be required to sign a confidential ity agreement. Efficacy  
data will be included up to the Week 4 visit only  and all available data for safet y and other 
endpoints will be inclu ded up to the data cut -off date.
To ensure that the data integrit y of the continuing trial will not be violated, a charter will be 
prepared in advance , outlining the procedures to be followed. This document will describe 
the measures to be implemented by  the Sponsor to protect the integrit y of the trial until the 
final database lock. Team members involved in the conduct of the trial as well as the site 
personnel and patients will remain blinded until the final database lock.
7.4.2 Final analysis
A final anal ysis (inclu ding all endpoints) will be performed when all trial d ata are available, 
i.e., approximately 56 weeks after the last patient has been randomized. I n this analy sis, all 
analyses performed for the primary analysis will be repeated with the (partially ) updated data, 
in particular with respect to safet y and efficacy endpoints collected until Week 56. The 
results of the final analy sis will be summarized in a CTR.
HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 7.5
7.5.1 Efficacy endpoints
No missing data for the primary  anal ysis endpoint are expected for the FAS, because Week 4 
is the first post -baseline visit for efficacy  assessment and , in case of discontinuation prior to 
Week 4, the EoT efficacy assessments should be performed . However, all patients who

discontinue treatment, are lost -to-follow -up or have any major protocol deviation related to 
any therapy  that may  significantly  impact efficacy  assessment ( Table 4.2.2.1: 1 ) prior to the 
primary  endpoint assessm ent will be considered as non -responders. Patients without any  
available CDAI evaluation at Week 4 will also be considered as non -responders. This is 
referred to as ‘NRI’. Patients assessed as non -responders at W eek 4 will be considered 
non-responders for all subsequent time points (L OCF) .
For se condary  efficacy  endpoints, rules for handling of missing data will be specified in the 
TSAP, if necessary .
7.5.2 Safety and other endpoints
With respect to safet y evaluations, it is not planned to impute missing values . For other 
endpoints, rules for handling o f missing data will be specified in the TSAP, if necessary .
RANDOMIZ ATION 7.6
Patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized 1:1 to either BI 695501 or EU-approved Humira over the 24 -week (4 -week 
induction an d 20- week maintenance) treatment period after the screening period at Visit 2 . 
The randomization will be stratified b y prior exposure to infliximab (Yes/No) and screening
SES-CD ( <16 or ≥16).
Randomization willoccur on Day 1 ( -1/+2) through a standard ran domization visit call. 
Patients will be randomized to each treat ment in a 1:1 ratio ( BI 695501: EU -approved 
Humira ) using an IRT system.
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG, Clinical Trial Supply  Unit or a third part y 
appointed by  the sponsor will provide the randomization list using a validated randomization 
number generating system. Access to the randomization code will be controlled and 
documented. All persons directly  involv ed in the conduct of the trial have no access to the 
treatment allocatio n prior to final database lock. The block sizes of the randomization will be 
documented in the CTR.
DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 7.7
The sample size determination is not based on a power calculation, but assures a precise
estimation of the relative risk diffe rence . For this trial a precision ( distance from observed 
difference to confidence limit ) of 0.115 has been considered necessary  and sufficient b y the 
project team. Assuming a response rate of 80%, in both the Humira as well in the BI 695501 
treatment arm, the trial will need at least 130 patients (65 per treatment arm).

Re-consenting may become necessary  when new relevant information becomes available and 
should be conducted according to the sponsor’s instructions.
The consent and re-consenting process should be properl y documented in the source 
documentation.
DATA QUALITY ASSURANC E 8.2
A qua lity assurance audit/inspection of this trial may  be conducted by  the sponsor ,sponsor ’s 
designees ,or by IRB/IEC or by  regulatory  authorities. The quality  assurance auditor will 
have access to all medical records, the investigator ’s trial -related files an d correspondence, 
and the informed consent docume ntation of this clinical trial.
RECORDS 8.3
Case Report Forms for individual patients will be provided by  the sponsor .See 
Section 4.1.5.2 for rules about emergency  code breaks. For drug accountability , refer to 
Section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirements ,the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial subject. Source data as well as reported 
data should follow good documentation p ractices and be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original ,and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
The current medi cal history  of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case ,the investigator must make three documented attemp ts to 
retrieve previous medical records. If this fails a verbal history from the patient, documented 
in their medical records, would be acceptable.
Before providing an y copy  of pat ients’ source documents to the sponso r, the investigator
must ensure that al l patient identifiers (e. g.,patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, 
social securit y number) have properl y been removed or redacted to ensure patient 
confidentiality .
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. ,re-training ,must 
be documented in the patient file.
For theCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
Patient identification : gender, date or yearof birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations )

Patient participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient was 
informed)
Dates of patient’s visits, including dispensing of trial medication
Medical history  (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
Medication history
AEs and ou tcome events (onset date [mandatory ], and end date [if available ])
SAEs (onset date [mandatory ], and end date [if available ])
Concomitant therap y (start date, changes)
Originals or copies of laboratory  results and other imaging or testing results, with proper 
documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
Completion of patient’s p articipation in the trial (end date; in case of premature 
discontinuation document the reason for it)
Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment in a clinical trial, there must be documented 
evidence in the source data (e.g. ,medical records) that the trial participant meets all 
inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The absence o f records (either 
medical records , verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific 
for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible 
for the clinical trial.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and d ocuments
The sponsor will monitor the conduct of the trial by regular on -site monitoring visits and 
in-house data qualit y review .The frequency  of on -site monitoring will be determined b y 
assessing all characteristics of the trial, including its nature, ob jective, methodology ,and the 
degree of an y deviations of the intervention from normal clinical practice.
The investigator /institution will allow on -site trial -related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC 
review ,and regulatory  inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source 
documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which 
must be available at all times for review b y the CRA , auditor, and regulato ry inspector 
(e.g.,FDA). The CRA and auditor may  review all CRFs and informed consents. The 
accuracy  of the data will be verified by  direct comparison with the source documents 
described in Section 8.3.1 . The sponsor will also m onitor compliance with the protocol and 
ICH GCP.
8.3.3 Storage period of records
Trial site(s):
The trial sites must retain the source and essential documents (including ISF) according to the 
national or local requirements (wh ichever is longer) valid at the time of the end of the trial .

10. APPENDICES
MEDICATION BLINDING PROCEDURE FOR THIRD PARTY 10.1
BLINDING
This is a double -blind trial, therefore patients, investigator s,and trial personnel (except the 
trial personnel administering the trial medication at site ) will remain blinded with regard to 
the randomized treatment assignments until after database lock.
The secondary  packaging (boxes containing s yringes) will be identical for both BI 695501 
and EU-approved Humira, allowing the blinding of the site pharmacy during the first 
22weeks of treatment .Thereafter, all patients will receive BI 695501 and the drug supplies 
will not require blinding via secondary  packaging.
A qualified unblinded designee will administer the trial medication until Week 22 ,as well as 
being responsible for preparation of unused trial medication for return to the sponsor or 
destruction in a blinded fashion and according to local SOPs.
Records of the product’s delivery  to the trial site will include dates, quantities, batch/serial 
numbers, expiry  (‘use by’) dates and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational 
products and t rial patients. The designated unblinded or blinded person will maintain records 
that document doses administered to patients and reconcile all investigational product 
received at site. At the time of return to sponsor orlocal destruction, the designated u nblinded 
or blinded person must verify  that no supplies remained at the trial site.
The unblinded trial personnel administering the trial medication will not be involved in any  
other trial assessments or procedures.
A description of the trial medication i s provided in Table 4.1.1: 1 and Table 4.1.1: 2 .
Patient blinding procedure
Trial medication will be administered by  unblinded trial personnel until Week 22 . To ensure 
patient’s blinding during the administration process, the following procedures are to be 
applied:
Syringes unpacked and prepared for injection are to be covered by  a surgical drape at the 
time of patient preparation for dosing. The same procedure is to be applied to used 
syringes after injection.
During the dose administration, patients are to be separated from the unblinded designee 
who will administer the trial medication by , for example, a surgical drape or screen.
Used sy ringes should be discarded in asharp container immediately after use .

Training
All professional personnel taking part in the clinical trial are trained and aware o f the need to 
respect study blinding principles as foreseen b y the protocol. Blinded and unblinded trial site 
staff, as well as blinded CRAs, will be trained on trial blinding procedures before the start of 
any trial activities at site. Unblinded trial sit e staff is restricted to persons handling trial
medications including the injection of trial drug. Training in stud y blinding procedures for 
blinded trial CRAs will be provided during a CRA Meeting. Training in trial blinding 
procedures for blinded and unblinded site staff will be provided at the Investigators’ Meeting . 
For the remaining site staff, who do not participate in an I nvestigators’ Meeting, applicable 
training in trial blinding procedures will be provided by  a blinded CRA during the Site 
Initiation Visit, based on information in the CTP, Medication Blinding Procedures ,and 
Pharmacy  Manual. Such training is a part of trial specific agenda for Site Initiation Visit, as 
well as the slide presentation prepared for the visit. All training will be do cumented.

DETAILS ABOUT THE ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERAT IONS 10.3
The purpose of this appendix is to detail the meta -analysis to estimate the expected treatment 
effect.
The historical treatment effect of Humira was established based on a meta -analysis of studies 
being representative for the treatment effect of Humir a in the intended 1297.4 trial 
population:
CLASSI C1 (R13-2267 ):a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging 
trial performed to evaluate the efficacy  of adalimumab induction therapies in patients 
with CD. In this trial, one endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving a 70 -point 
response at Week 4.
GAIN ( R13 2264 ): a 4-week, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
performed to determine whether adalimumab induces remission more frequently  than 
placebo in adult patients with CDwho have s ymptoms. One endpoint was also the 
decrease in CDAI score by  70 points.
The results are detailed in Table 10.3: 1 .

Response ra te
The effect size was computed using the Freeman and Tukey method which is used to 
normalize and variance- stabilize the sampling distribution of proportions. Then the 
fixed-effects method was used to pool the response rates together. When back- transforming 
the results and considering inverse -variance weights, the pooled response rate was 54.1% 
(95% CI from 47.6% to 60.4%).
Non-inferiority margin
As this is an add- on study  only , the standard rules for non
-inferiority  margin selection will 
not be applied. Instead, the magnitude of preserved historical treatment effect will be used 
(based on the point estimate rather than confidence in terval).
The RRs of the two studies were pooled to determine the non- inferiority  margin of the study . 
Log transformation was performed and a fixed- effect method (Mantel -Haenszel) was used to 
pool the RRs together. Using the inverse of the lower limit of th e 90% CI of the RR, 
M1=1/1.31 (=0.76) preserves about 39% of the historical treatment effect of adalimumab 
over placebo (calculated as [ln{1.56} -ln{1.31}]/ln[1.56] =0.3928). The results are presented 
below:

No. of patients, Statistical methods), Sections 2.1, 
3.1, 3.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3.1, 7.3.2.1, 7.7.
Description of change The study  methodology  as well as related 
statistical method and sample size calculations 
have been updated
Rationale for change Based on the fact that BI 695501 was alread y 
approved b y the authorities for all Humira 
indications and an additional confirmatory trial is 
not necessary . 
Additionally , the patients with moderatel y to 
severel y active CD (CDAI 220 -450), confirmed by  
endoscop y or radiologic evaluation represent a 
relativel y small proportion in a Crohn’s disease 
population. This fact causes enormous di fficulties 
to find the patients for the study participation 
within a reasonable timeframe and therefore the 
trial was redesigned to an exploratory  trial. 
Implementation of the updated statistical 
considerations will allow achieving the stud y 
objectives for the efficacy , as well as the

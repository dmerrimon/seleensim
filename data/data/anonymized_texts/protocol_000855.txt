Confidential   Page 9 will be excluded. Participants with immunocompromising conditions or medications, or 
malignancy within 10  years (excluding non -melanoma skin  cancer) will also be excluded. 
Participants who received a licensed or investigational influenza vaccine within the prior 
180 days or had tested positive for  influenza  by a Centers for Disease Control ( CDC )-
recommended testing method  within 180 days prior  to Day 1 will be excluded as well. See 
Study Eligibility Criteria for a complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Enrollment will occur  in parallel across all 8 study arms . The study will randomize 
approximately 70  healthy adult participants i nto each study arm with a balanced age group 
representation stratified approximately 1:1 into age groups of 18 to <  50 years of age and 
≥ 50 to ≤ 75 years  of age . 
Except for appropriately delegated unblinded pharmacists, vaccine administrators, and 
monitors, all personnel involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to individual 
treatment assignment until study unblinding. Study visits will consist of a  Screening Visit (up 
to 28 days before the Day 1 visit), Vaccination Visit at Day 1, and subsequent study visits on 
Day 4, Day 8, Day 29 (Month  1), and Day 181/end of study (EoS; Month  6), with up to 
7 months of study participation. Unscheduled visits for potential influenza -like illness (ILI) 
symptoms will include testing with a multiplex respiratory infection panel (Biofire or similar).  
Safety Oversight:  
Safety monitoring for this study will include a group of  blinded study team members, inclusive 
of, at a minimum, a Sponsor medical monitor , a contract research organization (CRO) medical 
monitor , a blinded internal safety team (IST), and an unblinded data safety monitoring board 
(DSMB). The study team will conduct ongoing blinded safety reviews during the  study and 
will be responsible for notifying the IST and DSMB of potential safety signal events or the 
triggering of pause rules. An unblinded statistician will support the determination if study 
pause rules have been met.  
The IST will comprise Sponsor phy sicians. The IST will conduct a scheduled review of safety 
data after approximately  96 participants (approximately 12 per study arm) (see the Study Arms 
and Dose Levels table above ) have completed the Day  8 visit as well as ad hoc safety data 
reviews if re quested by the study team. Enrollment will continue while these review s are 
conducted if no pause rules have been met and the study team has not identified any safety 
concerns. The IST will also conduct ad hoc reviews as requested by the study medical moni tor 
and the study team. The DSMB, composed of external/independent subject matter experts, will 
conduct unblinded reviews of safety data on an ad hoc basis if any pause rule is met or as 
otherwise requested by the study team and/or IST.  Details regarding t he IST and DSMB

4. Body mass index of 18 kg/m2 to 35 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the Screening Visit.  
5. Female participants of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. 
Nonchildbearing potential is defined as post-menopausal or permanently steril ized. A 
follicle -stimulating hormone level should  be measured at the discretion of the 
Investigator , if necessary,  to confirm postmenopausal status.  
6. Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study if the 
participant fulfills all the following criteria:  
• Has a negative pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and on the day of vaccination 
(Day  1). 
• Has practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from all activities that could 
result in pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to Day  1. Adequate female 
contraception is defined as con sistent and correct use of a Food and Drug 
Administration  approved contraceptive method in accordance with the product 
label.  
• Has agreed to continue adequate contraception through 90 days  following vaccine 
administration.

3. Participant is acutely ill or febrile (temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) 72 hours prior to or 
at the Screening Visit or Day 1. Participants meeting this criterion may be rescheduled 
within the 28 -day screening window and will retain their initially assigned participant 
number.  
4. History of a diagnosis or condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, is 
clinically unstable or may affect participant saf ety, assessment of safety endpoints, 
assessment of immune response, or adherence to study procedures. Clinically unstable 
is defined as a diagnosis or condition requiring significant changes in management or 
medication within the 60 days  prior to screening  and includes ongoing workup of an 
undiagnosed illness that could lead to a new diagnosis or condition.  
5. History of myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis . 
6. Reported history of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive

Confidential   Page 14 Immunogenicity Assessments:  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated 
in the Schedule of Events. The following immunogenicity assessments are planned:  
• Serum anti-HA antibody level as measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay  
(primary , secondary, and exploratory  endpoint s) 
• NA-specific antibody level as me asured by neuraminidase inhibition  assay  
(primary , secondary, and exploratory  endpoint s) 
• Serum neutralizing antibody level as measured by microneutralization (MN) assay 
or similar method (exploratory endpoint)  
• Cellular immunogenicity (exploratory endpoint)  
Clinical Assessments:  
All p articipants will provide  nasopharyngeal  (NP)  swab samples before injection on Day 1 for 
assessment of asymptomatic infection with respiratory pathogens, including influenza  virus  
and SARS -CoV -2, as influenza or COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity 
assessment. In addition, participants who develop symptoms consistent with CDC -defined ILI 
and/or COVID -19 during the study  should be tested by multiplex viral polymerase chain 
reaction  (NP specimen).  
Statistical Methods:  
General Considerations:  All analyses will be performed by treatment arm, unless otherwise 
specified. Categorical variables, frequencies, and percentages will be presented. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of participants, mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).  
Analysis Populations: The table below describes the analysis datasets.

Safety Set3 The Safety Set consists of all randomly assigned participants who 
receive the IP.  
Solicited Safety Set4 The Solicited Safety Set consists of all participants in the Safety Set 
who contribute any solicited AR data.  
Abbreviations: AR = adverse reaction; IP = investigational product; PCR = polymerase chain reaction . 
1. For the FAS, participants will be analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized.  
2. The PP Set will be used as the primary analysis set for analyses of immunogenicity unless otherwise specified. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized.  
3. The Safety Set will be used for all analyses of safety, except for the solicited ARs. Participants will be included i n the 
vaccination group corresponding to what they actually received. The Solicited Safety Set will be used for the analyses of 
solicited ARs and participants will be included in the vaccination group corresponding to what they actually received.  
Safety A nalysis:  All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set, except summaries of 
solicited ARs, which will be based on the Solicited Safety Set. All safety analyses will be 
performed  by vaccination group. Participants will be included in the vaccination g roup 
corresponding to what vaccine they actually received.  
Safety and reactogenicity will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, 
including solicited ARs (local and systemic ARs), unsolicited AEs (including any clinical 
safety laboratory  abnormalities), treatment -related AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, AEs 
leading to withdrawal from study participation, AESIs, vital sign measurements, and physical 
examination findings.  
The number and percentage of participants with any solicited local AR or  solicited systemic 
AR during the 7 -day follow -up period after the study injection will be summarized. A 2 -sided 
95% confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper -Pearson method will also be provided for the 
percentage of participants with any solicited AR.  
The number and percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs, treatment -related AEs, 
severe AEs, SAEs, AESIs, MAAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal from study participation 
will be summarized. Unsolicited AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictiona ry for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) for AR terminology and presented by MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term.  
Solicited ARs will be coded according to the MedDRA for AR terminology. The toxicity 
grading scale for healthy adult and adolescent volu nteers enrolled in preventive vaccine 
clinical trials will be used in this study with modification for rash, solicited ARs, and vital 
signs. Unsolicited AEs will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.

Confidential   Page 16 The number of events of unsolici ted AEs/SAEs, AESIs, MAAEs , and AEs leading to 
withdrawal  will be reported in summary tables accordingly. For all other safety parameters, 
descriptive summary statistics will be provided.  
Assessment of safety laboratory tests will be done for this study. T he number and percentage 
of participants who have chemistry and hematology results below or above the normal 
laboratory ranges will be tabulated by time point. For treatment -emergent safety laboratory 
test results, the raw values and change from baseline v alues will be summarized by 
vaccination group and visit at each time point.  
Immunogenicity  Analysis:  The analyses of immunogenicity will be based on the Per-
Protocol ( PP) Set. If the number of participants in the full analysis set ( FAS) and PP Set differ 
(defined as the difference divided by the total number of participants in the PP Set) by more 
than 10%, supportive analyses of immunogenicity may be conducted using the FAS.  
For the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean of specific antibody titer s with 
corresponding 95% CI at each time  point and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of specific 
antibody titers with corresponding 95% CI at each postbaseline time  point over preinjection 
baseline at Day 1 will be provided by treatment arm. Descriptive summ ary statistics including 
median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided.  
For summarizations of geometric mean titers, antibody titers reported as below lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) will be replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that are greater than th e upper 
limit of quantification (ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
For HA, rate of seroconversion is defined as the proportion of participants with either a 
prevaccination HI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination HI tite r 
≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold rise in postvaccination HI antibody titer. For NA, an endpoint of 
interest is the percentage of participants with a change in the Day 29 titer of at least 2 -/3-/4-
fold rise, defined as ≥ 2 -/3-/4-fold of the LLOQ if the Day 1 t iter is < LLOQ; or ≥ 2 -/3-/4-fold 
of the Day 1 titer if the Day 1 titer is ≥ LLOQ.  
Seroconversion rate from baseline will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper -Pearson method at each postbaseline time  point. For NA, the number and percentage 
of participants with a ≥ 2, ≥ 3, and ≥ 4-fold rise of serum titers from baseline will be provided 
with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at each postbaseline time  point.  
Further details will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Confidential   Page 17 Sample Size Justification: There is no hypothesis testing in this study. The number of 
proposed participants is considered sufficient to provide a descriptive summary of the safety 
and immunogenicity of different dose levels of mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030.  
A total of  approximately 560 participants will be randomly assigned to receive mRNA -1020, 
mRNA -1030, mRNA -1010, or Flublok. Among those 560 participants, 70 participants will be 
randomized into each vaccination group. With 70 participants in each group receivi ng the IP, 
there is an approximately 76% probability to observe at least 1 participant with an AE if the 
true incidence of the AE is 2%; if the true incidence rate is 4%, then the probability to observe 
an AE is approximately 94%. 
Study  Analys es: 
One inter im analysis  (IA) is planned in this study. It will be performed after participants have 
completed  the Day 29  Visit. All data relevant to the IA through the Day 29 Visit will be 
cleaned (ie, data that are as clean as possible) . 
The IA will be performed by a separate team of unblinded programmers and statisticians. 
Except for a limited number of Sponsor and CRO personnel who will be unblinded to perform 
the IA, the study site staff, Investigators, study monitors, and participants will r emain blinded 
until after the final database lock for final analysis.  
The final analys is of safety , reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity will be performed after all 
participants have completed all planned study procedures. The results of this analysis will b e 
presented in a final clinical study report, including individual listings.

a Screening and Day 1 will NOT be performed on the same day. Addi tionally, the Screening Visit may be performed over multiple visits if within the 28 -day screening 
window.  
b Verbal confirmation of medical history is acceptable.  
c Safety laboratory tests: Total WBC  count, hemoglobin, platelets, ALT, AST, creatinine, alkaline  phosphatase, and total bilirubin.  
d Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at screening; symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed 
at all other scheduled time points. Interim physical examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified by a 
healthcare professional during study visits should be reported as an MAAE.  
e Vital sign measurements: Systolic and diastolic blood pressu re, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. The preferred route of temperature assessment is oral. 
Participants must not eat or drink anything hot or cold within 10 minutes before oral temperature is taken. Participants will  be seated for at le ast 5 minutes before all 
measurements are taken. Vital signs will be collected on the day of vaccination, once before vaccination and approximately 1 hour after vaccination. Vital signs may be 
collected at other study site visits in conjunction with a symp tom-directed physical examination. If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for 
clinical abnormalities of Grade 3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be documented in the AE section of the eCRF ( unless there is ano ther known cause of the 
abnormality that would result in an AE classification). The Investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additi onal assessments until the vital sign value has 
reached the reference range, returns to the vital sign valu e at baseline, is considered stable , or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically 
necessary.  
f A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained after 10 minutes of supine rest at Visit 1/Day 1 prior to vaccination  (see Section  8.1.6 ). 
g A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit and before the vaccine dose on Day 1. At the discretion of  the Investigator, a pregnancy test 
either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed at any time. The follicle -stimulating hormone level may be measured at the Screening Visit, as necessary, and at the 
discretion of the Investigator, to confirm menopausa l status.

collected fro m approximately 240 participants ( 30 participants per vaccination group ) and assessed in a subset of participants . 
j Biomarker plasma and biomarker serum samples will be stored for potential future biomarker assessment . 
k An NP swab specimen for pathogens, including influenza and other respiratory pathogens (eg, SARS -CoV -2) will be collected prior to study injection on Day 1 to assess for  
pre- or asymptomatic infection prior to vaccination. An NP swab will also be collected throu gh study completion if any signs or symptoms suggesting COVID -19 or other 
causes of upper or lower respiratory infection occur. For signs or symptoms during the study, a participant will be instructe d to contact the study site to have a n NP swab 
collected for testing. The NP swab may be collected as part of a home visit in lieu of a study site visit . In the event that NP swabs during ILI cannot be collected, any available 
influenza and/or SARS -CoV -2 testing results performed outside of the study should be captured in the eCRF.  
l The eDiary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 1 hour after vaccination while at the clinic with ins truction provided by study staff. Study participants 
will continue to record in the eDiary each day after the y leave the clinic, preferably in the evening and at the same time each day, on the day of vaccination and for 6 days 
following vaccination. If a solicited local or systemic AR starts more than 7 days after dosing, it should be captured on the AE page unti l no longer reported, not to exceed 
28 days after vaccination. If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond 7 days after dosing, the participant should noti fy the site to provide an end date and close out 
the event. Adverse reactions beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by the study site staff either during the next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site visit.  
m Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information related to any SAE, AESIs, MAAEs, AEs leading to wi thdrawal  from study, information on 
concomitant medications associated with those events, and any non study  vaccinations.  
n All nonstudy vaccinations will be recorded through Day 181/EoS. All concomitant medications and non study  vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days after vaccination; 
all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, AESI, or MAAE will be recorded from Day 1 through Day  181/EoS .

2.1. Study Rationale  
Seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to cause 3 to 
5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year resulting in a severe 
challenge to public health ( WHO  2018 ). Influenza epidemics occur each year and follow a 
seasonal circulation pattern with increased cases during the winter months in the Northern and 
Southern Hemispheres, respectively ( Riedel  et al 2019 ). Since influenza viruses continuously 
change through a process termed antigenic drift, the circulating viruses are actively monitored by 
a worldwide monitoring network coordinated by the WHO ( Monto  2018 ). Based on the observed 
circulation patterns and antigenic changes, an expert panel recommends influenza virus strains to 
be used for vaccine manufacturing twice per year (once for the Northern He misphere [NH] and 
once for the Southern Hemisphere  [SH] ). Influenza A and influenza B viruses are the most 
relevant influenza viruses for human infection. Therefore, current vaccine recommendations 
include 1  influenza A H1N1 strain, 1 influenza A H3N2 stra in, and 2 influenza B strains 
(covering the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages).  
Currently licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 60% overall effectiveness and 
are poorly effective during years when the circulating viruses do not match th e strains selected 
for the vaccine antigens ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] 2020 a). Influenza 
vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) -technology could provide several benefits 
compared to current vaccines, inclu ding the ability to respond to strain changes more quickly, 
avoidance of mutations that may be acquired during vaccine production in eggs or cell culture, 
and stronger immune responses as well as improved protection in older adults 
(Rockman  et al 2020 ). The Sponsor is planning to test 2  next-generation development candidates 
(mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030) in a Phase 1/2 study, which will identify a candidate to take 
forward into the pivotal stud y(ies). A group receiving the Sponsor’s f irst-generation development 
candidate mRNA -1010, as well as a group receiving a licensed enhanced seasonal influenza 
vaccine (eg, Flublok), will be included as control groups. The vaccines will be administered as a 
single dose and will aim to elicit protec tion from all seasonal influenza viruses covered by the 
vaccine.  
2.2. Background and Overview  
ModernaT X, Inc. (the Sponsor) has developed a rapid -response, proprietary vaccine platform 
based on an mRNA delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and  observations that 
cells in vivo  can take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral antigen(s) on the cell 
surface. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
non-replicating, and is expressed transiently.

Confidential   Page 30 Two mRNA vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS -CoV -2), including Pfizer Inc.’s BNT162b2 ( Polack  et al 2020 ) and the Sponsor’s 
mRNA -1273 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), have been  approved by the 
United States (US)  Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
2.2.1.  mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030  
The Sponsor is using its mRNA -based platform to develop a  novel lipid nanoparticle 
(LNP) -encapsulated, mRNA -based seasonal vaccine against disease caused by influenza virus 
types  A and B. All 3 proposed development candidates (mRNA -1010, mRNA -1020, and 
mRNA -1030) contain mRNAs encoding for the hemagglutinins (HA s) of the 4 strains 
recommended by the WHO for cell - or recombinant -based vaccines, but the two next-generation 
candidates (mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030) are differentiated by the inclusion of mRNAs 
encoding for the neuraminidases (NAs) of the respective viruses at different HA:NA mass ratios 
( ). Equal amou nts of mRNAs 
encoding for each of the 4  different strains will be used for both the HA and NA components.  
The Sponsor is conducting a Phase 1/2 study of next -generation seasonal influenza mRNA 
vaccines to establish preliminary safety and immunogenicity dat a to support the initiation of the 
pivotal stud y(ies) for the lead candidate. The design of the Phase 1/2 study include s 
immunogenicity objectives for both the HA and NA components that represent surrogate 
markers for protection against influenza illness. The rationale for this approach is based on the 
established precedent of using HA -based immunologic surrogates for clinical assessment and 
licensure of influenza vaccines ( Department of Health and Human Services [ DHHS ] 2007a , 
Dunning  et al 2016 , and  European Medicines Agency [ EMA ] 2016 ) and the available literature 
indicating that NA -based immune responses contribute to protection against influenza disease in 
clinical studies and  animal models of influenza virus immunogenicity and challenge 
(Dunning  et al 2016 , Memoli  et al 2016 , Murphy  et al 1972 , and Weiss  et al 2020 ). 
2.2.2.  Nonclinical Stud ies 
Using preclinical material, a mouse study (MOD -4218) was performed to evaluate  the 
immunogenicity of multivalent  influenza vaccine s containing mRNAs encoding the 4  HA and 
4 NA of the seasonal influenza strains recommended by the WHO. The goal was to compare the 
immunogenicity of different ratios of HA:NA,  
. The secondary goal of this study was to compare different 
seasonal vaccine compositions  (NH 2020/2021 [NH20/21 ] composition versus SH 2021 
[SH2021 ] composition ). Mice were immunized  via intramuscular ( IM) injection on a 
prime/boost schedule with a 3 -week interval  and antibody responses were measured by enzyme -
linked immunosorbent assay at Day 21 and Day 36, a nd by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)

Confidential   Page 31 and neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) at Day  36. A prime/boost regimen was chosen since 
immunogenicity of seasonal influenza vaccines is often suboptimal in naïve hosts. However, 
mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030 are envisioned a s a single dose annual vaccine in human adults 
similar to currently licensed influenza vaccines. Serological analyses demonstrated potent 
immune responses against all antigens (HAs and NAs) after one dose of mRNA -1020 and 
mRNA -1030 vaccines, that was furth er boosted after the second dose. Robust HAI as well as 
NAI antibody titers were observed at Day 36 following mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030 
immunization. Finally, b oth the NH20/21 and SH21 mRNA vaccine compositions were 
immunogenic in mice  as demonstrated in thi s study.  
An additional mouse study (MOD -4485) was performed to evaluate the immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030 that code for the antigens of the NH21/22 vaccine composition 
(influenza strains used for the mRNA -1020 -P101 study ). Serological analyses demonstrated 
good immune responses against all antigens after 2 doses of mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030 
vaccines  of the NH21/22 , suggesting that the mRNA platform can readily support seasonal 
influenza virus vaccine strain changes.  
In addition to the mouse immunogenicity studies, mouse and ferret influenza virus challenge 
studies were performed. Mice and ferrets were immunized with mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030 of 
the SH21 composition (using non -Good Manufacturing Practice  co-formulated material) 
follo wed by a viral challenge. Control animals were immunized with phosphate buffered saline 
or a commercially available MF59 -adjuvanted influenza vaccine (FLUAD®, NH20/21 
composition ). Ferrets were vaccinated  via IM injection on a prime/boost schedule with a 3 -week 
interval ; antibody responses were measured at Day 21 and Day 42, followed by H1N1 challenge 
on Day 42. Mice received a single dose via IM injection and antibody responses were measured 
at Day 21 and  groups of animals were subsequently challenged with either an (H1N1)pdm09 -like 
or H3N2 challenge virus. In both animal models, s erological analyses demonstrated that HAI 
antibody titers were detectable against the 4 vaccine  strains after the first immuniz ation with 
either mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030 and in the case of ferrets, titers were further boosted by the 
second immunization. In addition, the HAI antibody titers induced by mRNA -1020 or 
mRNA -1030 were as robust as the titers induced by the adjuvanted compa rator influenza vaccine 
(FLUAD) . Upon live virus challenge, ferrets  that were vaccinated with mRNA -1020 or 
mRNA -1030  had lower detectable viral loads in the lungs compared to the placebo group. No 
virus was detected in the lung s 4 days after challenge.  Com pared to FLUAD  and placebo , 
mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030 induced greater  reduc tion in viral shedding in the upper 
respiratory tract with lower levels of  viral loads in the nasal cavity (including the nasal 
turbinates) and the  throat.

Confidential   Page 32 Upon challenge with a vaccine -mismatched  H3N2 live virus,  mice  that were vaccinated with 
mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030 exhibited  less weight  loss and fewer clinical symptoms compared 
to mice  that received FLUAD or mice  in the control group. Upon (H1N1)pdm09 -like virus 
challenge , mice  that received mRNA -1020, mRNA -1030 , or FLUAD were fully protected 
against morbidity and showed no scorable clinical symptoms.  
In conclusion, mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030  vaccines are immunogenic, induce strong antibody 
responses in mice and ferrets , and confer protective efficacy against live virus challenge.  
A detailed review of the nonclinical experience with mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030  vaccine s is 
provided in the investigator’s brochure (IB).  Additionally, the nonclinical experience with 
mRNA -1010 is provided in the mRNA -1010 IB.  
2.2.3.  Clinical Stud ies 
No clinical studies with mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030 have been performed to date.  The 
Sponsor’s Phase  1/2 mRNA -1010 -P101 study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is currently ongoing to provide 
initial first -in-human  safety and immunogenicity data on 3  dose levels of mRNA -1010 encoding 
strains (50, 100, or 200  µg total mRNA) recommended by the WHO for the 2021 SH. An 
amendment to mRNA -1010 -P101 includes a Phase 2 NH portion to the study to increase the size 
of the saf ety database for the 50 and 100 µg dose levels and to test an additional 25 µg dose level 
of mRNA -1010 as well as a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine as an active comparator.  
Additionally, an amendment is planned to assess 6.25 µg and 12.5 µg dose levels  of mRNA -
1010 as well as 25 µg mRNA -1010 and an active comparator in the Phase 2 Extension portion of 
the study. The mRNA -1010 vaccine encoding strains recommended by the WHO for the 
2021/2022 NH is used in the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension portions . 
2.3. Benefit /Risk  Assessment  
2.3.1.  Known Potential Benefits  
The following benefits may accrue to participants:  
• The mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030  vaccine s may be effective against seasonal 
influenza strains as recommended  by the WHO for the 2021-2022 NH influenza  
season.  
• Participants will have a baseline (Day 1) evaluation for respiratory pathogens, 
including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, and ongoing monitoring  for 
influenza -like illness ( ILI) and/or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) throughout 
the study .

Confidential   Page 33 • The study wil l contribute to the development of a potentially efficacious vaccine 
against seasonal influenza.  
2.3.2.  Risk s from Study Participation and Their  Mitigation  
Adverse events (AEs) ranging from immediate mild allergic reactions (eg, urticaria) to systemic 
allergic re actions (eg, anaphylaxis) may occur following any vaccination. Systemic allergic 
reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000 vaccinations for vaccines that 
do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). Since the authorization 
of the mRNA -1273 vaccine for COVID -19, the US CDC estimate of the rate of anaphylaxis 
based on reporting in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is approximately 
2.5 cases/million doses administered ( Shimabukuro  et al 2021 ). As a precaution, all participants 
will remain under observation at the study site for at least 60 minutes after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by 
pain or anxiety associated with the injection , and is not related to the substance injected. 
Therefore, it is important that standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoid injury 
from fainting.  
Intramuscular injection with o ther mRNA vaccines manufactured by the Sponsor containing the 
proprietary SM -102 (heptadecan -9-yl 8‑((2‑ hydroxyethyl) (6‑oxo‑6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)  
octanoate) lipid formulation have commonly resulted in transient and self -limiting local 
inflammatory rea ctions. These typically included pain, erythema (redness), or swelling 
(hardness) at the injection site, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity and usually 
occurred within 24 hours of injection. Laboratory abnormalities (including increases in live r 
function tests) following injection have been observed in early phase clinical studies with similar 
mRNA -based vaccines. These abnormalities were without clinical symptoms or signs and 
returned toward baseline (Day 1) values over time.  
In a completed Pha se 3 study of mRNA -1273 vaccine for COVID -19 in 30,420 healthy adults, 
the most commonly reported local reactions included pain, swelling, and erythema at the 
injection site. Most of these reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and resolved within 3 to 
4 days of onset. The most commonly reported systemic reactions were headache, myalgia, 
arthralgia, fatigue, chills, and fever. In most cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously within 
several days ( Baden  et al 2021 ). 
Similarly,  safety results from Phase 1 studies conducted by the Sponsor on 2 mRNA vaccines 
containing the HA glycoproteins from the H10N8 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses were well 
tolerated, although the Sponsor’s LNP/mRNA platform has since been updated (eg, S M‑10 2 is 
used in mRNA -1010 and mRNA -1273; Feldman  et al 2019 ). The Sponsor’s Phase 1/2 study of 
mRNA -1010 is underway to evaluate safety and reactogenicity of mRNA -1010. No significant

Protocol: mRNA -1020 -P101  Amendment 1  mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030  
 
Confidential   Page 34 safety concerns were  identified during the interim analysis  (IA) of available data through Day 29 
of the study . 
There have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination 
with COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. The majority of the cases have been reported in young males 
shortly a fter the second dose of the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine. These are typically mild cases 
and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest. 
Investigators and study participants should be alert to the signs and symptoms of m yocarditis and 
pericarditis ( Gargano  et al 2021 ). 
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
Participants will receive a single IM injection of a seasonal influenza vaccine: mRNA -1020, 
mRNA -1030, mRNA -1010, or Flublok. mRNA -1020, mRNA -1030, and mRNA -1010 are 
currently investigational vaccines and may or may not offer protection against seasonal 
influenza.  
Serological data from all participants will be used to infer vaccine immunogenicity. Safety 
findings will be monitored and reviewed by  the study team members to evaluate the safety status 
of all participants ( Section 9.6). The internal safety team (IST) will also review and assess the 
safety data as described in Section  11.1.11 . 
Considering the nonclinical data for the mRNA -1010, mRNA -1020, and mRNA -1030 vaccine s 
and the safety data for the other mRNA vaccines manufactured by the Sponsor to date that 
contain  the proprietary SM -102 lipid formulation  (eg, mRNA -1010) , the Sponsor considers the 
potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.

safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1020 (  
) and mRNA -1030 ( ) in healthy a dults 18 to 
75 years of age. Enrollment in study arms will proceed in parallel with randomization ( Figure 1) 
of all dose levels  of mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030  (Study Arms  1 to 6), the mRNA -1010 
Comparator Arm  (Study Arm 7), and the Flublok Comparator Arm (Study Arm 8). The study 
will randomize approximately 70  healthy adult participants into each study arm with a balanced 
age group re presentation stratified approximately 1:1 into age groups of 18 to <  50 years of age 
and ≥  50 to ≤ 75 years  of age . 
The vaccines to be tested contain mRNAs encoding for the surface glycoproteins of the strains 
recommended by the WHO for 2021/22 NH cell- or recombinant -based vaccines:  
• A/Wisconsin/588/2019(H1N1)pdm09  
• A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020(H3N2)  
• B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)  
• B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)  
Study visits will consist of a Screening Visit (up to 28 days before the Day 1 vis it), Vaccination 
Visit at Day 1, and subsequent study visits on Day 4, Day 8, Day 29 (Month  1), and Day 181/end 
of study (EoS; Month  6), with up to 7 months of study participation (Table  1). Unscheduled 
visits for potential ILI symptoms will include testing with a multiplex respiratory infection panel 
(Biofire or similar).  
Immunizations for the study are planned during the NH spring, when influenza infection rates 
are typically low or declining. Approximately 560 participants  will be randomized to receive a 
single dose of either one of the 2 next-generation candidate vaccines (mRNA -1020 or 
mRNA -1030) at different dose levels, a single dose of the first -generation candidate vaccine 
(mRNA -1010), or Flublok, a licensed enhanced seasonal influenza vaccine comparator ( 8 study 
arms total). Three different dose levels ( ) of  
 (mRNA -1020), 3 different dose levels ( ) of 
 (mRNA -1030), and a single dose level of mRNA -1010 ( 50 µg 
total mRNA ) will be assessed. A description of the mass ratios for the dose levels are provi ded in 
Table 3. The target number of participants in each arm and the randomization ratio can be found 
in Table 4.

4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed as an observer -blind study. Participants in Vaccination Groups 1 , 3, and 5 
will receive mRNA -1030 vaccine and participants in Groups 2, 4, and 6 will re ceive mRNA -
1020 vaccine . mRNA -1010 and Flublok will be used as comparators  for descrip tive comparisons 
of safety and immunogenicity.  
All participants will provide  nasopharyngeal  (NP) swab samples before the injection on Day 1 
for assessment of asymptomatic infection with respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus 
and SARS ‑CoV‑ 2, as influenza or COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity 
assessments  (CDC  2021 a). Furthermore, if a participant experiences any signs or symptoms 
suggesting ILI and/or COVI D‑19, an additional NP swab sample will be collected to confirm the 
diagnosis via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  (RT‑PCR ). Clinical inf ormation 
may be collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case  (CDC  2020 b).

Confidential   Page 39 4.3. Choice of Vaccine Dose  
No clinical studies of mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030 have been conducted to date.  
Previous studies of the Sponsor’s mRNA/LNP SM -102 platform have assessed dose levels as 
high as 250  µg for mRNA -1273, a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine ( Jackson  et al 2020 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), 
and mRNA -1893, a Zika vaccine (unpublished data, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Additionally, doses up to 
300 µg of the multivalent mRNA -1647, a cytomegalovirus vaccine (unpublished data, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and the multivalent mRNA -1653, a combination vaccine against  human 
metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus type  3 (unpublished data, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), have been 
tested in Phase  1 studies. The vaccines were generally well  tolerated at these dose levels.  
The Sponsor has previously evaluated  the immunogenicity of 2 mRNA vaccines containing the 
HA glycoprotein from the H10N8 and H7N9 influenza viruses. Although differences in the 
mRNA/LNP platform and the administration schedule (2 doses were given 3 weeks apart) limit 
extrapolation of the saf ety data, these mRNA vaccines against H10N8 and H7N9 influenza 
viruses elicited robust humoral immune responses and were well  tolerated up to dose levels of 
100 µg (for each HA type ; Feldman  et al 2019 ). 
The Sponsor’s Phase 1/2 m RNA -1010 P101 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is currently ongoing . No 
significant safety concerns have been observed in the ongoing Phase 1/2 portion of mRNA -1010 -
P101 study upon review of safety data up to 29 days by the DSMB. In that study, 45 participants 
in each group received 50 µg, 100 µg, or 200 µg doses of mRNA -1010. The local and systemic 
reactogenicity were mostly mild to moderate in severity. There were no Grade 4 adverse 
reactions or SAEs assessed by the Investigator as related to the study vaccine. The 3  doses of 
mRNA -1010 elicited comparable humoral immunogenicity responses. In addition, the Phase 2 
NH portion of mRNA -1010 -P101 study has enrolled 498 adults in a Phase 2 NH cohort in 
4 groups: 25 µg mRNA -1010 (n=151), 50 µg mRNA -1010 (n=147), 100 µg mRNA -1010 
(n=147), and Afluria (n=53). The interim analysis  of safety data through Day 29 demonstrated 
no significant safety concerns. The frequency and severity of the reports of solicited adverse 
reactions ( ARs) in the mRNA -1010 groups were acceptable across a ll dose levels.  Based on this 
data, the highest dose level for mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030 (  
) were selected.  
This first-in-human  clinical study of mRNA -1020 or mRNA -1030 vaccine s will evaluate the 
immunogenicity of mRNA -1020 and mRNA -1030 at proposed total dose levels of 50, 100, 150  
and 25, 50 , 100 µg total mRNA , respectively , administered as a single IM injection  in generally 
healthy  adults ≥  18 to ≤ 75  years of age.

6.3. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
6.3.1.  Preparation of Investigational Product  
In the study, the IP will be prepared for each participant based on the vaccination group. All 
mRNA vaccine injections will have a volume of 0.5  mL. Flublok  will be administered at a 
volume of 0.5  mL. The IP (mRNA -1020, mRNA -1030, mRNA -1010, and Flublok ) preparation 
instructions are detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.2.  Investigational Product  Administration  
The IP (mRNA -1020, mRNA -1030, mRNA -1010, or Flublok ) will be administered as a single 
IM injection into the deltoid muscle on Day 1. Preferably, the IP  should be administered into the 
nondominant arm.  
Participants will be monitored for a mi nimum of 60 minutes after administration of the IP. 
Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring for local or systemic reactions 
as shown in the SoE (Table  1). 
The study site will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either onsite resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
appropri ate protocols for the rapid transport of a participant to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.  
Further instructions for the preparation and administration of mRNA -1020, mRNA -1030,

Further description of the IP and corresponding instructions for the receipt, storage, preparation, 
administration, accountability, and destruction are described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.4.  Investigational Product  Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor will provide the Investigator (via the study site pharmacy) with adequate quantities 
of the IP. Sterile mRNA -1020, mRNA -1030, and mRNA -1010 will be  packaged in 2R glass 
vials with a 0. 8-mL fill volume. The IP  will have a ll required labeling per regulations and will be 
supplied to the pharmacy in an unblinded manner.  The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee will 
supply the diluent  for the  mRNA vaccine s (as applicable) as well as Flublok . The 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, United  States Pharmacopeia  (USP) bears a commercial label and does not 
contain study -specific identification.  
All IPs will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating procedures of the 
Sponsor or of its designee, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title  21 Good Manufacturing 
Practice guidelines, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clin ical Practice 
(GCP) guideline s, guidelines for Quality System Regulations, and applicable regulations.  
6.3.5.  Investigational Product Storage  
mRNA -1020, mRNA -1030, and mRNA -1010 must be stored at -60°C to -90°C ( -76°F 
to -130°F) in a secure area with limited acce ss and must be protected from moisture and light 
until it is prepared for administration ( Section  6.3.1 ). The freezer should have automated 
temperatur e recording and a 24 -hour alert system in place that allows for rapid response in case 
of freezer  malfunction. The freezer must be connected to a backup generator. In addition, for IP  
accountability , staff are required to keep a temperature log to establis h a record of compliance 
with these storage conditions. The study site is responsible for reporting any IP that was not 
temperature  controlled during shipment or storage. Such IP will be retained for inspection by the 
monitor and disposed of according to a pproved methods.  
The active comparator Flublok should be stored in its original container and in accordance with 
the instructions in the Pharmacy Manual.  
The 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP should be stored at 20 °C to 25 °C (68 °F to 77 °F) in a 
restricted  access area.

The Investigator  is responsib le for ensuring  that the IP  accountability staff maintain accurate 
records in an IP accountability log of receipt of all IPs, site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP 
injections,  and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used and unused IP vials.  
A site monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during site visits and at 
completion of the study. Additional details are provided  in the Pharmacy Manual . 
6.3.7.  Investigational Product Handling and Disposal  
The designated unblinded clinical research associate  will reconcile the clinical study material 
during the conduct and  at the end of the study for compliance. Once fully reconciled at the site, 
the clinical study  material can be destroyed at the investigational site or Sponsor -selected third 
party, as  appropriate.  
Clinical study material may be destroyed at the study site only if permitted by local regulations  
and authorized by the Sponsor. A document for destruct ion (ie, Certificate of Destruction) must  
be obtained and sent to the Sponsor or designee. For further direction refer to Pharmacy Manual.  
6.4. Investigational Product  Compliance  
The IP will be administered at the study site under direct observation of medically qualified 
study staff , and IP administration will be appropriately recorded (date and time) in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF ). Qualified staff will confirm that the parti cipant has received the entire 
dose of the IP . If a participant does not receive the IP , the reason for the missed dose will be 
recorded. Data will be reconciled with site accountability records to assess compliance.  
The study site staff are responsible fo r ensuring that participants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
participant and complete a visit within the defined visit window specified in the SoE (Table  1). If 
a participant does not complete a visit within the time window, that visit will be classified as a 
missed visit and the participant will continue with subseque nt scheduled study visits. All safety 
requirements of the missed visit will be captured and included in the subsequent visit.  
6.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
6.5.1.  Prior Medications and Therapies  
Information about prior medications (including any prescription or over -the-counter medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by the participant within the 28 days before providing 
informed consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in 
the participant’s eCRF.

• All concomitant medications taken through 28  days after the IP injection. Antipyretics 
and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the absence of any symptoms in 
anticipation of an injection reacti on) will be recorded as such.  
• Systemic steroids (≥ 10  mg/day of prednisone or equivalent), immunosuppressants, 
immune -modifying drugs, immunoglobulins, and/or blood products administered at any 
time during the study period after the IP injection.  
• Any conco mitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, adverse event of 
special interest (AESI ; Section 8.4.6 ), a medically attended AE ( MAAE ; Section 8.4.4 ), 
or an AE leading to withdrawal  from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS.  
• The participant will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or analgesic 
medication to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7  days after the study vaccination, 
including the day of injection. Reported antipyretic  or analgesic medications should be 
recorded in the source document by the study site staff during the study visits after 
vaccination or via other participant interactions (eg, telephone calls).  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the Investigator and the contract research 
organization’s ( CRO’s ) medical monitor will make a joint decision about  continuing or 
withholding the study vaccination of the participant based on the time the medication was 
administered, the drug’s pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication 
will compromise the participant’s safety or interpretatio n of the data. It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that details regarding the concomitant medications are adequately 
recorded in the eCRF.

6.5.3.  Conco mitant Medications and Vaccines that May Lead to the  Elimination of a 
Participant from Per-Protocol Analyses 
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s evaluability in the Per-Protocol 
(PP) analysis  (see Table  8 for definition of PP Set): 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study 
vaccine used during the study period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modi fying drugs administered chronically (ie, 
more than 14 days in total) during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean 
that ≥  10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is not permitted. Inhaled , nasal,  and topical 
steroids are allowed.  
• Long -acting immune -modifying drugs administered at any time during the study period 
(eg, infliximab).  
• An authorized or licensed vaccine administered within 28  days after the study vaccination  
(Section  5.2). 
• Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered during the study period.

7.1. Pause Rules  
Study pause rules will be continuously monitored during all periods  of the study by the 
Investigators, IST, and  DSMB ; as warranted. If the Investigator, IST, or DSMB request that the 
study be paused due to a safety concern, further study vaccination in the affected vaccination 
group and at higher dose levels will be suspended, but all other planned procedures relating to  
safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessments will continue as described in the 
protocol. The Sponsor will notify the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research within 
48 hours in the event of a study pause.  
7.1.1.  Pause Rules Based on the Occurrence of a Single Event and Adjudicated by the 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
The occurrence of any of the events listed in Table  5, regardless of the vaccination group , will 
result in immediate suspension of dosing and enrollment in the vaccination group and at higher 
dose levels. An unscheduled DSMB will be convened to a ssess specific data concerns and to 
make recommendations.

a Grade 4 AE includes any Grade 4 solicited local or systemic AR and any Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. Grading of 
laboratory parameters will be based on the US FDA Guidance for Industry “Toxicity grading scale for healthy adult and 
adolescent volunteers  enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials” ( DHHS  2007b ). 
7.1.1.1.  Pause Rules Based on the Occurrence of Events in a Proportion of Participants  
The occurrence of  safety events that will pause study dosing based on defined threshol d levels, 
which are aggregate incidences relative to the number of exposed participants within a 
vaccination group , are summarized in Table 6.

a The rate of AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be computed based on the number of exposed participants who have 
provided safety data (ie, have completed a postdosing visit for assessment of safety).  
b For the first 12 participants, the pause rule will be considered to be met if 2 of the first 12 participants experience the same 
solicited AR or the same MedDRA preferred term unsolicited AE or laboratory abnormality. The calculation for ≥ 20% of 
participants includes the total number of participants who have completed a postdosing visit in the denom inator.  
c Grading of laboratory parameters will be based on the US FDA Guidance for Industry “Toxicity grading scale for healthy adult 
and adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials” ( DHHS  2007b ). 
If a pause is triggered in the study, each participant’s study site  visits will continue until EoS. If a 
pause affects a participant’s vaccination visit, the window for that participant’s vaccination visit 
will be suspended until the pause is lifted and vaccin ation can resume. Once the pause is lifted, 
vaccination should be reinstated as soon as possible.  
If a participant is in the screening period for more than 28  days as the result of a pause, the 
participant may be rescreened for study eligibility (and will receive a new screening number) as 
long as the participant continues to provide consent to participate in the study.  
7.2. Criteria for Delay or Withholding of Study Vaccination  
Body temperature must be measured at the dosing visit before study vaccine administr ation. The 
following events constitute criteria for delay of injection, and if any of these events occur at the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  16 Feb 2022

Confidential   Page 52 time scheduled for dosing, the participant may be injected at a later date within the time window 
specified in the SoE (Table  1): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing . 
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥  38.0°C (100.4°F) at the time of dosing . 
• Receipt of COVID -19 vaccination within 28 days of planned Day 1.  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by the Investigator, can be 
administered study vaccine . Participants with a fever ≥  38.0°C (100.4°F) will be contacted 
within the time window acceptable for participation and reevaluated for eligibility. If the 
Investigator determines that the participant’s health on the day of administration  temporarily 
precludes injection, the visit should be rescheduled within the allowed interval  for that visit.  
The Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, should  withhold the IP 
injection if the participant meets any of the following criteria : 
• Becomes pregnant . 
• Develops symptoms or conditions listed in the exclusion criter ia. 
• Experiences a clinically significant change in clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, or general condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, requires 
withholding of vaccine.  
The reason(s) for withholding the injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the Investigator could delay the IP injection 
within the visit window or withhold the IP injection based on a joint decision of the Investigator 
and the CRO’s medical monitor ( Secti on 6.5.3 ). 
7.3. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced  unless otherwise 
stated in the protocol . 
A “withdrawal” from the study refers to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the 
final visit planned in the protocol.  
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The Investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.

Protocol: mRNA -1020 -P101  Amendment 1  mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030  
 
Confidential   Page 53 If a participant desires to withdraw from the study beca use of an AE, the Investigator will 
attempt to obtain agreement to follow -up with the participant until the event is considered 
resolved or stable and will then complete the EoS section of the eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The Investigator will 
document whether the decision to withdraw a participant from the study was made by the 
participant or by the Investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Solicited AR or reactogenicity event (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by Sponsor  
• Withdrawal of consent by participant (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
Participants wh o are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs, solicited ARs, 
or reactogenicity events) must be clearly distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for 
other reasons. Investigators will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn fr om the study 
as a result of an AE, SAE, solicited AR, or reactogenicity event until resolution of the event.  
A participant withdrawing from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the Investigator must document this in th e site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  11.1.6 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. A ll 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by local regulations).

Confidential   Page 54 7.4. Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required  
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible , counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule , and ascertain whether  the participant wishes to and/or  should continue in the 
study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU , the Investigator  or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s las t known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and registered 
letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• A participant who continues to be unreachable or continues to be no ncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.

Confidential   Page 55 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  AND P ROCEDURES  
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign an informed consent 
form ( ICF; Section  11.1.6 ). Participants will undergo study procedures at the time points 
specified in the SoE (Table  1). A participant can also be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time 
during the study. Reasons for an unscheduled visit may include, but are not  limited to, 
reactogenicity issues, symptoms of potenti al ILI and/or COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. The 
site also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform the 
participant about visits, review eDiary requirements, or follow -up on ongoing or outstanding 
issues.  
In acc ordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS  2020), Investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approv al of the Sponsor. Such action should be 
taken to protect the safety and well -being of participants and study site staff or to comply with 
state or municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Proto col waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be followed as presented in the SoE (Table  1). Adherence to the study 
design requirements is essential and required for study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue participation 
in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that pot ential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• The Screening Visit and Day 1 Visit cannot be completed on the same day. 
Additionally, the Screening Visit may be performed over multiple visits if within the 
28-day screening window.

Confidential   Page 56 8.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the fo llowing for each participant, 
according to the So E (Table  1): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section 8.4.3 ) that occur during the 7  days following 
study vaccine administration (ie, the day of injection and 6  subsequent days). Solicited 
ARs will be recorded daily using eDiaries ( Section 8.1.1 ). 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28  days following study vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 27 subsequent day s). Unsolicited AEs are 
defined in Section  8.4.1 . 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from study participation from Day  1 through 
Day 181/EoS or withdrawa l from the study.  
• SAEs, AESIs, and MAAEs from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the 
study . 
• Results of safety laboratory tests ( Section 8.1.3 ). 
• Vital sign measurements ( Section 8.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings ( Section 8.1.5 ). 
• Baseline electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) results ( Section 8.1.6 ). 
• Assessments for causes of respiratory infections as needed from Day 1 through 
Day 181/EoS or through withdrawal from the study  (Section  8.1.7 ). 
• Pregnancy and accompanying outcomes in female participants reported after 
administration of study vaccination  (Section 8.4.7 ). 
• Concomitant medications and non study  vaccinations . 
8.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries  
At the time of consent, the participants must confirm they are willing to complete an eDiary 
using either an application downloaded to their own device or using a device that is provided at 
the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day  1, the participants will be instructed to 
download the eDiary application or wi ll be provided an eDiary device to record solicited ARs 
(Section  8.4.3 ). 
Participants will be instructed on Day 1 on thermometer usage to measure bod y temperature, 
ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), and

Confidential   Page 57 self-assessment for localized axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection 
arm. 
Participants will record data into the eDiary startin g approximately 1  hour after injection under 
supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry of assessments. The study site staff 
will perform any retraining as necessary. Participants will continue to record data in the eDiary 
after they le ave the study site, preferably in the evening and at the same time each day, on the 
day of injection , and for 6 days following injection.  
Participants will record the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as defined  in Section  8.4.3 , that 
occur on the day of IP administration and for 6  days following  IP administration.  
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by the study site. If body 
temperature is taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.  
• Measurements, as applicable, for solicited local ARs (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration) will be performed using the ruler provided by the study site.  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on the day of injection or for 
the next 6  days.  
The eDiary will be the only source document allowed for solicited systemic or local ARs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants will be instructed to complete eDiary 
entries daily. Quantitative temperature recordings and measurement of any injection site 
erythema or swelling/induration reported on the following day may be excluded from the 
analyses of solicited ARs.  
Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants at a visit 7  days after the injection.  
8.1.1.1.  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use  
Study sites will distribute Sponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by participants 
in assessing body temperature and injection site reactions , for recording solicited ARs in 
eDiaries. Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to th ose participants who 
do not have their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
8.1.2.  Safety Phone Calls  
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by trained site personnel. This 
call will follow a script, which will facilitate the coll ection of relevant safety information. Safety

Protocol: mRNA -1020 -P101  Amendment 1  mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030  
 
Confidential   Page 58 telephone calls follow a schedule for each participant , as shown in  the So E (Table  1). The 
participant will  be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of MAAEs, SAEs, 
AESIs, or AEs leading to study withdrawal  and concomitant medications associated with those 
events, receipt of  any non study  vaccinations , and pregnancy  (Section 8.4). All safety information 
collected from the telephone contact must be documented in source documents as described by 
the participant and not docum ented on the script used for the safety telephone contact. An 
unscheduled follow -up safety call may be triggered if an eDiary record results in identification of 
a relevant safety event.  
8.1.3.  Safety Laboratory Assessments  
Planned blood sampling for safety labor atory assessments will occur as indicated in the So E 
(Table  1). Tests will include WBC  count, hemoglobin, platelets, alanine aminotransferase , 
aspartate  aminotransferase , total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine. Laboratory tests 
will be performed by the central laboratory, unless otherwise specified.  
Pregnancy testing include the following:  
• A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit and before 
the study vaccination on Day 1. At any time, a pregnancy test either via blood or 
point -of-care urine can be performed, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• If not documented in  a female participant’s medical r ecords, a n FSH test may be 
performed at the Screening Visit, as necessary and at the discretion of the Investigator, to 
confirm postmenopausal status.  
8.1.4.  Vital Sign  Measurements  
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi ratory rate, and 
body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 5  minutes 
before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in 
the So E (Table  1). On the day of IP administration, vital sign measurements will be collected 
once before injection and approximately  1 hour after injection (before participants are discharged 
from  the study site). Vital signs may be collected at other study visits in conjunction with a 
symptom -directed physical examination.  
If any of the vital sign measurements following administration of study vaccination  meet the 
toxicity grading criteria for cli nical abnormalities of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and 
grade will be documented in the AE section  of the eCRF (unless there is another known cause of 
the abnormality that would result in an AE classification). The Investigator will continue to 
monitor the participant with additional assessments until the vital sign value has reached the

Confidential   Page 59 reference range, returns to the vital sign value at baseline,  is considered stable , or until the 
Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically nec essary.  
Febrile  (≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) participants on the day of IP administration may be rescheduled 
within the relevant window periods. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses may be injected at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  
When procedures overlap  and are scheduled to occur at the same time point, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then blood collection.  
8.1.5.  Physical Examinations  
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at scheduled time 
points as indicated in the So E (Table  1). The full examination will include assessment of skin, 
head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, he art, cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, and musculoskeletal system and extremities. Any clinically significant finding identified 
during a study visit before administration of study vaccine  should be recorded in the participant's 
medical history eCRF. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit after 
administration of study vaccine should be  reported as an MAAE  (Section 8.4.4 ). 
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the discretion 
of the Investigator. On the day of IP administration before injection, the arm receiving the 
injection and the axillary  lymph nodes should be examined , and any abnormalities should be 
documented . 
Body mass index will be calculated at the Screening Visit only.  
8.1.6.  Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained after 10 minutes of supine rest at 
Visit  1/Day  1 prior to vaccination. Skin preparation should be thorough and electrode placement 
should be according to standard 12 -lead ECG procedure. The purpose of the ECG is to have a 
baseline comparison for possible subsequent clinical evaluations of suspected 
myocarditis/pericarditis. Interpretation of the ECG is not required prior to study vaccine 
administration . 
8.1.7.  Assessments for Respiratory Viral Infections  
Due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, participants may get infected with SARS -CoV -2 or 
experience symptoms consistent with ILI during the study.  
All participants will provide NP swab samples before the injection on Day 1 for assessment of 
asymptomatic infection with respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, 
as influenza or COVID -19 sympto ms may confound reactogenicity assessment ( CDC  2021a). 
ModernaTX, Inc.  16 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1020 -P101  Amendment 1  mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030  
 
Confidential   Page 60 If symptoms occur, participants will be directed to return to the study site as soon as possible, but 
no later than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, for medical evaluat ion and an NP swab. The 
NP swab sample will be tested by multiplex RT -PCR for respiratory pathogens , including 
influenza viruses and SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, clinical information may be collected to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case  (CDC  2020b). All findings will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
If scheduled, a study site illness visit may include additional assessments such as medical 
history, physical examination, and blood sampling for clinical laboratory testing. Radiologic  
imaging studies may be conducted. Blood samples may be collected for potential future 
immunologic assessment of influenza and/or SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
If participants are confirmed to have SARS -CoV -2 infection during the study and are 
asymptomatic, the Investigator will notify the participant's primary care physician and local 
health authority, per local regulations. If the participant had known exposure to COVID -19 (eg, 
exposure to someone with a confirmed case of COVID -19) prior to Day 1, it will be ca ptured on 
the COVID -19 exposure form, and the IP administration for that participant will be delayed for 
at least 14  days.  
All cases of RT -PCR -confirmed ILI and/or COVID -19 should be captured as MAAEs 
(Section  8.4.4 ; unless the definition for an SAE is met) along with relevant concomitant 
medications and details about severity, seriousness, and outcome.  
8.2. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples for immun ogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the So E (Table  1). The following assessments are planned:  
• Serum antibody level as measured by HAI assay  (primary , secondary, and exploratory  
endpoint s). 
• NA-specific antibody levels as measured by NAI assay (primary , secondary, and 
exploratory  endpoint s). 
• Serum neutralizing antibody level as measured by microneutralization (MN) assay or 
similar method ( secondary or exploratory endpoint) . 
• Cellular immunogenicity (exploratory endpoint  for subset only ). 
Sample aliq uots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that vial 
volumes are likely to be adequate for future testing needs. The actual time and date of each 
sample collected will be recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification wil l be utilized 
to maintain the blind at the laboratory at all times and to allow for automated sample tracking

Confidential   Page 61 and housing. Handling and preparation of the samples for analysis, as well as shipping and 
storage requirements, will be provided in a separate st udy manual.  
Measurement of antibody levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by the Sponsor.  
According to the ICF ( Section  11.1.6 ), serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for 
future research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize 
the immune response to influenza viruses, a dditional assay development, and the immune 
response across influenza viruses.  
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 450 mL for the study. 
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the 
samples. Further details are provided in both the ICF and Laboratory Reference Manual.  
8.3. Efficacy Assessments  
While the study will not be powered for effica cy assessments, ILI will be tracked as an 
exploratory objective  (Section 8.1.7 ). 
8.4. Safety Definitions  and Related Procedures  
8.4.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
pharmaceutical product , whether or not considered related  to the product . 
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition , after the IP injection . 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the IP  injection  even though they may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
Events NOT Meet ing the Adverse Event Definition  
• Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hospitalization for preplanned surgical 
procedure) . 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situati ons in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).

Confidential   Page 62 An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the AE 
(Section  8.4.3 ). For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the 
AE. 
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, for the 7  days after the injection  of IP).  
8.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the Investigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be reported to the Sponsor, whether or 
not it is considered related to IP.  
• Is life -threatening   
The participant  was at immediate risk of death  at the time of the event . It does not include 
an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the hospital 
or emergency ward for at least 1 overnight stay for observation and/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. The 
hospital or emergency ward admission should be considered an SAE regardless of 
whether opinions differ as t o the necessity of the admission. Complications that occur 
during inpatient hospitalization will be recorded as AE s; however, if a complication/AE 
prolongs hospitalization or otherwise fulfills SAE criteria, the complication/AE will be 
recorded as a separa te SAE.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vo miting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect

Protocol: mRNA -1020 -P101  Amendment 1  mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030  
 
Confidential   Page 63 • Medically important event   
Medical judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or 
require m edical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emerge ncy room or at home, blood dyscrasias , or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.4.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of sele cted signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after IP injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  8.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an 
eDiary on the day of IP injection and for the 6  days after the day of dosing.  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according t o the grading scales presented in Table  7 modified from the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Trials ( DHHS  2007b ). 
If a participant  reported a solicited AR during the solicited period and did not record the event in 
the eDiary , the event should be recorded on the Reactogenicity page  of the eCRF. If the events  
starts during the solicited period, but continues beyond 7 days after dosing,  the participant should 
notify the  site to provide an end date to close out the event on the Reactogenicity page of the 
eCRF. If the participant reported an event after the sol icited period (ie, after Day 7). it should be 
recorder as an AE on the AE page of the eCRF . All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be 
considered causally related  to dosing or study  vaccination.  
Adverse reactions beyond Day 7 should be reviewed by the study site staff either during the next 
scheduled phone call or at the following  study visit.

Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the 
participant’s source document and must also be recorded by the study site staff in the 
solicited AR section of the participant’s  eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that re sults in a visit to a healthcare practitioner ( HCP ), to 
be recorded as an MAAE  (Section 8.4.4 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study or 
the participant being withdrawn from the study by the Investigator (AE leading to 
withdrawal) . 
• Solicited local or systemic AR continuing  beyond 7 days post injection . 
• Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE . 
8.4.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events  
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to a n HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for unscheduled assessments (eg, abnorma l laboratory follow -up and/or  COVID -19 
[Section 8.1.7 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary care 
physician). Inves tigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. 
Unsolicited AEs will be captured on the AE page of the eCRF.  
All cases of RT-PCR -confirmed ILI and/or confirmed COVID -19 will be recorded as MAAEs.

Confidential   Page 66 8.4.5.  Influenza -Like Illness  
A CDC -defined ILI is defined as body temperature  ≥ 37.8°C (100°F) accompanied by cough 
and/or sore throat . 
An RT -PCR confirmed ILI is defined as a positive influenza result by RT -PCR done at any 
setting during the study period . 
8.4.6.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI  is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor are required. Such events may require further inves tigation to 
characterize and understand them.  
The AESIs  for this protocol are listed in Appendix 3 ( Section  11.3). 
Protocol -specific AESIs will be co llected through the entire study period and must be reported to 
the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24  hours of becoming 
aware of the event via the electronic data capture (EDC) system. If a site receives a report of a 
new A ESI from a participant or receives updated information on a previously reported AESI at a 
time after the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper 
AESI form using the SAE Mailbox or the SAE Fax line ( Section 8.4.12 ). 
Myocarditis/Pericarditis  
A case of suspected, probable, or confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis should 
be reported as an AESI, even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC case definition. The event 
should also be reported as an SAE if it meets seriousness criteria ( Section 8.4.2 ). The CDC case 
definition is provided in Appendix 4 ( Section  11.4) as guidance.  
Anaphylaxis  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorde d as MAAEs and reported as SAE s, based 
on the criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As 
an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24  hours, per Section  8.4.12 . The Investigator will submit any updated 
anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. For reportin g 
purposes, a participant who displays signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (as 
described below) should be reported as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as 
general guidance for Investigators and is based on the Brighton Collaborati on case definition 
(Rüggeberg et al 2007 ).

Confidential   Page 67 Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur foll owing 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by the following:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal:  urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes.  
− Cardiovascular:  measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated shock, 
loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, evidence of reduced 
peripheral circulation.  
− Respiratory:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, upper 
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respiratory distress, persistent 
dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea.  
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  
8.4.7.  Recording and Follow -up of Pregn ancy  
Female participants  who have a positive pregnancy test at screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test at Day 1 should not receive the IP . 
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after t he study vaccination on 
Day 1 and until the end of their participation in the study.  If a pregnancy is reported, the 
Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24  hours of learning of the pregnancy and should 
follow the procedures outlined in this secti on. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours  of the site learning of its occurrence  using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, 
or the SAE Fax line ( Section 8.4.12 ). If the participant agrees to sub mit this information, the 
pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn comp lications. This follow -up should occur even if 
intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be 
distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. The Investigator must immediately

outcome according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
8.4.8.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after the vaccine dose.  Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after the vaccine dose.  
AESIs, MAAEs , SAEs , and AEs leading to with drawal  will be collected from Day 1 throughout 
entire study duration (Day  181/EoS  for all participants) as specified in the SoE (Table  1). Any 
AEs occurr ing before receipt of IP will be analyzed separately from AEs.  
At every study site visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes  in their well -being (including respiratory viral infection  
symptoms)  according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been 
hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication 
regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any non study  
vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings , and other documents 
relevant to participant safety classified as an AE will be documented in the AE section  of the 
eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically 
appropriate and followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwi se explained, or the 
participant is LTFU (as defined in Section  7.4). 
8.4.9.  Assessment of Intensity  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section 8.4.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe . 
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS  2007 b) will be used to categorize local 
and systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs ), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign 
measurements observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity 
events are presented in Secti on 8.4.3 . 
ModernaTX, Inc.  16 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1020 -P101  Amendment 1  mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030  
 
Confidential   Page 69 The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the Investigator based 
upon medical judgment and the definitions of  severity as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant ’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the p articipant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s 
source documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of 
intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as interm ittent requires documentation of onset 
and duration of each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is 
reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
8.4.10.  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator's assessment of an  AE's relationship to IP is part of the documentation process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The Investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the 
following classification:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Participant did 
not receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relativ e to administration of the IP 
is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the IP.  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of 
exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the A E onset relative to the administration of 
the IP is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the IP than by another cause.  
8.4.11.  Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study r egardless of their relationship to the IP  or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt 
as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded in the A E section  of 
the eCRF. Information to be collected includes type of event, time of onset,

Confidential   Page 70 Investigator -specified assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and 
relationship to the IP , time of resolution of the event, seriousness, any req uired treatment or 
evaluations, and outcome. The unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must 
also be reported. All AEs will be followed u ntil they are resolved or stable or judged by the 
Investigator to be not clinically significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) will be used to code all unsolicited AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
8.4.12.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE considered serious by the Invest igator or that meets SAE criteria ( Section  8.4.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the 
EDC system. The Investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in 21  US CFR Parts 312 and 320. The Inve stigator is responsible for 
notifying the institutional review board (IRB) directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
• SAE Mailbox:  
• SAE Hotline (US A):  
• SAE Fax Line (USA):  
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs are described in Section  8.4.17 . 
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the IP  or study procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the  study.

Confidential   Page 71 8.4.13.  Reporting of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following process for reporting an AESI ensures compliance with 21 CFR 312 and ICH 
GCP guidelines. After learning that a participant has experienced an AESI, the Investigator or 
designee is responsible for reporting the AESI to the Sponsor, regardless of relationship or 
expectedness, within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event. If the AESI meets the criteria for 
an SAE, the SAE reporting  procedure should be followed.  
8.4.14.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and S erious Adverse 
Event Information  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP administration  but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the Me dical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the 
eCRF  and not in the AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time after IP 
administration during the study, it will be recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as fo llows:  
• Observing the participant.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading manner.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of vaccination through 6 days after injection . Other 
(unsolicited ) AEs will be collected from the day of vaccination  through 28 days after the 
injection . 
Serious AEs will be collected from the start of IP administration  until the last day of study 
participation . 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC system. If 
a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE  and the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report this 
information on a paper SAE form using the SAE Mailbox or the SAE Fax line ( Section  8.4.12 ). 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by the Investigator to be clinically significant (eg, meets any serious criteria ). If 
this is the case, it must be recorded in the source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE 
form(s). The evaluation that produced the value or result should be repeated until that value or 
result returns to normal or is stabilized and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Investigators are not  obligated to actively seek AE s or SAE s after EoS. However, if the 
Investigator  learns of any SAE (including a death ) at any time after a participant has withdrawn 
ModernaTX, Inc.  16 Feb 2022

Confidential   Page 72 from or completed the study and the Investigator considers the event to be reasonably relate d to 
the IP or study participation , the Investigator  must promptly notify the Sponsor . 
Participants who develop ILI will be followed through 30 days from the onset of ILI even if 
Day 30 is beyond Day 181/EoS.  
8.4.15.  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and S erious Adverse Events 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in  Section  8.4.12 . 
Electronic diaries have specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of inform ation on other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomitant 
medications/vaccinations.  
The Investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of the vaccination group 
or suspected causal relationship to the IP . For all AEs, the Investigator must p ursue and obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets 
the criteria for classification as an SAE , which  requir es immediate notification to the Sponsor or 
its designated representative.  
Care will be taken  not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.4.16.  Follow -up of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Events of 
Speci al Interest  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits  and contacts.  
All AEs, SAEs, and non serious  AESIs (as defined in Section 8.4.6 ), will be treated as medically 
appropriate and followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is LTFU, as defined in Section  7.4. 
8.4.17.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor  of a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local re gulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The

Protocol: mRNA -1020 -P101  Amendment 1  mRNA -1020  and mRNA -1030  
 
Confidential   Page 73 Sponsor  will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRBs, and Investigators . 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious ARs according to 
local regulatory requirements and Sponsor  policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an Investigator  safet y report describing a n SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor  will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.5. Safety Monitoring  
The CRO’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the individual Site 
Investigators will monitor safety throughout the study. The roles of the IST and DSMB are 
outlined in Section  11.1.11 . 
8.6. Treatment of Overdose  
Because  the IP is to be administered by a n HCP , it is unlikely that an overdose will occur. Dose 
deviations will be tracked as protocol deviations (Section  11.1.8 ).

Confidential   Page 74 9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. 
The details of statistical analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which 
will be finalized before the clinical database lock for the study. If changes are made to primary 
and/or key secondary objectives or the related statistical methods after t he study has begun but 
prior to any data unblinding, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with ICH Guideline 
E9). Changes to other secondary or exploratory analyses made after the protocol has been 
finalized, along with an explanation as to when a nd why they occurred, will be listed in the SAP 
or clinical study report (CSR) for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, will be clearly 
identified in the CSR.  
9.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses  
This is an observer -blind study. The Investig ator, study staff, study participants, site monitors, 
and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the IP administered until the study 
database is locked and unblinded, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded personnel (of limited number) w ill be assigned to vaccine accountability 
procedures and will prepare the IP for all participants. These personnel will have no study 
functions other than IP management, documentation, accountability, preparation, and 
administration. They will not be invol ved in participant evaluations and will not reveal 
the identity of the IP to either the participant or the blinded study site personnel involved 
in the conduct of the study unless this information is necessary in the case of an 
emergency.  
• Unblinded medical ly qualified study site personnel will administer the IP. They will not 
be involved in assessments of any study endpoints.  
• Unblinded site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned as 
the IP accountability monitors. They will h ave responsibilities to ensure that sites are 
following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and administration procedures.  
• An independent unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the preplanned 
IA (Section 9.6). Sponsor team members will be prespecified to be unblinded to the IA 
results and will not communicate the results to the blinded Investigators, study site staff, 
clinical mo nitors, or participants.  
• The DSMB will review the IA data to safeguard the interests of clinical study participants 
and to help ensure the integrity of the study. The DSMB will review unblinded IA results 
provided by the independent unblinded statistician.  The DSMB will also review

Confidential   Page 75 unblinded statistical outputs for ad hoc safety reviews triggered by pause rules, should 
this occur. Section 11.1.11  provides additional information on DSMB and safety review.  
The dosing assignment will be concealed by having the unblinded pharmacy personnel prepare 
the IP in a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. An opaque sleeve 
over the syringe used for injection will maintain the blind at the time of injection, as the doses 
containing mRNA IP will look different from that of the active comparator  Flublok . Only 
delegated unblinded study site staff will conduct the injection procedure.  Once the injection is 
completed, only the blinded study staff will perform further assessments and interact with the 
participants. Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
9.1.1.  Breaking the Blind  
Except in the case of medic al necessity, a participant’s vaccine  assignment should not be 
unblinded without the approval of the Sponsor. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant 
during the study, the blind will be broken only if knowledge of the vaccine  assignment will 
affect that participant’s clinical management. In the event of a medical emergency requiring 
identification of individual vaccine  assignment, the Investigator will make every attempt to 
contact the CRO ’s medical monitor, preferably via electronic protocol inq uiry platform, to 
explain the need for unblinding within 24 hours of opening the code. The Investigator will be 
responsible for documenting the time, date, reason for unblinding, and the names of the 
personnel involved. The Investigator (or designee) will have access to unblind participants 
within interactive response technology ( IRT). All unblinding instances will be tracked via an 
audit trail in IRT and documented in the final study report.  
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data will also be 
unblinded to a statistical team at specified time point(s) for analysis as outlined in Section 9.6. 
9.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal hypotheses will be tested . 
9.3. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study  is not driven by statistical assumptions for formal hypothesis 
testing. The number of proposed participants is considered sufficient to provide a descriptive 
summary of the safety and immunogenicity of different dose levels of mRNA -1020 or 
mRNA -1030.  
A total of  approximately 560 participants will be randomly assigned to receive mRNA -1020, 
mRNA -1030, mRNA -1010, or Flublok. Among those ~560  participan ts, 70 participants will be

Confidential   Page 76 randomized into each vaccination group. Details regarding the number of participants in each 
vaccination group and the randomization ratio are presented in  Section  6.2. 
With 70 participants in each group receiving the IP, there is an approximately 76% probability to 
observe at least 1 participant with an AE if the true incidence of the AE is 2%; if the true 
incidence rate is 4%, then the probability to observe an AE  is approximately 94%. 
9.4. Analysis Sets 
Table  8 describes the analysis datasets.  
Table  8: Analys is Sets 
Set Description  
Randomization Set  The Randomization Set consists of all participants who are randomly 
assigned.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)1 The FAS consists of all randomly assigned participants who receive the IP.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Set2 The PP Set consists of all participants in the FAS who comply with the 
injection schedule, comply with the timings of immunogenicity blood 
sampling to have a baseline and at least 1 postinjection assessment, do not 
have influenza infection at baseline through Day  29 (as documented by 
PCR testing), and have no major protocol deviations that impact the 
immune response.  
Safety Set3 The Safety Set consists of all randomly assigned participants who receive 
the IP.  
Solici ted Safety Set4 The Solicited Safety Set consists of all participants in the Safety Set who 
contribute any solicited AR data.  
Abbreviations: AR = adverse reaction; IP = investigational product ; PCR = polymerase chain reaction . 
1. For the FAS, participants will be analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized.  
2. The PP Set will be used as the primary analysis set for analyses of immunogenicity unless otherwise specified. Participants 
will be analyzed according to the group to which they were ra ndomized.  
3. The Safety Set  will be used for all analyses of safety, except for the solicited ARs. Participants will be included in the 
vaccination group corresponding to what they actually received.  
4. The Solicited Safety Set will be used for the analyses of s olicited ARs and participants will be included in the vaccination 
group corresponding to what they actually received.  
9.5. Statistical Methods  
General Considerations:  All analyses will be performed by treatment arm, unless otherwise 
specified. Categorical varia bles will be presented by  frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of participants, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).  
9.5.1.  Baseline Characteristics  and Demographics  
Demograp hic variables (eg, age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and body mass index ) 
and baseline characteristics will be summarized by vaccination group and overall. Summary

categorical variables) will be provided.  
9.5.2.  Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set, except summaries of solicited ARs, which 
will be based on the Solicited Safety Set. All safety analyses will be provided by vaccination 
group. Participants will be included in the vaccination group corresponding to what they actually 
received.  
Safety and reactogenicity will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, including 
solicited ARs (local and systemic AR s), unsolicited AEs (including any clinical safety laboratory 
abnormalities), treatment -related AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal 
from study participation, AESIs, vital sign measurements, and physical examination findings.  
The number and percentage of participants with any solicited local AR or solicited systemic AR 
during the 7 -day follow -up period after the study injection will be summarized. A 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper -Pearson method will also be provide d for the 
percentage of participants with any solicited AR.  
The number and percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs, treatment -related AEs, severe 
AEs, SAEs, AESIs, MAAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal from study participation will be 
summarized. Unsolicited AEs will be coded according to the MedDRA for AR terminology and 
presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.  
Solicited ARs will be coded according to the MedDRA for AR terminology. The toxicity grading 
scale for healthy adult and  adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials 
will be used in this study with modification for rash, solicited ARs, and vital signs  
(DHHS  2007b ). Unsolicited AEs will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and 
preferred term.  
The number of events of unsolicited AEs/SAEs, AESIs, MAAEs , and AEs leading to withdrawal  
will be reported in summary tables accordingly. For all other safety parameters, descriptive 
summary statistics will be provided.  
Assessment  of safety laboratory tests will be done for this study. The number and percentage of 
participants who have chemistry and hematology results below or above the normal laboratory 
ranges will be tabulated by time point. For treatment -emergent safety laborato ry test results, the 
raw values and change from baseline values will be summarized by vaccination group and visit 
at each time point.  
Vital sign results will be presented .

9.5.3.  Immunogenic ity Analyses  
Immunogenicity analyses will be reported based on the PP Set and provided by vaccination 
group , unless otherwise specified . 
For the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean of specific antibody titers with 
corresponding 95%  CI at each time poi nt and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR)  of specific 
antibody titers with corresponding 95%  CI at each postbaseline time  point over pre injection  
baseline at Day 1 will be provided by vaccination group . Descriptive summary statistics 
including median, minimum , and maximum will also be provided.  Geometric mean titer (GMT ) 
and GMFR might be adjusted for baseline titer and/or age group.  
For summarizations of geometric mean titers, antibody titers reported as below lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) will be replaced by 0.5  × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the upper 
limit of quantification (ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
For HA, rate of seroconversion is defined as the proportion of participants with either a 
pre-vaccination HI titer < 1:10 and a pos tvaccination  HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination HI 
titer ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold rise in post vaccination  HI antibody titer. For NA, an endpoint 
of interest is the percentage of participants with a change in the Day  29 titer of at least 2 -/3-/4-

the Day  1 titer if the Day  1 titer is ≥  LLOQ.  
Seroconversion rate from baseline will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper -Pearson method at each pos tbaseline time  point. For NA, the number and percentage of 
participants with a ≥  2-, ≥ 3-, and ≥  4-fold rise of serum titers from baseline will be provided 
with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at each postbaseline time  point.  
Further detail s will be described in the SAP.  
9.5.4.  Exploratory  Analyses  
Exploratory analyses not addressed in Section  9.5.1  and Section 9.5.3  will be described in the 
SAP before database lock . 
9.5.5.  Subgroup  Analyses  
The protocol does not define any formal subgroup analyses.  However, age -specific subgroup 
analyses may be performed to assess for potential differences in safety/reactogenicity or immune 
responses across age groups.  
9.6. Study  Analyses  
One unblinded  IA is planned in this study. It will be performed after participants have completed 
the Day 29 Visit and will include, at a minimum, cleaned data (ie, data that are as clean as 
possible) from available safety and immunogenicity datasets.  
The IA will be perfo rmed by a separate team of unblinded programmers and statisticians. Except 
for a limited number of Sponsor and CRO personnel who will be unblinded to perform the IA, 
the study site staff, Investigators , study monitors, and participants will remain blinded until after 
the final database lock for final analysis. The final CSR  will include full unblinded analyses of 
safety and immunogenicity data available through Day 181/EoS.  
The final analysis of all endpoints will be performed after all participants have co mpleted all 
planned study procedures. Results of this analysis will be presented in a final CSR, including 
individual listings. The final CSR will include full analyses of all safety and immunogenicity 
data through Day 181/EoS.  
The SAP will describe the planned interim  and final  analyses in greater detail.

Confidential   Page 86 According to ICH  GCP guideline s, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the 
proper conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on 
the eCRFs. The study monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and the Sponsor in the 
maintenance of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The 
study monitor will advise the Investigator of  the regulatory necessity for study -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB  review, and inspection by providing direct access to the source data 
and/or documents. In addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the Investigator 
all regulations app licable to the clinical evaluation of IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation 
throughout the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the prot ocol; 
to verify completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study 
conduct to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan. During 
the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or a representat ive will have regular contacts with the 
study  site, for the following  purposes : 
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the d ata are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed.  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm that AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs , that any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the SAE Hotline , and that those SAEs that m eet criteria

Definitions : 
Woman of Childbearing Potential  (WOCBP):  
Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
1. Following menarche  
2. From the time of menarche until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see 
below)  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
o A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) l evel in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH 
measurem ent is required.  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if 
they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must 
discontinue HRT  to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study 
enrollment.  
• Permanent sterilization methods (for the purpose of this study) include:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
o Documented tubal ligation  
o For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause 
other than the above, (eg, M üllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal 
dysgenesis), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study 
entry.  
• If ferti lity is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle 
cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation 
should be considered.

Acute pericarditis**  Presence of ≥2 new or worsening of the following clinical features:  
• acute chest pain††  
• pericardial rub on exam  
• new ST -elevation or PR -depression on EKG  
• new or worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiogram or MRI  
Myopericarditis  This term may be used for patients who meet criteria for both myocarditis and 
pericarditis.  
Abbreviations: AV = atrioventricular; cMRI = cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; ECG  or EKG  = electrocardiogram.  
Note: An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Co mmittee (CEAC) comprised of medically qualified personnel, including 
cardiologists, will review suspected cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis to determine if they meet Center  
for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for “probable” or  “confirmed” events, ( Gargano  et al 2021 ), and provide the 
assessment to the Sponsor. The CEAC members will be blinded to study treatment. Details regarding the CEAC 
composition, responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of  data review will be defined in the CEAC charter.  
* Persons who lack the listed symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified as subclinical myocarditis (probable or 
confirmed).  
† Using the Dallas criteria ( Aretz  et al 1987 ). Autopsy cases may be classified as confirmed clinical myocarditis on the basis 
of meeting histopathologic criteria if no other identifiable cause.  
§ To meet the ECG or rhythm monitoring criterion, a probable case must include at least one of 1)  ST-segment or T -wave 
abnormalities; 2) Paroxysmal or sustained atrial, supraventricular, or ventricular arrhythmias; or 3) AV nodal conduction 
delays or intraventricular conduction defects.  
Using either the original or the revised Lake Louise criteria.

†† Typically described as pain made worse by lying down, deep inspiration, or cough, and rel ieved by sitting up or leaning 
forward, although other types of chest pain might occur.

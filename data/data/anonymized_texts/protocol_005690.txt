Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 Secondary Outcomes  • The distance walked on the 6MWT is the major functional outcome to be evaluated. 
Other tests include time to walk and run , strength test, functional test , and reaching 
ability .   
• MRI studies of leg muscles will be done pre and post treatment (6 , 12 and 24 
months) to study muscle size, fibrosis and fat content.   
• EIM measurement will quantify the pathological status of muscles.   
• Muscle biopsies on quadriceps muscles (a muscle biopsy on one leg at baseline 
screening visit and the post gene transfer biopsy on the opposite leg at day 180), will 
include general histological evaluation. Assessment will consist of morphometric 
analyses for  quantification of fiber size, fibrosis, inflammatory process, satellite 
cells and regeneration. Muscle tissue obtained at biopsy will also be assessed for 
viral DNA (qPCR), and follistatin transgene expression .  . 
Study Duration  We will evaluate short -term safety over a two year period.  Subjects will be tested at 
baseline and return for follow up visits on day s 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, 90, 180,  and 9,  12, 18 
and 24 months post -gene transfer .  
Sample Size  Six DMD patients will receive rAAV1.CMV.huFollistatin 344 to both limbs by multiple  
injections to gluteal muscles, quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles.  
Statistical Analysis  This is a phase I/IIA trial, with safety as the primary measure. For each measure based on 
differences between pre-  and post -gene transfer examinations (clinical) evaluated by 
paired t test, with a p value of < 0.05 indicating significance.   
Long -term follow -up We will follow the most recent FDA guidance with regard t o long -term subject follow up 
post gene transfer.  As indicated by the guidelines, our proposed vector has a very low 
probability of gene transfer -related delayed adverse events.   We will, however, evaluate 
short -term safety over a two -year period that inc orporates the active phase of the protocol. 
If newly identified risks are associated with our product, or if the subjects suffer any 
adverse events during this period, we will initiate a long -term follow -up according to the 
FDA guidelines .

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015  
2.0 ABSTRACT  
The proposed clinical trial is an outgrowth of the safety record and functional improvement seen 
in the BMD follistatin gene therapy trial.  In this study we propose to inject 
AAV1.CMV.huFS344 at a total dose of 2.4 X 1012 vg/kg to  six DMD patient s.  This dose will be 
divided between gluteal muscles, quadriceps and tibialis anterior.  This is a wider distribution of 
vector than given to BMD patients, who overall improved the distance walked on the 6MWT 
without adverse events related to viral transduction into a single muscle.  
The primary objective of this study  is safety and endpoints will  include hematology, serum 
chemistry, urinalysis, immunologic response to rAAV 1 and follistatin, and reported history and 
observations of symptoms.  E fficacy measures will be used as secondary outcomes and include 
the distance walked on the 6MWT, functional tests by PT, life quality questionnaire, MRI, EIM, 
and muscle biopsy.  Subject will have follow up visits on days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, 90, 180 and 9, 
12, 18 and 24 months post -gene transfer .      
3.0 CLINICAL TRIAL A ND PRINCIPAL INVESTI GATOR  
The study will be carried out at the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  Dr 
Mendell, Professor of Pediatrics  and Neurology, Director of the Center for Gene Therapy at the 
Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, OH and Director of the 
Neuromuscular Disease Center, will serve as Principal Investigator.  Dr Mendell brings to this 
trial more than forty years of clinical trial experience in neuromuscular disorders.  With regard to 
gene therapy, he served as principal investigator for the first viral mediated gene transfer for 
muscular dystrophy (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) (DMD, IND BB -IND 129 36 Serial # 004 
using a hybrid AAV2.5 consisting of AAV2 with 5 amino acid substitutions from AAV1, CMV 
promoter, and mini -dystrophin).1  In DMD, rAAV.2.5.CMV.mini -dystrophin was delivered by 
intramuscular injection to the biceps muscle.  In a subsequent gene transfer study for limb girdle 
muscular dystrophy, type 2D subjects with α -SG deficiency received intramuscular injections to 
the extensor digitorum brevis muscle using rAAV1.tMCK.α -SG  (IND BB -IND 13434 Serial # 
002)2, 3.  He also holds an approved IND (#14845) for AAV1.CMV.follistatin gene therapy in 
Becker mus cular dystrophy (BMD) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), a study that is 
currently underway with intramuscular injections to the quadriceps muscles bilatera lly.  No 
adverse events have been encountered in any of these trials.

5.0 BACKGROUND AND S IGNIFICANCE  
DMD is the most common, severe childhood form of muscular dystrophy.  Inheritance follows 
an X -linked recessive pattern.  Birth prevalence has been estimated at 1 in 5000 live male bi rths.4  
Approximately one -third of cases represent new mutations of t he DMD  gene with the remaining 
inherited on the X chromosome from a carrier mother.  Questions usually begin to surface 
between ages 3 to 5 regarding reduced motor skills that alert a need for diagnostic evaluation.  
DMD is relentlessly progressive with lo ss of ambulation by age 12.5  Historically patients died 
from respiratory complications.  Now, a variety of factors protect the respiratory  system related 
to improved supportive equipment, antibiotics, vaccines, and other ancillary methods.6  
Prolonging life unmasks decline in cardiac function with complications of dilated 
cardiomyopathy.  This poses further clinical challenges and a need for recognition and medical 
intervention that did not previously exist.  Non- progressive cognitive dysfunction might be 
present in DMD and BMD.  
 
Disease Pathogenesis  
More than 20 years ago the DMD gene was cloned defining the molecular basis of the disease.7  
The identification of the dystrophin as the deficient protein followed closely on the heels of this 
discovery.8  Dystrophin is a 427kDa cytoskeletal protein required for muscle fiber stability.  Loss 
of this protein results in susceptibility to repeated cycles of necrosis and regeneration with 
satellite cell depletion, diminished regenerative capacity of the muscle, ending in fat and 
connective tissue replacement (fibrosis). The mutation spectrum within the DMD gene reveals 
that deletions of one or more exons are found in ~65% of cases clustered in two hotspot regions.9  
Originally multiplex PCR kits were developed that were able to detect 95% -98% of all 
deletions10, 11.  Detection of duplications, representing about 6% of the DMD mutations, initially 
required Southern blots to detect.  Overtime the demand for more rapid, less expensive detection 
methods have encouraged the introduction of additional tools to identify the full spectrum of 
mutations (deletions, duplications, splice -site and point mutations).  Multiplex lig ation -
dependent probe amplification (MLPA)12 or multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization 
(MAPH)13 will screen all exons providing detection of most deletions and duplications.  If 
MLPA or MAPH are negative, the gene should be scanned for subexonic  rearrangements or 
point mutations using DNA sequence analysis.14  This has become more than an academic

endpoints that help establish if patients are candidates for molecular therapies . 
 
Treatment for DMD  
Despite virtually hundreds of clinical trials in DMD, only one treatme nt has consistently 
demonstrated efficacy.  Unequivocal evidence for glucocorticoid -induced improvement was 
established through a double -blind, randomized controlled trial in a large cohort of subjects 
(n=103).15 Patients received 0.75 mg /kg/day  or 1.5 mg/kg/day versus placebo.  At six months 
there was approximately equal efficacy for the high and low dose prednisone groups compared to 
placebo in muscle strength (manual muscle testing score), the time needed to rise from supine to 
a standing (prednisone 3.4 vs. placebo 6.2 seconds), to walk 9 m (prednison e 7.0 vs. placebo 9.7 
seconds), to climb four stairs (prednisone 4.0 vs. placebo 7.1 seconds), and in forced vital 
capacity (prednisone 1.7 vs. placebo 1.5 liters) (P<0.001 for all comparisons).  Similar results 
were later reported with deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/day), an alternative, sodium -sparing 
corticosteroid that was also shown to prolong ambulation (untreated DMD patients stopped 
walking at 9.8 +  1.8 years compared to deflazacort -treated at 12.3 +  2.7 years, P<.005).16  A 
dose-related effect was observed in two follow up studies that de monstrated lesser but similar 
benefits using prednisone 0.30 and 0.35 mg/kg/day17, 18  A weekend dosing regimen (10 
mg/kg/wk: half on Saturday and half on Sunday) showed equal efficacy to daily steroids.19  
Additional follow up studies r eported that the number of boys having scoliosis surgery in treated 
groups was significantly less than untreated boys (P < 0.05);20, 21 and treatment extended 
independent ambulation by 3.3 years compared to unt reated (9.2 +1.48 years vs. 12.5+  3.02 ( p < 
0.0001).21  
The side -effect profile of glucocorticoids consistently demonstrates weight gain with a 
cushingoid appearance.  DMD boys on steroids are also at risk for hypertension,  cataract 
formation, loss of bone density, vertebral compression fractures, and long bone fractures.  Long-
term administration may be limited in some cases by steroid -induced behavioral problems 
frequently obse rved with this class of drugs.  
Molecular therapies provide a promising alternative to glucocorticoids.  In addition to direct gene 
replacement, three molecular pharmacologic approaches have demonstrated promising findings 
representing current research aspirations.  These incl ude exon skipping, readthrough of stop 
codon mutations, and replacement of dystrophin using utrophin, a dystrophin- like cytoskeletal 
protein.  The presence of revertants fibers encouraged scientists to develop a pharmacologic path 
to reproduce and expand t his spontaneous natural achievement in order to generate dystrophin 
expression levels that would result in clinically meaningful outcomes.  
Exon skipping is well underway in clinical trials but is still early in demonstration of efficacy. 
Limitations inclu de development of products related to specific exons.  The target of exon 
skipping is at the pre -mRNA level allowing one or more exons to be omitted to restore the 
dystrophin reading frame.  This is accomplished with splice -switching oligomers, typically 2 0-30 
nucleotides in length and complementary in sequence to regions of the pre -mRNA transcript.  
Pre-clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in the mdx mouse, dystrophin/utrophin knock- out

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 mouse, and CXMD dog22-24 using both 2’O -methyl- ribooligonucleoside -phoshophorothioate 
(2OMe) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs).  Two proof -of-principle 
clinical trials in DMD used a 2OMe oligomer (PRO051, ProsensaTherapeutics) or a PMO 
(Sarepta Therapeutics) deli vered directly to muscle targeting exon 51.25, 26  Evidence favoring 
exon skipping was validated b y RT -PCR and a newly synthesized dystrophin protein correctly 
localized to the sarcolemma.  Phase I/II extension studies were performed with both oligomers 
following systemic delivery.  In the PRO051 tria l, four doses were tested in the initial 5 week 
phase (0.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mg/kg) prior to an open- label 12 -week extension phase.27  Dose -
related efficacy was achieved with evidence of new dystrophin expression in approximately 60 -
100% of muscle fibers in 10 of 12 patients and modest improvement in the 6- minute walk test.  
In the AVI phase  II open -label study with AVI -4658 (Eteplirsen®) conducted in the UK, 7 of 19 
patients saw a modest response with a mean increase of sarcolemmal dystrophin from 8.9% to 
16.4%.28  The results were variable with one patient responding following treatment with 2 
mg/kg, while all other responders received the higher dosing levels of 10 and 20 mg/kg .  The 
PMO has now been tested in a phase I/II randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple 
dose efficacy trial at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA to assess 30 and 50 
mg/kg dosing over 24 weeks ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ).  At t he 24- week time point, 
dystrophin was increased and there was stability in the distance walked on the 6MWT.  This was 
followed by an open label extension study with all data reported at the 1 year time point showing 
increase dystrophin and stability in the  6MWT (Mendell et al Ann Neurol 2013;74:637- 47).  
A second molecular approach involves suppression of stop codon mutations of the DMD gene 
that comprise approximately 15% of DMD cases.  Two pharmacologic tactics have shown pre -
clinical efficacy.  In mdx mice, mutation suppression was shown with the aminoglycoside 
antibiotic, gentamicin.29  In a follow up clinical study, treatment of four DMD/BMD subjects 
failed to show a benefit.30  A subsequent clinical trial, also in a small cohort, challenged the 
finding s suggesting that readthrough had occurred, demonstrating full -length dystrophin as the 
product of gentamicin treatment.31  In a more definitive trial, done by Dr. Mendell at Nationwide 
Children’s Hospital, DMD patients (n = 16) with stop codons, treated weekly or twice weekly for 
six months (7.5 mg kg IV), showed a signific ant increase in dystrophin levels with the highest 
levels reaching 13 and 15% of normal.32  Muscle strength was stabilized and a modest increase 
in forced vital capacity was achieved.  Although this study demonstrates the therapeutic potential 
of gentamicin, higher doses might be necessary to impr ove functional outcomes.  The known 
renal toxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics and the inconvenience of intravenous administration 
pushed the field in the direction of identi fying an orally administered agent.  
Ataluren, formerly referred to as PTC124 (P TC therapeutics), fulfilled the requirement of an 
orally administered pharmacologic readthrough agent for stop codon mutations.33  Pre-clinical 
studies in the mdx  mouse demonstrated dystrophin expression in skeletal, cardiac, and diaphragm 
muscle and protected skeletal muscle from eccentric contraction -induced injury.  A phase I study 
in healthy volunteers est ablished safety and tolerability at doses exceeding what was required for 
pre-clinical efficacy.34  In a phase IIa  proof -of-concept 28 -day study in DMD/BMD patients, 
dystrophin appeared to increase post treatment.  A randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled 
phase IIb trial followed, evaluating safety and efficacy over a 48 week treatment period.  PTC, 
Inc. released preliminary results indicating a very strong safety profile; however, the primary 
endpoint of the 6 minute walk test did not reach statistical significance

10 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show /[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ].  Continued subgroup analysis to look at 
efficacy is underway.  Influence for further pursuit of treatment in DMD may come from on-
going clinical trials in cystic fibrosis35 and 
hemophilia[[ http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ], presuming results are 
favorable.  Upregulation of utrophin is another therapeutic strategy for DMD that has shown 
promise in the mdx mouse.  Utrophin shares 80% sequence homology with dystrophin and h as 
been shown to partially restore function as a dystrophin surrogate in pre -clinical transgenic mice 
36 and gene replacement studies.37  In normal muscle utrophin expression is limited to the 
neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions but in mdx mice and DMD patient s it is 
overexpressed throughout t he sarcolemma of all muscle fibers, putatively compensating for the 
absence of dystrophin.  Upregulation of utrophin holds a particular advantage because of the 
unlikely occurrence of an immune response as seen following mini -dystrophin gene 
replacement.1  
Several small molecules demonstrate upregulation of the utrophin gene through the utrophin- A 
promoter.  SMT C1100 is a novel small molecule that was identified t hrough an exhaustive high-
throughput small molecule screen.  When used in the mdx mouse, utrophin staining is increased 
at the sarcolemma and dystrophic muscle pathology is reversed.38  Summit PLC, a UK 
biotechnology company, has advocated for its use in DMD clinical trials. A similar small 
molecule transcriptionally upregulating utr ophin, BMN195 (Biomarin Pharmaceuticals), was 
tried in a phase I safety trial in healthy volunteers but disappointingly failed to achieve adequate 
concentrations in the blood.  The non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drug nabumetone39 (also 
known as Relafen®) was shown to upregulate endogenous utrophin mRNA and protein in 
C2C12 cells.39  It remains a candidate agent considering its current use in the treatment of 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, although its side effect profile as an NSAID with warnings 
regarding life -threatening heart or circulation problems, including he art attack or str oke may be a 
limiting factor as a life- long therapy.  
Heregulin represents an additional molecule capable of transactivating the utrophin- A promoter.  
When delivered to the mdx mouse for 3 months by intraperitoneal injections of a small pe ptide 
encoding the epidermal growth factor -like region of heregulin ectodomain, utrophin was 
upregulated, accompanied by increased resistance to eccentric contraction, and a reduction of 
muscle pathology.40  The amelioration of dystrophic phenotype by hereg ulin-mediated utrophin 
up-regulation offers a pharmacological therapeutic modality that deserves consideration in future 
planning to alleviate DMD.  
Another approach to upregulate utrophin employs a recombinant biglycan (rhBGN) that can be 
delivered system ically in the mdx mouse and ameliorate pathology and improve function at the 
diaphragm.41  There is clear evidence that biglycan can recruit utrophin to the sarcolemma.  
rhBGN has shown  promise when use d in cell culture and in vivo without changing mRNA levels 
of utrophin indicating that functional benefits arise from posttranscriptional effects.  rhBGN is 
being evaluated for clinical trials in DMD.

Rationale for Follistatin (FS344) Gene Therapy  
The planned approach for gene therapy for DMD is an extension of our current follistatin (FS) 
gene therapy trial in BMD where we have found that gene transfer to the quadriceps muscles 
bilaterally improved the distance walked on the 6 minute walk test in 4 of 6 patients.  The results 
were robust in 2 patients with improvement over 100 meters at 1 year and 58 m and 30 m in two 
other patients. We believe that these results are also favorable for treating DMD patients and we 
presented these findings to the FDA along with our safety data as an amendment to our IND

The paper describing the treatment of Becker patients has just been published in Molecular 
Therapy:  Mendell, JR, et al. A Phase I/IIa Follistatin Gene Therapy Trial for Becker Muscular 
Dystrophy , available on -line October 2014.  
Myostatin is a transforming growth factor -beta family member that normally acts to limit 
skeletal muscle growth.  Mice genetically engineered to lack myostatin have about twice the 
amount of muscle mass, and similar effect s are seen in cattle, sheep, dogs, and human.  42-45  FS is 
a potent myostatin antagonist with the added advantage of controlling muscle mass through 
pathways independent of the myostatin signaling casca de. 42  Myostatin null mice carrying a 
follistatin transgene demonstrate four times the muscle mass of wild -type.  There are two 
isoforms of follistatin generated by alternative splicing and initially tra nslated to isoforms FS317 
and FS344. 46  Post translational modification of each cleaves a 29 amino acid signal peptide 
giving rise to  FS288 and FS315.  FS288 functions collaboratively in reproductive phy siology 
with activin and inhibins of the hypothalamic pituitary -gonadal axis . 47  FS315 more  reliably 
targets skeletal muscle, has no known cardiotoxicity or other adverse effects and is ideal for gene 
delivery to muscle. AAV1.CMV.FS344 delivered by direct intramuscular inj ection to quadriceps 
and tibialis anterior muscles of the mdx mouse increased muscle mass and strength throughout 
the lower extremities with a demonstrable remote effect on these same parameters in the upper 
limbs and increased muscle mass in the paraspina l muscles . 48  This we attributed to the muscle 
acting as a secretory site for follistatin with the circulating isoform reaching remote sites 49  
AAV1.CMV.FS344 was further tested in the non -human primate to explore a paradigm  
applicable to clinical trial.  In the cynomolgus macaque we injected AAV1.FS344 directly into 
the quadriceps muscle resulting in an increase in size and strength of this  muscle.  50  It should be 
noted that when we injected the non- human prima te in one muscle (as opposed to multiple 
muscles in the mouse) we did not see remote effect s.  These pre -clinical studies in the absence of 
toxicity enabled a Phase I/IIa  clinical trial in patients with BMD (IND 14845).  The BMD 
clinical results are the first ever gene therapy to muscle showing a functional benefit (increase 
distance walked on t he 6MWT).  We are now ready to move ahead to treat boys with DMD.

• Subjects will be instructed to perform strengthening /endurance  exercises  at home 3 times 
per week, and asked to report the frequency of exercise. They will be incentivized 
through a video game and it will be emphasized tha t this should be relatively mild effort.  
The subjects will be incentivized to complete the exercise program  by offering them $10 
per week for completion of log showing that exercise has been done.   
* Study participants will continue  prednisone post gene t ransfer as part of the standard 
management of DMD boys.  Glucocorticoids are considered standard of care for DMD and most 
boys will be on a steroid regimen at the time they are recruited.  
6.3 PROTOCOL FOR GENE TRANSFER  
I. Injection preparation  
Preparation of the rAAV1.CMV.huFS344 will be in the investigational drug service based on the 
drug order from and follow ing pharmacy standard protocol.  The vector shall be diluted and 
manipulated in polypropylene syringes only.   Polystyrene and polycarbonate material s 
should never come in contact with the vector.  
Prior to transportation to the clinical setting appropriate dilutions of the test article will be 
completed by the pharmacy.  The dose will be diluted in normal saline, divided in 9 ml per leg 
with 0.5 ml delivered per site on each leg .  Documentation of the dilution will be completed by 
the pharmacy following standard pharmacy protocol. The formulated syringes will be maintained 
refrigerated at 2 -8C until transport to the patient procedure room where it wi ll be delivered on 
wet ice in the appro priately labeled cooler.   
 
The final volum e delivered to the PI will be 18 m l total volume distributed in 18  polypropylene 
syringes of 1 ml each, nine syringes being delivered to the right leg and nine  to the left leg .  The 
vector -containing syringe will be delivered to the designated procedure room at Nationwide 
Children’s Hospital.  It will be delivered on wet ice (not frozen) and administered to the subject 
within 8 hours of of thaw . Handling of rAAV1.CMV. huFS344 will follow compliance standards

(http://www4.od.nih.gov/oba/RAC/guidelines_02/APPENDIX_G.htm#_Toc7246561 )  
 
II. Vector Administration P rotocol  
Conscious sedation will be given to all DMD participants  by an anesthesiologist who will be 
with patient at the time of injection .  In addition, the skin over the gene transfer site will be pre -
treated with a lidocaine/prilocaine eutectic mixture incorporated in a cream base (EMLA cream) 
or a cellulose disk (EMLA patch).  Comparable  cream -based anesthesia such as xylocaine cream 
might be used.  Procedures will be performed under sterile conditions.  The injection site will be 
cleansed with three successive applications of non -iodine containing surgical prep swabs and 
draped with disposable sterile drapes.  A standard clinic al Doppler ultrasound will be used with a 
sterile sheath around the transducer to maintain asepsis of the injection field.  This will increase 
the precision of gene transfer to be sure that we inject muscle and not connective tissue or fat.   
The total dos e of vector per extremity, 1.2 X 1012 vg/kg will be distributed between the targeted 
muscles that include gluteals, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior.  The initial sites of injection, at 
least three injections per muscle, will be targeted based on MRI show ing preserved muscle.  The 
sites will be confirmed at the time of injection by ultrasound guidance for the needle injections.  
The procedure should take approximately 30 minutes to inject muscles of both extremities.  
 
6.4 POST GENE TRANSFER M ONITORING   
6.4.1 IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWIN G GENE TRANSFER  
Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature will be 
performed post -administration.  Concomitant medications and all adverse events/serious adverse 
events will also be monitored  and documented following injection.  Patients will be discharged 
the day after gene therapy (if no side effects are observed).  
 
6.4.2 FOLLOW UP   
Subjects will return for follow up visits on days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, 90,180, and 9, 12, 18, and 24 
months post -gene transfer .  Toxicity monitoring on each of these dates (including day 1 post -
gene transfer) are described in the following sections of the protocol.  
We will follow the most recent FDA guidelines  with regard to long -term patient follow up 
following  gene transfer.  Our proposed vector has a very low probability of gene transfer -related 
delayed adverse events.  We will, however, evaluate short -term safety over a two -year period 
that incorporates the active phase of the protocol (see assessment of endp oints below). If newly

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 B. Efficacy Monitoring  
 
I. Primary Outcome  
Safety is a primary outcome for thi s clinical gene transfer trial.  
II. Secondary Outcomes:  
• The distance walked on the 6MWT is the primary functional outcome to be evaluated. 
Time to walk and run, strength test, functional test, and reaching ability  will be included 
in PT testing .  Functional testing will be performed at baseline and at days 30, 60, 
90,180, and 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post -gene transfer.  
• Life quality questionnaire will be completed at baseline and 6, 12, 18 and 24 months 
post-gene tr ansfer.  
• In order to maximize potential benefit of follistatin gene therapy, subject will be 
instructed to continue strengthening exercise at home at least 3 times per week as 
instructed by physical therapists (PT) , and asked to report the frequency of exercise.  
The subjects who follow the exercise instruction will be incentivized  by video display 
and offered $10 per week if they fill out their log showing bike riding complete .   
• MRI studies of leg muscles will be done pre and post gene transfer (6, 12 and 24 
months) to study muscle size, fibrosis and fat content.   
• EIM measurement will quantify the pathological status of muscles.  
• Muscle biopsies on quadriceps muscles (a muscle bi opsy on one leg at baseline 
screening visit and the post gene transfer biopsy on the opposite leg at day 180), will 
include general histological evaluation. Assessment will consist of morphometric 
analyses for  quantification of fiber size, fibrosis, infla mmatory process, satellite cells 
and regeneration. Muscle tissue obtained at biopsy will also be assessed for viral DNA 
(qPCR),  and follistatin transgene expression  
6.6 STATISTICAL ANALYSI S 
This is a phase I/IIA trial, with safety as the primary measure. For each measure based on 
differences between pre-  and post -gene transfer examinations (clinical) analyses will be based on 
a paired t test, with a p value of < 0.05 indicating significance.

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 7.0 TEST MATERIAL AN D ADMINISTRATION  
7.1 DESCRIPTION OF B IOLOGICAL PRODUCT  
The biological drug product is a non- replicating, adeno- associated virus termed 
rAAV1.CMV.huFS344. The product will follow the IND  14845 CMC section, identical to what 
has been produced for the BMD study that is now completed. The product wi ll be produced at 
the Clinical Manufacturing Facility (CMF) at Nationwide Children’s Hospital according to 
current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).  The manufacturing process includes procedures 
to ensure the safety, identity, quality, purity and stren gth of the manufactured biologic.  The 
HEK 293 cell bank used in the production of the product will meet specifications for product 
release as detailed in FDA and ICH guidelines.  The production process is governed by over 90 
standard operating procedures (SOP), Master Batch Records, Methods and registered Forms.  
The vector will be formulated in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM MgCl 2 and 200 mM NaCl 
containing 0.001% pluronic F68.  The vector will be supplied as a frozen solution that is thawed 
before clinical administration.   
 
7.1.1 PRODUCT DEFINI TION  
 
Product Name:  rAAV1.CMV.huFS344  
Gene Insert:  Human cDNA for FS344 (alternatively spliced follistatin)  
Control Elements:  CMV promoter  
AAV Serotype:  Serotype AAV1  
 
7.2 DOSE SELECTION  
The dose is based on our BMD gene therapy trial using the same vector.  In that study we used 
two doses without safety concerns.  No dose limiting toxicity was found.  For the low dose 
rAAV1.CMV.huFS344 trial (n=3) we injected 12 sites in each ex tremity (quadriceps only).  The 
total dose per patient was 6 X 1011 vg/kg (3e11 vg/kg/quadriceps) and the high dose was 1.2 X 
1012 vg/kg per patient (6e11vg/kg/quadriceps).  There did not seem to be a significant dose 
response effect. In the low dose cohort patients improved in the distance walked in the 6MWT as 
follows: 58m, 125m, and 9 m.  In the high dose cohort, patients improved in the 6MWT by 108m 
and 29m.  One patient in the high dose group did not improve.  Based on our toxicology studies 
prepared for IND 14845 that included a high dose cohort in C57Bl mice at 2.0 x 1013 vg/kg 
without any organ system toxicity and the clinical  trial done at 1.2 X 1012 vg/kg, we are 
proposing that all six DMD boys receive 2.4 X 1012 vg/kg per patient.

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015  
7.3 DOSE LIMITING TOXICI TY  
In reporting adverse events we will follow the final regulations issued by the Food and Drug 
Administration address ing the safety reporting requirements for investigational new drug 
applications (INDs) found in 21 CFR part 312 and for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
found in 21 CFR part 320. “Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies”. 
The classification for adverse events to be used is the following:  
1  Mild adverse event; did not require treatment  
2  Moderate adverse event; resolved with treatment  
3  Severe adverse event; inability to carry on normal activities; required professional 
 medical attention  
4  Life-threatening or permanently disabling adverse event  
5  Fatal adverse event In this grading system, “severe” is not equivalent to seriousness.  
 
The definitions to be employed will follow the final regulations issued by the FDA in September 
2010 “Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies. 
 
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT)  is defined as any adverse event that is possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the study agent.  This would include any grade 3 according to the 
classification given above.  Study enrollment will be halted by the investigators when any 
subject experiences a Grade 3, or higher adverse event toxicity that is possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the study drug.  
Laboratory tests with values with in the clinically significant range will be repeated during the 
same visit whenever possible.  If the test result returns after the subject leaves the clinic, they 
will be immediately contacted.  For local residents they will be asked to return to the outpatient 
clinic for a repeat test.  For non- local residents, arrangements will be made to have the blood test 
redrawn in a laboratory close to home or by their primary care physician.  To avoid any 
confusion for the primary care physician, they will be infor med (with permission from the 
subject) of their participation in the study at the time of gene transfer.  If the AE requires 
treatment, this will be carried out by the primary care physician or a doctor of choice selected by 
the subject.  We will obtain co pies of repeat laboratory tests and any relevant medical records 
that will be added to the subject’s research chart.  
Only those adverse events requiring treatment will qualify as DLT.  The PI will fulfill the 
reporting responsibilities under 21 CFR 312.32(c), to notify FDA in an IND safety report of 
potentially serious risks, as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the

7.4 STOPPING AND DISCONTI NUATION RULES  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established by the sponsoring 
agency including a safety monitor for the study.  Safety data will be monitored on a continual 
basis throughout the trial.  The DSMB can recommend early termination of the trial for reasons 
of safety.  Study enrollment will be halted by the investigators when any subject experiences a 
Grade 3, or higher adverse event toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the 
study drug.  Thi s will include:  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4 Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.

If after review by the DSMB, IRB, IBCSC, NIH -OBA and FDA, the decision is made to 
continue  according to  this study protocol . 
 
7.5 CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS AND THERAPIES  
Prescribed and over the counter medications used in the prior two weeks will be recorded at the 
baseline visit and changes in these medications will be recorded during each subsequent follow 
up visits.  The PI will enc ourage participants to maintain the medication and supplements they 
are on at enrollment through the course of the study.  Subjects on aspirin or drugs that could 
affect coagulation will continue their medication as indicated.  Several investigations show that 
preoperative aspirin ingestion and intravenous heparin therapy can be administered safely 
without concerns about the risk of postoperative bleeding and should not lead to modification or 
cessation of such therapy.51-53 Subjects must already be on prednisone for three months at time of 
enrollment as part of the inclusion criteria.  
8.0 ADVERSE EVENT MO NITORING AND REPORTI NG 
8.1 DEFINITION OF AN  ADVERSE EVENT  
As stated above  this protocol will follow the final regulations issued by the Food and Drug 
Administration addressing the safety reporting requirements for investigational  new drug 
applications (INDs) found in 21 CFR part 312 and for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
found in 21 CFR part 320. “ Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies”.  
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/U
CM227351.pdf  
Adverse Events will be collected throughout the study from enrollment to last follow up visit.  
Adverse Event (AE):  Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Adverse events will be graded by the investigator accordingly:  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL*.

25 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4 Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
A Semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the descript ion of the grade.  
A single dash ( -) indicates a grade is not available.  
 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the  
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self care ADL refer to bath ing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. 
Association or relatedness to the study agent, study procedures and the subject's pre -existing 
disease will be graded as follows: 5 = unrelated, 4 = unlike ly, 3 = possibly, 2 = probably, and 1 = 
definitely related.  
Adverse reaction: An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that 
the dr ug caused the event.  
Suspected adverse reaction (21 CFR 312.32(a)) Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse 
event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the 
purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies 
a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event 
caused by a drug. 
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, o r require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such m edical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at

26 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
To reiterate, an SAE is an event in categories graded 3, 4, and 5.   
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4 Life- threatening  consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
Life-threatening (21 CFR 312.32(a)) An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurr ence 
places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected 
adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
The PI will fulfill the reporting responsibilities to FDA/ OBA on b ehalf of Nationwide 
Children’s Hospital using the web- based Adverse Event reporting system (GeMCRIS).  
  
8.2 OBLIGATIONS OF THE I NVESTIGATOR  
The Principal Investigator will submit an electronic report to NIH Office of Biotechnology 
Activities (NIH OBA) thr ough the GeMCRIS web- based reporting system on any serious 
adverse event that is both unexpected and associated with the use of the gene transfer product 
(i.e., there is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the use of the 
product; the investigator will not await definitive proof of association before reporting such 
events); as well as a written report on any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a 
significant risk for human research participants including reports of  mutagenicity, teratogenicity, 
or carcinogenicity.  The report will be clearly labeled as a “Safety Report” and will be submitted 
to the FDA, NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (NIH OBA) and to the local Institutional 
Biosafety Committee within the timeframes set forth in section Safety Reporting.  
 
The Principal Investigators will adhere to any other serious adverse event reporting requirements 
in accordance with federal regulations, state laws, and the local institutional policies and 
procedures, as applicable.  The Principal Investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the 
reporting requirements are fulfilled and will be held accountable for any reporting lapses.  
 
8.3 SAFETY REPORTING 
The investigator or his designee will report all serious and unexpected adverse events to the IRB, 
IBCSC, CBER, FDA, OBA, NIH, and DSMB according to regulatory requirements described as 
Center for Gene Therapy   Mendell, Jerry R.  
Phase I/IIa Clinical intramuscular gene transfer of rAAV1.CMV.huFollistatin344 trial to patients with DMD  
27 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 follows: All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be 
reported to the DSMB within 48 hours  of not ification, regardless of relatedness to the clinical 
trial.   
Any serious adverse event that is fatal or life -threatening, that is unexpected, and associated with 
the use of the gene transfer product will be reported to the FDA as soon as possible, but not  later 
than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  Serious adverse events 
that are unexpected and associated with the use of the gene transfer product, but are not fatal or 
life-threatening, will be reported to the FDA as soon as possible, but not later than 15 calendar 
days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.   Changes in this schedule will be 
permitted only where, under the FDA IND regulations [21 CFR 312(c) (3)], changes in this 
reporting schedule hav e been approved by the FDA and are reflected in the protocol. 
Follow up  
Relevant additional clinical and laboratory data will become available following the initial 
serious adverse event report.  Relevant follow -up information to an IND safety report will be 
submitted concurrently to the FDA/NIH OBA/IRB/ DSMB  as soon as the information is 
available and will be identified as such, i.e., "Follow -up IND Safety Report.”    If a serious 
adverse event occurs after the end of a clinical trial and is determined to be associated with the 
use of the gene transfer product, that event wil l be reported concurrently to the FDA/NIH 
OBA/IRB/ DSMB within 15 calendar  days of the determination. 
Should a serious adverse event deemed possibly, probably or definitely related to the study agent 
occur during administration, the study agent will be dis continued, appropriate treatment will be 
given under medical supervision and the subject will be examined as frequently as necessary 
thereafter until symptoms cease or stabilize.  
 
8.3.1 SAFETY REPORTING: CONTENT AND FORMAT  
 
The serious adverse event report  will include, but need not be limited to: (1) the date of the 
event; (2) designation of the report as an initial report or a follow -up report, identification of all 
safety reports previously filed for the clinical protocol concerning a similar adverse eve nt, and an 
analysis of the significance of the adverse event in light of previous similar reports; (3) clinical 
site; (4) the Principal Investigator; (5) NIH OBA protocol number; (6) FDA’s Investigational 
New Drug (IND) application number; (7) vector type , e.g., adeno- associated virus; (8) vector 
subtype, if relevant; (9) gene delivery method, e.g., in vivo  transduction; (10) route of 
administration, e.g., intramuscular; (11) dosing schedule; (12) a complete description of the 
event; (13) relevant clinical  observations; (14) relevant clinical history; (15) relevant tests that 
were or are planned to be conducted; (16) date of any treatment of the event; and (17) the 
suspected cause of the event.  These items will be reported electronically through the GeMCRI S 
reporting system ( E-mail address for Reporting Adverse Events: GeMCRIS@od.nih.gov  ) by 
using the recommended Adverse Event Reporting Template available on NIH OBA’s web site

8.4 UNEXPECTED ADVERSE E VENTS  
Unexpected adverse events are those which are not previously reported with recombinant AAV 
vectors, commonly not seen in association with the subject's underlying disease or with the 
procedures to be used in this study, or are related to a known toxicity but differ because of 
greater severity or specificity.  
8.5 FOLLOW UP OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
All adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization.   
9.0 LONG -TERM FOLLOW UP  
We will follow the most recent FDA guidance with regard to long -term patient follow up 
following gene transfer.  As indicated by the guidelines, our proposed vector has a very low 
probability of gene transfer -related delayed adverse events.  If n ewly identified risks are 
associated with our product, or if the subjects suffer any adverse events during this period, we 
will initiate a long -term follow -up according to the FDA guidelines.  We will, of course, notify 
CBER if there is any indication of need to extend follow -up period.  All subjects will be 
provided with written instructions on how to contact the Principal Investigator or study 
coordinator if they experience any serious adverse event that they consider possibly related to 
study treatment o r study participation.  This information will also be included in the Informed 
Consent document.  All subjects will be instructed to notify the Principal Investigator of a 
change of address or contact information.  
The final results of the clinical trial will be shared with the participants at the completion of the 
study when all data has been collected and analyzed. However, if significant findings become 
available that might increase the risk of the subjects or might affect their decision to remain in 
the study, then information will be made available as soon as it is available.  
At the time of death, no matter what the cause, permission for an autopsy will be requested of 
their families.  Subjects will be asked to advise their families of this request and of its scientific 
and medical importance.  
9.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING WITH PRIMARY CAR E PHYSICIAN  
Close communication will be established with the primary care physician of all study 
participants and will be maintained throughout the study. The important hallmarks of the study 
along with the proposed reporting plan will be explained.  We will request t hat the primary care 
physician provide information regarding non- routine visits during the two years following gene 
transfer.  If non -routine visits are reported to us by the primary care physician, the study

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 investigator will initiate an investigation to determine the possibility of an adverse event related 
to the gene transfer and will adhere to the adverse event reporting requirements in accordance 
with federal regulations, state laws, and the local institutional policies and procedures, as 
applicable.  
During the consent process, the study investigator will emphasize the importance of subject 
communication with our study team.  Any non -routine doctor’s visits or medical care received 
during the two years following gene transfer should be reported to the s tudy team.  The study 
doctor will explain to the participant that copies of any relevant medical records of those visits 
will be requested from their medical care provider.  
10.0 STUDY REPORTS  
10.1 FINAL STUDY REPORT  
The final study report will include data  through the final study visit but will not include long -
term follow -up information.   
10.2 ANNUAL STUDY REPORTS

information from controlled trials, and information about bioavailability.  
(c) A copy of the updated clinical protocol including a technical and non- technical abstract.  
11.0 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
The proposed study  will involve a total of 6 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) subjects.  
All subjects with this condition that are enrolled must have muscle weakness by clinical exam.  
DMD is established on the basis of c onfirmed DMD gene mutations .  Subject selection will not 
exclude anyone on the basis of race or ethnic background.  For complete details see the Inclusion 
and Exclusion Criteria Section. 
11.1 SOURCES OF MATERIAL  
Research material obtained from identifiable living human subjects includes reports of: history  
and physical assessments, blood, urine, chest X -ray, ECHO, EKG, EIM, pulmonary function 
tests, and MRI, clinical assessments and admission/ discharge summaries for hospitalization 
occurring while the subject is on study, adverse events, and autopsies.  Copies of case report 
forms, original test results, subject medical records, signed subject informed consent, 
correspondence, and any other documents of the subjects, relevant to the conduct of the study 
will be kept on file by the Principal Investigator.  A ll material or data collected as part of the 
study will be obtained specifically for research purposes.  
11.2 POTENTIAL RISKS  
Potential risks to study subjects include risks associated with administration of the study agent 
and with study procedures. 
 
11.2 .1 RISKS ASSOCIATED WIT H rAAV.CMV. HUFS344 GENE TRANSFER  
There is a very small chance that the study agent could damage the DNA in the cells of the 
subject's muscle.  In the unlikely event that this occurred, it could put the subject at risk for 
developing cancer in the future.  In animal studies to date, we have not seen the development of 
cancer.  In addition, we and others have shown that the majority of vector DNA appears to 
persist as episomal rather than integrated DNA, which makes it very unlikely tha t mutagenesis 
will occur.54-56  In summary, our data  suggest that AAV genomes persist in mouse muscle as 
transcriptionally active large and small concatameric episomes and when considering potential 
and theoretical integration events, AAV vectors appear to possess a  similar risk profile as 
plasmid DNA injec ted into muscle.55  The majority of v ector DNA appears to persist as episomal 
rather than integrated DNA, which makes it very unlikely that mutagenesis will occur. 54 
Therefore, we think the chance that cancer would develop is very small.  
Liver tumors were reported in one study performed in new born mice at another center with a 
different rAAV vector.  There is no evidence to indicate that these tumors were caused by

31 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 vector -induced DNA damage based on the number of AAV genomes per cell in tumor samples. 
57, 58  Also, other larger scale studies in newborn and adult mice have not shown this effect. 59  It 
remains difficult to ascertain the true risk of neoplasia, although it seems very small.  
Subjects may also develop immune response to AAV1.  This could lead to immune rejection of 
virus pre cluding gene expressi on.  We will measure both binding antibodies and T cell responses 
to the AAV capsid following gene transfer.  
 
11.2.2 RISKS ASSOCIATED WIT H PROCEDURES  
11.2 .2.1 BLOOD DRAWS  
The risks of venous blood draws include discomfort at the site of puncture; possible bruising and 
swelling around the puncture site; rarely an infection; and, uncommonly, fainting, nausea, 
vomiting, and light -headedness from the procedure.  
 
11.2.2.2 GENE TRANSFER TO MUS CLES  
In this trial, patients will receive at leas t 18 injections per extremity.  This will be done under 
sterile conditions by the PI accompanied by the ultrasonographer.  Both will be gowned and 
gloved.  Patients will also receive conscious sedation that will be directed by the anesthesiologist 
at Natio nwide Children’ s Hospital. There is a low risk of complications that could include 
hypotension, respiratory compromise, and complications from low blood pressure such as stroke 
or myocardial infarction.  These would be rare and unlikely complications of the procedure.  
11.2.2.3 MUSCLE BIOP SY 
The muscle biopsy has potential complications from procedure that include i nfection at the biopsy site, 
bleeding and/or pain at the site of the biopsy, and psychological trauma from the scar at the site of the 
incision;  in some cases because of keloid formation this can be quite large.   
11.2.2.4 STEROIDS   
The possible side effects of prednisolone or Deflazacort (steroid s) include acne, increased hair growth, 
thinning of the skin, glaucoma, roundness of the face, changes in behavior, disturbance of sleep, and 
increase of blood glucose level.

32 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 Volunteer s ubjects will be recruited from the Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus -MDA 
Clinic or self -referred in response to advertisement.  This protocol will also be listed in the 
Clinical Trials Data Bank of the NIH.  Potential study subjects who demonstrate an interest in 
participating in the study will receive a copy of the informed consent form to review and an 
explanation of the nature, duration, and purpose of the study and possible consequences of the 
study from one of the investigators in a language the y can understand.  They will be informed 
that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without jeopardizing their 
future treatment.  They will be asked to follow -up with necessary safety evaluations if they have 
received study agent prior to their desire to withdraw.  They will be given full information 
regarding potential side effects of rAAV1 and follistatin gene.  Subsequently, an investigator will 
request the subject's permission to participate in the study.  Volunteer participant s who sign the 
study specific subject informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Nationwide Children’s Hospital will be screened for eligibility to participate in the gene transfer 
study.  
11.3 .2 MINIMIZATION OF P OTENTIAL RISK  
Participants will be provided with contact numbers for any questions or concerns arising 
regarding the possible effects of the administration of rAAV 1.CMV.hu FS344.  Results of all 
laboratory and safety exams regarding subject enrollment and following gene transfer will be 
reviewed with the subject.  S ince the effects on the reproductive system are not fully established 
and the possible concerns with viral shedding, subjects with reproductive capacity must be 
willing to refrain from sexual intercourse  or use effective contraception for the active phase of 
the study until two negative sperm samples are obtained post gene transfer (males).  
Some of the vector can be excreted from the body for a least a week after injection.  This 
shedding of vector can be found in the blood, urine, saliva, and stool for up to a week following 
injection.  For a period of two weeks after gene injection, people who may come into contact 
with participants’ bodily fluids and waste must regularly wash their hands with soap and those 
who will have direct contact with their bodily fluids and waste must were protective gloves.  
 
11.3 .3 CONFIDENTIALITY  
Access to the database will be limited to th e key research personnel to ensure confidentiality.  
Case report forms, informed consent forms, laboratory study reports, and demographic profiles 
will be kept locked in a secure record storage and archiving under the responsibility of research 
staff.  The  subjects will be informed of what information is stored and of the secured access to 
their information by the following regulatory bodies: FDA -CBER, IRB, IBCSC, NCH internal 
monitors, and an outside contracted monitor designated for the study called a “CR O”.  Subjects 
will be alerted that others may have an interest in the innovative character of the protocol and in 
the status of the treated subjects.  They will be informed that the institution and investigators will 
make efforts to provide protection from  the media in an effort to protect the participants' privacy.  
They will be consulted as to whether, when, or how their identity is publicly disclosed.

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 11.3.4 PROVISIONS FOR IN JURY  
If a subject experiences an injury that is directly related to this study,  the event will be followed 
up until its resolution.  Nationwide Children’s Hospital will provide medical treatment 
reasonably necessary for such injury or illness at no cost to the subject or his insurance company 
for medical expenses up to $10,000. In or der for The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s 
Hospital to pay for these medical expenses the illness or injury must not be related to subject’s 
underlying medical condition and subject must have followed the study directions.  
If research subject  seeks care for a research related injury or illness from a medical provider 
other than Nationwide Children’s Hospital, then The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s 
Hospital will pay up to $10,000 to reimburse the research subject for treatment of such injury or 
illness directly resulting from the study.  Any claim for reimbursement must be supported by 
documentation such as a bill or invoice from a medical provider.  In order for The Research 
Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital to pay for these medical expenses the research 
subject’s illness or injury must not be related to his/her underlying medical condition and 
research subject must have followed the study directions. 
The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital’s reimbursemen t for injury or illness as 
a result of research subject’s participation in the study does not include any payment for lost 
wages, lost time, emotional distress or pain.  This does not mean that the research subject gives 
up any of his legal rights to seek compensation for his illness or injury.  
 
11.4 POTENTIAL BENEFITS O F RESEARCH TO SUBJEC TS AND OTHERS  
This is primarily a safety study of transfer of rAAV1.CMV. huFS344 .  Based on the results of 
the BMD clinical trial using the same vector, subjects particip ating in this trial could improve 
their walking ability.  There is also anticipated benefit to determine the safety of this vector 
system that may provide efficient and sustained efficacy.

12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
12.1 THE DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to review 
participant safety and study progress for the “Phase I/II gene transfer clinical trial for Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy using rAAV1.CMV. huFS344 .”  
 
Responsibilities of th e DSMB are to:  
• Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data and safety 
 monitoring;  
• Evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality  
  and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and  retention, participant risk  
  versus benefit, trial site performance, and other factors that can affect study outcome;  
• Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as 
 scientific or therapeutic developments t hat may have an impact on participant safety or the 
 ethics of the trial;  
• Review study performance, make recommendations and assist  in the resolution of problems 
 reported by the Principal Investigator;  
• Protect the safety of the study participants;  
• Review safety data to determine whether to recommend dose escalation;  
 • Ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring; and,

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015  • Assist by commenting on any problems with study conduct, enrollment, and sample size 
 and/or dat a collection.  
 
DSMB Reporting and Meetings  
Reports describing the status of the study will be prepared by the Principal Investigator’s staff 
and sent to the DSMB at the end of each cohort, or at the DSMB’s request.   
An initial meeting (either by teleconference or webcast) with the DSMB will be scheduled prior 
to study initiation and after Day 30 visit of the first subject, and approximately every 6 months 
thereafter , or at the DSMB’s request.  Reports will be submitte d prior to a scheduled meeting for 
review by the DSMB.  
Reports will include the following: 
A brief narrative of the study status, including the target enrollment, current and  projected time 
to completing enrollment.   Any significant events and/or difficulties should be briefly described 
in this narrative.  
• A brief narrative for each participant describing age, race and ethnicity and other relevant 
 demographic characteristics.  The narrative for each participant sho uld briefly describe his 
 study status (i.e., dose level, visit number, adverse event information);  
• A timeline outlining the study progress relative to visit number for each participant, as well as
 time points for each SAE/Dose Limiting Toxicity. A total for Adverse Events (AEs) for each 
 participant should be included. 
• A summary of AEs by severity levels; 
• A listing of AE details grouped by participant;  
• A listing of SAE details grouped by participant; 
• A listing of deaths  
• A summary of clinically significant laboratory test results  
• A listing of protocol deviations  
 
Stopping/Discontinuation Rules  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be designated by the study’s 
sponsor.  Safety data will be monitored on a continual basis throughout the trial.  The DSMB can 
recommend early termination of the trial for reasons of safety.  Study enrollment will be halted 
by the investigators when any subject experiences a Grade 3 or higher adverse event toxicity that 
is possibly, probably, or  definitely related to the study drug.  This will include any subject death,

to administration of the study agent.  If after review by the DSMB, IRB,  
IBCSC, NIH -OBA and FDA, the decision is made to continue, the study will proceed according 
to Dose Escalation plan.  
 
MEMBERSHIP  
The DSMB membership consists of persons completely independent of the investigator who 
have no financial, scientific, or other confl icts of interest with the trial.  Current or past 
collaborators or associates of Dr. Mendell must note any conflict of interest before their 
eligibility to serve on the DSMB is approved.  
The DSMB will include experts in or representatives of the fields of :  
• Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases  
• Immunology  
• Gene Therapy  
• Muscular Dystrophy Clinical Care  
• Clinical Research and Clinical Trials   
 
Conflict of Interest  
Individuals invited to serve on the DSMB as either voting or non -voting members must disclose 
any potential conflicts of interest, whether real or perceived.  Conflicts of interest can include 
professional, proprietary, and miscellaneous interests as descr ibed in the NIH Grant Policy 
Statement and 45 CFR Part 94.  Potential conflicts that develop during a member’s tenure on a 
DSMB must also be disclosed.  Written documentation attesting to an absence of conflict of 
interest is required.  
 
13.0 CLINICAL MONI TORING OF THE STUDY 
The study will be monitored in compliance with the relevant parts of 21 CFR and according to 
the ICH GCP Guidelines. 
The procedures outlined in the protocol and case report forms will be carefully reviewed by the 
PI and staff prior to s tudy initiation to ensure appropriate interpretation and implementation.  No 
deviations from the protocol shall be made except in emergency situations where alternative 
treatment is necessary for the protection, proper care and well -being of subjects.

37 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 Amen dments will be submitted to the Nationwide Children’s Hospital IRB for their review and 
approval prior to implementation.  When an amendment to a protocol substantially alters the 
study design or increases potential risk to the study subject, the Informed Consent form will be 
revised and if applicable, subject's consent to continue participation will again be obtained.   
 
13.1 DATA MANAGEMENT  AND STUDY FORMS  
All data and observations will be documented on electronic Case Report Forms (CRF) by source 
documentation using the Open Clinica Electronic Data Capture designed for the study.  A Safety 
Monitor will have access to  the data to monitor adherence to the protocol and to applicable FDA 
regulations, and the maintenance of adequate and accurate clinical records.  An electronic Case 
Report Form will be completed for every subject that was registered for participation in the 
study.  The Case Report Form will be re viewed in detail.  Case Report Forms will be completed 
as information becomes available.  
 
Case Report Forms will be reviewed in detail by the Safety Monitor in a regular basis for which 
the Safety Monitor will have access to subject medical records, laboratory data, and other source 
documentation. Safety monitor  will make a decision as to the data acceptability.  If errors or 
omissions are found in the course of a data audit, or if clarification of data is required, the 
electronic Case Report Form(s) in que stion will be corrected by the PI or his designee.  Data 
Resolution may be generated on omissions or clarifications, to be completed, electronically 
signed and dated, and maintained as a part of the eCRF.  The PI will sign and accept the 
indicated electron ic Case Report Form. This signature will indicate that thorough inspection of 
the data therein has been made and will thereby certify the contents of the form.  
In collaboration with the study team, the Research Informatics Core designed a data collection 
system (Open Clinica) for managing the clinical trial. A web -based database was created and it 
will be managed by authorized users. CRFs will be transcribed to this web -based database. Data 
will be extracted from source documents (lab reports, echo reports …) and transferred to the 
database as well.  All source documents will be kept in the Subject Research Chart.  The secured 
portal will feature view and edit capability with field validations for quality controls, change 
history attribute and reporting.  
 
An outside contracted monitor of the study called a “CRO” will also monitor the study on a 
regular basis to make sure the study is conducted in compliance with all regulatory aspects of the 
protocol.

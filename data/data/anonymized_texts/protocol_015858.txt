MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 3 of 69 1.0 Introduction  We will measure COVID-19 related preventative health behaviors, including COVID-19 vaccinations, in the Contra Costa County, CA Medicaid managed care population. Our goal is to test ways to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Our hypothesis is that as a result of financial, cultural, or access issues, among other things, vaccinations and other preventative health behaviors are too low from a public health standpoint, meaning relative to virus exposure and the potential adverse consequences of infection in low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. Furthermore, we hypothesize that small financial incentives and other low-cost behavioral nudges can be used to reduce disparities, increasing vaccination rates and other behaviors known to mitigate the spread of the virus. 2.0 Brief Overview of the Study Protocol Approximately 10,000 adult subjects will be recruited from the Contra Costa Health Plan (CCHP) via baseline survey. Subjects who complete the baseline survey will be randomized to the following arms: 1. Control Arm (n=2,500) 2. Informational Arm: no information/emotional message vs. safety and effectiveness information vs. information on consequences of going unvaccinated, race and/or gender concordant or discordant [7,500]  Each of these arms will be interacted with a financial incentive of $10 (N=2,500) or $50 (N=2,500) and, separately with a convenient link to the county public vaccine appointment scheduling system highlighted for participants (N=5,000).     The above treatments are designed to test the role of the following on vaccine take-up:   • Financial incentives [N=5,000] vs. no financial incentives [N=5,000] o 2,500 will be randomized to a $10 incentive and 2,500 to a $50 incentive • Convenient scheduling link highlighted [N=5,000] vs. not [N=5,000] • Messaging [N=7,500] vs not [2,500]  o Message type: emotion [N=2,500] vs. safety and effectiveness [N=2,500] vs. consequences of not vaccinating [N=2,500] • Race concordant [N=2,500] vs. race discordant messenger [N=2,500] • Gender concordant [N=2,500] vs. gender discordant messenger [N=2,500]  We will obtain survey data on preventative health behaviors, including mask-wearing, hand washing, and willingness to vaccinate. We will obtain EMR data on vaccine take-up. 3.0 Study Staff Responsibilities Pilot PI Jacobson will have ultimate responsibility for the study’s design and implementation. She will be supported by Other Significant Contributors Tom Chang and Manisha Shah. Jacobson will develop all study materials, including this MOP. She will be 
MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 4 of 69 responsible for monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and other issues per the terms of the relevant Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). She will obtain informed consent and HIPAA authorization from all subjects; recruit and randomize subjects; receive EMR data from CCHS; following the procedures in this MOP and the IRB-approved protocol; and report any protocol deviations to the IRB and other relevant parties. She will be responsible for protecting subjects’ rights on a daily basis. She will oversee all data management procedures and quality control procedures.   Collaborator Rajiv Pramanik of Conta Costa Health System (CCHS) will facilitate subject contacts and sharing of EMR data. CCHS will provide data on eligible CCHP members and will be responsible for screening members for eligibility. 4.0 Study Flow Diagram Figure 1: Study Flow Diagram 
 5.0 Recruitment and Retention A random sample of eligible CCHP members will be invited to participate in the study via email, mail, and/or text. We aim to recruit 10,000 subjects and recruitment will continue until we have reached 10,000 baseline survey responses. We will provide gift cards for baseline survey completion ($5 or $25, depending on survey take-up). In addition, respondents will be entered into a raffle for $250 gift cards. 

MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 5 of 69 5.1 Screening and Eligibility Criteria  CCHS will provide a list of eligible members and will be responsible for eligibility screening. Pilot PI Jacobson will not be responsible for eligibility screening. See 5.3 for Eligibility Criteria. 5.2 Screening Log As screening will not be performed by Pilot PI Jacobson or her academic study team, this group will not maintain a screening log. Collaborator Pramanik will maintain documentation of eligibility determinations. 5.3 Eligibility Criteria Eligible subjects are adult CCHP members with no previous COVID-19 vaccination history and no contraindications to COVID-19 vaccination, as determined in CCHP medical staff. 6.0 Informed Consent  Informed consent will be obtained during the baseline survey to recruit subjects. The IRB-approved consent documents are attached as an appendix. 6.1 HIPAA Authorization Personal health information (PHI) will be obtained in keeping with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The IRB approved a partial HIPAA waiver for purposes of study participant recruitment. The study outcome, COVID-19 vaccination, is PHI. The IRB-approved HIPAA authorization form is attached as an appendix. 7.0 Study Intervention  Subjects in treatment arms will receive interventions: • Financial incentives [N=5,000] vs. no financial incentives [N=5,000] o 2,500 will be randomized to a $10 incentive and 2,500 to a $50 incentive • Convenient scheduling link highlighted [N=5,000] vs. not [N=5,000] • Messaging [N=7,500] vs not [2,500]  o Message type: emotion [N=2,500] vs. safety and effectiveness [N=2,500] vs. consequences of not vaccinating [N=2,500] • Race concordant [N=2,500] vs. race discordant messenger [N=2,500] • Gender concordant [N=2,500] vs. gender discordant messenger [N=2,500] 8.0 Randomization  We will stratify our sample based on based on race/ethnicity and age-group. Randomization will be performed in the RedCAP system. In practice, the randomization will divide the sample into 60 possible conditions:  1. Control [N=625] 2. Control x $10 financial [N=312.5] 3. Control x $50 financial [N=312.5]

Subjects will know that treatment they have received, if any. We will not mask care providers or outcomes assessors. 10.0 Safety Reporting Per our DSMP, we will be unable to observe AEs and SAEs in our survey and EMR data.  Routine monitoring of EMR data for AEs and SAEs will not be conducted.   However, if the research team becomes aware through other channels of a specific event, the report will immediately be relayed to the PIs.   The PI will determine whether the event constitutes an AE or SAE, and classify any AEs or SAEs on their severity, expectedness, and relatedness, as above. The PI will consult with a qualified clinician as necessary to make such determinations. Affected subjects will be advised to visit a local, qualified medical practitioner.  Unexpected SAEs will be reported to the Safety Officer (SO), IRB, and NIA within 48 hours of the study’s knowledge, and summarized in periodic electronic reports to the SO.   Any unanticipated problem, defined as an issue related to the research that suggests the research places participants or others at greater risk than was expected, will be reported to NIA and the SO within 48 hours of the study’s knowledge. Reporting will occur within 24 hours if the problem involves death. The report will include a plan to correct the problem and prevent its reoccurrence.  Any SAEs related to the study and any unanticipated problems will also be promptly reported to the sIRB. 11.0 Study Compliance  Protocol deviations for this study, while exceedingly unlikely, could include randomizing an ineligible participant; obtaining incomplete or inadequate informed consent; administering the wrong treatment to a subject; or failing to keep the IRB protocol up to date.  Any deviations that impact participant safety will be reported to NIA and the SO within 24 hours of occurrence, or as soon as they are discovered. All other deviations will be 
MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 9 of 69 captured in routine reports to NIA and the SO. All deviations will be reported to the sIRB of Record in accordance with local policies and captured in the protocol deviations log in the appendix of this MOP.  12.0 Data Collection and Study Forms 12.1 Participant Data Individual-level survey data, EMR data, and randomization information will be maintained electronically by the study team. Survey data will be received directly by the study team. EMR data will be transmitted from CCHS to the study team. 12.2 Study Forms There are no study-specific forms for this study.  12.3 General Instructions for Completing Forms  Not applicable. 12.4 Data Flow  Data, which will include PHI, will be stored on secure servers only available to the research team. Coded data will be used for analysis and will be stored separately from the identifiable data.  12.5 Administrative Forms We will use the Adverse Event Form and Serious Adverse Event Form from the NIA Clinical Research Study Investigator’s Toolbox to record any AEs or SAEs.  12.6 Retention of Study Documentation  Participant data will be retained by the study team for at least the NIH minimum of three years. We have no plans for data destruction at this time. Informed consent will be included in the baseline survey data and maintained indefinitely.  13.0 Data Management 13.1 External Data  The study team will receive data from CCHS on eligible CCHP members and on enrolled subjects’ vaccine outcomes. These data transfers will rely on Box.com, which encrypts the data during transfer and at rest. USC and CCHS will execute appropriate data use agreement(s) before transferring any data. 13.2 Quality Control Procedures  The study team will review data from CCHS, as well as survey data, as soon as possible after receipt. The team will perform standard data quality checks, to include flagging missing, out-of-range, or illogical data.  14.0 Concomitant Medications Not applicable. 
MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 10 of 69 15.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Activities 15.1 Study Completion and Close-Out Procedures  At close-out, Pilot PI Jacobson will ensure that all required data has been received and that all data and analysis files are organized and accessible for review. She will ensure that all required study information has been reported to the NIA and other funders. She will notify the IRB of Record of the study’s completion and retain a copy of this notification. Finally, she will prepare a report summarizing the study’s conduct. 15.1.1 Participant Notification We do not plan to notify subjects or their health providers of the results of the study. 15.1.2 Confidentiality Procedures Data will be stored securely as described in 12.4 and 13.1 above. Data will be accessed only by staff with a legitimate need. All staff will be properly trained in human subjects research practices and appropriately supervised.   If computers are used to store and/or analyze clinical data, the investigator should address elements of computer security to ensure that the data remain confidential. These elements include but are not limited to: utilization of computer and system passwords, user security training, system testing and verification, and routine system backups to prevent any loss of electronic data. 16.0 MOP Maintenance Each page of the MOP is numbered, dated, and includes a version number.

MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 41 of 69  Amended Protocol – April 2021 (0.05)  • Participants: Adult patients impaneled at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center (CCRMC) who are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination based on county and CCRMC determination. o Adults ages 18+, eligible for vaccination (as determined by the county) o Self-identified as African American/Black, White or Latino (irrespective of race). o Children are not included as they do not make their own health care decisions. We are interested in how adults make decisions about their own COVID-19 vaccination and other preventive health behaviors. o We are not explicitly studying a protected population. Prisoners are not impaneled at CCRMC. Pregnant women, to the extent they are not excluded in the county’s vaccination plans, may be enrolled in the study. However, we will not explicitly target pregnant women or ask about pregnancy. Vaccination offers will be determined by medical personnel from the county and CCRMC, separate from the study.   • Recruitment Process (sampling strategy) o Eligible adults will be invited to participate in the study via email, mail, and/or text.  o CCRMC will provide us with a list of impaneled adult patients who are eligible for vaccination based on county prioritization categories and individual health status and who self-identify as African American/Black, White or Latino (irrespective of race). The list will be shared by CCHS via USC Marshall’s box.com accounts and will be managed by Tom Chang. o We will randomly sample and invite adults from this list to participate in a baseline survey. Recruitment in this way will continue until we reach a goal of 10,000 baseline survey responses.  • Enrollment Process o Consent will occur through the baseline survey available via USC RedCAP and through the included consent documents.  o We will also ask for HIPAA authorization so that we can link the survey data to information on vaccinations.  • Methods Our work will begin with a large online survey (N=10,000) of a random sample of the members of the county Medicaid managed care plan in Contra Costa County, CA. Contra Costa Health Plan (CCHP), has over 100,000 adult members. Over a quarter of adult members are Latino, a quarter non-Hispanic White and about 15% each are Black, Asian or of other/unknown race. Our sample will be drawn from CCHP members ages 18 and over who have not been previously vaccinated against COVID-19 and who have no contraindications to vaccination, as determined by county health plan medical staff. Because we are interested in testing race concordant messaging, we will also restrict to 
MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 42 of 69 members who are African American/Black, White or Latino (irrespective of race). Those of other/unknown race are excluded because they cannot be matched based on race to a messenger as are Asians because the group is comprised of populations that are both linguistically and culturally quite distinct. In particular, about a third of the “Asian” group is Filipino, a third Vietnamese, 25% Mandarin-speaking Chinese, 20% Cantonese-speaking Chinese, 15% Punjabi-speaking Indian, 10% Laotian, 10% Korean, and so on. As such, we do not think these populations can credibly be treated as one group for the purposes of studying race concordance and yet each group is individually too small to consider alone. Survey respondents will receive a $5 gift card for their time and be entered into a raffle for a $250 gift card.  In the survey, much of which we have previously piloted for a related project, we will capture rates of preventive health behaviors, including mask-wearing, hand washing, and, most importantly, willingness to vaccinate. Stratifying based on race/ethnicity, age-group and other characteristics predictive of vaccine take-up, we will randomize the 10,000 respondents to one of four arms:  1. Control arm [2,500] 2. Messaging/Information Arm 1: no information/emotional message [N=2,500] 3. Messaging/Information Arm 2: safety and effectiveness information [N=2,500]  4. Messaging/Information Arm 3: information on consequences of going unvaccinated].  The information arms have been designed with the experimental literature on vaccination intentions in mind (see Brewer et al. 2017 for a review). That literature finds, among other things, that messages aimed at clarifying the negative outcomes of not getting vaccinated are much more effective at changing intentions than messages that try to correct misperceptions about vaccine safety. Within the arm 3 and arm 4 message groups, we will further randomize participants to race/ethnicity concordant/discordant video messages and to gender concordant/discordant messages. This intervention builds on recent evidence that race-concordant health care providers increase health screening take-up (Alsan et al. 2019).   Each of these four arms will be interacted with a financial incentive of $10 (N=2,500) or $50 (N=2,500) and, separately with a convenient link to the county public vaccine appointment scheduling system highlighted for participants (N=5,000).   The above treatments are designed to test the role of the following on vaccine take-up:   • Financial incentives [N=5,000] vs. no financial incentives [N=5,000] o 2,500 will be randomized to a $10 incentive and 2,500 to a $50 incentive Sample Population:Respondents from Aim 1 Survey (n=10,000)Arm 1:Control (n=2,500)Arm 2: Emotional mesage/no information (n=2,500)Arm 3:Safety and Effectivness message (n=2,500)Arm 4: Consequences of not vaccinating(n=2,500)Figure. Randomization Design  
MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 43 of 69 • Convenient scheduling link highlighted [N=5,000] vs. not [N=5,000] • Messaging [N=7,500] vs not [2,500]  o Message type: emotion [N=2,500] vs. safety and effectiveness [N=2,500] vs. consequences of not vaccinating [N=2,500] • Race concordant [N=2,500] vs. race discordant messenger [N=2,500] • Gender concordant [N=2,500] vs. gender discordant messenger [N=2,500] These financial incentives of $10 or $50 are in line with the prior literature. For example, Bronchetti, Huffman, and Magenheim (2015) paid college students $30 for flu vaccinations in 2012. In addition, the $50 incentive is in-line with 2 hours of time at the minimum wage plus transportation costs. These incentives will be paid for with funding from J-PAL. While financial incentives for vaccination have faced some criticism (Largent and Miller 2021), prior work suggests small incentives can be quite effective (Bronchetti,  Huffman, and Magenheim 2015). Given the urgency of the issue, we think it is crucial to test the effectiveness of financial incentives against other potential tools to improve vaccine take-up. We will also examine study impacts for subpopulations of interest identified in our baseline survey (e.g., groups at a high risk for adverse health outcomes or young adults who have high potential to be super-spreaders of COVID-19).   We understand that the IRB is concerned that the incentives for vaccination are not equal across participants in the incentive arm. However, this approach is fairly standard in behavioral economic studies and has been approved by many IRBs at peer institutions. We highlight just a few such health studies here but there are dozens of other relevant examples:  1. Alsan et al. (2019), which studied preventive health care among African American men, included a condition that randomly offered subjects incentives of $5 or $10 for selecting an influenza vaccination. These rewards were for intentions and were irrespective of actual vaccination. This study was approved by Stanford’s IRB. The protocol is available in Alsan et al. (2018) https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.2497-2.0.       2. Bachireddy et al. (2019), which studied physical activity, compared 3 different 2-week incentive programs with rewards for daily steps taken. Incentives varied from $0.10 per 10,000 steps to $2 per 10,000 steps, a 20-fold difference, over the 2-week intervention period. This study was approved by the IRB at University of Pennsylvania.  3. Jones et al. (2019), which studied workplace wellness programs, offered varying levels of cash rewards ($100 vs. $200) to University of Illinois employees for completing a biometric screening and health risk assessment and an additional cash reward for completing each wellness activity ($25 vs. $75). The study was approved by the IRBs at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, the University of Chicago and the National Bureau of Economic Research.   
MOP version 1.1 dated 03Jun2021  Page 44 of 69 We believe our work is in line with these and many other studies. It is also extremely policy relevant given concern about vaccine take-up. Our primary outcomes are vaccine take-up at one month and vaccine intentions at the time of survey. Secondary analysis will consider any vaccine take-up over longer time periods.   Overview of procedures to be used for  o Data collection tools • Baseline survey – Survey will be translated into Spanish and thus available in both Spanish and English for respondents to choose from in RedCAP. • Administrative data from CCRMC on COVID-19 tests, vaccinations, hospitalizations o Vaccination appointments in Contra Costa have been open to all age groups since March 30, 2021. o Research procedures will end once survey respondents have “received” an intervention.  The research team will not take part in any delivery of care. Thus, any actual take-up of vaccinations will be subject to normal CCHS standard of care.   o Data Analysis   • Randomization Randomization will be performed in the RedCAP system. In practice, the randomization will divide the sample into 60 possible conditions:  1. Control [N=625] 2. Control x $10 financial [N=312.5] 3. Control x $50 financial [N=312.5] 4. Control x link [N=625] 5. Control x $10 financial x link [N=312.5] 6. Control x $50 financial x link [N=312.5] 7. No information/Emotional (language concordant) [N=625]   8.

Rationale: To remove reference language w hich was based on an embryo -
fetal study.  Exposure margins calculated for doses used in humans do not 
indicate a product risk associated w ith administration of upadacitinib to male 
partners of females of childbearing potential.  Male subjects were therefore no 
longer required to use contraception when participating in upadacitinib 
clinical trials.  Informed consents to collect pregnancy outcomes therefore are 
not required to be obtained from the pregnant partner of an enrolled male 
subject for the same reason.

asymptomat ic COVID -19 and when study  drug m ay be restarted.
○Updated ECG section to remove the QTcF value > 500 msec as a criterion 
for discont inuing upadacit inib as it has not been shown to have an effect 
onprolongation of the QTc interval at plasma exposures associated with 
the 15 m g QD adul tequivalent dose, so discont inuation due to prolonged 
QTc is not ne cessary.   Added requi rement to di scont inue study  drug for 
subjects taking upadacit inib if there is a new ECG finding that is 
considered clinically significant and with a reasonable possibilit y of 
relationship to study  drug.

Methodology:
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods.  Period 1 is 56 weeks in duration and 
includes a 24- week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled and active comparator -
controlled period followed by an additional 32 weeks of blinded, active comparator -controlled treatment 
(Weeks 24 –56).  Period 1 is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 
15mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) in 
subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and have an inadequate response to non -biologic 
DMARDs (DMARD -IR).  Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
and 30 mg QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression.  Period 2 is an open -label 
(blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1), long -term extension of up to a total 
treatment duration of approximately 5 years to evaluate t he safety, tolerability and efficacy of 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with PsA who have completed Period 1.
The study  is designed to enroll approximately 1640 subjects at approximately 350 study centers 
worldwide to meet scientific and reg ulatory  objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in 
alignment with ethical considerations.  
The study  duration will include a 35 -day screening period; a 56 -week blinded period which includes 
24weeks of double -blind, placebo -controlled and active comparator controlled treatment followed by 
32weeks of active comparator controlled treatment (Period 1); a long -term extension period of up to a 
total treatment duration of approximately 5 years ([blinded until the last subject completes the last visit 
of Period 1] Period 2); a 30- day follow -up call o r visit; and a 70- day follow -up call.
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area 
[BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, pres ence of dactylitis, and presence of 
enthesitis, except for subjects from China and Japan, w here randomization for each country will be 
stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) only, and then will be 
randomized in a 2:2:2 :1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups:
Group 1:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 410)
Group 2:  upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 410)
Group 3:  ADA (40 mg eow) (N = 410) 
Group 4:  Placebo followed by upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 205)
Group 5:  Placebo followed by upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 205)
No more than approximately 15% of subjects will be enrolled with concomitant use of 
hydroxy chloraquine, sulfasalazine, bucillamine, or iguratimod.
Subjects will receive both oral study drug QD (upadacitinib 15 mg, upadaciti nib 30 mg, or matching 
placebo) and subcutaneous study drug eow (either ADA 40 mg or matching placebo) until all subjects 
have completed Period 1 (Week 56) and sites and subjects are unblinded to study treatment.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
12
Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who were assigned to placebo at Baseline will be preassigned to receiving either upadacitinib 
15mg QD or upadacitinib 30 mg QD starting at Week 24 in a 1:1 ratio.  Subjects who complete the 
Week 56 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long- term extension portio n of the study, Period 2 (total 
study duration up to approximately 5 years).  Subjects will continue study treatment as assigned at the 
end of Period 1.  Subjects who are assigned to the upadacitinib 15 mg QD, upadacitinib 30 mg QD, or 
adalimumab 40 mg eow will continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD, upadacitinib 30 mg QD, or 
adalimumab 40 mg eow, respectively, in a blinded manner.  When the last subject completes the last 
visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study drug assignment in both periods will be unblind ed to the sites, and 
subjects will be dispensed study drug in an open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.
Subjects must have had inadequate response to ≥ 1 non -biologic DMARD (MTX, SSZ, LEF, 
cyclosporine, apremilast, bucillamine or iguratimod) or an intolerance to or contraindication for 
DMARDs as defined by the investigator prior to the Screening visit.  No background non -biologic 
DMARD therapy is required during participation in this study.  For subjects who are on non -biologic 
DMARD therapy a t baseline (MTX, SSZ, LEF, apremilast, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), bucillamine or 
iguratimod), non -biologic DMARDs should have been started ≥ 12 weeks prior to the baseline visit, 
must be at stable dose for ≥ 4weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and remain on a stable dose 
through Week 36 of the study; the non -biologic DMARD dose may be decreased only for safety 
reasons.  In addition, all subjects taking MTX should take a dietary supplement of oral folic acid (or 
equivalent) throughout study particip ation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be followed 
according to the Investigator 's instructions.  Please refer to Section 5.2.3.1 and Section 5.2.3.2 for 
additional details related to prior and concomitant DMARD therapy, respectively.  Star ting at the 
Week 36 visit (after Week 36 assessments have been performed), initiation of or change in background 
PsA medication(s) including, corticosteroids, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency opiates, a nd no n-biologic DMARDs (concomitant use of up to 
2 non -biologic DMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label 
with maximum doses as outlined in Section 5.2.3.3 .
At Week 16, subjects classified as non -responders (define d as not achieving at least 20% improvement 
in either or both tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at both Week 12 and Week 16) 
will add or modify background therapy for PsA.  
After the last subject completes the Week 24 study visit, an unblinded analysis will be conducted for the 
purpose of initial regulatory submission.  To maintain integrity of the trial during the blinded 56 -week 
period, study sites and subjects will remain blinded until all subjects have reached Week 56.  A 
second unblinded analysis may be conducted for regulatory purposes after all subjects have completed 
Period 1.  A final analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 2.  An unblinded 
interim analysis will be conducted by an independent externa l Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after 
approximately 600 subjects have completed the Week 12 visit or have prematurely discontinued from 
the study .  The interim analysis is to assess if the study met the pre -defined No -Go boundary for the 
primary  endpoint ACR20.

Methodology (Continued):
Each subject will undergo a maximum of 6 scheduled visits for x -ray examinatio n of bilateral hands and 
feet (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due to failure to meet the quality requirements) at 
Screening, Week 24, Week 56, Week 104, Week 152, and Week 260/Premature discontinuation.  In 
addition, all subjects who fail to attain at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at 
Week 12 and Week 16 will have an x-ray examination at Week 16 (refer to Section 5.2.3.4 for additional 
details).  All subjects will receive x -rays of hands and feet if they discontinue from the study or from 
study drug at Week 12 or later and it has been at least 12 weeks from when x -rays were last obtained 
during Period 1 or at least 24 weeks during Period 2.
Starting at Week 36, subjects who fail to demonstrate at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC 
and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits will be discontinued from study drug treatment.
Upon approval of protocol amendment 7, subjects receiving upadacitinib 30 mg QD will be switched to 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD at their next scheduled study visit.
For subjects receiving upadacitinib, as the subject nears the end of the study (Week 260 in Period 2), the 
investigator will discuss the appropriate subsequent treatment with the subject.   If the subject and 
investigator determine continued therapy with upadacitinib remains the best course of treatment , AbbVie 
will work with th e investigator to evaluate a path for continued treatment in accordance with local 
regulation until upadacitinib is commercially available and/or the subject can access upadacitinib locally.   
All subjects randomized to the adalimumab treatment arm will hav e the opportunity to continue with 
adalimumab treatment through the end of Period 2 (Week 260).   Following completion of the Week 260 
visit, subjects randomized to adalimumab will complete the study by the 70 -day follow -up phone call.

Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples for assay of upadacitinib and possibly other medications in plasma will be collected at 
each visit after baseline in Period 1.
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional)
Prognostic, surrogate, predictive, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers signatures may be evaluated.  
Samples for different applications including, but not limited to, pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, 
transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and targeted investigations will be collected at various time 
points.  Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, or lipids.
Safety:
Safety evaluations include adverse ev ent (AE) monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign 
measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, and 
urinaly sis) as a measure of safety and tolerability for the entire study duration.
Statistical Method s:
Efficacy:
All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
Period 1 Efficacy:
Analy sis of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints:
For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  Pairwise 
comparisons between each upadacitinib treatment group and the combined placebo groups will be 
conducted using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors.
For ACR20 response rate at Week 12, analysis will be conducted to assess the non -inferio rity of each 
upadacitinib dose versus ADA on placebo -subtracted treatment difference using Koch 's 3-arm test 
statistic.  The test aims to s how that upadacitinib preserves at least 50% of the placebo -subtracted ADA 
effect.  Superiority of upadacitinib versus ADA will also be tested for ACR20.

EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
18
Statistical Methods (Continued):
Period 1 Efficacy (Continued):
For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for each 
treatment group.  Pairwise comparisons for each of the upadacitinib treatment groups and the combined 
placebo groups will be carried out using the analysis of covariance model with treatment group as the 
fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates.  
For change from baseline in Patient 's Assessment of Pain NRS and change from baseline in HAQ -DI at 
Week 12, superiority of upadacitinib vs adalimumab will also be tested.  The overall type I error rate of 
the primary and key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled using a graphical 
multiple testing procedure.
Long -Term Efficacy for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined:
Long -term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
Pharmacokinetic:
A non -linear mixed- effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population central values and 
the empirical Ba yesian estimates of the individual values of upadacitinib oral clearance (CL/F) and 
volume of distribution (V/F).  Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of 
the data.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be carried out using the Sa fety Analysis Set, which includes all subjects who receive 
at least one dose of study drug.  There will be two sets of planned safety analyses:  safety analysis by 
Week 24, and long -term safety analysis.  Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examinatio n, 
laborato ry assessments, ECG, and vital signs.  Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment -
emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary, by 
system organ class, by severity, and by relationshi p to the study drug as assessed by the Investigator will 
be provided.  The changes from baseline in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical 
laborato ry values will be analyzed in a descriptive manner.  Shift of laboratory values from baselin e to 
defined time points will be tabulated.

3.0 Introduction
Psoriatic Arthritis
Psori atic Arthri tis (PsA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory  disease classified as a sub -
type of spondyloarthrit is (SpA) and characterized by the associat ion of arthri tis and 
psori asis.  PsA can develop at any  time, but for most people it appears between t he ages of 
30 and 50, and it affects men and women equally 1.  The course of PsA is usually 
characteri zed by  flares and remissi ons 1.  Left untreated, patients with PsA can have 
persistent inflammat ion, progressive jo int dam age, disabilit y, and a reduced life 
expectancy  1,2.  For m ost pati ents, skin manifestations predate the arthrit is 1. 
Patients wi th PsA experience varying combinat ions of di sease manifestati ons affect ing the 
synovium, tendons, entheses, skin, and bone.  These manifestations of disease range in 
prevalence wit h peri pheral arthri tis and variable degrees of psoriasis observed in all 
patients at som e point during their disease course, axial disease in 40 –74% depending on 
the criteria used for diagnosi s 3, enthesit is in 25 –51%, dactylit is in 8–59%, 4-6and 
anteri or uvei tis in 2 –25% 7.  Addit ionally, PsA patients are more likely to experience the 
co-morbid condi tions of cardi ovascular disease, metabolic syndro me, obesit y, diabetes, 
fatty liver disease, inflammatory  bowel  disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis, 
fibro myalgia, 8depression, and anxiet y than healt hy subjects 9, and have de creased qualit y 
of life and funct ional impairment 10,11.
The prevalence of PsA varies by region and has been reported as 0.13% in North 
America, 0.07% in South America, 0.19% in Europe, and 0.01 – 0.07% in Africa, the 
Middle East, and Asia 12.
PsA pat ients requi re treatm ent of the ent ire spectrum o f disease manifestati ons.  The 
primary  goal  of treating pat ients with PsA is to maximize long -term heal th-related quali ty 
of life, through control o f symptoms, p revention of structural damage, normalizat ion of 
funct ion and social participat ion and abrogation of inflammat ion.  Ini tial treatm ent of 
muscul oskeletal  symptom s is co mposed of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory  drugs

(NSAIDs) and local corticosteroid inject ions, while topical therapies are used for the 
initial treatment of psoriasis.  For patients who experience lack of efficacy or toxicit y with 
these m easures, for the treatment of peripheral arthritis, both the European League 
Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 13and Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis 
andPsoriatic Arthrit is (GRAPPA) 14recommend systemic therapy wit h convent ional 
disease m odifying ant i-rheumat ic drugs (cDMAR Ds) (methotrexate [MTX], lefluno mide 
[LEF], sulfasalazine [SSZ], or ciclosporin A), fo llowed by  anti-tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) therapy  in pat ients who do not respond adequately to cDMARDs.  Other bio logic 
therapi es (e.g., IL -12 /23 or IL -17 inhibitors) a re also recommended as alternat ives to 
anti-TNF inhibitors in selected PsA patients.  Additional specific recommendat ions differ 
slight ly between EULAR and GRAPPA, however recommendat ions for therapeuti c 
choice are made based on a patient 's clinical presen tation as so me manifestations of PsA, 
such as enthesit is, dactylit is, and axial disease are either not responsive or poorly 
responsive to cDMARDs.  Addit ional therapeut ic options are also recommended 
specifically for treatment of skin disease 13,14.
Despite the beneficial results achieved with currently  available bi ologic agent s, 
approximately  40% of  patients do not have at least 20% improvement in American 
College o f Rheumatol ogy (ACR) scores 13,15-21and only 58% 22to 61% 23of patients wi th 
PsA who receive them are abl e to achieve clinical remission after 1 year of treatment, 
with only approximately  43% achieving sustained remission for at least 1 y ear 24.  Thus, 
there remains a cle ar medical  need f or addi tional therapeut ic options in PsA for patients 
with inadequate response to or intolerance to current ly available therapies.
Targeting the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway for autoimmune diseases, such as 
PsA, rheumatoid arthriti s (RA), Crohn 's disease, ulcerative co litis (UC), and atopic 
derm atitis, is supported by  the invo lvement of various pro -inflammatory cytokines that 
signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of these immune -related di sorders.  The 
activat ion of JAK signal ing init iates expressio n of survival factors, cy tokines, 
chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocy te cellular trafficking and cell 
proliferat ion, which contribute to inflammatory  and autoimmune disorders 25,26.

The JAK family  is composed of 4 members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and ty rosine kinase 2 (Ty k2).  
These cytopl asmi c tyrosine kinases act in tandem to activate the Signal Transducer and 
Activator of Transcript ion (STAT) that transduce cytokine -mediated signals, and are 
associ ated wi th multiple membrane cy tokine receptors such as common gamma -chain 
(CGC) receptors and t he glycoprotein 130 trans -membrane proteins 27.  JAK3 and JAK1 
are com ponents of the CGC cy tokine receptor compl exes that are responsible for the 
signaling of the inflammatory  cytokines IL -2, -4, -7, -9, -15 and -21; whereas IL -12 and
IL-23 si gnal through JAK2 and Ty k2 28.  Propagation of these signals is important in the 
amplificat ion of inflammatory  responses.  While the exact mechanism of PsA has not 
been fully elucidated, mult iple cy tokines such as IL -1, -6, -12, -17, -20, and -23 are 
thought to be invo lved in the act ivation and proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes in 
psori atic lesio ns 29.  The IL -17/IL -23 cy tokine axis is also thought to be important in PsA 
pathogenesis 30.  Thus, blockade of eit her JAK1 or Ty k2 coul d inhibi t the response of 
central  cytokine si gnals thought to be important in the pathogenesis of PsA.
Tofacitinib is an oral  JAK inhibitor that inhibit s JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 wit h high 
invitro functional specificit y for kinases 1 and 3.  Tofacit inib is current ly in Phase 3 
developm ent in PsA.  The Phase 3 studies evaluated the efficacy and safet y of tofacitinib 
5 mg and 10 m g twi ce daily (BID) in adult patients with act ive PsA who had an 
inadequate response to at least one conventional synthet ic DMARD (csDMARD) and 
who were TNF inhi bitor-naïve (OPAL Broaden) or who had an inadequate response to at 
least 1 TNF inhibitor (OPAL Bey ond).  Both studies achieved the primary endpoints of 
ACR20 and change in Healt h Assessment Questionnaire Disabilit y Index (HAQ- DI) 
versus pl acebo for both th e 5 m g BID and 10 mg BID doses at Month 3.  Data reported 
from OPAL Broaden indicate ACR20 response at Month 3 for placebo, tofacit inib 5 mg 
BID, tofacit inib 10 mg BID, and adalimumab 40 mg EOW of 33.3%, 50.5%, 60.6%, and 
51.9%, respectively; p -value versu s placebo for each act ive therapy was ≤ 0.05.  At 
Month 3, statistically  significant resul ts in favor of tofacit inib over pl acebo for both dose 
groups were also observed for ACR50/70 responses, and PASI75 response.  Superiorit y of 
tofacitinib versus pl acebo was seen in the Leeds Enthesit is Index (LEI), and Dact ylitis 
Severit y Score (DSS) at the 10 mg BID dose only .  Resul ts for the primary  and reported

secondary  efficacy endpoints were maintained to Month 12.  No radiographic data were 
reported at Month 3 ( end of double- blind peri od); however at Month 12 little radiographic 
progression was observed in any  dose group 31.  OPAL Beyond resul ts for ACR20 
response at Month 3 for placebo, tofacit inib 5 mg BID, and tofacit inib 10 mg BID were 
23.7%, 49.6%, and 47.0%, respectively; p -value versus placebo for each active therapy 
was ≤ 0.0001.  At Month 3 statist ically superi or resul ts in favor of tofacitinib at both 
doses versus placebo for ACR50, LEI, and DSS were also observed with superiority over 
placebo for PASI75 demonstrated only at the 10 mg BID dose while ACR70 response was 
not significantly different fro m placebo for ei ther dos e group 32.  The observed safet y 
findings for both studies were consistent with those observed in the RA and psoria sis 
development programs.  In related diseases (RA 33, psori asis 34, and ankylosing 
spond ylitis 35), tofacit inib has demonstrated an impact on signs and symptoms, as 
measured by ACR, Psoriasis Area and Severit y Index (PASI), and Assessment in 
Ankylosing Spondylit is (ASAS) response criteria 31-35.
Upadacit inib is a novel JAK1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients 
with inflammatory  diseases.  Based on in vitro selectivit y assays and in vivo animal 
models, upadacit inib has demonstrated inhibit ion of JAK1 at efficacious drug exposure 
levels that spare an inhibitory  effect on JAK2.  The enhanced select ivity of upadaci tinib 
may have the potential f or an improved benefi t/risk profile by mi tigating JAK2 inhibitory  
effects on ery thropoi esis and myelopoiesis.
Upadacit inib Clinical Development
To date, single and mult iple doses of upadacit inib have been studied in healt hy vo lunteers 
in 10 Phase 1 studies (one of which also emplo yed a substudy  in subjects with mild to 
moderate RA), which have completed study  conduct.  In addi tion, upadaci tinib has been 
studi ed in 4 Phase 2 tri als in subjects wi th RA or Crohn 's disease.  Two of these Phase 2 
trials have com pleted study  conduct:  2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 
575subjects with moderately to severely active RA on background MTX 
(Studi esM13 -550 and M13 -537).  One open -label extensio n to the completed RA studies 
(Study  M13- 538) and 1 rando mized, dose -ranging, placebo -controlled study  
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
33
(Study M13 -740) in subjects wi th moderately to severely  active Crohn 's disease wi th a 
history  of inadequate response to or intolerance to ant i-TNF therapy  are ongoing.  The RA 
Phase 3 clinical development program has been initiated and will include 6 randomized, 
controlled studies fo llowed by  long-term extensi on peri ods.
No Phase 2 studies in subjects with PsA have been performed with upadacit inib.  Results 
from the Phase 2 randomized controlled studies in subjects with RA are available.  
Efficacy of treatment with upadacit inib in pat ients with moderate to severe RA was 
demonstrated in both Phase 2 Studies M13 -550 and M13 -537.  Results fro m both studi es 
demonstrated dose -and exposure -dependent improvement in clinical signs and symptom s 
as measured by the ACR20/50/70 response criteria.
The Phase 2 program for upadacit inib in subjects wi th moderately to severely  active RA 
consisted of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), both on stable background 
methotrexate (MTX) therapy ,and one open -label extensi on (OLE) study  (Study  M13- 538; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for those subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs.  
Study M13 -550 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to 
anti-TNF therapy  and Study  M13- 537 (NCT0206 6389) enrolled subjects who had shown 
an inadequate response to MTX.  A total of 4 twice daily (BID) and 1 once daily (QD) 
dose regimens o f upadacit inib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg 
BID, 18 mg BID, and 24 mg QD) were evaluated.
In TNF -inadequate responder (TNF -IR) subjects, who represent the populat ion with the 
greatest unmet need, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was 
significant ly greater at all doses of upadacit inib (up to 73%) compared with placebo 
(35%).
Inaddition, numerically  higher proporti ons of subjects achieved ACR50 and ACR70 
responses and low disease act ivity (LDA, based on Disease Act ivity Score [DAS] 28 
C-reactive protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activit y Index [CDAI]) in the upadacit inib 
dose g roups versus placebo.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
34
In MTX -inadequate responder (MTX -IR) subjects, the primary endpo int of ACR20 
response rate at Week 12 was significant ly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose 
of upadaci tinib co mpared with placebo (50%).  At all doses of upada citinib co mpared to 
placebo, si gnificantly higher proportions of subjects achieved LDA and clinical remissio n 
at Week 12.
Safety resul ts across the studi es showed that upadacit inib was well tolerated and the ty pes 
and frequencies of adverse events (AEs) we re consistent with subjects with moderately to 
severely  active RA receiving immuno modulatory  therapy.  One subject died fro m lung 
cancer 14 weeks after complet ing the 12 -week study  (Study  M13- 537); the l ung cancer 
was considered by the invest igator as not related to study  drug.  Thi s subject had a 
40pack -year history of tobacco use and a posit ive family history  of lung cancer.  The 
rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs result ing in discont inuat ion of study  drug 
were l ow and not si gnificant ly different f rom placebo.  No trends in the number of 
subjects wi th potenti ally clinically significant values or changes per dose group were 
observed for any o f the hematol ogy or urine parameters; however, treatment -emergent 
increases in blood creatine phosphokin ase (CPK), all o f which were asymptomat ic, were 
reported with higher doses of upadacitinib (12 to 18 mg BID).  No subject discont inued 
study  drug due to el evated CPK.  In all subjects, the CPK values normalized or were 
significant ly reduced at the time of last observat ion.  Among subjects with laboratory  
evidence of systemic inflammat ion (as evidenced by C -reactive protein [CRP] > upper 
limit of norm al [ULN]), treatm ent wi th upadaci tinib 3 m g BID or 6 m g BID was 
associ ated wi th improvements in mean hemoglo bin (Hgb) relat ive to placebo.  At higher 
doses, there was a reduction in mean Hgb, however the reduction was not clinically 
significant, as m ean Hgb levels remained within normal range throughout the treatment 
period.  One subject each in the 18 mg BID gro up in both Study M13 -550 and Study  
M13 -537 had an AE of anemia.  Overall, the AEs observed during the Phase 2 
development, as well as changes in physical examinat ion findings, vital signs and clinical 
laboratory  resul ts, do not indicate any safet y concerns for further development of 
upadacit inib.

Phase 3 Studies with upadacit inib
Six multi-country  rando mized controlled trials (RCTs) inclusive of approximately 
4,425 subjects are planned or ongoing for upadacitinib in subjects with moderately to 
severely  active RA.  Study  M13- 542 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enroll subjects who had an 
inadequate response to bio logic DMARDs.  Study  M15- 925 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will 
compare upadacit inib vs. abatacept in subjects who had an inadequate response to 
biologic DMARDs.  Study  M13- 549 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enroll subjects who are on a 
stable dose of convent ional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and have an inadequate 
response to csDMARDs.  Study  M14- 465 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enroll subjects who are 
on a stabl e dose of MTX and have an inadequate respo nse to MTX.  Study  M13- 545 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enro ll subjects who are MTX naïve.  Study  M15- 555 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enro ll subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX and will 
investi gate the use of upadacit inib as mo notherapy.  A total of 3 dose regimen s of 
upadacit inib once -daily  tablets [30 m g QD, 15 m g QD, and 7.5 m g QD (Japan only )] will 
be evaluated.  There are no data available fro m these studies at this t ime.
3.1 Differences Statement
This study  is the first to evaluate safety , tolerabili ty, and effic acy of upadaci tinib in 
subjects wi th PsA and a previous inadequate response to at least one non -biologic 
DMARD.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Despite the availabilit y of various PsA therapies, including convent ional synthetic 
(cs)DMARDs, 1 targeted synthet ic (ts)DMAR D and bi ologic (b)DMARDs, m any patients 
still do not respond adequately  to these treatm ents, or gradually lose response over time.  
There i s evidence for clinical benefit of JAK inhibition in PsA based on 2 Phase 3 studies 
of tofacitinib, a non -select ive JAK inhibitor 31,32.  Many AEs (serious infect ions, herpes 
zoster reactivat ion, malignancies, and hematologic adverse events) observed for 
tofacitinib are thought to be a consequence of non -select ivity against the m embers of the 
JAK family  of proteins.  Upadacit inib is a novel select ive JAK1 inhibitor with the abilit y 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
36
to decrease jo int inflammat ion and damage mediated by  JAK1 signaling while having 
minimal inhibitory  effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially minimize some of 
the repo rted safet y concerns wit h non -selective JAK inhibit ion which are though t to be 
mediated by  inhibi tion of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathway s.
The safet y profile specific to upadacitinib is evo lving with safet y resul ts to date consistent 
with those known to be associ ated wi th JAK inhibiti on.  Adverse events in the categories 
of infect ion such as urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection and herpes 
zoster reactivat ion have been reported as well as adverse events in the categories of 
malignancies , and gastroi ntestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal perforation.  Events 
of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmo nary embo lism (PE) have been reported in 
patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacit inib.
In addi tion, laboratory  changes includi ng elevat ions of liver funct ion tests, increase in 
lipids, elevation in serum creat inine, creatine phosphokinase, reduced hemoglobin 
depending on baseline inflammatory  burden, l ower whi te blood cell  counts, and 
reducti ons in Natural  Killer (NK) cells have been observed wit h upadacit inib therapy.
In ORAL Surveillance, a study  of a different JAK inhibitor, tofacit inib, in RA pat ients 
50years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of 
all-cause m ortali ty, malignancies, MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, non -fatal 
myocardial  infarct ions and non -fatal strokes) and thrombosi s (overall thrombosis, deep 
vein thrombosis, and pulmo nary embo lism) were seen in pat ients treated wi th tofacitinib 
versus TNF blockers 36.  These higher rates were primarily observed in patients 65 years 
of age and o lder, patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and 
patients wi th other cardi ovascular risk factors (such as current or past long- time smokers).  
Altho ugh upadacit inib clinical trial data to date have not indicated a higher risk for 
MACE, venous thromboembolism, malignancies excluding NMSC, or deaths in RA 
patients treated wi th upadaci tinib versus adalimumab, the findings of the ORAL 
Surveillance study  may potenti ally also apply to other JAK inhibitors and an increased 
risk for these events compared to TNF blockers cannot be completely excluded.  
Therefore, the invest igator should consider the benefits and risks of upadacit inib treatment 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
37
and suitable treatment alternat ives in determining study  parti cipation and the continued 
use of upadacit inib in pat ients 65 y ears of age and older, patients with a history  of 
atherosclerotic cardio vascular disease or other cardio vascular risk factors, patients who 
are current or past long -time smokers, and/or patients wi th other malignancy  risk factors 
(e.g., current malignancy or history  of malignancy).
The results of all genet ic toxico logy testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic, 
however upadacit inib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance 
of pregnancy in wo men of childbearing potential.  Based on calculated safet y margins for 
human fetal exposure with seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to 
pregnancy of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadac itinib.
A detailed discussio n of the pre -clinical and clinical toxicology, metabolism, 
pharmaco logy and safet y experience wit h upadacit inib can be found in the current 
Invest igator 's Brochure.
A Phase 2 program with upadacit inib demo nstrated efficacy for i mprovement in signs and 
symptoms of RA and the safet y resul ts were consistent wi th those known to be associ ated 
with JAK inhibit ion 37-45,46,47.  Together, the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 RA 
program and establishment of proof of concept for efficacy o f JAK inhibit ion in PsA 
support further development of upadacit inib in Phase 3 in subjects wi th PsA.
The benefit:risk profile o f various immunomodulatory  therapi es on COVID -19 is being 
evaluated.  At this time, the effects of upadacit inib on the course of COVID -19 are not 
well defined.

controlled and act ive co mparator -controlled peri od followed by  an addi tional 32 weeks of 
blinded, active co mparator -controlled treatment (Weeks 24 –56).  Period 1 is designed to 
compare the safet y, tolerabili ty, and efficacy of upadacit inib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD 
versus pl acebo and versus adalimumab 40 mg eow for the treatment of signs and 
symptoms of subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and have an inadequate 
response or i ntolerance to n on-biologic DMARDs (DMARD- IR).  Peri od 1 i s also 
designed to compare the efficacy  of upadaci tinib 15 m g QD and 30 m g QD versus 
placebo for the prevent ion of structural  progressi on.  Peri od 2 i s an open -label (blinded 
until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1), long- term extensi on of up to a 
total treatm ent durati on of approximately 5 years to evaluate the safety , tolerabili ty and 
efficacy o f upadacit inib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with PsA who have 
completed Peri od 1.
Upon approval o f protocol  amendment 7, subj ects receiving upadacit inib 30 mg QD will 
be switched to upadaciti nib 15 m g QD at thei r next scheduled study  visit.
The study  is desi gned to enroll approximately 1640 subjects at approximately 350 study  
centers worl dwide to m eet sci entific and regulatory object ives wit hout enrolling an undue 
number of subjects in alignme nt with ethical considerati ons.
The study  durati on will include a 35 -day screening peri od; a 56 -week blinded period 
which includes 24 weeks of double -blind, placebo -controlled and act ive co mparator -
controlled treatment fo llowed by  32 weeks of active compar ator controll ed treatm ent 
(Peri od 1); a l ong-term extensi on period of  up to a total  treatm ent durati on of 
approximately  5 years ([blinded unt il the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1] 
Period 2); a 30 -day follow-up call or visit ; and a 70 -dayfollow-up call.
Subjects who meet eligibilit y criteria will  be stratified by  extent of psori asis ( ≥ 3% body  
surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, presence of 
dactylit is, and presence of enthesit is, except for subjects from Chin a and Japan, where

five treatment groups:
Group 1:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 410)
Group 2:  Upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 410)
Group 3:  ADA (40 mg every  other week [eow]) (N = 410) 
Group 4:  Pl acebo followed by upadacit inib 15 mg QD (N = 205)
Group 5:  Pl acebo followed by upadacit inib 30 mg QD (N = 205)
No m ore than approximately 15% of subjects will be enrolled wit h conco mitant use of 
HCQ, sulfasalazine, bucillamine, or iguratimod.
Subjects will receive both oral study  drug QD (upadaci tinib 15 mg, upadacit inib 30 mg, or 
matching placebo) and subcutaneous study  drug eow (ei ther ADA 40 m gor matching 
placebo) until all subjects have co mpleted Period 1 (Week 56) and sites and subjects are 
unblinded to study  treatment.
Subjects who were assigned to placebo at Baseline will be preassigned to receive either 
upadacit inib 15 mg QD or upadacit inib 30 m g QD starting at Week 24 in a 1:1 ratio.  
Subjects who complete the Week 56 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long -term 
extensio n porti on of the study , Peri od 2 (total  treatment up to approximately 5 y ears).  
Subjects will cont inue study  treatme nt as assigned in Period 1.  Subjects who are assigned 
to the upadacit inib 15 mg QD, upadacit inib 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg eow will 
continue to receive upadacit inib 15 mg QD, upadacit inib 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 
40mg eow, respectively, in a blinded m anner.  When the l ast subject completes the last 
visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study  drug assignment in both periods will be unblinded to 
the sites, and subjects will be dispensed study  drug in an open -label fashion until the 
completion of Period 2.  Upon a pproval o f protocol amendment 7, subjects receiving

contraindicat ion for DMARDs as defined by  the investi gator pri or to the Screening visit.  
No background non -biologic DMARD therapy  is requi red during parti cipat ion in this 
study .  For subj ects who are on non -biologic DMARD therapy  at baseline (MTX, SSZ, 
LEF, apremilast, hy droxychl oroquine (HCQ), bucillamine or i guratimod), non -biologic 
DMARDs should have been started ≥ 12 weeks prior to the baseline visit, must be at 
stable dose for ≥ 4weeks prior to the first dose of study  drug and remain at stabl e dose 
through Week 36 of the study ; the non -biologic DMARD dose m ay be decreased only for 
safet y reasons.  In addit ion, all subjects taking MTX should take a dietary  supplement of 
oral folic acid (or equi valent) throughout study  parti cipat ion.  Folic acid dosing and 
timing of regimen should be fo llowed according to the Invest igator 's instructi ons.  Pl ease 
refer to Section 5.2.3.2 for addit ional details related to prior and concomitant DMARD 
therapy .
At Week 16, rescue therapy  will be offered to subjects cl assified as non -responders 
(defined as not achieving at least 20% improvement in eit her or both t ender jo int count 
(TJC) and swollen jo int count (SJC) at both Week 12 and Week 16) as fo llows:  1) add or 
modify doses of non -biologic DMARDs, NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamo l, low 
potency  opioid medicat ions (tramadol or combinatio n of acetaminophen and c odeine or 
hydrocodone), oral corticosteroids and/or 2) receive 1 intra-articular, trigger point or 
tender point, intra -bursa, or intra -tendon sheath corticosteroid injection for 1 peripheral 
joint, 1 tri gger point, 1 tender point, 1 bursa, or 1 enthesis as described in Sect ion5.2.3.4
(Rescue Therapy).
After the last subject completes the Week 24 study visit, an unblinded analysis will be 
conducted f or the purpose of init ial regulatory  submissi on.  To m aintain integri ty of the 
trial during the blinded 56- week period study  sites and subjects will remain blinded unt il 
all subjects have reached Week 56.  A second unblinded analysis may be conducted for

regulatory  purposes after all subjects have completed Period 1.  A final analysis will be 
conducted after all subjects have co mpleted Period 2.
Starti ng at Week 36, subjects who fail to demonstrate at least 20% improvement in either 
or both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecut ive visits will be discont inued 
from study  drug treatment.  Addi tionally, in subjects continuing on study  drug, starting at 
the Week 36 visit (after Week 36 assessments have been performed), init iation of or 
change in background PsA medicat ion(s) including, oral corticosteroids, non -steroi dal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen/paracetamo l, low potency  opiates, 
and non -biologic DMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 non -biologic DMARDs except 
the combination o f MTX and lefluno mide) is allo wed as per local label with maximum 
doses as outlined in Section 5.2.3.3 .
Each subject will undergo a maximum o f 6 scheduled vis its for x-ray examinat ion of 
bilateral  hands and feet (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due to failure to 
meet the qualit y requi rements) at Screening, Week 24, Week 56, Week 104, Week 152, 
and Week 260/Prem ature discont inuat ion.
All subjects who fail to attain at least a 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC 
at Week 12 and Week 16 will have an x -ray examinat ion at Week 16.   All subjects will 
receive x -rays of hands and feet if they  discontinue from  the study  or from study  drug at 
Week 12 or later and i t has been at least 12 weeks fro m when x -rays were last obtained 
during Peri od 1 or at l east 24 weeks during Period 2.
X-rays of the hands and feet will be sent to the central imaging vendor designated by the 
Sponsor.  Images should be reviewed by the investigator to assess for clinically  significant 
findings.  The x -rays will not be assessed by the central imaging vendor for any  clinically 
significant findings that may impact a subject 's heal th.

Screening Period
Within 35 days prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation o f the 
study  design and study  procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the 
screening procedures out lined in Appendix C.  Lab values can be re -tested once during the 
screening period.  If the re -tested l ab value(s) remain(s) exclusio nary, the subj ect will be 
considered a screen failure.  If the subject does not have either an elevated hs -CRP or an 
erosi on on x -ray examinat ion of bilateral  hands and feet (inclusi on criterion 4), hs -CRP 
may be re -tested once during the screening period.  Redrawing sa mples if init ial samples 
were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since init ial result was never 
obtained.
Subjects that init ially screen fail for the study  are permi tted to re -screen once fo llowing 
re-consent without prior AbbVie approval.  For addi tional re-screening, AbbVie 
Therapeut ic Area Medical Director (TA MD) approval is required.  All screening 
procedures wi th the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during re -screening.  
The subject must meet all the inclusio n and none o f the exclusio n criteria at the time of re -
screening in order to qualify for the study .  There is no minimum period of time a subject 
must wai t to re -screen for the study.
If the subject had a complete init ial screening evaluation including HBV, HCV and HI V 
serol ogy, the assessment of an Interferon -Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; Quant iFERON 
Tuberculosis [TB] Gold test) and/or a purified protein derivat ive (PPD) test (or 
equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), ANA, chest x -ray, and 
electrocardi ogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re -screening 
provi ded the condi tions noted in Section 5.3.1.1 are met, there are no c hanges in the 
subject 's medical history  that woul d warrant re -testing, and no more than 90 days have 
passed.  Provided the condit ions noted in the central imaging manual are met, if the 
subject had x -rays of hands and feet performed within 12 weeks of re -screening these tests 
will not be required for re -screening.

Period 1 (56 -Week Rando mized, Double -Blind Treatment Period)
Period 1 will begin at the Baseline Visit (Day  1) and will end at the Week 56 Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n 
criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study  and 
rando mized to double -blind treatment.  During this period of the study, subjects will visit 
the study  site at Baseline (Day  1), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 , 32, 36, 44 and 56.  A 
± 3 day  window i s permitted around scheduled study  visits up to Week 36.  Following 
Week 36, a ± 7 day  window is permi tted.  The last dose of oral study  drug in Peri od 1 is 
taken the day  prior to the Week 56 visit.
Period 2 (Long -Term Extensio n Peri od [Up to a Total  Treatm ent Durati on of 
Approximately  5 Years])
Period 2 will begin at the Week 56 visit after all assessments have been completed.  When 
the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study  drug assi gnmen t in 
both periods will  be unblinded to the si tes, and subjects will be dispensed study  drug in an 
open -label fashi on until the co mpletion of Period 2.  During Period 2, subjects will have a 
study  visit at Week 56 and every  12 weeks thereafter until co mpletion of the study .  A 
± 7day window i s permitted around scheduled study  visits.  The l ast dose of oral  study  
drug i s taken the day  prior to the Week 260 visit.
Upon approval o f protocol  amendment 7, subj ects receiving upadacit inib 30 mg QD will 
be switched to upadaci tinib 15 m g QD at thei r next scheduled study  visit.
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Starti ng at Week 36, subjects who failed to show at least 20% improvement in either or 
both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits will be discont inued fro m 
study  drug treatm ent.  Subj ects who di scont inue study  drug treatment may  choose to 
continue to participate in the study  (refer to Secti on 5.4.1 for addi tional details).  Subjects 
who prematurely discont inue study  drug shoul d complete a Prem ature Discont inuat ion

visit (PD visit) as soon as possible, preferably wit hin 2 weeks o f study  drug 
discontinuat ion and preferably  prior to ini tiation of another therapy .  Afterwards, subjects 
shoul d follow the regul ar visi t schedule as outlined in Appendix Cand adhere to all study  
procedures except for dispensing study  drug, annual  TB testing, PK sample co llection, 
blood sample co llection for opti onal expl oratory  research and validat ion studies, and 
calculat ion for drug assi gnment bas ed on TJC/SJC.  If a subject no longer wants to 
provi de assessments (withdrawal o f informed consent) fo llowing di scontinuati on of study  
drug, a second PD visit is not required.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent) (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may withdraw fro m the study  com pletely  (withdrawal  of inform ed consent) for 
any reason at any  time (refer to Section 5.4.2 for addi tional details).  If a subject 
prem aturely  discontinues study  drug treatment and study  parti cipat ion (wi thdrawal of 
inform ed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discon tinuation visit (PD 
visit) shoul d be co mpleted as soon as possible, preferably wit hin 2 weeks of study  drug 
discontinuat ion and preferably  prior to ini tiation of another therapy .  In addi tion, a 30 -day 
follow-up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possi ble) shoul d occur to determine the status 
of any ongo ing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  For subjects on 
subcutaneous study  drug, a 70 -day follow-up phone call shoul d occur to determine the 
status of any  ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  The 70- day 
follow-up phone call will not be required for any  subject that init iates commercial 
adalimumab.  Subjects who discontinue from the study  will not be replaced.
Follow-Up Peri od
Subjects who complete the last visit of Period 2 (Week 260) will have a fo llow-up 
visit/ phon e call approximately 30 days after the last dose of oral study  drug to obtain 
additional safety  informati on.  Whenever l aboratory  resul ts are needed for AE follow -up, 
the 30-day follow-up shoul d be perform ed as a visit at the si te.  A follow-up phone call 
will also occur 70 days after the last administration of injectable study  drug to determine 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
47
the status of any ongo ing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence o f any new AEs/SAEs.  Subjects 
completing the study on open label (OL) therapy will  only be requi red to have the 30 -day 
follow-up visit/ phon e call if on oral study  drug or the 70 -day follow-up phone call if on 
injectable study  drug.  The foll ow-up visit/phone call is not applicable for subject who 
begin commercially avai lable upadacit inib or adalimumab.  The 30- day follow-up 
visit/phone call and 70 -day follow-up call are not required for subjects who discont inued 
study  drug and cont inued study  parti cipat ion with com pletion of at least one study  visit 
approximately  30 days or 70 days after l ast dose of study  drug, respecti vely.  For subjects 
who enter CTTP, the 30- day follow-up visit/phone call fo llowing the l ast dose of study  
drug at the Week 260 visit will not be required.
5.1.1 Treatment After End of Study
For subjects receiving upadacit inib, as the subject nears the end of the study (Week 260 in 
Period 2), the invest igator will discuss the appropriate subsequent treatment with the 
subject.   If the subject and invest igator determine continued therapy wit h upadacit inib 
remains the best course of treatment, AbbVie will work with the investigator to evaluate a 
path for con tinued treatm ent in accordance wit h local regulati on until  upadaci tinib is 
commercially  available and/or the subject can access upadacit inib locally (refer to 
Appendix Ifor further details).
All subjects randomized to the adalimumab treatment arm will have the opportunit y to 
continue wit h adalimumab t reatment through the end of Period 2 (Week 260).  Following 
completion of the Week 260 visit, subjects randomized to adalimumab will co mplete the 
study  by the 70 -day follow-up phone call.
5.2 Selection of Study Population
It is ant icipated that approximately 1 640 subjects wi th active PsA with inadequate 
response to at least one non -biologic DMARD will be rando mized at approximately

5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medicat ion or vaccine (including over- the-counter or prescript ion medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements including fo lic acid) that the subject is receiving 
within 28 days pri or to Screening and/or receives during the study , must be recorded 
along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and 
dosage information including dose, route and frequency must be recorded in the eCRF.
In addi tion, for subj ect's ≤ 30 y ears o ld wi th a reported malignancy AE, prior exposure to, 
or current use of antineoplast ics, or other drugs which have a risk of malignancy  as stated 
in their label and other relevant dosing information to estimate total exposure will be 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
56
collected in the source docume nts and appropriate eCRF pages.  At the time o f the 
reported malignancy AE, sites will be asked if any of the below prior and concomitant 
medicat ion categori es contributed to the event.  Any  medicati ons in these categories used 
prior to the study  will be captured on the appropriate eCRF.  Informat ion on the reason for 
use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, highest maintained dose, 
dosage information including dose, route and frequency, and reason for stopping the 
medicat ion will be collected in the source documents and appropriate eCRF pages.
Medication Categories:
●corticosteroi ds
●immunosuppressants
●biologic agents
●antineoplastics
●other
Vaccines
Vaccines reco mmended by local guidelines should be considered.  If the invest igator 
chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug 
with appropri ate precauti ons and time interval.  It is recommended that subjects b e up to 
date for recommended inact ivated, toxoid or biosynthet ic vaccines, such as injectable flu 
vaccine, pneumococcal, and pertussis (Tdap).  It is recommended that the live herpes 
zoster vaccine should be considered for administration at least 4 weeks ( 8 weeks in Japan) 
before first dose of study  drug or administered at least 30 day s after l ast dose of oral  study  
drug, or at least 70 days after last dose of subcutaneous study drug.  If the herpes zoster 
vaccine i s to be administered, and there is no know n history  of primary  varicella 
(chicken pox), pre -exist ing immunit y to vari cella shoul d be confi rmed wi th antibody  
testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine.  If 
screening varicella ant ibody  testing is negati ve the herpes zoster vaccine should not be 
administered.  See Section 5.2.3.3 for a list of commo nly used live vaccines.

The AbbVie Therapeut ic Are a Medical  Director (TA MD) shoul d be contacted if there are 
any quest ions regarding concomitant or prior therapy (ies).
5.2.3.1 Prior Therapy
All prior drug therapies for PsA (arthritis and psoriasis), since init ial diagnosis, must be 
recorded in the eCRF alo ng wi th the dates of first and last dose, maximum dosage taken, 
route of administration and reason for discontinuatio n, if known.  Addit ionally, the 
investi gator will record response to DMARDs (e.g., no response, inadequate response, 
loss of response), intol erance to DMARD and/or contraindicat ion for DMARDs.
5.2.3.2 Permitted Background Therapy
In Peri od 1, if subjects are on background DMARDs they  shoul d continue on stabl e 
treatm ent of up to 2 non -biologic DMARDs (DMARDs shoul d have been started 
≥12weeks prior to the Baseline visit and without dosing or administration changes 
≥ 4weeks prior to the Baseline visit).  The fo llowing non -biologic DMARDs are allowed 
as background therapy  during the study :  MTX ( ≤ 25 mg/week), SSZ (≤ 3000 mg/day), 
leflunomide (LEF) ( ≤ 20 mg/ day), apremilast ( ≤ 60 mg/day), HCQ (≤ 400 mg/day), 
bucillamine ( ≤ 300 mg/day ) and i gurat imod (≤ 50 mg/day).  In addit ion, for all subjects 
taking MTX, subjects should take a dietary  supplement of oral fo lic acid (or equivalent, 
such as fo linic acid) throughout study  parti cipat ion.  Folic acid dosing and timing of 
regimen shoul d be fo llowed according to Invest igator 's instructions.  No other DMARDs 
are permitted during the first 36 weeks of study  parti cipati on in Peri od 1.  At any  time, the 
background DMARD dose m ay be decreased for safet y reasons.  AbbVie will not provide 
background DMARDs or folic acid.
In the first 36 weeks of study  parti cipati on in Peri od 1, subjects should also continue on 
their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamo l, low-potency opiates (tramado l 
or combinat ion of acetaminophen wit h codeine or hydrocodone), oral corticosteroids 
(equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 m g/day).  If taking any of the above on a scheduled basis, 
they shoul d continue to take them as they  did at study  entry with no change in dose or 
frequency , including on study  visit days.  If not taking any  of the above at baseline, these 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
58
shoul d not be ini tiated except where permitted by  protocol  (specific time period or 
protocol -defined rescue).  If taking any  of the abov e at baseline on an as -needed basis 
(PRN), they  shoul d cont inue to use them for the same reason and same dose each time but 
they shoul d not be taken wi thin the 24 hours pri or to any  study  visit to avoi d bias in 
outcome measurements.  In the event of tolera bility (or other safet y) issues, these 
medicat ions m ay be decreased, or discont inued with subst itution of another permi tted 
medicat ion from that cl ass.  PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is permitted at any  time.
In Peri ods 1 and 2, starting at Week 36 (a fter Week 36 assessments have been performed) 
and thereafter, 1 intra -articular, trigger point or tender point, intra -bursa, or intra -tendon 
sheath inject ions of corti costeroi ds, dosage and frequency per standard of care, is allowed 
every 12 weeks.  Howeve r, corticosteroid inject ions should be avo ided within 21 days 
prior to the next scheduled study  visit to avoi d confounding effects of systemic absorption 
of intra-articular, trigger point or tender point, intra -bursa, and intra -tendon sheath 
corticosteroi ds.
In addi tion, at Week 36 (after Week 36 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, 
initiation of or change in corticosteroids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamo l, low-
potency  opiates (tram adol or combinat ion of acetaminophen with codeine or 
hydrocod one) or adding or changing doses of non -biologic DMARDs (MTX, LEF, SSZ, 
apremilast, HCQ, bucillamine or igurat imod) is allowed as per l ocal label.  Concomitant 
use of up to 2 non -biologic DMARDs (MTX, LEF, SSZ, apremilast, HCQ, bucillamine or 
iguratimod) e xcept the combinat ion of MTX and LEF is permitted.  Doses of non -biologic 
DMARDs and oral corticosteroids may  not exceed maximums defined above and in 
inclusio n criteria (Secti on5.2.1 ).
After the Week 16 visit has been co mpleted, a subject who qualifies for rescue therapy  
will be permitted to add or modify  doses of non -biologic DMARDs, NSAIDs, 
acetaminophen/paracetamo l, low potency  opioid medi cations(tramado l or combinat ion of 
acetaminophen and codeine or, hy drocodone), oral corti costeroi ds, and/or receive 1 intra-
articular, tri gger point or tender point, intra -bursa, or intra -tendon sheath corticosteroid 
inject ion for 1 peri pheral  joint, 1 tri gger p oint, 1 tender point, 1 bursa, or 1 enthesis as 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8

59
described in Section 5.2.3.4 (Rescue Therapy).  Corticosteroid inject ions should be 
avoided wit hin 2 1 days pri or to the next scheduled study  visit to avoi d confounding 
effects of systemic absorption of corticosteroids.
In Peri od 1 and Peri od 2 permi tted topi cal treatm ents for Psori asis (PsO) include:
●Non-medicated shampoos 
●Bland (wi thout beta or al pha hydroxy acids, urea or salicylic acid) emo llients
●Low potency  (Class VI or VII) topi cal corti costeroids on the palms, so les, face, 
inframammary area and groin only.
Starti ng at Week 16 (after Week 16 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, 
subject s may use any therapy for PsO per invest igator judgment, with the except ion of 
non-biologic DMARDs which may  not be ini tiated or m odified at Week 16 unless non -
responder criteria are met as detailed in Sect ion 5.2.3.4 Rescue Therapy.  At Week 36 and 
thereafter, init iation of or change in dose of non -biologic DMARDs is permitted, as 
described above.

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A wo man who is postmenopausal, permanent ly surgi cally sterile, or permanent ly infertile 
isnot considered to be a woman of childbearing potential and is not required to follow 
contraception recommendations.
Surgically sterile is defined as:
●bilateral  oophorectomy (sur gical removal of both ovaries); or
●bilateral  salpingectomy  (surgical rem oval of both fallopian tubes); or
●hysterectomy (surgical remo val of uterus)
Postmenopausal  is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears wi th no menses for 12 or more months wit hout an al ternat ive 
medical cause; or 
●Age < 55 y ears wi th no m enses for 12 or more months wit hout an al ternat ive 
medical cause AND a fo llicle -stimulat ing hormone (FSH) level ≥30IU/L.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
66
Non-surgi cal perm anent infertilit y is defined as:
●Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensit ivity, or gonadal  dysgenesis; invest igator 
discreti on shoul d be applied to determining study  entry  for these individuals.
If the f emale subject i s < 55 y ears o f age and has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND 
has no history  of perm anent surgi cal sterilizati on (defined above), FSH should be tested at 
Screening:
●If FSH is not tested, i t is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol -specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal st atus, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and pregnancy test ing requirements for women of 
childbearing potential must be fo llowed (see Section 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potenti al and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
requi red.
A wo man who does not meet the definit ion of postmenopausal, permanent ly surgi cally 
sterile, or permanent ly infert ileis considered of childbearing potential and is required to 
practi ce at l east one of the fo llowing highly effect ive methods of birth control that is 
effect ive from Study  Day  1 (or ea rlier) through at least 150 day s after the last dose of 
subcutaneous study  drug, and at l east 30 days after the last dose of oral study  drug.

ovulation, init iated at least 30 day s prior to Baseline Vi sit.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on (oral , injectable, implantable) 
associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulat ion, init iated at least 30 day s prior to 
Baseline Visit.
●Bilateral  tubal  occl usion/ligation (Japan only:  bilateral tubal ligat ion only).
●Vasectomized partner(s) provided the vasectomized partner verbally confirms 
recei pt of medical  assessment of the surgi cal success and i s the so le sexual 
partner of the wom en of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
● True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual int ercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subjec t.  Peri odic abst inence for 
example, using calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods 
and wit hdrawal are not acceptable.
If requi red per l ocal pract ices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, di aphragm or sponge wi th spermicide should be used in addit ion to one of the birth 
control  methods listed above (excluding true abst inence).
If during the course of the study  a wom an beco mes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and co mplete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no 
longer requi red.
It is important to note that contraception reco mmendat ions described above are 
specifically intended to prevent pregnancy  during exposure to the invest igational therapy .  
Contraception reco mmendat ions relat ed to use of concomitant therapies prescribed per 
standard of care should be based on the local label.

nicotine use will be taken fro m each subject during the Screening Visit.  Addit ionally, a 
list of each subjects 'PsA and PsO related medical and surgical history  will be recorded at 
Screening.  History  of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepat itis B 
vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history .  An updated medical 
history  will be obtained prior to study  drug administrati on at Baseline, to ensure the 
subject i s still eligible for enrollment.
A detailed m edical  history  with respect to TB risk factors will be documented in the study  
source documentation.  This informat ion will include BCG vaccination, cohabitation wit h 
individuals who have had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic 
locations.

Vital Signs, Weight and Height
Vital sign determinat ions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate (counted for 
at least 30 seconds after 5 minutes in sitt ing position), respiratory rate, body weight, and 
body temperature will be obta ined at the designated study visits in Appendix C.  Vital 
signs shoul d be perform ed before bl ood draws and pri or to recei pt of study  drug.  Hei ght 
will be measured at the Screening Visit only (with shoes off).  All measurements will be 
recorded in metric units where applicable.
Due to a state of emergency or pandemic situat ion, subject visits may  be conducted via 
phone or vi deo conference.  In these situations, vital signs and weight may be performed 
by the subject or caregiver as needed.
Physical Exam
A co mplete physical examinat ion will be performed at the designated study visits as 
specified in Appendix C.  The physical  examinat ion at the Baseline Visit will serve as the 
baseline physical examinat ion for the entire study .  Physical  examinat ion abnormalit ies 
noted by  the Invest igator at the Bas eline Visi t prior to the fi rst dose of study  drug shoul d 
be recorded in the subject 's medical history .  Abnorm alities noted after the Baseline Visit 
and first dose of study  drug shoul d be evaluated and documented by  the Investigator as to 
whether or not th ese are AEs.  All findings whether related to an AE or part of each 
subject 's medical history  shoul d be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
A symptom -directed physical  examinat ion will be performed when necessary.
Due to a state of emergency or pandemic situation, subject visi ts may  be conducted via 
phone or vi deo conference.  In these situat ions, if a visit by phone or video conference 
occurs at one of the designated study  visit s specified for complete physical examinat ion, 
the com plete physical examina tion will be performed at the next feasible visit.

12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A rest ing 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the Screening and Week 56 Visit.  A 
qualified physician will interpret the clinical significance of any abnormal finding, sign, 
and date each ECG.  ECGs wi th QT interval corrected for heart rate using Friedericia 's 
correcti on formula (QTcF) shoul d be reported (or calculated) and documented in the 
source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF if QTcF prolongat ion 
is observed.  In these cases, the baseline QTcF will need to be entered into the appropriate 
eCRF for comparison as well.  A valid QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have a 
pacemaker or supraventricular or ventricular conduction abnormalit ies.  In ad dition, any 
clinically significant findings will be documented in the source documents and later 
transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  Each signed original ECG will be kept with 
subject 's source docum ents onsi te.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at 
Screening will not be required, provided all protocol required documentation is available 
and nothing has changed in the subject 's heal th status since the time of the test that 
warrants a repeat test.  If there are clinically  significant findings, the Invest igator must 
contact the AbbVie TA MD before enrolling the subject.
Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any  time during the study  as warranted based on the 
opinio n of the Invest igator.
X-Rays of the Hands and Fee t
Each subject will undergo a maximum o f 6 scheduled visits for x -ray examinat ion of 
bilateral  hands and feet (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due to failure to 
meet the qualit y requi rements) at Screening, Week 24, Week 56, Week 104, Week 152, 
and Week 260/Prem ature discont inuat ion.
All subjects who fail to attain at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at 
Week 12 and Week 16 will have an x -ray examinati on at Week 16.   All subjects will 
receive x -rays of hands and feet if they  discontinue fro m the study  or from study  drug at 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
72
Week 12 or l ater and i t has been at least 12 weeks fro m when x -rays were last obtained 
during Peri od 1 or at l east 24 weeks during Period 2.  In such subjects, x -rays shoul d be 
obtained as close as possible to the date of study  drug discont inuat ion.
For subjects who re -screen:  Provided the condit ions outlined in the imaging manual are 
met, if the subject had x -rays of hands and feet performed wit hin 12 weeks of re -screening 
these tests will not be required for re-screening.
Radiographs will  be sent to the desi gnated central  imaging vendor and will be interpreted 
by an experi enced reader selected for the study , who will make the final determinat ion as 
to whether a subject has at least 1 erosion.  The imaging vend or will  return an eligibilit y 
notification report to the site as outlined in the central imaging documents.
Further details regarding the specific imaging techniques to be used will be provided in an 
imaging manual fro m AbbVie or designee.
The Investigator or thei r qualified delegate should read the Screening visit x -rays of the 
hands and feet to determine if the subject fulfills item 5 of the CASPAR criteria 
(Appendix G).  It i s the responsibilit y of the Investigator to ensure that all delegates are 
qualified and that all training is documented.
In the event Hand and Feet x -rays may  not be perform ed at the pl anned visit due to a state 
of emergency or pandemic situat ion, perform the Hand and Feet x -rays at the next feasible 
visit.
Chest X -Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posteri or-anterior and lateral views) is required:
●For all subjects at Screening to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically 
relevant findings.   The CXR will not be required if the subject had a 
previously normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within 90 days 
of Screening, provi ded all source documentation is available at the site as 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
73
outlined below and provided nothing has changed in t he subject 's medical 
history  to warrant a repeat test.
●Annually for subjects with one or more TB risk factors as identified by the TB 
risk assessment form ( Appendix E), subjects living in areas endemic for TB, 
and subjects with newly  posi tive PPD and/or QuantiFERON -TB Gol d test or 
equivalents after baseline.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any  time during the study  as warranted based on the 
opinio nof the Invest igator.
A radi ologist or pulmo nologist must perform  an assessment of the CXR.  The Principal 
Invest igator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date 
the report.  In the assessment of the CXR (review of images requi red), a radi ologist, the 
Princi pal Invest igator or their physician delegate must indicate the presence or absence of 
(1)calcified granulo mas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of act ive TB.  If the 
CXR demonstrates changes suggest ive of previ ous TB (e.g., calcified nodul e, fibroti c 
scar, api cal or basilar pl eural thi ckening) or other findings that are clinically  significant, 
the Principal Invest igator should contact the AbbVie TA MD before enro lling the subject.
In the event CXR may  not be performed at the planned visit due to a state of emergency 
or pandemic situat ion, perform the CXR at the next feasible visit.
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the 
Screening Visit.  The serum  pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central 
laboratory .  If the serum pregnancy test i s posi tive the subject is considered a screen 
failure.  If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ 3 days later to 
determine eligibilit y.  If the repeat serum pregnancy  test is:
●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the study ;
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
74
●Still borderline ≥ 3 days l ater, thi s will  be considered documentation of 
continued lack of a positive resul t and the subject can be enrolled into the 
study  in the absence of clinical suspicio n of pregnancy and other pathological 
causes o f borderline result s.  Where mandated by  local  requi rements a negat ive 
serum  pregnancy  test will be requi red.
In Peri od 1, a urine pregnancy test will be performed for all wo men of childbearing 
potenti al at the Baseline Visi t prior to the first dose of study  drug and at all subsequent 
visits.  More frequent pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study  if requi red 
per local/country  requi rements.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy test performed at the site is negat ive, then 
dosing wit h study  drug m ay begin.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy test performed at the site is posit ive, dosing 
with study  drug m ust be w ithheld and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The 
serum  pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed by  the central  laboratory .  
If the serum pregnancy test i s negat ive, study drug may be started.  If the 
serum  pregnancy  test is posi tive, study  drug m ust be wi thheld and the subject 
must be discont inued fro m study  drug treatm ent.  In the event a serum 
pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required ( ≥ 3 day s later) 
to document continued lack of a positive result.
●If a urine pregnancy  test post-baseline is posit ive, study drug needs to be 
temporarily discont inued and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The serum 
pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory .  If the 
serum  pregnancy  test is negat ive, study  drug m ay be restarted.  If the serum 
pregnancy test is posit ive, study drug must be permanent ly discont inued.  In 
the event a pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required 
(≥ 3 days later) to document continued lack of a posit ive result.
In Peri od2, for women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed 
at all visit s and mo nthly at home between scheduled study  visits.  The resul ts of the 
monthly at hom e tests will be co mmunicated to the site.  If a urine pregnancy test is 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
75
positive, the subject must stop dosing, return to the study site and have blood drawn for a 
serum  pregnancy  test that will  be analyzed at the central laboratory .
At each visit, the study  staff shoul d review the pregnancy avo idance reco mmendat ions 
with each s ubject of childbearing potential and document this discussion in the subject 's 
source records.
If during the course of the study  a wom an beco mes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and co mplete documentation as described in Sect ion 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy testing 
is no longer requi red.
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participat ion in this study  or be 
allowed to con tinue study  drug.
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis 
The TB screening tests provide diagnost ic test results to be interpreted in the context of 
the subject 's epi demi ology, history , exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibilit y of the 
Invest igator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.
At screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by  a risk 
assessment form ( Appen dixE) and tested for TB infect ion by Quant iFERON -TB Gol d 
test.  The PPD Skin Test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON -TB Gol d Test is 
not possible for any  reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).  The site 
staff will com plete the TB ri sk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate 
eCRF.  The TB risk assessment form will be co mpleted annually  for all subjects, 
regardl ess of TB test results.  One or more "yes"response on the TB ri sk assessment form 
indicates increased ri sk of TB.  At annual evaluat ions, questions on the TB risk 
assessment form should be answered considering the previous year when the timeframe is 
not indicated in the question.
If a Quant iFERON -TB Gol d Test cannot be performed by  the Centr al Lab at Screening 
and a subject had a negat ive PPD within 90 days prior to Screening and source 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
76
docum entati on is available, TB testing by PPD Skin Test does not need to be repeated, 
provi ded nothing has changed in the subject 's medical  history  to warrant a repeat test.  
These cases may  be di scussed wi th the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.  The 
resul ts of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
In cases where the annual Quant iFERON -TB Gol d test by  the cen tral laboratory  is 
positive and the investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB (i.e., no risk factors 
ident ified on the TB risk questionnaire) and has no clinical suspicio n of TB, the 
investi gator m ay perform a local Quant iFERON -TB Gol d test (or repeat testing through 
the central  laboratory  if not locally available) to confirm the posit ive test result.  If repeat 
testing result is negative, the investigator may consider the test to be negat ive based on 
his/her clinical judgment; if the repeat tes ting result is posi tive, the test i s considered 
positive.
For subjects with a negat ive TB test result at Screening or most recent evaluat ion, an 
annual TB re -test will be performed.  If an annual TB test is newly posit ive 
(seroconversio n), a chest x -ray (CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in 
distinguishing act ive versus latent TB.  For subjects with seroconversio n on an annual TB 
test, in the absence of a posit ive response to any  questi on on the TB ri sk assessment 
questi onnai re, if a CXR cannot be done due to restrict ions because of a state of emergency 
or pandemic situat ion, the invest igator should contact the AbbVie TA MD to determine if 
the subject may  cont inue on study  drug.  CXR shoul d be perform ed as soon as restri ctions 
are lifted a t the study  site or l ocal hospi tal/facili ty.  Expert consul tation can be considered 
per Investigator 's discreti on.  Any  posi tive TB screen after the patient has started the 
study , shoul d be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable).
Subje cts wi th documentati on of a pri or posi tive resul t of QuantiFERON- TB Gol d Test (or 
equivalent) or PPD are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the study  
and shoul d be considered posi tive.

TB test:
●For regi ons that requi re both PPD and Q uantiFERON -TB Gol d testing, both 
will be performed.  If either PPD or QuantiFERON -TB Gol d is posi tive, the 
TB test is considered positive.
●If a site has the capaci ty to perform  both PPD and Quant iFERON -TB Gol d 
tests, and local guidelines require only one t est to be performed, then the 
Quant iFERON -TB Gol d is the preferred test.  At a site with capacit y to 
perform  both tests, if a PPD is plac ed as the only form of TB test at screening, 
then the TB test to be used for the remainder of the study  for that subj ect is the 
PPD.  Similarly, if a subject enters the study  with a Quant iFERON -TB Gol d 
test al one or other IGRA (negat ive result), then the subject should have their 
annual TB test performed wit h Quant iFERON -TB Gol d test.
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gol d Test is NOT possible (or if both the 
Quant iFERON -TB Gol d Test and the PPD Skin Test are required per local 
guidelines):  the PPD Ski n Test (also known as a TB Skin Test) will be 
perform ed according to standard clinical pract ice.  The TB Skin Test shoul d be 
read by  a licensed healt hcare professio nal between 48 and 72 hours after 
administrati on.  A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be 
rescheduled for another skin test.  The reaction will be measured in millimeters 
(mm) of indurati on and indurat ion≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction.  
The absence o f indurat ion will be recorded as "0 mm "not "negat ive."  Subjects 
who have had an ulcerat ing reaction to the TB Skin Test in the past should not 
be re -exposed and the TB Skin Test should be considere d posi tive.
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gol d test i s indeterminate, then the invest igator 
shoul d perform  a local Quant iFERON -TB Gol d test (or through the central 
laboratory , if not locally  available) to rul e out a posi tive test result.  If testing 
remains indete rminate or is posit ive, then the subject is considered to be 
positive for the purpose of this study .  If the testing resul t is negat ive, then the 
patient is considered to be negat ive.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB 
test) may be subst ituted for the QuantiFERON -TB Gol d.

Subjects wi th a negat ive TB test and chest x -ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB or 
prior TB exposure may be enro lled.
Subjects wi th a posi tive TB test must be assessed for evidence of act ive TB versu s latent 
TB, including signs and symptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a 
CXR not suggestive of act ive TB may be enro lled after init iation of TB prophylaxis (see 
below).  Subjects with evidence of act ive TB must not be enro lled.
TB proph ylaxis:
At screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infect ion (posi tive TB test and the 
subject has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), prophylact ic treatment must be init iated 
at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study  drug (or per l ocal guidelines, whichever is 
longer); at least 6 months of prophylaxis needs to be co mpleted; however, the full course 
of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study  drug.  If the 
Invest igator deems that it is necessary, consult ation with a TB expert coul d be considered.
Of note:  Rifampin (Rifampicin) or Rifapentine are not allowed for TB prophylaxis.
Subjects wi th a pri or history  of latent TB that have documented complet ion of a full 
course of ant i-TB therapy  will be allo wed to enter the study provided nothing has changed 
in the subject 's medical history  to warrant repeat treatment.
For subjects with co mpletion of a full course of anti -TB therapy , but insufficient 
docum entati on, the invest igator should consult with the AbbVie TA MD.
Newly init iated prophylact ic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and in the source 
docum ents.  Pri or therapy  shoul d be captured in the eCRF.
During the study , subjects wi th new evidence o f latent TB m ust init iate prophylact ic 
treatm ent immediatel y per l ocal guidelines and complete at least 6 months of prophylaxis.  
Study  drug(s) should not be withheld.  Two to 4 weeks later the subject should be re -
evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms of toxicit y to TB prophylaxis.

If the subject i s experi encing signs or symptoms suspicious for TB or something has 
changed in the subject' s medical history  to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled 
annual TB re -test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the 
AbbVie Th erapeuti c Area Medical  Director.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be obtained for clinical laboratory  tests listed in Table 2.  
Samples will  be obtained at the designated study  visits in Appendix C.
Unschedule d clinical  labs m ay be obtained at any  time during the study  if deemed 
appropriate per Invest igator 's discretion.  A certified central laboratory  will be utilized to 
process and provide results for the clinical laboratory  tests.  All  abnorm al laboratory  test 
resul ts that are considered clinically significant by  the Invest igator will be fo llowed to a 
satisfactory  resol ution.
The central laboratory  chosen for thi s study  will provi de instructi ons regarding the 
collect ion, processing, and shipping of these samp les.
Blood draws shoul d be perform ed after all  clinical  assessments and quest ionnaires and 
vital sign determinat ions have been co mpleted but before any study  drug administrati on 
during a visit.
Due to a state of emergency or pandemic situat ion, local laboratories may  be used to 
collect l aboratory  samples per instructi ons from AbbVie, as local regulat ions allow.
For clinic visits where samples for serum chemistry tests are collected, subjects should be 
fasting (a minimum 8 -hour fast) whenever possible.  If a subject is not able to fast when 
necessary , due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in 
study  source docum entati on.
Urine samples will be obtained for urinalysis testing at the specified time po ints as noted 
in Appendix C.  The central  laboratory  will be responsible for performing a macroscopic 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
80
urinalysis (urine dipst ick) on the collected urine specimens.  Specified ab normal 
macroscopic urinalyses defined as leukocy tes, ni trite, protein, ketones or blood greater 
than negat ive, or glucose greater than normal will be fo llowed-up wi th a microscopi c 
analysis at the central laboratory .
For any  laboratory  test value outside t he reference range that the Invest igator considers to 
be clinically  significant, the Invest igator should apply the standard of care for medical 
evaluat ion and treatment per local guidelines:
●The Investigator will repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value.
●The Investigator will fo llow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory  clinical  
resol ution.
A laboratory  test value that requires a subject to be discont inued fro m study  drug 
treatm ent or requi res a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as a n AE.  The central 
laboratory  chosen for thi s study  will provi de instructi ons regarding the co llection, 
processing and shipping of these samples.  The baseline laboratory test results for clinical 
assessment for a particular test will be defined as the las t measurement pri or to the init ial 
dose of study  drug.

b. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits.  A 
microscopic analysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, 
or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
c. INR will o nly be measured if ALT and/or AST > 3 × ULN.  A separate blood sample for INR testing will be 
needed to measure INR at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.
d. A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential at the Screening Visit 
and if any post -baseline urine pregnancy is positive.
e. At Screening only.  For subjects in China and Japan, or where mandated by local requirements:  for subjects with 
HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening, the H BV-DNA PCR test should be performed 
again every 12 weeks.  Retesting every 12 weeks is not necessary with subjects that have a history of HBV vaccine 
and is HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab–.
f. All subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a ri sk assessment form ( Appendix E) and 
tested for TB infection by QuantiFERON -TB Gold test analyzed by the central laboratory.  The PPD Skin Test 
shoul d be utilized only when an IGRA is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local 
guidelines).

g. Starting from Baseline (Day 1) the hs -CRP results will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site 
personnel, or the subje ct.  For safety evaluations of signs and symptoms of infection and management of adverse 
events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin.  Results of tests such as hs -CRP, and procalcitonin may be 
blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a 
possible safety assessment or adverse event management.  Any local hs -CRP, CRP, or serial procalcitonin tests 
reported to the investigator until a subject is known to receive upadacitinib or until treatment allocation is 
unblinded will be recorded as protocol deviations.
h. At screening for female subjects < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of 
permanent surgical sterilization.
i. Japan only.  If the res ult from the central lab is indeterminate or otherwise not interpretable, a local lab may be 
used.
j. Anti-HIV Ab will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited by local regulations.  The Investigator must discuss 
any local reporting requirements to loc al health agencies with the subject.  The site will report confirmed positive 
results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the 
Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential im plications to the subject 's health and subject should 
receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results 
indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not receive results from the te sting and will not be made aware of 
any positive result.
k. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential at the Baseline Visit prior 
to the first dose of study drug and all subsequent visits.  If the baseline u rine pregnancy test performed at the site is 
negative, then dosing with study drug may begin.  If the baseline urine pregnancy test performed at the site is 
positive, dosing with study drug must be withheld and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The seru m pregnancy 
test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug 
must be withheld and the subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment.  In the event a serum pregnancy 
test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required ≥ 3 days later to document continued lack of a positive result.  
If a urine pregnancy test post -baseline is positive, study drug must be temporarily discontinued and a serum 
pregnancy test is required.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory.  If the 
serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug must be permanently discontinued.
HIV Test
Subjects wi th HIV infecti on are excluded from study  parti cipat ion.  HIV antibody  (Ab) 
testin g will  be perform ed at Screening.  The Investigator must discuss any  local reporting 
requi rements to l ocal heal th agencies wit h the subject.  The site will report confirmed 
positive results to their health agency  per l ocal regul ations, if necessary .  If a subject has a 
confirmed posit ive HIV Ab result, the Investigator must discuss with the subject the 
potenti al implicat ions to the subject 's heal th and subject should receive or be referred for 
clinical care prompt ly.  A subject will not be eligible for stud y participat ion if test results 
indicate a posit ive HIV infect ion (HIV Ab posi tive).

Hepatitis Screening
All subjects will be tested for the presence of the Hepatit is B Virus (HBV) at Screening.
Hepatitis B:
Subjects will be tested for the presence of HB V at screening using the fo llowing tests:
●HBs Ag (Hepatit is B surface ant igen)

A posi tive result for HBs Ag will be exclusio nary.
A negat ive result for HBs Ag will be tested (automatic reflex testing) for core antibodies 
(HBc Ab) and surface antibodies (HBs Ab).
●A negat ive test result for HBc Ab does not require HBV DNA PCR qualitat ive 
testing and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 2, Scenarios A and B).  For a 
subject who has had a HBV vaccinat ion (should document in the medical 
history ), the HBV DNA PCR quali tative testing is not requi red and the subject 
may be enrolled.  For subjects without a history of HBV vaccination (and 
where mandated by  local requi rements) a posi tive result for HBs Ab requires 
HBV DNA PCR testing (automat ic reflex testing).  ( Figure 2, Scenari o B).*
●A posi tive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automat ic

* For subjects who have had a HB V vaccination (should be documented in the medical history), a positive test result 
for HBs Ab is expected and these subjects may be enrolled.  For subjects without a history of HBV vaccination 
(and where mandated by local requirements.  a positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing.
** For China, Japan and South Korea, or where mandated by local requirements; subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc

weeks.  HBV DNA PCR testing every 12 weeks is not necessary when the subject has a history of HBV vaccine 
and is HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab –.  If necessary, HBV DNA PCR may be tested at unscheduled visits.
Hepatitis C:
All subjects will be tested for the presence of Hepati tis C Vi rus ant ibodies (HCV Ab) at 
Screening.  Samples positive for HCV Ab require PCR qualitat ive testing for HCV RNA.  
Any HCV RNA PCR result that meets or exceeds detection sensit ivity will  be 
exclusio nary.  Subjects wi th a history  of treated H CV infect ion may be allowed to enroll 
if documentation of effective treatment is available and no evidence of HCV is detected 
by HCV RNA PCR.

Randomization and Drug Assignment
All Screening laboratory  resul ts must be reviewed, si gned and dated by  the Princ ipal 
Invest igator or Sub -invest igator prior to the Baseline Visit.  Subjects will not be enrolled 
into the study  if laboratory  or other Screening result abnormalit ies are deemed clinically 
significant by  the Principal Invest igator or Sub -investigator.
Subjects will  be eligible for randomizat ion if they continue to meet all o f the select ion 
criteria (Secti on 5.2) at the Baseline Visit and are willing to conti nue in the study .  
Subjects will be rando mized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio using an Interactive Response 
Techno logy (IRT) to receive double -blind study  drug in one of the fo llowing treatm ent 
groups:
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 410)
●Group 2:  Upadaci tinib 30 m g QD (N = 410)
●Group 3:  ADA (40 mg every  other week [eow]) (N = 410) 
●Group 4:  Pl acebo followed by upadacit inib 15 mg QD (N = 205)
●Group 5:  Pl acebo followed by upadacit inib 30 mg QD (N = 205)
No m ore than approximately 15% subjects will be enrolled with conco mitant use of HCQ, 
sulfasalazine, bucillamine, or igurat imod.
Randomization will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body  surface area [BSA] or 
< 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, presence of dact ylitis, and presence o f 
enthesitis, except for subjects from China and Japan, where rando mization for each 
country  will be stratified by extent of psori asis ( ≥ 3% body  surface area [BSA] or < 3% 
BSA) only.  See Section 5.5.3 for details.
Upon approval o f protocol  amendment 7, subj ects receiving upadacit inib 30 mg QD will

Study  Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Co mpliance
Study  drug will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day  1) and as specified in 
Appendix C.  The first dose of study  drug will be administered after all other Baseline 
(Day  1) procedures are completed.  Subjects will maintain a diary  through Week 151 
(except for subjects in China where the paper subject diary is reinstated) for all study  drug 
administered (i.e., at home) to c apture dosing dates and times.  At visits specified in 
Appendix C, the si te personnel will review and retain a copy  of the di ary, returned study  
drug ki ts, and em pty study  drug packaging to verify  com pliance.  Diaries will not be 
dispensed bey ond Week 140 (except for subjects in China where the paper subject diary is 
reinstated); dosing compliance will be captured during the drug accountabilit y proce ss for 
each subject in the IRT sy stem .
Due to a state of emergency or pandemic situat ion, study  drug may  be shipped di rectly to 
subjects per instructions fro m AbbVie, as l ocal regul ations allow.
All relevant dosing informat ion will be entered into the eCRF at each visit.  ADA/placebo 
for ADA study  drug can be self -administered, or administered to subjects by  study  site 
medical staff or designee (subject, friend, family member, or health care professio nal) 
during the visit at Baseline.  Subjects or a designa ted family member or friend will be 
trained to administer study  drug at thi s visi t.
Refer to Section 5.5for addi tional informat ion.
Subject Diary
During the Baseline Visit, subjects will be dispensed a paper subject diary and will be 
trained on how to complete the diary by site staff.  Subjects will be asked to notate their 
concomitant medicat ion use, AEs, and document date and times of doses of stud y drug 
taken between study  visits.  The subject di ary will be reviewed by site personnel wit h the 
subject at each visit and a review and descript ion of the subject diary  notations will  be 
docum ented in the subject 's source documentati on and recorded on the applicable eCRF.  
Replacement diaries will be dispensed as needed should a subject misplace a subject

maintained at the site as source documentation.  Diaries will not be dispensed beyo nd 
Week 140; conco mitant m edicat ion use and AEs will be documented in the subject 's 
source documentation during study  visits and recorded on the applicable eCRF .  For si tes 
in China, paper subject diary will be reinstated for subjects to reco rd their concomitant 
medicat ion use, AEs and document date and time for doses of study  drug taken between 
study  visits through Week 259 and will be collected at Week 260 visit.  Paper subject 
diary will be docum ented as subject 's source document and will b e recorded on the 
applicable eCRF.
Patient Questionnaires
Subjects will co mplete the fo llowing quest ionnaires as specified in Appendix C.  A

Investigator Assessments
The invest igator assessments will be recorded on paper worksheets and entered into the 
eCRF and conducted at the study  visits specified in Appendix C.  For the foll owing 
assessment, if possible, the invest igator assessments should be performed by an 
independent and blinded assessor who should not perform any other study  related 
procedures.

In order to minimize variabilit y, the same assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit 
for the durati on ofthe trial.  A back- up assessor shoul d be i dentified.  The assessor should 
be a qualified medical pro fessio nal (e.g., nurse, physician's assistant, or physician) or be 
pre-approved by the TA MD as an assessor after review of assessor training and 
experienc e.  Any assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments.  
It is the responsibilit y of the Invest igator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and 
trained to perform assessments and that all training is documented.  If the assessor is not 
available, the pre -identified back- up assessor should perform such assessments.

The PGA -Disease Act ivity will be conducted to assess the subject 's curre nt disease 
activit y, taking into consi derat ion both arthrit is and psoriasis act ivity, independent of the 
subject 's self -assessment, using a 0 –10 NRS, anchored at either end by opposite 
adjectives.
The assessor is not required to be independent but should be a qualified medical 
professio nal, preferably  a physician.
Health Resource Utilizat ion (HRU) Questionnaire
Sites will co mplete a HRU questionnaire at the study  visits specified in Appendix C.  The 
questi onnai re will  be interview administered by  the si te.  The assessor is not required to 
be independent and may be a qualified medical professio nal or a study  coordinator.  The 
answers will be completed on the source worksheet provided by the sponsor and entered 
in the eCRF.
Psori asis Assessments
Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 48
The PASI is a measure of psori asis severi ty.  Four anatomic sites –head, upper 
extremit ies, trunk, and lower extremit ies –are assessed for ery thema, indurat ion and 
desquamat ion using a 5 -point scale.  Based on the extent of lesio ns in a given anatomic 
site, the area affected i s assigned a numerical value.
Since the head, upper extremit ies, trunk and lower extremit ies correspond to 
approximately  10, 20, 30 and 40% of body surface area, respectively; the PASI score is 
calculated using the formula:
PASI = 0.1(E h+ Ih+ D h)Ah+ 0.2(E u+ Iu+ D u)Au+ 0.3(E t+ It+ D t)At + 0.4(E l+ Il
+ D l)Al
ABT -494

Where E, I, D , and A denote ery thema, indurati on, desquam ation, and area, respectively , 
and h, u, t , and l denote head, upper extremit ies, trunk, and lower extremit ies, 
respectively .  PASI scores range fro m 0.0 to 72.0 wi th the highest score represent ing 
complete ery throderm a of the severest possi ble degree.
Typically  scores of 3 or l ess represent mild disease, scores over 3 and up and including 
15represent moderate disease and scores over 15 are considered to be associated with 
severe disease.
The assessor should be a n independent qualified medical professio nal.
Body Surface Area (BSA) –Psoriasis
The subject 's right or l eft hand shoul d be selected as the measuring device.  For purposes 
of clinical est imation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be 
approximately  equivalent to 1%.  Measurement of the total area of invo lvement is aided 
by imagining if scattered pl aques were m oved so that they  were next to each other and 
then est imating the total area invo lved.
The assessor should be an in dependent qualified medical professio nal.
Static Investi gator Gl obal Assessment (sIGA)
The sIGA i s a 5-point score ranging fro m 0 to 4, based on the invest igator 's assessment of 
the average elevat ion, ery thema, and scaling of all psoriat ic lesio ns.
The ass essment i s considered "static"which refers to the patient 's disease state at the time 
of the assessments, without comparison to any  of the pat ient's previ ous disease states, 
whether at Baseline or at a previous visit.
A lower score indicates less body  coverage, with 0 being clear and 1 being almo st clear.
The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professio nal.

TJC and SJC Assessment
TJC Assessment
An assessment of 68 jo ints will be done for tenderness by pressure manipulat ion on 
physical exam ination.  Joint pain/tenderness will be classified as:  present, absent, 
replaced or no assessment.  Joints injected with corticosteroid will be considered non -
evaluable for 90 days fro m the time of the inject ion.
The assessor should be an independent qual ified medical professio nal.
SJC Assessment
An assessment of 66 jo ints will be done by directed physical examinat ion.  The jo ints to 
be examined for swelling are the same as those examined for tenderness, except the hip 
joints are excl uded.  Joi nt swelling will be classified as present, absent, replaced or no 
assessment.  Joints injected with corticosteroid will be considered non -evaluable for 
90days from the time of the inject ion.
The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professio nal.
Dactyl itis
Leeds Dactylitis Index (LDI 49)
This evaluat ion will be conducted to a ssess the presence or absence of dact ylitis in all 
20of the subject 's digi ts.  The assessment shoul d begin wi th visual inspecti on of the hands 
and feet.  For each pair of digit s in which one or both digits appear dactylit ic, the 
circumference of the affec ted di gits (both ri ght and left si de) will be assessed using a 
dactylo meter.  Addit ionally, the affected digit pairs will be assessed for tenderness by 
squeezing the digital shaft mid -way between the metacarpophalangeal and proximal 
interphalangeal jo ints and will be recorded as tenderness, y es or no.  Tenderness should 
not be assessed by squeezing the jo int lines.  Digit s injected wi th corti costeroi d will be 
considered non -evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection.  If a digit is missing

M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
92
and its contral ateral  digit is dact ylitic, "digit absent "will be recorded for the missing digit.  
For any  digit without an available dacylo meter measurement the standard reference value 
will be ut ilized in calculat ion of the LDI.  The standard reference values w ill not be 
entered into the eCRF.  A dactylo meter will be provided to sites for use.
The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professio nal.
Enthesit is
Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI)
This evaluat ion will be conducted to assess the presence or a bsence of enthesit is at 
3bilateral sites.  Tenderness on examinat ion is recorded as either present, absent, or not 
assessed for each of the 6 sites, for an overall score range of 0 –6.  Enthesit is sites 
injected wi th corti costeroi d will be considered non -evaluable for 90 days from the time of 
the inject ion.
The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professio nal.
Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Enthesitis Index
This evaluat ion will be conducted to assess the presence or absence of enthesit is at 
9bilateral sites.  Tenderness on examinat ion is recorded as either present, absent, or not 
assessed for each of the 18 sites.  For scoring purposes, the inferior patella and tibial 
tuberosi ty are consi dered to be one si te due to thei r anatomical proximit y.  The overall 
score range is 0 –16.  Enthesit is sites injected with corticosteroid will be considered non -
evaluable for 90 days fro m the time of the inject ion.
The Lateral  epicondyle and Achilles tendon insertion will only  need to be assessed once 
since the 2 bilateral sites overlap between the LEI and SPARCC Enthesit is Index.
The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professio nal.

Psoriatic Spondylitis
This evaluat ion will be conducted at Baseline only as a singl e quest ion asking the 
investi gator to take into consideration all that is known about the subject to assess whether 
or not the subject has psoriatic spondylit is.  Responses will be recorded as y es or no.  This 
evaluat ion shoul d be assessed by the rheumatol ogist invest igator.
5.3.1.2 Optional Samples for Exploratory Research and Validation 
Studies
Subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory  research and validat ion 
studi es.  Subj ects m ay st ill participate in the main study even if they decide not to 
participate in the optional co llection of samples for exploratory  research/validat ion 
studi es.
Exploratory  research can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond 
to drugs and our abilit y to predi ct which subjects woul d benefit fro m receiving specific 
therapi es.  In addi tion, expl oratory  research may  help to improve our understanding o f 
how to di agnose and assess/mo nitor PsA by  assessing associat ions between disease 
characteri stics, outcom es data and bio markers of interests.
Validat ionstudi es, including those related to the development of potential in- vitro 
diagnosti c tests m ay be carri ed out retrospectively in order to assess associat ions between 
events of interest (i.e., efficacy and/or safet y events) and candidate bio markers.
For Ja pan only:  The research on DNA and RNA exploratory research samples will be 
restri cted to the subject 's response to the treatment in terms o f pharmacokinet ics, efficacy , 
tolerabilit y, and safety .
AbbVie (or people or companies working wit h AbbVie) will sto re the exploratory 
research/validation studies samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confident iality.  The samples will  be retained while research on upadacit inib (or

drugs of thi s class) or PsA and related condit ions continue s, but for no l onger than 
20years after study  com pletion.
All subjects are preferred to have been fasting for a minimum of 8 hours prior to sample 
collect ion.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen 
circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study  source docum entati on.  
The fo llowing samples will be co llected according to Appendix Dfor each subject who 
consents to provi de samples for exploratory  research/validat ion studi es:
●DNA samples for pharmacogenetic or epigenetic analyses;
●RNA samples for transcriptomic and/or epigenet ic analyses;
●Serum  and plasma samples for sy stemic analyses, including but not limite d to 
proteomic and metabo lomics;
●Urine samples, including but not limited to targeted protein and metabo lomic 
analyses .
The procedures for obtaining and document ing inform ed consent are di scussed in 
Secti on9.4.
Samples will  be shipped to AbbVie or a designated laboratory  for RNA/DNA extracti on, 
if applicable, and/or analyses or long- term storage.  Instructi ons for the preparati on and 
shipment of th e sam ples will  be provi ded in the l aboratory  manual.
5.3.2 Drug Concentration Measurements
Blood Samples for upadacitinib PK Assay (Period 1 Only)
Blood sam ples (pl asma) for assay  of upadaci tinib and possibly other medicat ions will be 
collected as fo llows (Appendix C):
●Weeks 2 and 4 prior to oral study  drug dosing;
●Weeks 8 and bey ond at any  time during the visit.  For subjects who 
prem aturely  discontinue f rom study  drug treatment prior to Week 56, at any

On Week 2 and Week 4 visit days, if possible, subjects should take the oral study  drug 
dose at the clinic after collect ing the PK blood sample, except if the subjects regularly 
take the study  drug dose at ni ght.  Those subj ects who regularly take the oral study  drug 
dose at ni ght shoul d cont inue to take study drug according to their normal schedule.  For 
all other visits, subjects can take the study drug dose on visit days at their regul ar schedule 
and not necessarily at the clinic.
For all PK samples, the date and accurate time of the PK sample collection will be 
recorded on the lab requisit ion form.  The date and accurate time of the last two study  
drug doses will be recorded on t he eCRF to the nearest minute.
Refer to the study  specific l aboratory  manual for detailed instructi ons on sample 
collect ion, processing, and shipment.

5.3.4 Safety Variables
Safety evaluations include AE m onitoring, physical  examinat ions, vital sign 
measurements, ECG, and clinical laboratory  testi ng (hematology , chemistry , and 
urinalysis) as a measure of safet y and tol erabili ty for the ent ire study  durati on.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Plasma upadacit inib concentrati ons will be obtained at the times indicated in Appendix C.  
A non-linear mixed -effects m odeling approach will be used to estimate the populat ion 
central  values and the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values of 
upadacit inib oral clearance (CL/F) and vo lume of di stribution (V/F).  Additional 
param eters for upadaci tinib may be est imated if useful in the interpretation of the data.

5.3.6 Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies
Optional samples m ay be collected to conduct exploratory  invest igations into known and 
novel bio markers.  The ty pes of  biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not 
limited to:  nucl eic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites.
For Japan only:  The research on DNA and RNA exploratory research samples will be 
restri cted to the subject 's response to the treatment in terms o f pharmacokinet ics, efficacy , 
tolerabilit y, and safety .
Biomarker assessments may be used to assess and generate prognostic, predict ive, 
pharmacodynamic, or surrogate bio marker signatures.  These assessments may be 
explore d in the context of PsA or related conditions and/or upadacitinib or drugs of 
similar classes.  The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be 
included wit h the study  report.
The samples may  also be used to develop new therapies, research methods or 
techno logies.  In addi tion, samples fro m this study  may be banked for future use.  
Samples may  then be used to validate putative bio marker signatures obtained fro m a 
prospective study , leading to the development of diagnostic tests.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
A subject may  withdraw from  the study  at any  time and for any  reason.  The Invest igator 
may discont inue any subject 's partici pation for any reason, including an AE, safet y 
concerns or failure to comply  with the protocol .  See Secti on 6.1.7 for toxicit y 
management cri teria.  Subjects will be wit hdrawn from study  drug treatm ent immediately 
if any one of the fo llowing occurs:
●Clinically significant abnormal laboratory  resul t(s) or AE(s), whi ch rul e out 
continuat ion of the study  drug, as determined by the Invest igator or the 
AbbVie TA MD.

●Serious infect ions (e.g., sepsis ) which cannot be adequately controlled within 
2weeks by anti -infect ive treatment or would put the subject at risk for 
continued participation in the trial as determined by the Invest igator.
●The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subj ect.
●The subject requests withdrawal fro m study  drug or the study .
●Inclusio n and exclusio n criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study  drug, when continuat ion of the study  drug woul d place the subject at risk 
as determined by  the AbbVie TA MD.
● Introduction of prohibited medicat ions or dosages when cont inuat ion of the 
study  drug woul d place the subject at risk as determined by the AbbVie TA 
MD.
●Subject is non -compliant with TB prophylaxis (if applicable) or develops 
active TB at any  time dur ing the study .
●The subject beco mes pregnant while on study  drug.
●Malignancy , except for l ocalized NMSC or carcinoma in -situ of  the cervix.
●Subjects wi th disease progression or not responding to treatment are to be 
withdrawn from  study  drug treatm ent based on investi gator 's discreti on.
●Starti ng at Week 36, subjects who fail to show at least 20% improvement in 
either or both TJC and SJC co mpared to baseline at 2 consecut ive visits will be 
discontinued fro m study  drug treatment.
●The subject experiences a serio us hypersensit ivity reacti on without an 
alternat ive etio logy
●The invest igator determines the subject is significant ly non-compliant with

●Subject develops a major cardiovascular event (MACE: acute myocardial 
infarction or stroke) 
●Subject develops a new ECG change considered clinically s ignificant and with 
reasonable possibilit y of being related to study  drug
Subjects will have adalimumab study  drug treatment discont inued immediately if any o f 
the following occur:
●Subject develops new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure
●Subject is diagnosed with lupus- like syndrome, mult iple sclerosis, or 
demyelinat ing disease.
In order to minimize missing data for safet y and efficacy assessments, subjects who 
prem aturely  discontinue study  drug treatm ent should continue to be fo llowed for all 
regul arly scheduled visits as outlined in Appendix C, and adhere to all study  procedures 
except for di spensing study  drug, annual  TB testing, PK sam ple collect ion, and blood 
sample collect ion for opti onal expl oratory  research and valida tion studi es unless they  have 
decided to discont inue the study participation ent irely (wi thdrawal of informed consent).  
In addi tion, all future rescue and efficacy driven discontinuation criteria no longer apply .  
Subjects should be advised on the continu ed scientific importance of their data even if 
they discont inue treatment with study  drug early.
If a subject is discont inued fro m study  drug, the procedures outlined for the PD Visit 
shoul d be com pleted as soon as possible, preferably  within 2 weeks of th e last dose of 
study  drug, and preferably  prior to the ini tiation of another therapy .  In addi tion, if subject 
is willing, 30- day follow-up visi t (or phone call  if a visi t is not possible) may  occur to 
determine the status of any  ongoing AEs/SAEs or occurr ence of any new AEs/SAEs.  For 
subjects on subcutaneous study  drug, if the subject is willing, a 70 -day follow-up phone 
call may  occur to determine the status of any  ongoing AEs/SAEs, the occurrence of any  
new AEs/SAEs, and medications used to treat AEs/SA Es.  The fo llow-up visit/phone call 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
103
following the last dose of study  drug will not occur for subjects who begin co mmercially 
available upadacit inib or adalimumab.   Subjects who discont inue the study prematurely 
after randomizat ion will not be replaced.
Allattem pts m ust be m ade to determine the date of the last study  drug dose and the 
primary  reason for discont inuat ion of study  drug or study  parti cipat ion.  The information 
will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not 
interfere wi th the ini tiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalit ies that the 
Invest igator feels are necessary to treat the subject 's condi tion.  Foll owing discont inuat ion 
of the study  drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Inves tigator 's best 
clinical judgment.
Lost to Follow- Up
For subjects that are considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must 
be made and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source 
docum ents.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prem aturely , either in its entiret y or at any  site.  The 
study  will be discont inued or terminated in case of an unaccepta ble ri sk, any relevant 
toxicity, request of regulatory  agency and/or ethi cs commissi on, withdrawal of the license 
to manufacture the study  drug, wi thdrawal  of the permissi on to import the study  drug, or a 
negat ive change in the risk/benefit assessment.   This might include the occurrence of AEs 
with a character, severit y or frequency  that i s new in com parison to the existing risk 
profile.   In addi tion, data deriving fro m other clinical trials or toxico logical studi es which 
negat ively influence the risk/benef it assessment might cause discont inuat ion or 
termination o f the study .
The invest igator may also stop the study at their site if they have safet y concerns.   If 
AbbVie terminates the study  for saf ety reasons, AbbVie will prompt ly notify the

investi gator.   Advance noti ce is not required by  either party  if the study  is stopped due to 
safet y concerns.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
There are two active study  drugs in this study .  The first i s daily  upadaci tinib and the 
second is ADA eow.
Upadacit inib (or ma tching pl acebo) will be taken orally  once daily , beginning on Day  1 
(Baseline), and should be taken at approximately the same t ime each day.  The study  drug 
can be taken with or without food.  Subjects will continue their stable background 
non-biologic DMA RD therapy .  AbbVie will  not supply  background DMARDs.
ADA (or m atching pl acebo) will be provided as a subcutaneous injection so lution in 1 mL 
pre-filled syringes containing ADA 40 mg/0.8 mL (or matching placebo).  ADA (or 
matching placebo) will be subcuta neously administered eow at approximately the same 
time of day .
Subjects taking MTX as background therapy  should take a di etary  supplement of oral 
folic acid beginning on Day  1 (Baseline) throughout study  parti cipat ion.  Folic acid 
dosing and timing of reg imen should be fo llowed according to the Investigator 's 
instructi ons.  AbbVie will not supply  folic aci d (or equivalent, such as fo linic acid).
Subjects will receive both oral study  drug QD (ei ther upadaci tinib 15 mg, upadacit inib 
30mg, or matching placeb o) and subcutaneous study  drug eow (ei ther ADA 40 m g or 
matching placebo).  When the last subject completes the Week 56 visit, study  drug 
assignment in both periods will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be dispensed 
study  drug in an open -label fashion until the co mpletion of Period 2.
Upon approval o f protocol  amendment 7, subj ects receiving upadacit inib 30 mg QD will 
be switched to upadacitinib 15 mg QD at their next scheduled study  visit.

Each ki t will be labeled as required per country  requi rements.  Labels must remain affixed 
to the ki ts.  All  blank spaces on the l abel will be completed by  the si te staff pri or to 
dispensing to the subjects.
5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs
Upadacit inib must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F).  
Adalimumab and placebo for adalimumab pre -filled syringesare to be stored protected 
from light at 2°C to 8°C/36°F to 46°F.  Adalimumab and placebo for ADA must not be 
frozen at any  time.  A storage temperature log is to be maintained to document proper 
storage condit ions.  The refrigerator temperature must be r ecorded on a temperature log to 
record proper funct ion.  Malfunctions or any temperature excursio ns must be reported to 
the Sponsor immediately.  Study  medicat ion should be quarant ined until AbbVie deems 
the medicat ion as acceptable.  The invest igational p roducts are for investigat ional use only  
and are to be used only wit hin the context of this study.  The study drug supplied for this 
study  must be m aintained under adequate securit y and stored under the condit ions 
specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroy ed on si te as appropri ate.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects m eeting eligibilit y criteria will be centrally  randomized using an IRT sy stem.  
Before the study  is initiated, IRT di rections will be provi ded t o each site.
At the Screening Visit, subjects will be assigned a unique subject number by the IRT.  
The unique subject number will be used for each subject throughout the study.  For 
subjects that re -screen, the Screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial Screening 
visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested.
Subjects who meet the inclusio n and exclusio n criteria defined in Sect ion 5.2.1 and 
Secti on 5.2.2 will be centrally  randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 rati o to one of five treatment 
groups at Baseline (Day  1) as foll ows:
● Group 1:  Upadacitinib (ABT- 494) 15 m g QD (N = 410)
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
107
● Group 2:  Upadacitinib (ABT- 494) 30 m g QD (N = 410)
●Group 3:  ADA (40 mg every  other week [eow]) (N = 410)
●Group 4:  Pl acebo followed by upadacit inib 15 mg QD (N = 205)
●Group 5:  Pl acebo followed by upadacit inib 30 mg QD (N = 205)
No m ore than approximately 15% of subjects will be enrolled wit h conco mitant use of 
HCQ, sulfasalazine, bucillamine, or iguratimod.
Subjects will receive both oral study  drug QD (upadaci tinib 15 mg, upadacit inib 30 mg, or 
matching placebo) and subcutaneous study  drug eow (ei ther ADA 40 m g or m atching 
placebo) until all subjects have co mpleted Period 1 (Week 56) and sites and subjects are 
unblinded to study  treatment.  Randomization will be stratified by  extent of psori asis 
(≥3% body  surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, 
presence of dact ylitis, and presence of enthesit is, except for subjects from China and 
Japan, where rando mizat ion for each country  will be stratified by  extent of psori asis 
(≥3% b ody surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) only .
The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject 's treatm ent 
group assignment according to the randomizat ion schedule generated by  the Data 
Sciences and Stati stics Departments at AbbVie.
IRT will provide the appropriate study  drug ki t number(s) to dispense to each subject.  
Study  drug will be administered at the study  visits as summarized in Section 5.3.1.1 .  
Returned study  drug shoul d not be re -dispensed to any subject.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects should take study  drugs as outlined in Section 5.5.1 .
On dosing days that occur on study  visit days, subjects shoul d follow the regular dosing 
schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2 regarding Week 2 and Week 4 visit s).
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
108
Each subject 's dosing schedule shoul d be cl osely m onitored by  the si te at each study  visit 
through Week 151 (except for subjects in China where the paper subject diary is 
reinstated) by careful  review of the subject 's diary.  This will ensure that all subjects 
enrolled into the study maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first 
dose of study  drug (Baseline/Day 1).  Diaries will not be dispensed bey ond Week 140 
(except for subjects in China where the paper subject diary  is reinstated); dosing 
compliance will  be captured during the drug accountabilit y process for each subject in the 
IRT system.
Upadacit inib/Placebo (daily dosing):
●If a subject shoul d forget to take th eir upadaci tinib (or m atching pl acebo) dose 
at thei r regularly scheduled dosing t ime, they should take the forgotten dose as 
soon as they  remember the dose was missed as long as it is at least 10 hours 
before their next scheduled dose.  If a subject only r emembers the missed dose 
within 10 hours before next scheduled dose, the subject should skip the missed 
dose and take the next dose at the scheduled time.
●If the subject experiences a study  drug interrupti on > 14 consecutive days 
during the first 24 weeks or > 21 consecut ive days after Week 24, they should 
notify their study  site physician, and the subject should be discontinued from 
study  drug treatm ent.  If study  drug treatm ent is interrupted or withdrawn in 
Periods 1 or 2, both oral and subcutaneous stud y drug administration must be 
stopped.
ADA/Placebo (biweekly  dosing):
●Biweekly  ADA (or m atching pl acebo) shoul d be injected the same day  and 
approximately  the same t ime every other week.  If the subject should forget to 
inject their subcutaneous study  drug on thei r regularly  scheduled dosing date, 
they shoul d inject the forgotten dose as soon as they  remember the dose was 
missed up to the day  before thei r scheduled dose.  The subject must not 
administer two inject ions on the same day .

●If the subject experi ences a study  drug interrupti on of  > 2 consecut ive missed 
doses during the first 24 weeks or > 3 consecutive missed doses after Week 24, 
they shoul d notify  their study  site physician, and the subject should be 
discontinued fro m study  drug.  If study  drug t reatment is interrupted or 
withdrawn in Peri ods 1 or 2, both oral  and subcutaneous study  drug 
administrati on must be stopped.
Refer to Appendix Ffor inject ion instructions.
5.5.5 Blinding
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
All AbbVie personnel wit h direct oversi ght of the conduct and management of the trial 
(with the except ion of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), the Invest igator, study 
site personnel , and the subject will remain blinded to each subject 's treatm ent throughout 
the study .  In order to maintain the blind, the upadacit inib/placebo tablets and 
adalimumab/matching placebo sy ringes provi ded for the study  will be i dentical  in 
appearance.  The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment informat ion in 
the case of medical emergency.
In the event of a medical situat ion that requi res unblinding of the study  drug assignment, 
the Invest igator is requested to contact the AbbVie TA MD prior to breaking the blind.  
However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary  which warrants breaking the 
blind pri or to con tacting the AbbVie TA MD, the Investigator can direct ly access the IRT 
system  to break the blind without AbbVie notificatio n or agreement.  Unblinding is 
available in the IRT system via the Unblind Subject transact ion, which is available only to 
the Invest igator.  If the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may occur by contacting 
EndPoint technical support via eit her phone (pre ferred) or email 
(support@endpo intclinical.co m).  For coun try-specific phone numbers, please see the 
following website:  http://www.endpointclinical.com/helpdesk/.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
110
In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the AbbVie TA MD, AbbVie 
reques ts that the AbbVie TA MD be notified wit hin 24 hours of the blind being broken.  
The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and recorded 
on the appropri ate eCRF.
After the last subject completes the Week 24 visit the Sponsor w ill be unblinded to study  
drug assi gnment to facilitate regulatory  filings.  When the last subject completes the last 
visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study  drug assignment will be unblinded to the sites, and 
subjects will be dispensed study  drug in an open -label fashio n unt il the co mpletion of 
Period 2.
5.5.5.2 Blinding of Data for Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee (DMC) comprised of persons external to 
AbbVie and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safet y data fro m 
the ongoi ng study .  If necessary  to ensure subject safet y, the DMC will also be given 
access to selected efficacy data which will be specified in the DMC charter.  The primary  
responsibilit y of the DMC will be to protect the safety  of the subje cts parti cipating in this 
study .
Addit ionally, the external DMC will review efficacy  data after at l east 600 subj ects have 
completed the Week 12 Vi sit or have prem aturely di scontinued fro m the study .  The 
interim analysis is to assess if the study  met the pre-defined No -Go boundary for the 
primary  endpoint ACR20.
A DMC charter will be prepared for the safet y and efficacy data review outside of the 
protocol  and will  describe the rol es and responsibilit ies of the DMC members, frequency 
of data revi ews, and re levant safet y and efficacy data to be assessed.
Communicat ions from the DMC to the Study  Team  will not contain informat ion that 
could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.

5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The invest igator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study  drug only to subjects enrolled in the study  in accordance with 
the protocol.  The study  drug m ust not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol .
Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject diary through Week 151 (except for subjects 
in China where the paper subject diary  will be recorded through Week 259).   Subjects will 
be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empt y) to the study  site personnel at 
each clinic vis it.  The study  site personnel  will docum ent com pliance in the study  source 
docum ents.  Dosing compliance will be captured during the drug accountabilit y process 
for each subject in the IRT system.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The Investigator or his/her representat ive will verify that study  drug supplies are received 
intact, at the appropri ate tem perature (US/Puerto Rico is cool to touch and outside the US 
temperature recording devices, i.e., Temptales provided in shipments) and in the correct 
amounts.  This will be docum ented by signing and dating the Proof of Receipt or similar 
docum ent and by registering the arrival of drug through the IRT.  The original Proof of 
Receipt Note and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in the site files as a record of 
what was rec eived.
In addi tion, an IRT will be used to document investigat ional product accountabilit y 
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number, and the ident ificat ion of the person dispensing the drug.
All empty/used study  drug packaging including pre -filled syringes will be inventoried by 
the site.  Each subject will be given their own Sharps container to dispose of used 
syringes.  Em pty/used study  drug packaging and Sharps containers should be returned by 
the subject at each visit for accountabilit y and compliance purposes.  Site staff will 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
112
complete study  drug accountabilit y via IRT, source documents, subject dosing diaries, 
empty IP boxes and by visually inspect ing the packaging whenever possible.
After drug accountabilit y has been co mpleted by  the si te, em pty used packaging may  be 
discarded wi th any subject i dentifiers removed or returned to AbbVie- designated 
destruction depot.
Unused study  drug and used packaging wit h rem aining study  drug will be dest royed on 
site according to l ocal procedures or regulat ions or returned to the AbbVie -designated 
destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie 's docum entati on requi rements 
for on-site destructi on).
For si tes performing on -site drug destructi on or using a thi rd-party  vendor for drug 
destruction a copy  of the destructi on methodol ogy and date of destructi on/date prepared 
for destructi on shoul d be maintained at the site 's facility.  Moni tors will  reconcile the si te's 
process, source documents, subje ct's dosing diaries, IRT or site accountabilit y records, 
and destruction records to assure site compliance.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This study  includes two peri ods.
Period 1 i s 56- weeks in duration and includes a 24 week rando mized, double -blind, 
parallel -group, pl acebo -controlled and active -comparator controlled period fo llowed by  an 
additional 32 weeks of blinded, act ive comparator -controlled treatment (Weeks 24 –56).  
Period 1 is designed to compare the safety, tolerabilit y, and efficacy of upadacit inib 
15mg QD and upadacit inib 30 mg versus placebo and versus ADA 40 mg eow in subjects 
with moderately to severely  active PsA who have an inadequate response to n on-biologic 
DMARD t herapy.  Period 1 is designed to test the superiorit y of upadaci tinib versus 
placebo for achi eving the primary  endpoint (ACR20 at Week 12) and other efficacy 
param eters at Weeks 12 –24, and to test non -inferiori ty of upadaci tinib versus

adalimumab (ACR20 at Week 12).  At Week 24 all subjects will be given upadacit inib 
and will cont inue on blinded treatment unt il all subjects have co mpleted the last visit of 
Period 1 (Week 56).  This will allow unbiased assessments of long -term safet y of 
upadacit inib withou t com promising the study  conduct or resul ts of the ongoing study .  In 
addition, the blinded study  design will allow the assessment of the maintenance of 
treatm ent response of both doses in an unbiased manner during the first y ear of  the study .
The purpose of Period 2 i s to further evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerabili ty, and 
efficacy o f upadacit inib (15 mg QD and 30 mg QD) in PsA subjects who have completed 
Period 1.  All  subjects will cont inue treatment to which they were assigned at the end of 
Period 1 i n a blinded manner.
When the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study  drug 
assignment will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be dispensed study  drug in an 
open -label fashi on until the co mpletion of Period 2.
Adalimum ab was first approved in the United States and European Unio n for the 
treatm ent of PsA in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and is considered standard of care.  
Addit ional updates regarding approved indicat ions and safet y can be found in the current 
edition of the Package Insert and Summary  of Product Characteri stics.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard stati stical, clinical and laboratory procedures will be ut ilized in this study.  
Efficacy measurements in this study  have been selected or designed to asses s disease 
activit y in subjects with PsA.  Other than the bio marker analyses which are exploratory , 
all clinical  and laboratory  procedures in this study  are standard and generally accepted.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
The intended study  popul ation is moderately  to severely  active PsA pati ents who have had 
an inadequate response to prior non -biologic DMARD treatment.  Key  entry  criteria are to 
enroll adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 y ears of age with a clinical

diagnosis of PsA and who fulfill the CASPAR criteria with symptoms for at least 
6months.  Eligible study  subjects m ust have ≥ 3 swollen j oints (based on 66 jo int counts) 
and ≥ 3 tender j oints (based on 68 jo int counts) at Screening and Baseline V isits, and 
either ≥ 1 erosi on on x -ray of the hands or feet as determined by the central imaging 
reader or an elevated hs -CRP > l aboratory  defined ULN) at Screening.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The doses of upadacit inib selected for this study , 15 m g QD and 30 m g QD, dosed up to 
approximately  5 years, are expected to be efficacio us wi th an acceptable safet y profile.  
Two doses of upadacit inib have been selected for this study  in order to perform limit ed 
dose ranging in subjects with PsA.  The upadacit inib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD doses 
were sel ected as they  are expected to demonstrate efficacy  in the treatm ent of  patients 
with PsA while limit ing potenti al drug -related effects on laboratory  parameters (e.g., 
hemoglo bin).  Doses of 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD are t he doses that are currently being 
evaluated in Phase 3 trials in rheumatoid arthrit is (RA).  The doses being evaluated in the 
RA Phase 3 trials are considered appropriate for investigation in PsA as (1) effects of 
upadacit inib on tender and swo llen jo ints,markers of inflammation, and ACR responses 
are expected to be similar in RA and PsA; and (2) proof of concept has been demo nstrated 
with another JAK inhibitor (tofacitanib) at the doses that are efficacious in RA.  In 
addition, in RA the pl ateau for effic acy was achieved by  exposures equivalent to 30 mg 
QD, indicat ing that higher doses may not provide greater therapeutic benefit.
Results fro m two Phase 2b tri als in subjects wi th RA wi th the upadaci tinib immediate 
release capsule formulat ion indicate that a ll evaluated doses (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg 
BID, 18 m g BID, and 24 mg QD) were generally  well tolerated and wi thout unexpected 
safet y concerns.  The Phase 2 dose -response and exposure -response results in RA show 
that the 6 mg BID dose approaches the plat eau of efficacy, and increasing the dose to 
12mg BID appears to result in so me incremental  efficacy  benefi t, parti cularly in the more 
refractory  subjects wi th inadequate response or intolerance to anti -TNF bi ologic therapy .  
Therefore, upadacit inib exposu res associ ated wi th 6 mg BID and 12 m g BID were 
selected as the target exposures to evaluate in Phase 3 trials in RA.

In order to enhance pat ients'compliance and to provide a more convenient dosing 
regimen than BID administration, AbbVie developed a once -daily tablet formulation 
which will be used in the current study .
A bioavailabilit y study  has demo nstrated that 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD regimens of the 
once-daily tablet formulat ion provi de equivalent daily  AUC and com parable C max, and 
Cminto 6 m g BID and 12 m g BID, respectively , of the immediate -release capsule 
formulation used in Phase 2 studies in RA.
The m ean exposures (AUC and C max) for the highest dose that will be evaluated in this 
study  (30 m g QD) are predi cted to be l ower than the exposures associat ed wi th the no -
observed -adverse -effect l evel in the 9 -month GLP preclinical toxico logy study  in dogs 
(1.5 m g/kg/day ) and l ower than the highest mean upadacit inib exposures evaluated in 
healt hy subjects or in pat ients in previous clinical studies.
The adali mumab dose selected for this study , 40 mg SQ EOW, i s the dose marketed for 
treatm ent of patients with PsA.

A Co mplaint is any written, electronic, or oral co mmunicat ion that alleges deficiencies 
related to the physical characterist ics, identity,qualit y, purity, potency , durabili ty, 
reliabilit y, safet y, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribut ion.
Com plaint s associ ated wi th any com ponent of this investi gational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (S ection 6.2.2 ).  For adverse events (AE), please refer to 
Secti on6.1.  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The invest igator will mo nitor each subject fo r clinical and laboratory  evidence of AEs on 
a routine basis throughout the study .  The invest igator will assess and record any AE in 
detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severit y, 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24

time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the AE to study drug, and 
any act ion(s) taken.  For serious adverse events (SAE) considered as having "no 
reasonable possibilit y"of being associated with study  drug, the invest igator will provide 
an Other cause of the event.   For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of 
similar nature and severit y.  AEs, whether in response to a query , observed by  site 
personnel, or reported spontaneously  by the subject will be recorded.
All AEs will be fo llowed to a sati sfact ory concl usion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or clinical invest igation 
subject administered a pharmaceut ical product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relat ionship with this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a medicinal (investigat ional) product, whether or not 
the event is considered causally relat ed to the use of the product.
Such an event can result fro m use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as fro m accidental  or intenti onal overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in 
severi ty of a reported AE shoul d be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory  abnorm alities and 
changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they  resul t in discontinuation fro m 
the study , necessitate therapeutic medic al interventi on, and/or if the invest igator considers 
them to be AEs.
Expected manifestations of PsA (i.e., psoriasis, jo int pain and swelling, dactylit is, 
enthesit is, etc.) are not to be recorded as AEs unless the manifestation is considered to be 
a disease flare (worsening) of the underlying condition.

An elect ive surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -exist ing condit ion and the 
surgery /procedure has been pre -planned pri or to study  entry .  However, if the pre -exist ing 
condi tion deteri orates unexpectedly  during the study  (e.g., surgery  performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition fo r whi ch the elect ive surgery/procedure 
is being done w ill be considered an AE.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an AE m eets any  of the f ollowing cri teria, i t is to be reported to AbbVie as a SAE 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinio n of the invest igator, would have 
resul ted in immediate fatalit y if medical intervent ion had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal  if it had occurred i n a m ore severe form .
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject 's hospi tal stay.  This 
does not i nclude an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An ano maly detected at or after bi rth, or any  anomaly that 
results in fetal  loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condit ion that substantially  
interferes wi th the activit ies of daily living of a study  subject.  
Disabili ty is not intended to include experiences o f relat ively 
minor m edical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medica l or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion, but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgica l intervent ion to prevent any  
of the outcom es listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -
threatening, hospitalizat ion, prol ongation of hospit alizat ion, 
congenital ano maly, or persistent or si gnificant 
disabili ty/incapaci ty).  Addi tionally, any elect ive or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not 
resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.
For SAEs with the outcome o f death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest

Institute Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0), which 
can be accessed at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm#ctc.  If 
guidance for specific events is n ot available grading should be as fo llows:
Mild (Grade 1):  asymptomat ic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnost ic observations 
only; intervent ion not indicated. 
Moderate (Grade 2):  minimal, local or noninvasive intervent ion indicated; limit ing age -
approp riate instrumental act ivities of daily living (ADL).  (Instrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing mo ney, 
etc.).
Severe (Grade 3 –5): 
●Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immedi ately  life-threatening; 
hospitalizati on or prol ongation of hospi talizati on indicated; disabling; limit ing 
self-care ADL.  (Self -care ADL refer sto bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.)

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The invest igator will use the fo llowing definit ions to assess the relationship of the AE to 
the use of study  drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including t iming of the event, 
biologic pl ausibili ty, clinical  judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (inform ation) to suggest a 
causal relat ionship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consi derati on of factors incl uding timing of the event, 
biologic pl ausibili ty, clinical  judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (informat ion) to suggest a 
causal relat ionship.
For causalit y assessments, events asses sed as having a reasonable possibilit y of being 
related to the study  drug will be considered "associated. "  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibilit y of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated. "  
In addi tion, when the inves tigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an invest igator 's opinio n of no reasonable possibilit y of being related to study  drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All AEs reported from the time of study  drug administrati on until 70 days fo llowing 
discontinuat ion of subcutaneous study  drug administrati on and unt il 30 days fo llowing the 
discontinuation of oral  study  drug administrati on have elapsed will be collected, whether 
solicited or spontaneously reported by  the subject.  Subjects who discontinue study  drug 
treatm ent but continue to participate in the study  will have SAEs and non -serious A Es 
collected for the remainder of the study  parti cipat ion.  In addition, SAEs and protocol -
related nonserious AEs (AEs due to study  procedures) will be collected from the time the 
subject signed the study -specific informed consent.

Addit ionally, in order to assist the adjudicat ion process, addit ional informat ion on any 
potenti al MA CE will be collected, if applicable.
In the case of any  of the fo llowing reported events, an appropri ate suppl emental  MACE 
eCRF shoul d be co mpleted:
●Cardi ac events;
●Myocardial  infarct ion or unstable angina;
●Heart failure;
●Cerebral vascular accident and transient ischemic attack;
In the case of a reported AE of herpes zoster infectio n or a non -cardiac, non -CNS embo lic 
or thrombotic event, or is COVID -19 related, a Supplemental AE eCRF should be 
completed.
6.1.5 Serious Adverse Event and Malignancy Reporting
AbbVie is co mmit ted to continue to collect safety  information including those events that 
may occur in this trial in order to confirm this established safet y profile and to i dentify 

ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
122
any unknown potential adverse react ions, rare events, and those events with a long 
latency.  AbbVie is participat ing in an FDA -requested, TNF inhibitor class wide 
explorat ion of the rare appearance of malignancy  in subjects/patients who are 30 y ears of 
age or y ounger at the time of diagnosis.  The risk of malignancy in this age group has not 
been established and is difficult to study  due to i ts rari ty.  AbbVie appreciates y our 
attenti on to the addi tional reporting requi rements needed in this unlikely event.
In the event of a SAE, and addit ionally, any nonserious event of malignancy in subjects 
30 years of age and y ounger, whether rel ated to subcutaneous study  drug or not, the
physician will notify  Clinical  Pharmacovigilance wi thin 24 hours of the physician 
beco ming aware of the event by  entering the SAE or nonserious event of malignancy in 
subjects 30 y ears of age and y ounger data into the el ectroni c data capture (EDC) system.
SAEs that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE®system , or if RAVE is not 
operabl e, shoul d be docum ented on the SAE non -CRF forms and emailed (preferred 
route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made 
aware of the SAE.

Inform ation regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be co llected.  Pregnancies in study subjects and female partn ers of m ale 
subjects will be co llected fro m the date of the first dose through 30 day s of the last dose of 
oral study  drug and 150 day s following the l ast dose of subcutaneous study  drug.
Pregnancy in a study  subject is not considered an AE.  The medical o utcom e for either 
mother or infant, meet ing any serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous 
aborti on is consi dered a SAE and must be reported to AbbVie wit hin 24 hours of the site 
beco ming aware of the event.
Female subjects should avo id pregnanc y throughout the course of the study , starting wi th 
the Screening Visit through 150 days after the last subcutaneous study  drug administrati on 
for female subjects and through 30 days after the last oral study  drug administration.  
Results of a posit ive pre gnancy  test or confi rmation of a pregnancy  will be assessed 
starting with the Screening Visit through the final study visit.  
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
The toxi city management of the AEs including AESIs consists of safet y monitoring 
(review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and peri odic/ad hoc revi ew of  safet y issues by an 
independent external data monitoring co mmittee), interruption of study drug dosing with 
appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discont inuat ion of the subjects fro m 
study  drug.  The m anag ement of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters i s described 
below.
For subjects who discontinue study  drug but con tinue participation in the study and are on 
standard of care therapies, these toxicit y management requirements do not apply 
(including alerts from the central  lab) and any  intolerabilit y to standard of care therapies 
shoul d be managed by the prescribing physician.
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and symptoms of infect ion during and after tr eatment wi th study  drug.  Study  drug shoul d 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infectio n or an opportunist ic infect ion.  A 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
125
subject who develops a new infect ion during treatment with study  drug shoul d undergo 
prom pt diagnosti c testing appropri ate for an immunocompro mised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therapy  should be ini tiated, and the subject should be closely  
monitored.  Re -challenge with study  drug may  occur once the infect ion has been 
successfully treated.  Subjects who develop act ive TB must be permanent ly discontinued 
from study  drug.  See Secti on 5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject for 
study  drug interrupti on guidelines.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting 
study  drug unt il the episode resolves.
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If the di agnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is 
confirmed (other than due to appendicit is or m echanical injury) in a subject taking 
upadacit inib, the subject must be permanent ly discontinued fro m study  drug.
Major Cardiovascular Events (MACE):   Subjects taking upadacit inib who develop an 
acute my ocardial  infarct ion or stroke must b e permanent ly discont inued fro m study  drug.
Congestive heart failure: Subjects taking adalimumab who devel op new or worsening 
symptoms of congest ive heart failure must be permanent ly discont inued from study  drug.
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignanc y other than NMSC or carcino ma in-situ 
of the cervix must be discont inued fro m study  drug.  Information including 
histopathological results should be queried for the confirmat ion of the diagnosis.  Periodic 
skin examinat ion is recommended for subjects who are at i ncreased risk for skin cancer.  
Subjects who develop malignancies should be referred to appropriate specialists and 
managed as per standard of care.
Muscle -related symptoms:   If a subject experiences symptoms suggest ive of myosit is or 
rhabdo myolysis, consider checking CPK and aldo lase with clinical management and/or 
study  drug interrupti on as deemed appropri ate by  the treating physician.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
126
Thrombosis Events:   Subjects should be assessed for symptoms of thrombosis during the 
assessment of adverse events.  Subj ects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be 
prom ptly evaluated and treated appropriately.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmo nary embo lus, or non -cardiac, non -neuro logic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, 
subjects taking upad acitinib m ust be di scontinued fro m study  drug.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study  drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis o f COVID- 19.  
Consider interrupting study  drug in subjects who show signs and/or symptoms with 
suspicio n of COVID- 19.  Study  drug m ay be r estarted if fever is reso lved without use of 
antipyretics for 24 hours and other symptoms improved, or if 5 days have passed since the 
COVID- 19 posi tive test result (whichever comes last) .  The COVID-19 eCRF must be 
completed.
ECG Abnormality:   Subjects taking upadacit inibmust be discont inued fro m study  drug 
for a new ECG change considered clinically  significant and wi th a reasonable possibilit y 
of relationship to study  drug.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:   For any given laboratory  
abnorm ality, the Invest igator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for 
medical evaluat ion and treatment fo llowing any l ocal guidelines.  Specific toxicit y 
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory  values are described in Table 4and may  
requi re an appropri ate suppl emental  eCRF be compl eted.  For subjects with ongoing 
laboratory  abnorm alities which requi re data entry  into an eCRF, an additional eCRF 
related to subsequent laboratory  abnorm alities is only  required if the subject has relevant 
changes in history  (e.g., new onset signs or symptoms) or laboratory  values which have 
returned to normal reference range or its Baseline value fo llowed by  subsequent 
laboratory  abnorm alities meet ing toxicit y guidelines (consi dered a new event).   All 
abnorm al laboratory  tests that are considered clinically  significant by  the Invest igator will 
be followed to a satisfactory  resol ution.  If a repeat test is required per Table 4, the repeat 
testing must occur as soon as possible.

Hemoglobin If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat 
testing with a new sample.
If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline without an alte rnative 
etiology, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing with new 
sample.
If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline and an alternative 
etiology is known or the hemoglobin value remains in the normal reference 
range, the subject ma y remain on study drug at the investigator 's discretion.
If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value 
returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC)If confirmed < 1000/μL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its 
Baseline value.
Interrupt study drug if confirmed < 500/μL by repeat testing with new 
sample.  If value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value, 
restarting study drug is allowed if there is an alternative etiology identified; 
documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe 
for the subject.  Study drug should be discontinued if no alternative etiology 
can be found .
Absolute lymphocyte 
counts (ALC)If confirmed < 500/μL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its Baseline 
value.

cell count If confirmed < 2000/μL by repeat test ing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until white blood cell count returns to normal reference range 
or its Baseline value.
Platelet count If confirmed < 50,000/μL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until platelet co unt returns to normal reference range or its 
Baseline value.
AST or ALT Interrupt study drug, if any of the following scenarios are confirmed by repeat 
testing of AST/ALT:
ALT or AST > 3 ×ULN and either a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or an 
international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5:
A separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure 
INR at thetime of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test of 
INR is not needed for determination if above toxicity management

If ALT or AST > 8 ×ULN, interrupt study drug immediately, repeat testing with 
a new sample, and if repeat test confirms result contact the TA MD.
Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespect ive of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA 
PCR testing at Screening who develop the following laboratory findings should 
have HBV DNA PCR testing performed within 1 week (based on initial elevated 
value): 
ALT > 5 × ULN OR 
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alter native cause is not readily identified.
oA separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be 
needed at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption 
of study drug (unless not acceptable by local practices) and a hepatologist 
consultation should occur within 1 week for recommendation regarding 
subsequent treatment.  
Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an 
alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically 
appropriate.  If applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented 
appropriately in the eCRF.  If ALT or AST val ues return to the normal reference 
range or its Baseline value, study drug may be restarted.  If restarting study 
drug, documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be 
safe.  If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etiology for ALT 
or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is 
not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from study 
drug.  Fo r any  confirmed ALT or AST elevation > 3 ULN, complete the 
appropriate su pplemental hepatic eCRF(s).
Serum Creatinine If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the Baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test 
for serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the 
results.  If the results of the repeat testing still meet th is criterion then 
interrupt study drug and re -start study drug once serum creatinine returns to 
≤ 1.5 × Baseline value.
If confirmed serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL, interrupt study drug and re -start 
study drug once serum creatinine returns to normal reference range or its 
Baseline value.

8.1.2 Subject Accountability, Disposition and Study Drug 
Exposure
8.1.2.1 Subject Accou ntability
The fo llowing will be summarized by  site and by  treatm ent group as well as overall, 
separately  for Peri od 1 and Peri od 2 as appropri ate:  the number of subjects randomized, 
the number of subjects who received at least one dose of study  drug, the number of 
subjects who completed, and the number of subjects who prematurely discont inued study  
participat ion.
8.1.2.2 Subject Disposition
Separately for Period 1 and Period 2, the number and percentage of subjects who are 
rando mized, received at least one dose of study  drug, prem aturely  discontinued study  
drug, prematurely discont inued study  parti cipat ion, and completed will be summarized by 
treatm ent group and overall.  Reasons for premature discont inuat ion of study  drug and 
study  participati on will be summarized separately for all rando mized subjects by 
treatm ent group and overall, wit h frequencies and percentages by reason for 
discontinuat ion.
8.1.2.3 Study Drug Exposure
Exposure to study  drug will be summarized for the Safet y Analysis Set for Period 1 alone 
as well as for Peri od 1 and Peri od 2 com bined.  The exposure to study  drug (day s) will be 
summarized wit h the m ean, standard deviat ion, median, and range for each treatment 
group.  The exposure to study  drug i s defined as the difference between the dates of the 
firstand last doses of the study drug plus 1 day for oral study drug and plus 14 days for 
injectable study  drug.
Study  drug com pliance will  be summarized for each treatment group for Period 1.  The 
compliance for oral  study  drug i s defined as the total number of tablets taken divi ded by 
the total number of tablets a subject is supposed to take during Period 1.  The compliance

for injectable study  drug is defined as the total number of injections received divided by 
the total number of inject ions a subject i s supposed to receive during Period 1.
8.1.3 Analysis of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Dem ographic and baseline characterist ics will be summarized by treatment group and 
overall for the FAS.  For the purpose of this analysis, baseline data for each subjec t will 
be the data collected prior to the first dose of study drug.
Summary  statistics for con tinuous variables will include the number of observat ions, 
mean, standard deviat ion, median, and range.  For discrete variables, frequencies and 
percentages for e ach category will be summarized.
Medical history  will be presented by  counts and percentages of subjects, broken down by  
Body  System  and Di agnosis.
Prior therapy  and medicat ion will be summarized by treatment group.  Prior therapy  and 
medicat ion will include all therapies and medicat ions wit h a start date prior to the date of 
first dose of study  drug.
Concomitant medicat ions will also be summarized with frequencies and percentages for 
each treatment group.  All medicat ions administered during study  drug exposure will be 
included.
8.1.4 Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the FAS populat ion, which includes all 
rando mized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
8.1.4.1 Primary Efficacy Variable
Analysis of the primary  endpoin t will be conducted on the FAS based on treatment as 
rando mized.  Comparison of the primary endpo int will be made between each 
upadacit inib dose group and the combined placebo groups using the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test adjust ing for main stratificati on factors.  For the primary  analysis, Non -
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
136
Responder Imputation (NRI) will be used.  The analysis will be repeated using Observed 
Cases (OC).  Supportive analysis will also be conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set.
The primary  efficacy  analyses will also be performed in demographic subgroups including 
age, gender, race, body  mass index, and geographical region to assess the consistency  of 
the treatment effect.  Addit ional subgroup analyses based on baseline disease 
characteri stics and stratificat ion facto rs will also be conducted.
8.1.4.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Variables
Unless otherwise specified, comparisons are between each dose group of upadacit inib and 
the combined placebo group.
For binary  endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each trea tment 
group.  Similar analyses as for the primary  endpoint will be conducted.
For ACR20 response rate at Week 12, analysis will be conducted to assess the non -
inferi ority of each upadacit inib dose versus ADA on placebo -subtracted treatment 
difference using Koch's 3-arm test statistic.  Non -inferiorit y will be claimed if 
upadacit inib preserves at least 50% of the placebo- subtracted ADA effect, i.e., the 
multiplicit y adjusted l ower confidence limit for the ratio of placebo -subtracted 
upadacit inib ACR20 rate v ersus the pl acebo -subtracted ADA ACR20 rate is at least 50%.  
Superi ority of upadaci tinib versus ADA will also be tested for ACR20 at Week 12.
For continuous endpo ints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be 
reported for each treatment gro up.  Pairwise co mparisons between each upadacit inib dose 
group and the combined placebo groups will be carried out using the Mixed -Effects 
Model  Repeated Measures (MMRM) with treatment group, visit, treatment -by-visit 
interact ion as the fixed factor, and t he corresponding baseline value and the main 
stratificat ion factors as the covariates.  For change fro m baseline in Patient's Assessment 
of Pain NRS and change from baseline in HAQ- DI at Week 12, superiorit y of 
upadacit inib vs ADA will also be tested.

137
8.1.4.3 Addi tional Efficacy Variables
Addit ional efficacy variables as listed in Section 5.3.3.3 will be summarized for all visits.  
For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported by  treatm ent group by  
visit.  For continuous endpo ints, the mean, standard deviat ion, median, and range will be 
reported by  treatm ent group by  visit.
8.1.4.4 Multiplicity Control for the Primary and Key Secondary 
Endpoints
The overall type I error rate of the primary and key secondary  endpoints for the two doses 
will be strongly  controlled using a graphical mult iple testing procedure 50,51.  Specifically, 
the testing will utilize the endpo int sequence of primary endpo int followed by  key 
secondary  endpoints in the order as specified in Section 5.3.3.2 , and will begin with 
testing the primary  endpoint using α of 0.025 for each dose.  Continued testing will fo llow 
a pre -specified α transfer path which includes downstream transfer along the endpo int 
sequence wit hin each dose as well as cross -dose transfer.  More details of the graphical 
procedure will be specified in the SAP.
8.1.4.5 Imputation Methods
The fo llowing m ethods will  be used for missing data imputation:
Observed Cases (OC):   The OC analysis will not impute values for missing evaluat ions, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluat ion on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the OC analysis for that visit.
Multiple Imputatio n (MI):   The MI analysis imputes missing data mult iple times under 
appropriate random variat ion and thus generates mult iple imputed "pseudo -complete"
datasets.  Results will be aggregated across the mult iple imputed datasets, overcoming 
drawbacks of the si ngle imputati on methods.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
138
Non- Responder Imputation (NRI):   NRI applies to binary endpo ints only.  In NRI 
analysis, subjects who prematurely  discontinue study  drug will be considered non -
responders for visits after the discont inuat ion.
Linear Extrapolation f or Radiographic Data:   For radiographic data (i.e., SHS -based 
endpo ints), if a subject prematurely discont inued before Week 24/56, their Week 24/56 
data will be imputed assuming a linear relat ionship between baseline and the time point 
when x -ray shoul d be collected.
Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM):   The MMRM includes treatment, visit, 
and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and baseline as covariate.
For non -radiographic data, the NRI approach will serve as the primary analysis approach 
for binary  endpoints.  Analysis for key  binary  endpoints will also be repeated using OC.  
The mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) will serve as the primary  analysis for key  
continuous endpo ints at Week 12 which are prior to potential modification o f backgr ound 
therapy .  The Mul tiple Im putati on (MI) approach will serve as the primary analysis for 
key cont inuous endpo ints at Week 24.  A Missing Not At Random (MNAR) model that 
varies assumpt ions for the missing data in active treatment groups and placebo group s 
may be used as a sensit ivity analysis for important continuous endpo ints to account for 
potenti al deviati on from the missing at random assumpt ion.  For radiographic data, both 
linear extrapolat ion and as -observed analysis will be conducted.
8.1.4.6 Interim Analy sis
An unblinded interim efficacy analysis will be conducted by  an independent external 
DMC after at least 600 subjects have completed the Week 12 Visit or have prematurely 
discontinued fro m the study .  The interim analysis is to assess if the study  met the pre -
defined No -Go boundary  for the primary  endpoint ACR20.  A futilit y recommendation 
will be made only  when both the upadaci tinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD doses meet the 
futilit y criteria.  Details of the decisio n making rules will be specified in a separate DMC 
charter.

8.1.4.7 Long -Term Efficacy for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined
The efficacy variables are listed in Section 5.3.3.3 and will be summarized for all visits.
Long -term efficacy by  time point will be summarized using descript ive statist ics.  For 
binary  endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be summarized.  For continuous 
endpo ints, the mean and standard deviat ion will be reported.
8.1.5 Safety Analyses
8.1.5.1 General Considerations
Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safet y Analysis Set.  There will be two sets 
of planned safet y analysis: safet y analysis by  Week 24, and l ong-term safet y analysis.
Safety analyses are based on treatm ents actually received.  Safet y will be assessed by  
AEs, physical examinat ion, laboratory  assessments, and vital signs.  Frequency tables and 
lists of subjects with treatment- emergent AEs by  preferred term  as in the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary, by system organ class, by 
severi ty, and by  relati onshi p to the study  drug as assessed by  the Invest igator will be 
provi ded.  The vi tal signs, physical examinat ion results, and clinical laboratory values will 
be analyzed in a descript ive manner.  Shift of laboratory  values fro m baseline to defined 
time points will be tabulated.
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
8.1.5.2 Analysis of Adverse Events
Unless otherwise specified, the fo llowing conventions apply for both sets of sa fety 
analysis.
8.1.5.2.1 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)
AEs will be coded using MedDRA.  A TEAE is defined as AE that began or worsened in 
severi ty after ini tiation of study  drug.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
140
AEs starting more than 70 days fo llowing the l ast dose of study  drug for sub jects on ADA 
and AEs starting more than 30 days fo llowing the last dose of study  drug for subjects on 
upadacit inib or PBO will not be included in summaries o f TEAEs.
As a general safet y summary, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs 
willbe summarized for each treatment group for the fo llowing AE categori es:
●All AEs;
●All severe AEs;
●All reasonably possibly related AEs;
●All SAEs;
●Frequent AEs (reported in 5% of subjects or more in any treatment group);
●Frequent reasonably  possibly  related AEs (reported in 5% of subjects or more 
in any treatm ent group);
●Discontinuati ons due to AEs;
●Death.
Addit ional AEs may  be considered for tabul ation/summary  based on recommendat ions 
from the TA MD and Pharmacovigilance and Patient Safet y as deemed appropr iate.
TEAEs will be summarized and presented by  system  organ classes (SOCs) and preferred 
terms (PTs) using MedDRA.  The SOCs will be presented in alphabet ical order, and the 
PTs will be presented in alphabet ical order within each SOC.
TEAE will also be su mmarized by maximum severit y and by  maximum relati onship.
The AESIs listed in Section 6.1.1.3 will be summari zed.  Event rate (per 100 patient 
years) for AESIs will also be summarized for the long -term safet y analysis.
All AEs leading to discontinuat ion of study  drug will  be presented in list ing format.  A 
listing by treatment group of TEAEs grouped by  SOC and MedDRA preferred term with 
subject i dentificat ion numbers will be generated.

8.1.5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events and Death
All treatment -emergent SAEs and AEs leading to death will also be presented in list ing 
format.  In addi tion, SAEs will be summarized by  SOC and MedDRA PT.
8.1.5.3 Analysis of Laboratory and Vital Sign Data
Summary  statistics by  visit, and changes from  baseline to minimum value, maximum 
value, and final values in continuous laboratory data, and vital signs will be summarized 
by treatm ent group.
Baseline values are defined as the last non -missi ng measurements recorded on or before 
the date of the first dose of study  drug in Peri od 1.
The l aboratory  data will be categorized as Grade 0, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and 
Grade 4 based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Commo n Toxi city Criteria for Adv erse 
Events (CTCAE).  The shift tables will tabulate the number and percentage of subjects 
with baseline and post -baseline values by the above categories.  
Descript ive summary and list ings will be provided for potentially clinically significant 
laboratory values and vital signs.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure -Response Analyses
Individual upadacit inib plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and 
summarized wit h appropri ate stati stical methods.
Data from this study  may be combined wit h data from other studi es for the popul ation PK 
and exposure -response analyses.  Populat ion PK and exposure -response analyses o f only 
data from this study  may not be conducted.  The following general methodology  will be 
used for the population PK and exposure -response analyses.
Popul ation PK analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to 
dosing.  PK models will be built using a non -linear mixed -effects m odeling approach wi th 
NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version).  The CL/F and V/F of upadaci tinib 
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
142
will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses.  If necessary, other 
param eters, including the parameters describing absorption characterist ics, may be fixed if 
useful in the analysis.  The relat ionship between the condi tionalestimates of CL/F and 
V/F values with only  potenti ally physi ologically  relevant or clinically  meaningful  
covari ates (such as subject age, sex, body  weight, concomitant medicat ions, laboratory  
markers of hepat ic of renal funct ion, etc.) will be explored us ing stepwi se forward 
select ion backward eliminat ion approach.  Relat ionships between upadacit inib exposure 
and clinical observat ions will be explored.  The effect of meaningful covariates (e.g., body  
weight) on the exposure -response relationships for effic acy measures (e.g., ACR and 
PASI) in PsA pat ients will be evaluated.
Results of the PK and exposure -response analyses may be summarized in a separate 
report, rather than in the CSR.  Addit ional analyses will be performed if useful and 
appropriate.
8.2 Determin ation of Sample Size
The pl anned sam ple size of approximately 1640 for this study  (with 
2:2:2:1:1 randomizat ion rati o for upadaci tinib 15 mg, upadacit inib 30 mg, adalimumab 
and placebo subjects) provides at least 90% power for a 20% difference in ACR20 
response rate (assuming a placebo ACR20 response rate of 30%).  It will also provide at 
least 90% power for the majorit y of the key  secondary  endpoints.  Wi th the given sample 
size, there is approximately  90% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.26 in 
change from baseline in SHS for each upadacit inib dose group versus the combined 
placebo group at Week 24 52.  This sample size will a lso provide at least 85% power for 
evaluat ing non-inferiorit y for each upadacit inib dose group vs. ADA in ACR20 response 
rate at Week 12 assuming 50% ACR20 response rates for ADA and upadacit inib and 30% 
ACR20 response rates for placebo.  All power and sam ple size calculat ions are performed 
at two -sided significance level o f 0.025 and account ing for a 10% dropout rate.

and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submissio n to the 
IEC/IRB shoul d also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, Internat ional Conference on 
Harm onizat ion (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines go verning clinical 
study  conduct and the ethi cal principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilit ies of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A.
In cases of state of emergency or pandemic situations leading to difficult ies in performing 
protocol -specified procedures, AbbVie will engage with study  site personnel  in efforts to 
ensure the safet y of subjects, m aintain protocol  compliance, and minimize risks to the 
integrity of the study  while trying to best manage subject continuit y of care.  This may 
include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visit s), 
alternat ive locationsfor data collect ion (e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab), 
and shipping invest igational product and/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuit y 
of treatm ent where allowed.  In all cases, these alternat ive measures must be allowed by  
local regulati ons and permi tted by  IRB/IEC.  Investi gators shoul d notify  AbbVie if any 
urgent safet y measures are taken to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard.
9.3 Subject Confidentiality
To protect subjects 'confident iality, all subjects and the ir associ ated sam ples will  be 
assigned numerical study  identifiers or "codes. "No identifiable informat ion will be 
provi ded to AbbVie.
For the personal data that AbbVie controls and maintains, AbbVie has developed a robust 
securi ty program  focused on due diligence in design, managed change, and informat ion 
securi ty governance.   Information Securit y policies govern the Informat ion Securi ty 
funct ions including ident ity and access management, operations, infrastructure, 
applicat ion, and third -party securi ty requirements.   The risk -based AbbVie Data 
Classificat ion Tool  dictates the l evel of scrutiny  and control  requi red for the rel evant

145
activit ies per AbbVie 's Informati on Securi ty policies taking into account the sensit ivity of 
the data.
Before subject data are shared with AbbVie, the study doctor and staff will replace any 
inform ation that could direct ly ident ify a subject (such as name, address, and contact 
inform ation) wi th a generi c code which AbbVie cannot link to that subject 's identity to 
protect the conf ident iality of the data.
AbbVie has a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) program to ensure and document 
the appropri ate controls and safeguards stated above are in place for clinical trial data that 
it control s and maintains and these processing act ivities respect privacy o f clinical  trial 
subjects.   AbbVie also maintains robust securit y incident response policies and 
procedures, including requirements for the containment of any  data rel ated inci dents, the 
mitigation measures where needed, and notific ation to authori ties or affected individuals 
where required.
9.4 Subject Information and Consent
The invest igator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject 
and answer all quest ions regarding this study .  Pri or to any  study -related screening 
procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be 
reviewed and signed and dated by  the subject, the person who administered the informed 
consent, and any  other si gnatories according to l ocal requi rements.  A copy  of the 
inform ed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject 's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject 's dated source 
docum ents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any  study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy .
Inform ation regarding incentives for subjects and informat ion regarding provisio ns for 
treating and/or compensat ing subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participat ion 
in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
146
Samples for exploratory  research/validat ion studi es will  only be collected if the subject 
has vo luntarily signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory  
research/validation studies, approved by  an IEC/IRB, after the nature of the testing has 
been explained and the subject has had an opportunit y to ask questi ons.  The separate 
written consent must be signed before the exploratory  research/validation studies samples 
are collected and testing is perfor med.  If the subject does not consent to the exploratory 
research/validation studies, it will not impact the subject 's parti cipat ion in the study .
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study , opti onal exploratory  
research/validation samples will c ontinue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject 
specifically wit hdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is wit hdrawn for the 
optional sampling, the subject must inform their study  doctor, and once AbbVie is 
inform ed, the opti onal samples will be destroy ed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples have already  been tested, th ose resul ts will st ill remain as 
part of the overall research data.
In cases of state -of emergency  or pandemic si tuations, in addi tion to the study informed 
consent, addit ional verbal consent may  be obtained pri or to adaptati ons to substant ial 
changes in study  conduct, according to l ocal regulati ons (e.g., l abs taken at a l ocal facility, 
direct to pati ent couri er study  drug deliver, ho me or virt ual study  visits, etc.).
9.4.1 Informed Consent Form and Explanatory Material
In Japan, the principal invest igator will prepare the consent form and explanatory material 
requi red to obtain subject 's consent to parti cipate in the study  with the cooperati on of the
sponsor and will revise these documents as required.  The prepared or revised consent 
forms and explanatory  material will be submitted to the sponsor.  Approval of the IRB 
will be obtained prior to use in the study .
9.4.2 Revision of the Consent Form and Explan atory Material
In Japan, when important new information related to the subject 's consent beco mes 
available, the principal investigator will revise the consent form and explanatory  material

10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this
study .  These form s will  be used to transmit informat ion collected during the study  to 
AbbVie and regulatory  authori ties, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study  are being 
collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave®provi ded by the 
techno logy vendor Medi data Sol utions Incorporated, NY, USA.  The EDC sy stem  and the 
study -specific electroni c case report forms (eCRFs) will comply wit h Title 21 CFR 
Part 11.  The documentation related to the validat ion of the EDC system is available 
through the vendor, Medidata, while the validat ion of the study -specific eCRFs will be 
conducted by  AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The invest igator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will 
be recorded by  invest igative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the 
eCRF will be supported by  source documentation.
Suppl emental  study  case re port f orms shoul d be completed in the event of COVID -19 
(coronavirus SARS -CoV -2) rel ated missing/inco mplete/virtual visit s, study  drug 
interrupti ons or di scontinuati ons, or adverse events (including capture of specific 
signs/symptom s of infect ion and testi ng results).
The invest igator or an authorized member of the investigator 's staff will make any  
necessary  correcti ons to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, whi ch is part of the EDC 
system .  For any  correcti on, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will 
be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility , and acceptabilit y by AbbVie 
personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their repr esentati ves) will also be allowed 
access to all source documents pertinent to the study  in order to verify  eCRF entri es.  The 
principal investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide 
his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.

Medidata will provide access to the EDC sy stem  for the duration of the trial through a 
password- protected method of internet access.  Such access will be remo ved from 
investi gator si tes at the end of the site 's participati on in the study .  Data from the EDC 
system  will be archived on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and provided to the 
investi gator at that time as a durable record of the site 's eCRF data.  It will be possible for 
the invest igator to make paper printouts from that media.
Electronic Patient Reported Data:
Patient reported data must be co mpleted for each subject screened/enrolled in this study .  
Some of these data are being co llected with an Electronic Patient Reported Outcome 
(ePRO) sy stem  called Tri almanager, provi ded by  the technol ogy vendor Si gnant Heal th of 
Plymouth Meet ing, PA, USA.  The ePRO system is in compliance with Tit le 21 CFR 
Part 11.  The documentation related to the system validat ion of the ePRO system is 
available through the vendor, Signant Heal th, while the user acceptance testing of the 
study -specific PRO design will be conducted and maintained at AbbVie.
The subject will be entering the data on an electronic device; these data will be uploaded 
to a server.  The data on the server will be considered source, and maintained and 
managed by  Signant Heal th.
The ePRO data will be co llected electronically via a Tablet device into which the patient 
will direct ly enter the required pieces o f informat ion.  The el ectroni c device will be 
programmed to allow data entry  for only  the visi ts specified in the protocol  and will not 
allow for patients to complete more than one of the same assessments at any one visit.  All 
data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself and 
autom atically upl oaded to a central  server administ rated by  Signant Heal th.  The 
Invest igator and delegated staff will be able to access all uploaded pat ient entered data via 
a password protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation o f the 
study archive.

the study  visit window on paper or over the telephone by  site personnel  directly  to 
subjects per instructions fro m AbbVie, as l ocal regul ations allow.
Intern et access to the ePRO data will be provided by  Signant Heal th for the durati on of 
the study .  Thi s access will be available for the duration of the study  to the si te 
investi gator, as well as delegated personnel.  Such access will be removed fro m 
investi gator sites following the receipt of the study archive.  Data from the ePRO system 
will be archived on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and provi ded to the 
investi gator at that time as a durable record of the site 's ePRO data.  It will be possible for 
the invest igator to make paper print -outs from that media.
The assessments completed by the subject will be considered source documentation.
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
AbbVie will ensure that the clinical trial is conducted with a qualit y management system 
that will define qualit y tolerance limi ts in order to ensure human subject protection and 
reliabilit y of study  resul ts.  Data will be generated, documented, and reported in

a. These visits every 12 weeks are at:  Wk 68, Wk 80, Wk 92, Wk 104, Wk 116, Wk 128, Wk 140, Wk 152, Wk 164, Wk 176, Wk 188, Wk 200, Wk 212, Wk 224, Wk 236, 
Wk248.
b. A 30 -day follow -up visit/phone call will occur for all subjects on oral study drug approximately 30 days after the last dose of study dru g to obtain additional safety 
information.   Whenever laboratory results are needed for AE follow -up, the 30 -day follow -up should be performed as a visit at the site.   For those subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study (withdrawal of informed con sent) a 30 -day follow -up phone call (and not an on -site visit) may be allowed for subjects who have completed the PD 
visit to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  The 70 -day follow -up phone call is to take pl ace 70 days after the last dose 
of study drug.  The 70 -day follow -up phone call is also for those subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study (withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjec ts completing 
the study on OL therapy will only be required to ha ve the 30 -day follow -up visit/ phone call if on oral study drug and the 70 -day follow -up call if on injectable study drug.  
The 30 -day follow -up visit/phone call and 70 -day follow -up call are not required for subjects who begin commercially available upadac itinib or adalimumab or who 
discontinued study drug and continued study participation with completion of at least one study visit approximately 30 days o r 70 days after last dose of study drug, 
respectively.  For subjects who enter CTTP, the 30- day follow -up visit/phone call following the last dose of study drug at the Week 260 visit will not be required.
c. Obtain informed consent prior to performing any study related procedures.
d. Note herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history.
e. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, body weight, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are pe rformed.
f. Height will be measured at Screening visit only (with shoes off).

g. For concomitant med ications, at Week 36 (after Week 36 assessments have been performed), per Investigator judgment, may add non -biologic DMARDs (concomitant use of 
up to 2 non -biologic DMARDs, except the combination of MTX and leflunomide), or increase DMARD dose.
h. For Period 1 (up to and including Week 56 visit), a full physical exam is required at the visits indicated.  A symptom -directed phy sical exam may be performed when 
necessary.  For Period 2 (after Week 56), a full physical exam is required approximately every 2 4 weeks (Wk 80, Wk 104, Wk 128, Wk 152, Wk 176, Wk 200, Wk 224, Wk 
248 visits) and at the Wk 260/PD visit.  A symptom -directed phy sical exam may be performed when necessary.
i. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required; provided all protocol -required documentation is available 
and nothing has changed in the subject 's health status since the time of the test that warrants a repeat test.  If required by country regulatory authorities, an a nnual ECG will be 
performed.
j. HIV testing will be performed at Screening.  The Investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health a gencies with the subject.  The site will report 
confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the Investigator must discuss with the sub ject 
the potential implications to the subject 's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A su bject will not be eligible for study participation if test 
results indicate a positive HIV infection.  
k. The screening chest x -ray will not be required if a subject had a previously normal chest -x-ray (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within 90 days of Screening, provided that 
all protocol -required documentation is available at the site and nothing has changed in the subject 's health status since the time of the test that warrants a repeat test (refer to 
Section 5.3.1.1 for specific requirements).
l. Obtain a chest x -ray annually for subjects with one or more TB risk factors as identified by the TB risk assessment form, subjects living in a reasendemic for TB, and subjects 
with a newly positive QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (and/or PPD skin test) after baseline.  In the case a subject prematurely discontinues from the study drug a che st x-ray 
should not be performed if it has been less than 48 weeks since the last examination.
m. X-rays of hands and feet will be performed for all subjects at Screening, Wk 24, Wk 56, Wk 104, Wk 152 and Wk 260/PD visits.  A ll subjects who fail to attain at least 20% 
improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at Week 12 a nd Week 16 will have an x-ray examination at Week 16.  An x -ray examination at Week 16 is not required for 
subjects with at least a 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at Week 12 and Week 16.  All subjects will receive x -rays of hands and feet if they discontinue from 
the study or from study drug at Week 12 or later and it has been at least 12 weeks from when x -rays were last obtained during Period 1 or at least 24 weeks during Period 2.
n. Randomization is permitted prior to results of the centra l reading of hand and foot x -rays for eligibility if a subject has an elevated hs -CRP available from the central 
laboratory and all other criteria are met.
o. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test at Screening and if any urine pregnancy test is positive at any time during the study.  If the serum 
pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure.  If serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repe at test is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion 
criterion).  If still borderline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study.  Refer to 
Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24

p. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits.  M ore frequent pregnancy te sts will be performed 
throughout the study if required per local/country requirements.  If urine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine 
pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a seru m pregnancy test.  Pregnant subjects must discontinue from study drug treatment.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1
Study  Procedures Pregnancy Test for addit ional details.
q. If time between visits is longer than one month, then collect the results of the monthly at home urine pregnancy test between scheduled visits.  If a urine pregnancy test is 
positive, the subject must stop dosing, come into the clinic and have blood drawn for a serum pregnancy test that will be analyzed at the central laboratory.  A pregnant or 
breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study.  The monthly at home tests between scheduled on -site vis its are to occur at Weeks 40, 
48, 52, 60, 64, 72, 76, 84, 88, 96, 100, 108, 112, 120, 124, 132, 136, 144, 148, 156, 160, 168, 172, 180, 184, 192, 196, 204, 208, 216, 220, 228, 232, 240, 244, 252, and 256.
r. Latent TB risk factor questionnaire will be obta ined at Screening and annually thereafter through study participation.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for specific requirements for TB 
testing and TB Pro phylaxis.
s. TB testing will be performed at Screening and annually thereafter through study participation.  In the case a subject prematu rely discontinues from the study drug TB testing 
should not be performed if it has been less than 48 weeks since the l ast test was obtained.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for specific requirements for TB testing and TB 
Prophylaxis.
t. Minimum 8 -hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
u. Starting from Baseline (Day 1) the hs -CRP results will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site p ersonnel, or the subject.  For safety evaluations of signs and 
symptoms of infection and management of adverse events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin.  Results of tests su ch as hs -CRP, and procalcitonin may be blunted 
in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a possible safety assessment or adverse event management.  Any local hs -
CRP, CRP, or serial procalcitonin tests reported to the investigator until a subject is known to r eceive upadacitinib or until treatment allocation is unblinded will be recorded 
as protocol deviations.
v. If required by country regulatory authorities, subjects who initiate or increase dose of MTX during the study should undergo ALT, AST, creatinine and CBC testing every 
4weeks for a 12 -week period.
w. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits.  A microscopic an alysis will be performed in the event the dipstick 
results show leukocytes, nit rite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
x. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilizat ion 
(defined in Section 5.2.4 ).
y. For China, Japan and South Korea, or where mandated by local requirements:  for subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening, the HBV -
DNA PCR test should be performed again approximately every 12 weeks.  Retesting approximately every 12 weeks is not necessary for subjects that have a history of HBV 
vaccine and HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab –.  If neces sary, HBV DNA PCR may be tested at unscheduled visits.
z. At Week 2 and Week 4 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to oral study drug dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the 
PK blood sample.  Howe ver, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the sub ject should follow the regular 
dosing schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit.
ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8

aa. PK samples s hould be collected at any time during the visit.  Subject should follow the regular dosing schedule.  Collect PK samples at W eek 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, 
Week 24, Week 32, Week 56, and at PD visit only for subjects who prematurely discontinue from stu dy drug treatment prior to Week 56.  No PK sample collection is 
required at Week 260.
bb. Prior to other study visit procedures.
cc. PASI, BSA -Ps, sIGA, and SAPS are to be done at Week 80, Week 104, Week 128, Week 152, Week 176, Week 200, Week 224, Week 24 8 (every 24 weeks after the Week

M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
176
●Make sure the liquid in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless.  Do not use 
a prefilled syringe if the liqu id is cloudy  or discol ored or has flakes or particles 
in it. 
●Have a special sharps (puncture proof) container nearby for disposing of used 
needles and sy ringes. 
For y our protecti on, it is important that y ou follow these instructi ons. 
2. Choosing and prepa ring an injection site
●Wash and dry  your hands well 
●Choose a si te on the front of y our thi ghs or y our stom ach area (abdo men).  If 
you choose y our abdom en, y ou shoul d avoi d the area 2 inches around y our 
belly button (navel).
●Choose a different site each time you give y ourself an inject ion.  Each new 
inject ion shoul d be given at l east one inch fro m a site y ou used before.  
○Never inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard or 
where y ou have scars or stretch marks.
●If you have psori asis, you shoul d try not to inject direct ly into any  raised, 
thick, red or scaly skin patches or lesions.
●You m ay find i t helpful to keep notes on the location of y our inject ion sites. 
●Wipe the inject ion site wit h an alcoho l prep (swab) using a circular moti on.
●Do not touch this area again unt il you are ready  to inject.

3. How to prepare your study drug dose for injection with a Prefilled Syringe
●Hold the sy ringe upri ght with the needle facing down.
●Check to m ake sure that there is liquid in the pre -filled
●The t op of  the liquid may  be curved. 
●If the sy ringe does not have liquid, do not use that sy ringe and call  your study  
doctor.
If the sy ringe does not have the correct amount of liquid, do not use that sy ringe.  Call 
your study  doctor.
●Remove the needle cover taking care not to touch the needle wit h your fingers 
or allow it to touch any surface.
●Turn the sy ringe so the needle is facing up and slo wly push the pl unger in to 
push the air in the syringe out through the needle.  If a small drop of liquid 
comes out o f the needle that is okay .
●Do not shake the sy ringe.
4. Injecting your study drug dose
●With your other hand, gent ly squeeze an area of the cleaned area of skin and 
hold it firmly .
●You will inject into this raised area of skin.  Hold the syringe like a pencil  at 
about a 45° angle (see picture) to the skin.
●With a qui ck, short, "dart-like"motion, push the needl e into the skin. 

ABT -494
M15 -572 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2016 -004130 -24
178
●After the needle is in, let go of the skin.  Pull back slight ly on the plunger.  If 
blood appears in the syringe it means that y ou have entered a bl ood vessel.  Do 
not inject the study  drug.  Pull the needle out of the skin and repeat the steps to 
choose and clean a new injection site.  Do not use the same syringe.  Dispose 
of it in y our special  sharps container.  If no blood appea rs, sl owly  push the 
plunger all the way  in unt il all o f the study  drug i s injected.
●When the syringe is empt y, remove the needle from the skin keeping it at the 
same angle it was when it was pushed into the skin.
●Press a cotton ball or gauze pad over the i njecti on si te and hol d it for 
10seconds.  Do not rub the inject ion site.  You may have slight bleeding.  This 
is normal.
●Dispose of the sy ringe ri ght away  into your speci al sharps container.

If the f emale subject i s < 55 y ears o f age:
●AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent 
surgi cal sterilizat ion (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, i t is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol -specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contracept ion is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy test must be performed (see 
Secti on 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potenti al and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subj ects who are surgically sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
requi red.
A wo man who does not meet the definit ion of postmenopausal, permanent ly surgi cally 
sterile, or perm anent ly infert ileis considered of childbearing potential and is required to 
practi ce two forms of contraception.  This includes one form of highly  effect ive 
contraception and one effect ive method of contracepti on.  That i s effect ive from Study  
Day 1 (or earlier) through at least 150 days after the last dose of subcutaneous study  drug 
and through at least 30 days after the last dose of oral study  drug.
●Highly effect ive methods:
○Horm onal contraceptives started at l east 2 m onths pri or to randomizat ion 
(e.g., combined [estro gen and progestogen containing] [oral contraceptives, 
patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants); 
●Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); 
●Vasectomy  and tubal  ligation.

●Effect ive methods:
○Barri er methods of contraception (e.g., male c ondom, female condom, 
cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge)
○Note:  The proper use of diaphragm or cervical cap includes use of 
spermicide and is considered one barrier method.  The cervical cap and 
contraceptive sponge are less effect ive in parous women.  The use of 
spermicide alo ne is not considered a suitable barrier method for 
contraception.  When used consistently and correctly, " double barri er"
methods of contraception (e.g., male condo m with diaphragm , male 
condom  with cervical cap) can be used as an effective alternative to the 
highly  effect ive contraception methods described above.  Male and female 
condoms should not be used together as they  can tear or become damaged.

Appendix I. Continued Treatment for Trial Participants (CTTP)
Directions are found throughout this appendix for sites in countries that require continued 
treatm ent in accordance wit h local regulat ions until such time when upadacit inib is 
commercially  available and/or the subject can access treatment locally . 
As subjects approach Week 260 in Period 2, the investigator will discuss the appropriate 
subsequent treatment with the subject.  If the subject and invest igator determine continued 
therapy  with upadact inib remains the best course of treatment, AbbVie will work with the 
investi gator to eval uate a path for continued treatment in accordance with local 
regul ations until upadacit inib is co mmerc ially available and/or the subject can access 
treatm ent locally.  Subjects in applicable countries will be evaluated every  12 weeks unt il 
the end of CTTP (see Study  Activit ies Table –CTTP Study  Activities Table After Period 
2 Week 260 for details).  Safet y informat ion will continue to be collected for subjects who 
enter CTTP.  Efficacy data will not be collected during CTTP.   Overall management and 
monitoring of safet y during CTTP is the responsibilit y of the invest igator.  
When upadacit inib is co mmercial ly available and/or the subject can access treatment 
locally, subjects will be brought in for a final CTTP visit. 
Parti cipating si tes in applicable countri es will be provi ded wi th estimated dates of when 
the subjects' final CTTP vi sits are expected to occ ur for planning purposes.  It is 
acknowledged that these dates may change at any  time during the course of the regulatory  
approval /reimbursement process.  The final visit dates will be communicated to the sites 
based on actual approval/reimbursement dates or if deci sion to di scontinue pursuit of 
regul atory  approval/reimbursement i s made.  In the event regulatory  approval , local 
reimbursement, or the decisio n to di scontinue pursui t of regul atory  
approval /reimbursement occurs at a time po int different than th e estimated dates, subjects 
shoul d then be brought in for their terminat ion visit based on the actual date as provided 
by AbbVie.  AbbVie reserves the right to terminate the study  at any  time.

a. Any other procedures and/or evaluations necessary per local requirements or for the care of the subject are the 
responsibility of the investigator.
b. Visit intervals for CTTP are to be scheduled starting from the Week 260 visit date based on the sched ule 
established by the Baseline Visit date. 
c. When the subject can access upadacitinib locally, the subject should return as soon as possible to complete their 
final CTTP visit.
d. Unscheduled Visits are performed when subjects come in for a medical visi t for evaluation and assessment.  Visits 
for dispensing new study drug in case of temperature excursion, loss, or damage, are not considered an 
Unscheduled Visit.
e. A follow -up visit/phone call will occur for all subjects approximately 30 days after the l ast dose of study drug to 
obtain additional safety information.   Whenever laboratory results are needed for AE follow -up, the 30- day follow -
up should be performed as a visit at the site.   The 30 -day follow -up visit/phone call will not occur for subjects who 
begin commercially available upadacitinib.
f. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at all subsequent visits.  More 
frequent pregnancy tests will be performed throughout CTTP if required per local/country req uirements.  If urine 
pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine pregnancy test is 
positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test at a local laboratory.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for 
additional details.
g. If time between visits is longer than one month, collect the results of the monthly at home urine pregnancy test 
between scheduled visits.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject must stop dosing, return to the clinic and 
have blood drawn for a serum pregnancy test performed at a local laboratory.

combination with pembrol izumab in all subjects (ie,Stratum 1 and 2).
For the Phase 2 part –to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by independent imaging review (IIR) in 
all subjects .
For the Phase 2 part –to evaluate ORR per RECIST 1.1 by IIR in Stratum 2 subjects and 
compare with the historical response rate of pembrolizumab monotherapy of 10%.
Secondary Objectives
For the Phase 2 part, in all subjects and separately in Stratum 2 sub jects, to evaluate 
progr ession -free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by IIR.
To evaluate overall survival (OS) .
To evaluate duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 by IIR .

Study Design
This is an open -label, single -arm, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of eribulin mesylate in 
combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic triple -negative breast cancer 
previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy (cytotoxic or targeted anticancer 
agents) in the metastatic setting.  Subjects may have receive d prior neo /adjuvant chemotherapy.  
The Phase 1b part includes 1 initia l safety run -in cohort in which at least 6 subjects will receive 
eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2intravenously ( IV)on Days 1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle and 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 o f a 21 -day cycle ( Dose Level 1).  Dose -limiting toxicity 
(DLT) will be assessed in the first cycle.  Dose level 1 can be selected as the recommended Phase 2 
dose (RP2D) if no more than 1 subject has a DLT.  Otherwise, eribulin mesylate dose will be 
lower edfrom 1.4 mg/ m2to 1.1 mg/ m2on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle ( Dose Level 0).  If no 
more tha n 1 out of 6 subjects at Dose Level 0 has a DLT, the Phase 2 part will proceed with Dose 
Level 0.  Approximately 12 subjects may be enrolled in the Phase 1b part of the study .  
As of Protocol Amendment 05, t he RP2D was determined to be eribulin 1.4 mg/m2IV 
administered on Day 1 and Day 8 of each 21 -day cycle with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV 
administered on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.
Under Protocol Amendment 1, 107 subjects (including subjects in Phase 1b who are on RP2D 
level) wereenrolled in 2strata and receive dthe same combination treatment at the RP2D level.  
The strata include no prior systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting ( Stratum 1) and 
previously treated with 1 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting 
(Stratum 2). Bayesian predictive probability (PP) of response rate wasused to monitor the 
response rate after postbaseline tumor assessments for at least 38 subjects were available.  The 
study could be stopped early for efficacy or futility if PP crosses the prespecified boundary.  
Hence, efficacy conclusion of the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR could be made on the basis of 
the predictive probability prior to the full enrollment of 100evaluable subjects in the study (see 
Statistical Methods for details). 
Ther e is clinical interest to have a more precise estimation of th e efficacy data for Stratum 2.  
Ther efore, per Protocol Amendment 3, additional subjects will be added to Stratum 2 in order to 
include
atotal of80evaluable subjects in Stratum 2 for final analysis.   As a result, approximately 
150subjects in total (145 evaluable with 80 in Stratum 2) will be enrolled. Per Protocol 
Amendment 4, 20 additional subjects will be added to Stratum 2 in order to include a total of at

Pharmacokinetic ( PK)assessm ents of eribulin mesylate will be performed in all subjects in the 
Phase 1b part of the study.  Subjects in the Phase 2 part will undergo sparse PK sampling for 
population pharm acokinetic /pharm acodynamic ( PK/PD)analysis where feasible.

End-of-Treatment visit (or the end of the 90-day follow up for serious adverse events 
[SAEs ]/events of clinical interest [ ECIs ]) for the last subject. As of Protocol Amendm ent05, the 
Follow -Up asessments inthe Posttreatment Phase will no longer need to be performed.
Number of Subjects
A total of approximately 170adult female or male subjects previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of 
systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting will be enrolled (including at least 6 subjects 
from the Phase 1b part) .  It is estimated that 165of the 170subjects will be evaluable for the

Dose Delays and Modifications: Dose delays and modifications for toxicities associated with 
eribulin mesylate and pembrolizumab are described in detail in Section 9.4.1.1 and Section 9.4.1.2 , 
respectively .  
Duration of Treatment
Subjects will be treated with eribulin mesylate and pembrolizumab and can remain on one or both 
study drugs in the presence of clinical benefit until intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, or 
disease progression occurs, or until the subject withdraws consent.
For su bjects experiencing prolonged clinical benefit, temporary interruption (up to 3months) of 
study treatment may be permitted after discussion with the treating physician and the sponsor.   
After such interruption, investigators are strongly encouraged to res can the subject to rule out 
interim progression of disease.
Subjects can receive up to 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab. During that 
time, subjects may continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consen t, physician's decision to stop therapy for the subject , or sponsor’s decision to terminate the 
study. 
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR 
that have been treated for at least 8 cycles (24 weeks) wit h pembrolizumab and had at least 
2treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.
After the last subject has completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab or has discontinued 
pembrolizumab for other reasons , all ongoing subjects will be transitioned off study .  Subjects still 
receiving eribulin monotherapy at thistime may continue to receive eribulin treatment off study 
through their pharmacy (if commercially available for that individual subject) or through a patient 
assistance program administered by the sponsor.   Subjects will continue to receive eribulin 
investigational product and will continue to be assessed according to the Schedule of 
Procedures/ Assessments until they complete the End -of-Treatment visit , prior to their tra nsition to 
commercial eribulin or an access program.

Discontinuation or delay of more than 2weeks of either study drug due to treatment -
related AE will be considered as a DLT
All subjects enrolled in Phase 1b will be assessed for DLTs during a DLT a ssessment window of 
the first cycle of 21 days.  Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to completing the DLT 
assessment window for any reason other than a DLT will be replaced.
Efficacy
Tumor assessment will be performed by the investigator based on both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST.  
Copies of all tumor assessment scans will be sent to an imaging core laboratory designated by the 
sponsor for independent review of efficacy assessment .  Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 05,
tumor assessment scans will no longer be sent to an independent imaging core laboratory.   Detailed 
methodology for assessment by independent review will be provided in an Independent Imaging 
Review Charter.  Tumor assessments are to be performed every 9 weeks ± 1 week after the start of 
study treatment (or sooner if there is evidence of progressive disease) using consistent imaging 
methodology (ie, computed tomography [ CT] scan/magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI ]or bone 
scan and consistent use or nonuse of c ontrast media).  In subjects who discontinue study therapy 
without documented disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their 
disease status by radiologic imaging every 9 weeks ± 1week during Year 1, and every 9to 12 
weeks ± 1 week thereafter according to standard of care ,until (1) the start of new anticancer 
treatment, (2) disease progression (3) death, or (4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first. In 
addition, overall survival (OS) status (disposition) will be asse ssed throughout the study.   
Treat ment After Initial Radiologic Progression
Pembr olizumab, like other immunotherapeutic agents, may produce antitumor effects by 
potentiating endogenous cancer -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such
an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of image responses seen with cytotoxic 
agents, and can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the 
appearance of new lesions . 
For any subject who showed first radiologic evidence of progressive disease (PD) and is deemed 
clinically stable, it is at the discretion of the investigator to continue treating the subject until 
progr ession is confirmed at least 4 weeks from the date of the first radiologic evidence of PD.  If 
progr ession is confirmed ,the subject will be discontinued from study treatment.  Other wise, the 
subject will continue treatment and radiographic scans .  Any s ubject who had initial radiologic 
progr ession and is deemed clinically unstable should b e discontinued from both study drugs and no 
subsequent scan for confirmation is required.  
Safety:
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by the following assessments:  
•Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), drug -related AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation reported by the investigator 
(coded according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities

Efficacy Analyses
Primary Efficacy
Approximately 165evaluable subjects on RP2D will be enrolled in the study , including phase 1b 
and 2 .
Bayesian Predictive Probability (PP) design was used in original study design .Under original 
design, i nthe combined Stratum 1 and 2 subjects, theORR value per RECIST 1.1 by I IRwas 
assumed to be 0.20 for the historical control based on the recent studies (Table 1). The ORR in this 
study is estimated to be 0.35. Under protocol amendment 1, approximately 100 evaluable subjects 
were expected to be enrolled, Bayesian PP was used to monitor the response r ate after postbaseline 
tumor assessments of at least 38 subjects were available.  Tumor response data per RECIST 1.1 by 
investigator review were used for continuous monitoring. The calculation of PP is based on the 
goal of claiming superiority of the comb i
nation at the end of the study if
                                  P(p>0. 2|data) ≥0.95     (1)
wher e p wasthe response rate of the comb ination , 0.2 wasthe response rate of historical control, 
based on single -agent pembrolizumab and eribulin mesylate in recent studies ; 0.95 wasthe 
prespecified target probability (θ T) and P(p>0.2|data) wasthe posterior probability.  On the basis of 
the accumulated data thus far in the study, the probabilities of all possible future outcomes that lead 
to equation (1) at the end of the study would be added in order to obtain the predictive probability. 
Ther efore, early decision of study termination prior to reaching approximately 100 evaluable 
subjects was possible for claiming the combination is promising when PP is ab ove a prespecified 
upper threshold (θ U) or for claiming futility when PP is below a prespecified lower threshold (θ L).  
The upper and lower cutoff probabilities for decision making, θ Uand θ L, wer eset as 0.99 and 
0.025. Under the predictive monitoring, the study proceed edas follows:
If PP> θ U(=0.99), stop the study and claim the comb ination promising
If PP< θ L(=0.025), stop the study and claim the comb ination not promising

enrollment under protocol amendment 1 , Bayesian PP is no longer used forcontinuous monitoring
of efficacy and futil ityas the study will not be stopped early foreither efficacy or futility . 
Under protocol amendment 3, inStratum 2 subjects, thehypothes es for ORR per RECIST by IIR
areupdated to be H 0: ORR=0.10 vs. Ha: ORR=0.25 , based on the most recent pembrolizumab 
monotherapy KN086 study (Table 1) . Ther efore, additional subjects will be enrolled to ensure 80 
evaluable subjects in Stratum 2to provide >90% power for the comparison of H0: ORR=0.10 vs. 
Ha: ORR=0. 25at 1-sided alpha value of 0.025 using a binomia l exact test .Under protocol 
amendment 4, additional subjects will be enrolled to ensure at least 100 evaluable subjects are 
enrolled in Stratum 2 to obtain a more precise estimate of ORR. 
Final Analysis
Inall evaluable subjects (i.e., Stratum 1 and 2 ), Bayesian Posterior probability in equation (1) will 
be evaluated to determine the efficacy after the tumor response status has been collected from the 
last evaluable subjects. That is, to claim efficacy if P (p>0.2|data) ≥0.95 . A 2-sided 95% c redible 
interval of objective response rate in the evaluable subjects will be constructed to aid the 
interpretation of the results Details of predictive and posterior probabilities calculation will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
In the evaluable Stratum 2subjects , a binomial exact test will be used to test the estimated ORR 
versus a historical response rate of 10% at1-sided alpha value of 0.025. 
Subjects in the Phase 1b part who were treated at the RP2D and were deemed evaluable will be 
combined with Phase 2 subjects in the efficacy analysis. 
Secondary Efficacy
PFS, OS ,and DOR
Progression -free survival (PFS), OS ,and DOR will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier product -limit 
estimates.  Median PFS and OS and the cumulative probability of PFS, OS ,and DOR at 6 and 
12months will be presented with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) if estimable.  Censoring 
rules for PFS and DOR will be provided in the SAP.
The cumulative PFS, OS ,and DOR will be plott ed over time.  The median andfirst and third 
quartiles from Kaplan –

estimable. 
Clinical Benefit Rate
A 2-sided Clopper –Pearson 95% CI will be constructed for calculating exact binomial intervals. 
Exploratory Efficacy
In addition to RECIST1.1, tumor assessment data (ie, ORR, PFS, DOR, and CBR) will be assessed 
using irRECIST in the sensitivity analysis.  
The analysis of time to response (TTR) will follow the analysis of PFS.  The analysis will be 
performed in the subjects with confirmed PR/CR perRECIST1.1 by IIR .  
All efficacy analyses will be performed in all subjects and separately for each stratum .
Efficacy outcomes will be further evaluated in the PD -L1 Positive Set after a cutoff point is 
deter mined with external data.  The clinical utility of PD -L1 as a predictive marker in mTNBC 
subjects who receive eribulin mesylate and pembrolizumab combination treatment will be assessed.

Safety Analyses
RP2D and DLT
The Phase 1b study will include at least 1 safety run -in cohort in which 6 metastatic triple -negative 
breast cancer (mTNBC) subjects who receive eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2on Days 1 and 8 and 
pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 of a 21 -day cycle ( Dose Level 1).  Subjects will be observed for 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first c ycle.  The purpose of the safety run -in cohort(s) is to 
study safety of the 2 -drug combination.  The Phase 2 part will proceed with Dose Level 1 when no 
more tha n 1 subject has a DLT.  Otherwise, a lower eribulin mesylate dose of 1.1 mg/m2and 
pembrolizuma b 200 mg will be evaluated in another cohort of 6 subjects.  If no more than 1 subject 
has a DLT in the first cycle, the Phase 2 part will proceed with Dose Level 0 as the RP2D.  
Otherwise, alternative doses (eribulin mesylate 0.7 mg/m2) will be explored prior to the start of the 
Phase 2 part.
The DLT rate will be summarized descriptively at each combination dose level. Subsequent DLT s
will be reported and summarized as well.
Adverse Events
The incidence of treatment -emer gent adverse events throughout the study (graded according to 
NCI CTCAE 4.0 3) will be coded according to MedDRA and descriptively summarized overall, by 
grade, seriousness, action taken on study drug (including discontinuation and dose modification), 
and outcome for the Full Analysis Set (Safety Analysis Set).  
General Safety
Hem atology, serum chemistry and qualitative urinalysis laboratory analyses will be 
summarized descriptively for observed values, by grade, and by change from Baseline by 
cycle.  
Vital sign variables (body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and body wei ght) will be 
summarized descriptively for observed values, by grade, and change from Baseline.  
Physical examination results determined by the investigator to be clinically significant will 
be reported as an adverse event
ECOG performance status will be summarized descriptively for observed values, by grade, 
and by change from Baseline .  
Interim Analyses
Under Protocol Amendment 1 , interim decision scould be made based on the expected response 
rate at the end of the study, which compromises the current information with the future sample size 
via predictive probability approach .  The Bayesian design can continuously update the predictive 
probability of the study outcome, such that early termination of a study waspossible for either 
superiority or futilit y.  One interim analysis was performed after the first 39 enrolled subjects 
completed at least 2 post -baseline tumor assessments or discontinued due to PD or death.
Under Protocol Amendment 3, Bayesian PP continuous monitoring will not be applied.
Pharmac okinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of eribulin mesylate will be analyzed to determine PK parameters including 
maximum plasm a concentration (C max), time to maximum plasma concentration (t max), clearance 
(CL), area under the concentration- time curve (AUC), and terminal elimination phase half-life (t ½).
These PK parameters will be calculated at a minimum and additional parameters will be calculated

provided in a separate document.
Sample Size Rationale
A total of approximately 170subjects (at least 165 evaluable with 100in Stratum 2) will be 
enrolled .
Under Protocol Amendment 1 , 107 subjects including at least 6 from the Phase 1b part were 
enrolled in the study.  Enrollment was split into 2 strata, which include first -line ( Stratum 1) versus
second -and third-line ( Stratum 2) subjects.  Bayesian predictive probability wasused to monitor 
the study after response data from the first 38 subjects were available.  Sample size calculation was 
carried out assuming the historical response rate of 0.2.  Using simulation, the model parameters 
(θL=0.025, θ U =0.99 ,and θ T=0.95) were calibrated such that the frequentist 1-sided Type I error 
was 0. 0326 when the tumor response rate in the comb ination regimen was 0.2 (under frequentist’s 
null hypothesis H 0), and the power was 0. 9278 when the response rate was 0.35 (under 
frequentist’s alternative hypothesis H a).  The expected numbers of subjects needed to reach the 
decisions were 56 and 61 when p=0.2 (under H 0) and 0.35 (under H a), respectively.  A vague beta 
prior distribution for response rate, p, was specified in PP calculation; that is, p~beta (0.2, 0.8).  PP 
was updated for every 3 new subjects in the simulations, which mimics the group sequential 
decision -making in a real study setting.  Without Bayesian interim monitoring, the Type I error was 
estimated as 0. 0358 , and power was es timated as 0. 9418 in demonstrating posterior probability 
P(p>0.2|data) ≥0.95.  Five thousand simulations were run to estimate these design characteristics.
Per Amendment 3, additional subjects will be enrolled to ensure 80 evaluable subjects in Stratum 2.
Using binomial exact test, the power is 0. 92with 80 evaluable subjects to demonstrate statistical 
significance at 1-sided alpha of 0.025 for the assumptions of H 0: ORR=0. 10vs. Ha: ORR=0. 25.
With 80 subjects, the 95% confidence interval for ORR from bin omia l distribution will be 
0.160 -0.359 if the observed ORR is 0.25. Per Amendment 4, additional subjects will be enrolled to 
ensur e 100 e valuable subjects in Stratum 2. With 100 subjects, power will be increased to 98% and 
the 95% confidence interval forORR from binomial distribution will be 0.169- 0.347 if the 
observed ORR is 0.25 .

7INTRODUCTION
7.1 Indication
This is an open -label, single -arm multicenter Phase 1b/2 study  to evalua te the efficacy  and 
safet y of eribulin mesylate in co mbination wit h pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic 
triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of systemic 
anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting.
Eribulin mesylate (HALAV EN®) is a microtubule inhibitor indicated for the treatment of 
patients wi th metastati c breast cancer who have previously received at least 
2chemotherapeut ic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease .  Prior therapy should 
have included an anthracycline and a taxane in eit her the adjuvant or metastatic setting
(HALAV EN package insert ). 
Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) is a potent, humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) 
monoclonal antibody  (mAb) wi th high specificit y of binding to the programmed cell death 1 
(PD-1) receptor, thus inhibit ing its interacti on wi th programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2).Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinit y and potent receptor blocking act ivity for PD -1. 
Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as 
an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy  for advanced malignancies. Keytruda®
(pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications. 
For m ore details on specific indicat ions refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure.
Refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background 
inform ation on MK -3475.
Pembrolizumab is also being invest igated for treatment of mTNBC .  Results of “A Phase 1b 
Study  of Pembro lizumab in Pat ients with Advanced Tri ple-Negat ive Breast Cancer” 
indicated that it is effect ive and safe in this populatio n (Nanda, et al ., 2014 ).
This study  will evaluate whether this co mbinat ion results in better efficacy than eribulin 
mesylate or pembro lizumab monotherapy and provides an acceptable safety  profile in 
treating the mTNBC patient populat ion.

FINAL: 26 June 2020Confidential Page 43of 1277.1.1 Current Therapeutic Options
Triple negat ive breast cancer (TNBC) is a challenging disease with the poorest prognosis of 
all breast cancer subt ypes. Importantly , there are currently no known molecular targets for 
this subgroup. Cytotoxi c chem otherapy is the only sy stemic tre atment opti on for pati ents 
with mTNBC. To ident ify a targeted anticancer agent effect ive against mTNBC in 
combinat ion with chem otherapy  is a maj or unmet need in breast cancer treatment.
7.1.2 Eribulin Mesylate
7.1.2.1 Mechanism of Action of Eribulin Mesylate
Direct Cytotoxicity
Halichondrin B is a large polyether macrolide iso lated from the rare m arine sponge 
Halichondrin okadai .  It exhibit s potent anti cancer effects both in vitro and in vivo ( Lin, et 
al., 2000; Wang ,et al., 1999; Chang, et al.,1999) wi th a tubulin -based mechanism that 
appears to be distinct from all other antitubulin agents ( Lin, et al., 2000; Morse, et al., 2005; 
Rein, et al., 2000 ). Eribulin mesylate (E7389) i s a structurally  simplified, synthet ic analog of 
this marine natural  product that exhib its similar anticancer properties in preclinical models 
(Roninson, et al., 2001
) through a tubulin- based antimitotic mechanism similar to that of 
halichondrin B.  It is a nontaxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor that suppresses 
microtubule growth and seque sters tubulin into nonfunct ional aggregates, prevent ing mitotic 
spindle format ion with subsequent G2 -M arrest and apoptosis.  It exhibited potent anticancer 
effects in preclinical models of various malignancies, including breast cancer ( Lin, et al., 
2000; Morse, et al ., 2005; Roninson, et al., 2001; Ellis, et al., 1997; Stearns, et al., 2003; 
Arends, et al., 1990). This m echanism  of action is distinct fro m that of other anti tubulins, 
such that i t may be effect ive in pat ients with disease that is resistant to these agents.  In fact, 
eribulin mesylate demonstrated anti tumor activit y in preclinical studies with cell lines that 
are paclitaxel resistant as a result of beta tubulin mutations ( Gauthier, et al., 1996 ).  The in 
vivo animal model data also predicted that this agent would achieve greater efficacy than the 
taxanes and with fewer adverse effects. 
Effects on Tumor Vascular Remodeling and reversal of EMT in Pre -Clinical Models
It has been reported that the abnormal vasculature present in tumors impairs bl ood perf usion 
and oxygenat ion, leading to hy poxic condi tions, which prom otes invasi on, metastasi s, and 
overall aggressiveness o f tumor cells through epithelial mesenchymal transit ion 
(EMT) -related processes. Normalizat ion of vascular perfusio n is therefor e gaining interest as 
a therapeuti c approach to inhibit motilit y, invasiveness, and aggressiveness of tumor cells .  
Preclinical data suggest that eribulin mesylate improves tumor blood perfusio n through 
vascular remodeling, which may indirect ly contribute to reduced metastasis, invasio n, and 
reversal of EMT in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a normoxic tumor 
microenvironment ( Yoshida, et al., 2014; Funahashi , et al ., 2014).
7.1.2.2 Clinical Experience with Eribulin Mesylate 
Eribulin mesylate was first appr oved on 15 Nov 2010 in the USfor the treatm ent of pat ients 
with metastati c breast cancer ( MBC )who have previously received at least

Overall, approximately  5457 subjects have been enrolled in clinical studies since the 
Development International Birth Date; approximately 3984 subjects have received eribulin 
mesylate up to the data lock point of 14 May 2014 ( HALAVEN®Invest igator Brochure) .
Of the total  of 1349 serious adverse events ( SAEs )reported in subjects who received eribulin 
mesylate, 510 were assessed by  the invest igator as related to eribulin mesylate and 839 were 
reported as unrelated to eribulin mesylate.  The most frequent treatment -related SAEs were 
febrile neutropenia, neutropenia and py rexia ( HALAVEN®Invest igator’s Brochure ).
In summary, eribulin mesylate provides clinical benefit for the treatment of patients with 
locally recurring breast cancer and MBC previously  treated wi th chem otherapeutic regimens.  
Eribulin mesylate has an acceptable safet y profile.  The risk of toxicit y with eribulin 
mesylate is comparable or less than that for other agents currently used in this populat ion.  
Proposed precautions and dose adjust ments will allow the toxicit y of eribulin mesylate to be 
managed appropriately.  Eribulin mesylate is provided as a ready -to-use formulat ionthat is 
easily  administered wi thout the need for premedications to prevent hypersensit ivity.  It i s 
therefore concluded that the benefit -risk rati o of eribulin mesylate continues to be favorable.
7.1.3 Pembrolizumab
7.1.3.1 Mechanism of Action of P embrolizumab
Immune Restoration
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal ant ibody  
(mAb) wi th high specificit y of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) receptor, thus 
inhibit ing its interacti on wi th programmed cell death ligand (PD -L1) and programmed cell 
death ligand 2 (PD -L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembro lizumab has high affinit y 
and potent receptor blocking act ivity for PD -1.  Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical 
safet y profile and is in clinical development as an i ntravenous (IV) immunotherapy  for 
advanced malignancies.  Key truda®(Pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of 
patients across a number of indications.  For more details on specific indications refer to the 
Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
Refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure/approved labeling for detailed background information 
on MK -3475.
7.1.3.2 Clinical Experience w ith Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab has demonstrated initial clinical efficacy in single arm mo notherapy  studi es
in subjects wi th non-small cell lun g cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcino ma, 
urothelial cancer, gastric cancer, triple negat ive breast cancer and Hodgkin’s Lympho ma as 
determined by response rate.  Ongoing clinical studi esare being conducted in these tumor 
types as well as a number of other advanced solid tumor indicat ions and hematologic 
malignancies.  For study  details please refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure.

7.2 Study Rationale
There are currently no known mo lecular targets for mTNBC and c ytotoxi c chem otherapy  is 
the only systemic treatment option for thesepatients.
Recent advances in genomics and gene expressio n profiling have shed new ligh t on the 
significant heterogeneit y within TNBC. In particular, theCancer Geno me At las RNA 
sequencing data was used (Mittendorf, et al., 2014 )to show significantly greater expressio n 
of the T -cell inhibitory  molecule programmed cell death receptor -1 (PD -1) ligand 1 (PD -L1)
gene in TNBC (n =120) compared wit h non -TNBC (n =716; P <0.001) .Breast tumor tissue 
microarrays were also evaluated for PD-L1 expression, which was present in 19% (20 of 
105) of TNBC specimens .  
Pembrolizumab, an ant i-PD-1 monoclonal  antibody that rel eases ant itumor i mmune response 
blocked by thePD-L1 pathway , is being investi gated f or mTNBC and a preliminary  study  
indicated that it is safe and effect ive in this populatio n (Nanda , et al ., 2014 ).Preliminary 
resul t of a Phase 2 study of pembro lizumab monotherapy for p reviously treated mTNBC also 
showed potential efficacy  (Adams, et al., 2017 ).
Eisai clinical studi es (Study  305 and Study  301) show edthat eribulin mesylate has better 
efficacy than the Treatm ent of Physician’s Cho ice (TPC) and capecitabine , respectively, in 
mTNBC. 
Efficacies of Study  305 and Study  301 in m TNBC, as well  as a pembro lizumab stud iesin 
patients wi th advanced TNBC, are listed in Table 1.

Eribulin mesylate and pembro lizumab each havea unique mechanism of act ion (direct 
cytotoxi city and immune restorati on, respect ively) and a different safet y profile ,hence
combinat ion therapy  with these 2agents may provide better antitumor outcomes over that 
seen with eit her agent alone ( Table 1).
In addit ion to i ts direct cy totoxi city actions, p reclinical data suggest that eribulin mesylate
has significant beneficial effects on tumor v ascular remodeling that could potentially  resul t in 
improved tumor blood perfusio n.  Therefore, eribulin mesylate may lead to increased

antitumor activit y in the clin ical setting when the 2 drugs are administered simultaneously.  
From  a safet y perspect ive, the most frequent SAEs associated with eribulin mesylate
(eg,neutropenia) and most frequent adverse react ions associated with pembro lizumab
(eg,immune -mediated adverse reactions) are not overlapping . Thus, it is not expected that 
these individual toxicities will be exacerbated with combined use of the 2drugs.
Therefore, this study  combining eribulin mesylate and pembro lizumab may provide a new 
system atic treatm ent opti on for mTNBC.

9INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 Overall Study Des ign and Plan
This is an open -label, single -arm, mul ticenter, Phase 1b/2 study  of eribulin mesylate in 
combinat ion with pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic triple -negative breast cancer 
previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of systemic ant icancer therapy  (cytotoxi c or targeted 
anticancer agents) in the metastatic setting.  Subjects may have received prior neo/adjuvant 
chemotherapy.  
The Phase 1b part includes 1 initial safet y run-in cohort in which at least 6 subjects (up to a 
maximum o f 12) will receive eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2intravenously (IV) on Days 1 and 
8 of a 21- day cycle and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day  1 of a 21 -day cycle ( Dose Level 
1).  Dose -limit ing toxicit y (DLT) will be assessed in the first cy cle.  Dose Level 1 can be 
selected as the recommend ed Phase 2 dose (RP2D) if no more than 1 subject has a DLT.  
Otherwi se,theeribulin mesylate dose will be lowered fro m 1.4 m g/ m2to 1.1 m g/m2on Days 
1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle ( Dose Level 0).  If  no more than 1 out of 6 subjects at Dose Level 0 
has a DLT, the Phase 2 part will proceed with Dose Level 0.  Approximately 12 subjects m ay 
be enrolled in the Phase 1b part of the study .  
As of Protocol Amendment 05, the RP2D was determined to be eribulin 1.4 mg/m2IV 
administered on Day 1 and Day 8 of each 21 -day cycle wi th pembro lizumab 200 mg IV 
administered on Day  1 of each 21 -day cycle.
Approximately  170 subjects in total (including subjects in Phase 1b who are on RP2D level) 
will be enro lled in 2strata and receive the same combinat ion treatment attheRP2D level.  
The strata include no prior systemic ant icancer therapy in the metastatic setting ( Stratum 1) 
and previously  treated wi th 1 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic 
setting ( Stratum 2). 
Under Protocol  Amendment 1 , for the first 100 evaluable subjects enro lled, Bayesian 
predi ctive probabilit y (PP) of  response rate will be used to monitor the response rate after

FINAL: 26 June 2020Confidential Page 49of 127postbaseline tumor assessments for at least 38 subjects are available.  The study  coul d be 
stopped early for efficacy or futilit y if PP crosses the prespecified boundary .  Hence, efficacy 
concl usion of the primary endpoint ORR could be made on the basis o f the predi ctive 
probabilit y prior to the full enrollment of 100 evaluable subjects in the study  (see the
Statistical Methods Section 9.7for details).
Per Protocol  Amendment 3, a dditional subjects will be added to Stratum 2 in order to include 
a total  of 80 evaluable subjects in Stratum 2 for final  analysis. Therefore, a total of 
approximately  150 subjects (145 evaluable with 80 in Stratum 2) will be enrolled. 
Per Protocol  Amendment 4 , 20 additional subjects will be added to Stratum 2 in order to 
include a total of at least 100 evaluable subjects in Stratum 2for final analysis. Therefore, a 
total of approximately 170 subjects (at least 165 evaluable wit h 100 in Stratum 2) will  be 
enrolled.
Pharmacokinet ic assessments of eribulin mesylate will be performed in all subjects in the 
Phase 1b part of the study .  Subjects in the Phase 2 part will undergo sparse PK sampling for 
popul ation PK/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD) analysis where feasible.

End-of-Treatm ent visi t (or the end of the 90-day followup for serious adverse events 
[SAEs]/events of clinical interest [ECIs]) for the last subject.   As of Protocol Amendment 05, 
Follow-
Up asessments in the Posttreatment Phase will no l onger need to be performed.
9.1.1 Pretreatment Phase
The Pretreatm ent Phase consists of the Screening Period, whi ch will occur between Day  –21 
and Day –1.  The purpose of the Screening Period is to obtain informed consent and to 
establish protocol eligibilit y.  Inform ed consent will be obtained after the study  has been 
fully explained to each subject and before the conduct of any  screening procedures or 
assessments.  Procedures to be fo llowed when obtaining informed consent are detailed in 
Secti on5.3.
9.1.2 Treatment Phase
The Treatment Phase of the study  will begin wi th the first dose of study  drug administrati on 
in Cycle 1 and cont inue in21-daycycles unt il complet ion of the End of Treatment 
assessments (within 30 days after the l ast study  drug administration )or subj ect

The Fo llow-Up Peri od will begin immediately  after the End of Treatment assessments have 
been co mpleted and will continue as long as the study  subject is alive or the study  subject 
withdraws co nsent.  Subjects who discont inue study treatment before diseas e progressi on 
will cont inue to undergo disease assessment every 12weeks ±1 week until documentation of 
disease progressi on or start of another anticancer therapy.  Subjects who are being follow ed 
for survival at the time of data cutoff for the primary  analysis (ie, at the end of the Treatment 
Phase) will cont inue to be fo llowed for survival during the posttreatment Follow -Up Peri od.
Note: As of Protocol Amendment 05, Follow -Up asessments no lon ger need to be 
perform ed.
After the last subject has co mpleted 35 cy cles of pembro lizumab ,all ongoing subjects will be 
transi tioned off study .  Subj ects still receiving eribulin mo notherapy  at thistime may
continue to receive eribulin treatm entoff study  through their pharmacy  (if commercially  
available for that individual subject) or through a patient assistance program administered by 
the sponsor.   Subjects will cont inue to receive eribulin invest igational product and will be 
assessed according to the Schedule of Procedures/ Assessments ( Table 8) until they co mplete 
the End-of-Treatment visit ,prior to thei r transi tion to commercial eribulin or an access

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
Thisis an open -label study  in metastatic breast cancer that will evaluate the combinat ion of 2
drugs wi th proven ant icancer activit y to determine whether the agents have improved activit y 
with an acceptable toxicityprofile .  The study  desi gn was adapted fro mprevious studies of 
these agents and may offer a new systemat ic treatment option for the indicat ion
.
The inclusio n and exclusio n criteria are standard for anticancer studies in the desired 
popul ation andare desi gned to enroll subjects who can possibly benefit fro m treatm ent and at 
the sam e time limit possible harmful effects both to study  subjects and to unborn children 
from unplanned pregnancies. 
The key  endpoints are standard for cancer studies. 
9.3 Selection of Study Population
A total of approximately  170 adult female or male subjects previously  treated wi th 0 to 
2lines of systemic ant icancer therapy in the metastatic setting will be enrolled ( including at 
least 6 subjects from the Phase 1b part ).  It i s estimated that 165 ( at least 100 in Stratum 2)of 
the 170subjects will be evaluable for the primary analysis.   Approximately 25 study  sites in

treatm ent, the subject will enter the Posttreatm ent Phase and co mplete protocol -specified 
off-treatm ent visi ts, procedures, and survival fo llow-up unless the subject withdraws consent.  
The invest igator should confirm whether a subject will wit hdraw fro m study  treatm ent but 
agree to continue protocol -specified, off -treatm ent study  visits, procedures, and survival 
follow-up, or whether the subject will wit hdraw consent.  If a subject withdraws consent, the 
date will be documented in the source documents.  The Subject Disposit ioncase report form 
(CRF)page will be completed indicat ing the reason for discont inuat ion from treatment.  In 
addition, the date of last dose of study  drugs will be recorded on the Study  Drug Dosing CRF 
page.
In subjects who discont inue study  therapy  without docum ented di sease progressi on, every  
effort should be made to continue mo nitoring their disease status by  radiologic imaging every  
every 9 weeks ± 1 week during Year 1, and every  9to12 weeks ±1 week thereafter

Before dose administration, the amount of eribulin mesylate needed for each subject must be 
calculated in the following manner:
1.Scheduled dose (mg/m2) ×body  surface area (m2) = Dose (m g)
2.Dose (m g) ×2 = the number of mL of eribulin mesylate to withdraw fro m vials for 
administration.
Body  surface area (BSA) will be calculated using any method that is accepted and 
custom arily used by  the invest igational site, such as the Mosteller formula:
BSA (m2) = ([Hei ght ([cm ] ×Weight (kg))] /3600)½
Height and body  weight will be recorded at the screening visit.  Thereafter, body weight will 
be recorded on Day  1 of each treatm ent cycle to recalculate BSA (in the event that weight 
has changed by 10% or more *). 
*Note: If institutional guidelines requi re BSA recalculat ion starting at 5% or more weight 
change, this will be acceptable. 
The am ount of  eribulin mesylate required (as calculated above) will be withdrawn fro m the 
appropriate number of vials into a sy ringe.  This may  be administered direct ly as an

Dose modification and toxicity management for immune -related AEs associated with 
pembrolizumab
AEs associ ated wi th pembro lizumab exposure may represent an immunologic et iology. 
These immune -related AEs (i rAEs) m ay occur shortly  after the first dose or several m onths 
after the l ast dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may  affect m ore than on body  system  
simultaneously .Therefore, early recognit ion and init iation of treatment is crit ical to reduce 
complicat ions.  Based on exist ing clinical study data, m ost irAEs w ere reversible and could 
be managed with interruptions o f pembro lizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or 
other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluat ion to confirm etio logy 
or exclude other causes. Addit ional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy , 
skin biopsy may  be included as part of the evaluat ion. Based on the severit y of irAEs, 
withhol d orpermanent lydiscont inue pembro lizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose 
modificati on and toxici ty management gui delines for irAEs associated with pembr olizumab 
are provided in Table 4.
Subjects shoul d receive appropri ate supportive care measures as deemed necessary  by the 
treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with 
potent ial immuno logic etiology are outlined alo ng with the dose modificat ion gui delines.
Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV treatment with 
corticosteroi ds, as well  as addi tional ant i-inflammatory  agents if symptoms do not improve 
with administrati on of  corti costeroi ds.Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be 
necessary  as symptoms m ay worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, 
attempts shoul d be m ade to rul e out other causes such as metastatic disea se or bacteri al or 
viral infect ion, which might require addit ional supporti ve care. The treatment guidelines are 
intended to be applied when the invest igator determines the events to be related to 
pembro lizumab. 
Note: If after the evaluat ion of the even t, it is determined not to be related to 
pembro lizumab, the invest igator does not need to follow the treatment guidance. Refer to 
Table 4for guidelines regarding dose m odificat ion and supportive care. 
It may be necessary  to perform  condi tional procedure s such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy , or 
skin photography as part of evaluat ion of the event.

General instructions:
1.Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper 
over at least 4 weeks.
2.For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has 
been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and cort icosteroid has been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or corticosteroids cannot 
be reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks. 
3.For severe and life -threat ening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral 
steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by 
corticosteroids.

assigned to receive eribulin mesylate in combinat ion with pembrolizumab.  There is no 
rando mizat ion in this study . Subjects will be enrolled fro m 2strata: no prior systemic 
anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting and previously treated with 1 to 2 lines o f 
systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting.
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The level 1 dose of eribulin mesylate (1.4 mg/m2IV on Days 1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle) was
selected based on the FDA approved label.
The pembro lizumab dose used in the study  of metastatic melano ma was 2 mg/kg every  
3weeks ( Q3W )and in advanced TNBC was 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W ).  This study  
will use a 200 m g Q3W fixed dose.  The rationale to use a 200 m g Q3W fixed dose is based 
on a populat ion PK analysis from  476 subjects with the fo llowing findings:
the relat ionship between clearance and body  weight, wi th an all ometric exponent of 
0.59, supports both body  weight normalized dosing and a fixed dose across all body  
weights
pembro lizumab has a wide therapeut ic range (exposure margins of 0.5 –5.0) based 
on the m elano ma indicat ion
exposure i s similar between melano ma and other solid tumor indicat ions.
Therefore, the 200 mg Q3W f ixed dose regimen is likely  similar, wi th regard to efficacy and 
tolerabilit y, to the 10 m g/kg Q2W dose regimen, and there are no anticipated changes in 
exposure between different indicat ion settings.  
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
All subjects will receive pembro lizumab first, follo wed immediately by eribulin mesylate on

9.5.1.4.1 TUMOR RESPONSE ASSESSMENT
Tumor assessments will be performed using RECIST 1.1 (Appendix 3).  Investi gator 
assessment will be performed at each assessment time point and entered onto the CRFs. 
Copi es of  all tum or asse ssment scans will be sent to an independent core laboratory  
designated by  the sponsor for efficacy assessment. Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 05 ,
tumor assessment scans will no longer be sent to an independent imaging core l aboratory . 
Tumor assessments will be carried out during the Pretreatment Phase and then every  9 weeks
± 1 week (or sooner if there is evidence of progressive disease) after the start of study  
treatm ent.  Com puted tom ography/MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and of other 
known sites o f disease will  be obtained at Screening (within 28 days prior to Cycle 1/Day  1), 
at all tum or assessment time points, and as indicated clinically .  Col or photographs 
containing a mm scale must be taken of all skin lesio ns being used as target l esions.  
Historical standard of care scans that are performed with scanning parameters consistent with 
the requirements for this protocol wit hin 28 days prior to dosing are acceptable.   
The CT scan should be a diagnostic qualit y spiral or m ultidetector CT wi th oral and i odinated 
IV contrast, and the MRI scan should be performed with IV gadolinium chelate .  Scans of the 
abdo men, pelvis, and other areas of the body  may be done wi th MRI instead of CT, but 
evaluat ion of the chest must be done with CT.  If iodinated IV contrast is contraindicated, the 
chest evaluation should be done with non -contrast CT, and the abdo men and pelvis 
evaluat ion shoul d be perform ed using ei ther CT with oral contrast (without IV contrast) or 
MRI wi th gadolinium chelate IV contrast (the latter is preferred) .  Spiral/mult idetector CT 
shoul d be perform ed wi th a 5-mm cont iguous slice reconstruction algorithm. If body  MRI 
scans are performed, contiguous slices o f 5 mm are al so recommended. 
Low-dose non -contrast CT transmissio nscans from a positron emissio n tom ography -CT 
(PET -CT) combinat ion scanner are not acceptable .  Ult rasound should not be used for 
radiographic tum or assessment.  Chest disease may  not be foll owed using chest x -ray.  
A brain scan (CT with contrast or MRI p re-and post -gadolinium) must be performed at 
Screening (within 28 days prior to Cycle 1/Day  1),to assess potential CNS disease and/or 
metastases.  For subjects with previously treated eligible brain metastases, a brain scan will 
be perform ed at tum or ass essment time po ints, if clinically indicated.

course of treatment or the dose of contrast needs to be adjusted based on the subject’s healt h 
status.  
Bone scans will be performed at Screening, every  27 weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated, 
and at confirmation o f CR.  A bone scan (99m-technet ium polyphosphonate scint igraphy, 
whole body  bone MRI, or 18F-NaF-PET) to assess bone metastases will be performed wi thin 
6 weeks prior to C1D1 (historical scans are acceptable) and then every 27 weeks (within that 
27th week) from C1D1, or sooner if clinically indicated.  In subjects whose body  CT/MRI 
scans indicate CR has been achieved, a bone scan will be requi red at confirmat ion of CR to 
exclude new bone metastases.  The same methodology  and acquisit ion techniques used at 
screening should be used throughout the study  to ensure com parabili ty.  Lesio ns detected on 
bone scans must be followed with cross -sectio nal imaging.
Tumor response will be confirmed by  a second examinat ion performed no less than 4 weeks 
after the first observat ion of response .  Best overall response (BOR) of stable disease requires 
at least 1 posttreatment assessment that meets the SD crit eria at l east 8 weeks after the start 
of treatm ent.
In subjects who discont inue study  therapy  without docum ented di sease progressi on, every  
effort should be made to continue mo nitoring their disease status by  radiologic imaging every

9.5.1.4.2 IRRECIST AFTER INITIAL RADIOLOGIC PROGRESSION
Since pembro lizumab , like other immunotherapeutic agents, may produce antitumor effects 
after an ini tial increase in tumor burden, standard RECIST criteria may  not provi de a 
complete response assessment of its efficacy .  irRECIST is RECIST 1.1 adapted as described 
below to accoun t for the uni que tum or response seen wit h immunotherapeutic drugs. 
irRECIST will be used by site invest igator/local radio logy review to assess tumor response 
and progression, and make treatment decisio ns.This data will be co llected in the clinical 
database. Treatment efficacy based on irRECIST as assessed by central imaging vendor 
review will be evaluated retrospectively .
The key  changes for i rRECIST from  RECIST v1.1 is the abilit y to continue treatm ent, if 
clinically stable ,until a repeat imaging scan ≥4 weeks after the first radi ologi c evidence of 
PDconfirm sprogressive disease .  Therefore, i n addi tion to radi ographic assessment of tumor 
response or progression, irRECIST (see Appendix 4) takes into account the clinical 
condi tion/stabilit y of subjects ( Table 6)
. 
Clinically stable is defined by  the f ollowing criteria:

Eribulin mesylate PK/PD analysis will be conducted to evaluate the relationship between 
exposure and efficacy  and exposure and safet y when eribulin mesylate is coadministered 
with pembro lizumab.  
9.5.1.5.3 OTHER BIOMARKER ASSESSMENTS
Archived and/or fresh (if possible) tissue samples will be co llected at screening for 
assessment of PD -1/PD -L1 expressio n.  Fresh biopsy  tissues shoul d be limi ted to readily  
accessible tumor lesions ( eg, breast, peripheral lymph node, or skin).
Collected tumor tissues may be used for potential assessment of mutations and other genet ic 
alterati ons or genes that m ay be important in the development and progression of cancer as 
well as for potential use in diagnostic development.  The decisio n to pe rform other bio marker 
assessments may be based on the clinical outcome of this study  and/or the si gnals observed

9.5.1.6 Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of the monitoring and recording of all AEs, including all 
CTCAE v4.0 3grades for both increasing and decreasing severit y (Appendix 6),and SAEs;
regul ar monitoring of hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , and urine; periodic measurement of
vital signs; and the perform ance of physical examinat ions, as detailed in Table 8.
9.5.1.6.1 ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
An AE is any  untoward m edical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an invest igational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drugs are eribulin mesylate 
and pembro lizumab.
The cri teria for identifying AEs in this study  are:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease tem porally associated wi th the use of an invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product (Note:  Every  sign or 
symptom  shoul d not be listed as a separate AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE) .
Any new disease or exacerbat ion of an exist
ing disease .  However, worsening of the 
primary  disease shoul d be captured under efficacy  assessments as disease progression 
rather than as an AE.

An abnormal laboratory  test resul t shoul d be considered an AE if the ident ified laboratory 
abnorm ality leads to any  type of  intervent ion, withdrawal  of study  drug, or wi thhol ding 
of study  drug , whether pr escrib ed in the protocol or not .
All AEs observed during the study  will be reported on the Adverse Event CRF.  All AEs, 
regardl ess of rel ationship to study  drug or procedure, should be collected beginning fro m the 
time the subject signs the s tudy ICF and for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.
SAEs will be collected for 90 day sand ECIs will be collected for 30 days after the l ast dose
or 30 day s following the l ast dose if the subject initiates new ant icancer therapy , whichever is 
earlier .An AE wil l not be reported on the Adverse Event CRF if other anticancer treatment 
is started.  All SAEs will be report ed on the Adverse Event CRF.
Abnorm al laboratory  values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical synd rome that i s being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibilit y of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine whether they 
constitute an AE.  Medical and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
an isolated laboratory  abnormalit y shoul d be cl assified as an AE.  Any laboratory  
abnorm ality considered to consti tute an AE shoul d be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
All AEs must be fo llowed for 30 days after the subject’s last dose, or until reso lution,or the 
start of new anticancer therapy , whichever com es first .  SAEs m ust be fo llowed for 90 day s

All SAEs should be fo llowed to resol ution or, if resolut ion is unlikely, to stabilizat ion.
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during 
treatm ent, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) , or:
Reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but 
stopped before tre atment, or
Worsens in severit y during treatment relat ive to th e pretreatment state, when the AE 
is cont inuous.
Disease progressi on is a study  endpo int and shoul d be captured in the CRF as per the 
guidelines for reporting disease progressi on.

AEs will be graded on a 5-point scale according to Commo n Termino logy Cri teria for 
Adverse Events ( [CTCAE v 4.03];see Appendix 6; also available fro m: 
http://www.hrc.gov t.nz/si tes/default/files/CTCAE%20m anual %20-%20DMCC.pdf ).  
Invest igators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing 
severi ty).  
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatm ent are:
Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatm ent
The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatm ent or wi th other 
similar treatments
The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each AE to the study  drug will  be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question:
Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s a reasonable 
possibilit y.
No (not related) A causal rel ationship between the study  drug and the AE i s not a 
reasonable possibilit y.
9.5.1.6.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
event as i t occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form or was allowed to con tinue, might have caused death)
 Requi res inpat ient hospitalizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y

Other important medical events that may  not be immediately life -threatening or resul t in 
death or hospitalizat ion but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes in the definit ion of 
SAE listed above should al so be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. 
In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy  or 
exposure to stu dy drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error .  These events associ ated wi th special situat ions are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they meet 1of
the above criteria.  All AEs associ ated wi thspecial si tuations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they  meet the cri teria for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if resolut ion is unlikely, tostabilizat ion.
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” (ie, there i s no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospitalizat ion:
Hospitalizations for respite care 
Planned hospi talizat ions required by the protocol
Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the 
hospi talizati on has not changed afterstudy  drug administrati on)
Hospitalization for administration of study  drug or insertion of access for 
administration of study drug
Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was 
in place before study  entry

n:Screening tumor assessments using CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and other areas of known disease or newly suspected di sease should be 
performed within 28 days prior to C1D1.  Scans of the abdomen, pelvis ,and other areas of the body may be done with MRI instead of CT, but 
evaluation of the chest should be done with CT.  CT scans should be performed with oral and iodinated IV contrast and MRI sca ns with IV gadolinium 
chelate unless there is a medical contra indication to contrast.  If iodinated IV contrast is contraindicated, chest CT should be done without IV contrast.
Treatment Phase:  Tumor assessments of the chest, abdomen ,and pelvis and other areas where scans were performed at screening or newly suspe cted 
disease should be performed every 9 weeks ±1 week after the start of study treatment (or sooner if there is evidence of progressive disease) and should 
use the same methodology (CT or MRI) and scan acquisition techniques (including use or nonuse of IV contrast) as were used for the screening 
assessments.  Objective responses must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later (eg, generally at the next tumor assessment time point ).  
Screening brain scans will be performed by MRI pre -and post -gadolinium or CT with contrast within 28 days prior to C1D1.  During the Treatment 
Phase, CT/MRI of the brain will be performed if clinically indicated, and within a target of 1 week after a subject achieves an irCR.   For subjects with 
history  of treated brain metastases, brain scans will be performed at tumor assessment time points if clinically indicated .  The same methodology and 
scan acquisition techniques used at screening should be used throughout the study to ensure comparability.
A bone scan (99m-technetium polyphosphonate scintigraphy, whole body bone MRI, or 18F-NaF) to assess bone metastases will be performed within 
6weeks prior to C1D1 (historical scans are acceptable) and then every 27 weeks (within that 27th week) from C1D1, or sooner if clinically indicated.  
In subjects whose body CT/MRI scans indicate CR has been achieved, a bone scan will be required at confirmation of CR to excl ude new bone

Any pregnancy  in which the estimated date of conception is either before the last visit or 
within 120days o f last study  treatm entor 30 day s following last study  treatment if the 
subject init iates new ant icancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported.  Also ,any 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding during study  treatm ent or wi thin 120days of 
last study  treatm entor30 day s following last study treatment if the subject init iates new 
anticancer therapy , whichever is earlier , must be reported .
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
shoul d be reported regardless of the length o f time that has passed since the exposure to study  
treatm ent.
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
aborti on are consi dered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same t ime frame and in
the sam e format as all  other SAEs (seeReporting of Serious Adverse Events ,
Secti on9.5.4.1 ).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must be r eported by  fax or 
email as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day  from the date the invest igator 
beco mes aware of the pregnancy.  The contact informat ion for the reporting of pregnancies 
and exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding is provid ed in the Invest igator Study  File.  
The Pregnancy Report Form must be used for reporting.  All pregnancies must be followed to 
outcom e.  The outcom e of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 1 business day fro m the date the in vestigator beco mes aware of the outcome.
A subject who beco mes pregnant must be withdrawn fro m the study  (all off -treatm ent study  
assessments should apply).

than the protocol -defined dose.  For this study , anoverdose of 
pembro lizumab will be defined as ≥1000 mg (5 times the 200 m g 
dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of pembro lizumab. In the event of overdose, the subject 
shoul d be observed closely for signs of toxicit y.  Appropri ate 
supportive treatment should be provided if clinically  indicated.
Misuse Intentional and inappropriate use of study  drug not in accordance with 
the protocol. 
Abuse Sporadi c or persi stent intent ional exc essive use of study  drug 
accompanied by harmful physical or psy chological effects
Medicat ion error Any unintentional event that causes or leads to inappropriate study  
drug use or subject harm while the study  drug i s in the control  of the 
healt hcare profess ional, subject, or consumer.  Such events may  be 
related to professio nal pract ice, healt hcare products, occupational 
exposure, procedures, or systems, including prescribing, order 
communicat ion, product labeling/packaging/no menclature, 
compounding, di spens ing, di stributi on, administratio n, education,

the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adver se Events (Secti on9.5.4.1 ),even if the AEs do not m eet seri ous cri teria. 
Abuse is always to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associated with an overdose or 
medicat ion error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form 
and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the 
Adverse Event CRF .
9.5.4.3.2 REPORTING OF STUDY-S PECIFIC EVENTS /EVENTS OF CLINICAL INTEREST
Study -specific events (Events of Clinical Interest [ECIs]) should always be considered as 
serious important m edical events and be entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported 
using the procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious Adverse Events ( Section 9.5.4.1 ), even 
if the study -specific event does not meet other serious criteria. 
Events of clinical interest for this study includ e: an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is 
greater than or equal to 3 × ULN and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than 
or equal to 2× ULN and, at the same t ime, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 
2 × ULN, as determine d by way of protocol -specified laboratory  testing or unscheduled

9.7.1.6.1 PRIMARY EFFICAC Y ANALYSIS
At least 165evaluable subjects on RP2D will be enro lled in the study , including Phases1b 
and 2.
Bayesian predictive probabilit y (PP) design wa s used in ori ginal  study  design. Under 
original  design, in the combined Stratum 1 and 2 subjects, the ORR value per RECIST 1.1 by  
IRR was assumed to be 0.20 for the historical control based on the recent studies(Table 1). 
The ORR in this study is est imated to be 0.35. Under protocol amendment 1, approximately 
100 evaluable subjects were expected to be enrolled. Bayesian PP was used to m onitor the 
response rate after postbaseline tumor assessments of at least 38 subjects were available.  The 
calculat ion of PP was based on the goal of claiming superiorit y of the comb inationat the end 
of the study  if

where p was the response rate of the comb ination , 0.2 was the response rate of historical 
control  based on single agents pembro lizumab and eribulin in recent studi es(Table 1), 0.95 
was the prespecified target probabilit y (θ T),and P(p>0.2|data) is the posterior probabilit y.  
On the basis of the accumulated data thus far in the study, the probabilit ies of all possible 
future outcomes that lead to equation (1) at the end of the study woul d be added in order to 
obtain the predict ive probabilit y.  Therefore, early decisio n of study  terminat ion prior to 
reaching approximat ely 100 evaluable subjects was possible for claiming the combinat ion is 
promising when PP is above a prespecified upper thresho ld (θ U) or f or claiming fut ility when 
PP is below a prespecified l ower threshold (θ L).  The upper and lower cutoff probabilit ies for 
decisio n-making, θ Uand θ L, 
were set as 0.99 and 0.025.  Under the predict ive monitoring, the 
study  proceeded as follows:
If PP> θ U(=0.99), stop the study  and cl aim the comb inationpromising
If PP< θ L(=0.025), stop the study  and claim the comb ination not promising
Otherwi se, continue the study  until the number of evaluable subjects reaches to 100
The Bayesian stopping boundaries are included in Appendix 1.
After complet ion of enrollment under protocol amendment 1 , Bay esian PP is no l onger used 
for continuous m onitoring of efficacy and fut ility as the study  will not be stopped early  for 
either efficacy or futilit y. 
Under protocol amendment 3, in Stratum 2 subjects, the hypotheses for ORR per RECIST by  
IIR are updated to be H 0: ORR=0.10 vs. Ha: ORR=0.25, based on the most recent 
pembro lizumab monotherapy study (Table 1). Therefore, addit ional subjects will be enrolled 
to ensure 80 evaluable subjects in Stratum 2 to provide >90% power for the comparison of 
H0: ORR=0.10 vs. Ha: ORR=0.25 at 1
-sided alpha value of 0.025 .Under Protocol 
Amendment 4, additional subjects will be enrolled to ensure 100 evaluable subjects in 
Stratum 2 to obtain more precise est imate of ORR. 
Final Analysis
Inthe evaluable subjects in Stratum 1 and 2 combined , Bayesian posteri or probabilit y in 
equati on (1) will be evaluated to determine the efficacy  of the combinat ion regimen after the 
tumor response status has been co llected fro m the last evaluable subjects.  That is, to claim 
efficacy  if P(p>0.2|data) ≥0.95.  A 2-sided 95% credible interval of object ive response rate in 
the evaluable subjects will be constructed to aid the interpretation of the results.  Details o f 
predi ctive and posterior probabilit ies calculat ion will  be provi ded in the SAP. 
In the evaluable Stratum 2subjects, a bino mial exact test will be used to test the estimated 
ORR per RECIST 1.1 by  IIR versus a historical response rate of 10% at1-sided alpha value 
of 0.025.

9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size
A total o f approximately  170 subjects ( approximately 165evaluable with at least 100in 
Stratum 2) will  be enrolled. 
Under Protocol  Amendment 1 , 107 subjects including at least 6 from the Phase 1b part were
enrolled in the study .  Enrollment was into
2strata, which include dfirst-line ( Stratum 1) 
versus second -and third-line ( Stratum 2) subjects.  Bay esian predi ctive probabilit y wasused 
to monitor the study  after response data from the first 38 subjects were available.  Sample 
size calculat ion was carried out assuming the historical response rate of 0.2.  Using 
simulat ion, the m odel param eters (θ L=0.025, θ U =0.99 ,and θ T=0.95) were calibrated such that 
the frequent ist 1-sided Ty pe I error was 0. 0326 when the tum or response rate in the 
combinat ionregimen was 0.2 (under frequentist’s null hypothesis H 0), and the power was 
0.9278 when the response rate was 0.35 (under frequent ist’s alternat ive hypothesis H a).  The 
expected numbers of subjects needed to reach the decisio ns were 56 and 61 when p=0.2 
(under H 0) and 0.35 (under H a), respectively.  A vague beta prior distribut ion for response 
rate, p, was specified in PP calculat ion; that i s, p~beta (0.2, 0.8).  PP was updated for every 3 
new subjects in the simul ations, which mimics the group sequent ial decisi on making in a real 
study setting.  Wit hout Bayesian interim monitoring, the Ty pe I error was estimated as 
0.0358 , and power was estimated as 0. 9418 in demonstrating posterior probabilit y 
P(p>0.2|data) ≥0.95.   Five thousand simulations were run to estimate these design 
characterist ics.

Stratum 2. Using bino mial exact test, the power is 0. 92with 80 evaluable subjects to 
demonstrate statistical significan ce at 1 -sided al pha of  0.025 for the assumpt ions of H0: 
ORR=0. 10vs. Ha: ORR=0. 25.With 80 subjects, the 95% confidence interval for ORR from 
binomial distribut ion will be 0.160- 0.359 if the observed ORR is 0.25. 
Per Amendment 4, addit ional subjects will be enrolled to ensure 100 evaluable subjects in 
Stratum 2. With 100 subjects, power will be increased to 98% and the 95% confidence 
interval  for ORR from binomial distribut ion will be 0.169 -0.347 if the observed ORR is 0.25.
9.7.3 Interim Analysis
Under Protocol  Amendment 1, i nterim decisio ns couldbe m ade on the basis of the expected 
response rate at the end of the study , which compromises the current informat ion with the 
future sample size via a predi ctive probabilit y appro ach.  The Bayesian design can 
continuously update the predict ive probabilit y of the study  outcom e, such that early 
termination o f a study  is possible for either superiority  or futilit y.  The prespecified Bayesian 
stopping boundaries are included in Appendix 1. One interim analysis was performed after 
the first 39 enrolled subjects completed at least 2 tumor assessments or discont inued due to 
PD or death.
9.7.4 Other Statistical/Analytical Issues
Primary, secondary ,and expl oratory  endpo ints ORR, PFS, DOR ,and CBR will be 
summarized in the evaluable analysis set in which an evaluable baseline tumor assessme nt 
and at least 1 evaluable postbaseline tumor assessment are required .  In the analyses 
described above and any  other sensi tivity analysis, subjects with missing data will be 
considered as nonresponders in ORR and CBR calculat ion and nonresponders will be
excluded in the analysis o f DOR.
Any other statistical/
analy tical issues will be discussed in the SAP.
9.7.5 Procedure for Revising the Statistical Analysis Plan
The SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock in this exploratory  study .  Any deviat ion 
from analysis plan described in the protocol will be documented in the SAP.

PROCEDURES)
11.1 Changes to the Protocol
There are to be no changes to the protocol wit hout written approval  from the sponsor.  
Protocol s will be fo llowed as wri tten.
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by  the sponsor before implementation.  Amend ments specifically 
affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the 
study  requi re submissi on to heal th or regul atory  authori ties as well  as additional approval  by 
the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requiremen ts shoul d in no way  prevent any  immediate 
action from being taken by  the invest igator, or by  the sponsor, in the interest of preserving 
the safet y of all subjects included in the study .  If the invest igator determines that an 
immediate change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary  for saf ety reasons to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical mo nitor and the 
IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately.  The sponsor must notify the healt h or 
regul atory  authori ty as requi red per l ocal regulat ions.
Protocol  amendments that affect only  administrative aspects of the study  may not requi re 
submissio n to health or regulatory  authori ty or the IRB/IEC, but the healt h or regulatory  
authori ty and the IRB/IEC should be kept informed of such changes as required by local 
regul ations.  In these cases, the sponsor may be required to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and 
the Com petent Authori ties detailing such changes.
11.2 Adherence to the Protocol
The invest igator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to 
ICH E6, Section 4.5).
11.3 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the invest igator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visit s.  Moni toring visits to each site will be 
conducted by  the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator or 
designee will allow the CRA t o inspect the clinical, laboratory , and pharmacy facilit ies to 
assure co mpliance with GCP and local regulatory  requi reme nts.  The CRFs and subject’s 
corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully available for 
review by  the sponsor’s representatives at regular intervals.  These reviews verify  adherence 
to study  protocol  and data accuracy  in accord ance with local regulat ions.  All records at the 
site are subject to inspection by  the l ocal audi ting agency and IRB/IEC review.

Correspondence regarding a study  subject’s treatment between physicians or 
memoranda sent to the IRBs/IECs
CRF co mponents (eg, quest ionnaires) that are completed directly by  subjects and 
serve as their own source
11.4 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be co mpleted for each subject by  qualified and authori zed 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source do cument, except 
when a sectionof the CRF i tself is used as the source document.  Any  correcti on to entri es 
made on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction is dated, the 
individual making the correct is identified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original  data are not obscured.  Only  data requi red by  the protocol  for the purposes of the 
study  shoul d be collected.
The invest igator must sign each CRF.  The invest igator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a copy  of the CRFs.
11.5 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.  For 
the following i tem(s), the data recorded directly on the CRF are to be considered source data:

11.6 Retention of Records
The ci rcumstances of com pletion or terminat ion of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator is responsible for retaining all study  docum ents, including but not limited to the 
protocol , copi es of CRFs, the Invest igator's Brochure, and regulatory agency registration 
docum ents (eg, Form  FDA 1572, ICF s, and IRB/IEC correspondence).  The site should plan 
to retain study  docum ents, as di rected by  the sponsor, for at l east 2 y ears after the last 
approval  of a marketing applicat ion in an ICH region and unt il there are no pending or 
contem plated m arketing applicat ions in an ICH region or at least 3 y ears have elapsed since 
the form al discontinuat ion of clinical development of the invest igational product.
It is reques ted that the invest igator contact the sponsor at the complet ion of the required 
retenti on peri od, or shoul d the invest igator retire or relocate, allowing the sponsor the option 
of perm anent ly retaining the study  records.
11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addit ion to routi ne monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Qualit y Assurance 
departm ent must conduct audits of clinical research act ivities in accordance with the 
sponsor’s SOPs to evaluate compliance with the principles o f ICH GCP and all applic able 
local regulati ons.  If a government regulatory  authori ty requests an inspection during the 
study  or af ter its com pletion, the invest igator must inform the sponsor immediately.
11.8 Handling of Study Drug
All study  drug will be supplied to the principal inv estigator (or a desi gnated pharm acist) by  
the sponsor.  Drug supplies must be kept in an approp riate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) 
and stored according to the condit ions specified on the drug labels.  The invest igator (or a 
designated pharmacist) must m aintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of 
the study  drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy  of which m ust be given to the sponsor 
at the end of the study .  An accurate record of the date and amount of study  drug di spensed to 
each su bject must be available for inspect ion at any t ime.  The CRA will visit the site and 
review these documents along with all other study  conduct docum ents at appropri ate 
intervals once study  drug has been received by the site.
All drug supplies are to be use d only for this study  and not for any  other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug labels or any  partly used or unused 
drug supply before approval to do so by  the sponsor.  At the conclusio n of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study, the invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy  of the com pleted drug di sposi tion form 
to the sponsor’s CRA (or desi gnated contractor) or, when approval is given by  the sponsor, 
will destroy  supplies and containers at the site.

Tumors (irRECIST)
Invest igators should fo llow the gui delines provi ded here , which are an adaptation of RECIST 
1.1 and immune -related response cri teria ( irRC).  The fo llowing gui de represents a summary  
of irRECIST and i s meant to hel p invest igators in providing more object ive and reproducible 
immune therapy -related t umor response assessments in so lid tumors.
The key  changes for i rRECIST are:
For thi s study , similar to that allowed for RECIST 1.1, irRECIST allows the site to 
select up to 5target l esions at baseline, 2per organ, if clinically relevant via CT/MRI 
scans or by  electroni c calipers for skin lesio ns. The abilit y to continue treatm ent, if 
clinically stable, unt il repeat imaging scans ≥ 4 weeks l ater (in m ost cases at the next 
scanning time point) to confirm immune -related p rogressive disease (irPD)
irRECIST Lexicon
1.Baseline Assessments
Measurable 
(Target) LesionsMeasurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least 1dimension with a 
minimum size of:
10 mm in the longest diameter (LDi) by CT or MRI scan (or no less than double 
the slice thickness) for non -nodal lesions and ≥15 mm in s hort axis (SDi ) for nodal 
lesions
10 mm in LDi for clinical lesions (must be measured using electronic calipers)
Identify  up to 5lesions, not more than 2from 1organ s ystem. Lymph nodes are 
considered 1organ system
Likely  to be reproducible across all time point s
Representative of tumor burden
May include lesions in previously irradiated areas ONLY if there is demonstrated 
progression in that lesion after irradiation
Sum of diameters (SOD) of all target lesions including nodal and non -nodal are 
reported as baseline SOD which is used for assessing tumor response at follow -up 
time points
Bone Lesions Regardless of the imaging modality, blastic bone lesions will not be selected as target 
lesions. Lytic or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with a measurable soft tissue component 
≥10 mm can be selected as target lesions.
Cystic and 
Necrotic Lesions 
as Target 
LesionsLesions that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected as target lesions. The 
longest diameter of such a lesion will be added to the SOD of all target lesions at 
baseline. If other lesions with a nonliquid/nonnecrotic component are present, those 
should be preferred.
Lesions with 
Prior Local 
TreatmentDuring target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on the 
anatomical sites of previous intervention ( eg,previous irradiation, RF -ablation, TACE, 
surgery , etc).  Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target 
lesions unless there has been a demonstration of progression in the lesion.
Nonmeasurable 
(Non target) 
LesionsNon-target lesions will include:
Measurable lesions not selected as target lesions .  There is no limit to the number 
of nontarget lesions that can be recorded at baseline
Other ty pes of lesions that are confidently felt to represent neoplastic tissue, but 
are difficult to measure in a reproducible manner .  These include bone metastases,

ascites, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, 
ill-defined abdominal masses, etc.
Multiple non target lesions from the same organ may be captured as a single item 
on the CRF ( eg,multiple liver metastases )
Non-target lesions should be reported as present at baseline
SOD baseline Sum of diameters at baseline = LDi of all non -nodal + SDi of all nodal target lesions
2.Time point Assessments after Baseline
Target lesion 
measurementsLocate image that optimizes the LDi of the non -nodal target lesion or short axis of 
target node(s) .  There is no need to go to an identical slice from baseline.
Measure the respective LDi and SDi for all target lesions and calculate time point SOD 
(SOD timepoint ).
Special c onsideration for target lesions:
If a target lesion is too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be entered 
on CRF.
If a target lesion is between 5 -10mm, actual diameter should be entered on the 
CRF.
If a target lesion splits into 2 or more les ion then the LDi of split lesions will be 
added and entered in place of that lesion .
If 2target lesion smerged to form 1lesion ,then the LDi of 1should be entered as 
“0mm”while the other lesion should have the diameter of the merged lesion .
Nontarget Lesion 
AssessmentNontarget lesions are evaluated qualitatively as prese nt, absent, not evaluable (NE) o r 
unequivocal progression .  The response of nontarget lesions primarily contributes to 
the overall response assessments of irCR .  Nontarget lesions do not affect irPR and 
irSD assessments .  Only a massive and unequivocal worsening of nontarget lesions 
alone, even in the presence of stable disease or a PRin the target lesion is indicative of 
irPD .  IrCR is not possible unless all nontarget lesions are absent.
Definition of 
New lesionAny lesion which was not recorded at baseline .  There is no minimum size criteria to 
identify  a new lesion and clinical judgment must be used by the PI
May include a lesion in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
(ie,brain)
Should be unequivocal and not due to differences in scanning technique
If equivocal, should be assessed at next time point; if present, irPD is the date the 
lesion was first seen (not the date confirmed)
3.irRECIST Overall Tumor Assessment
irCR Complete disappearance of all measurable and nonmeasurable lesions (from 
baseline) and there are no unequivocal new lesions (unconfirmed irCR).
Lymph nodes must decrease to <10 mm in short axis.
Confirmation of response is required ≥ 4weeks later, preferably at next time point , 
to be considered a confirmed irCR.
irPR If the SOD timepoint of TLs decreases by ≥30 % compared to SOD baseline and there 
are no unequivocal new lesions, and no progression of nontarget disease, it is an 
irPR (unconfirmed). 
Confirmation is required ≥ 4weeks later, preferably at next time point, to be 
considered a confirmed irPR.
irSD Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD.
If the sum of the TLs and the status of the nontarget lesions do not reach the 
criteria to meet irPR or irPD (an increase of ≥20% and at least 5 mm absolute 
increase in SOD compared to nadir†) ,the response is irSD.

indicating disease progressi on
No decline in ECOG performance status
Absence of rapid progression of disease 
Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites ( eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention
If irPD is confirmed and the subject is experiencing extraordinary clinical benefit, site 
must contact thesponsor to discuss continuing treatment .
irNE Used in exceptional cases where insufficient data exists due to poor quality of scans or 
missed scans or procedure .
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, local study site 
investigators should consider all target lesio ns as well as non -target l esions.  Subj ects that are 
deem ed clinically  unstable are not requi red to have repeat tumor imaging for confirmation.  
•For a clinically  stable subject wi th first radio logic evidence of progressive disease by 
RECIST 1.1 (ie, unconfirmed progression of disease), it is at the discret ion of the site 
investigator to continue treating the subject wi th the assigned treatm ent per protocol  until 
progression of disease is confirmed at least 28 days from the date of the scan first suggesting 
PD. If radio logic progressi on is confi rmed by  subsequent scan then the subject will be 
discontinued fro m study treatment.  If radio logic progressi on is not confirmed by  irRECIST 
per the site, then the subjects may cont inue on treatment and fo llow the regular imaging 
schedule intervals until progression is confirmed at a later timepo int by the si te. 
oNOTE: If a subje ct has confirmed radiographic progressio n (ie,2 scans at least 4 weeks 
apart demonstrating progressive disease) per irRECIST, but the subject is achieving a 
clinically meaningful benefit, and there is no further increase in the tumor burden at the 
confirm atory  tumor imaging, an except ion to continue treatment may be considered 
following consultation wit h the Sponsor. In this case, if treatment is cont inued, tumor 
imaging should continue to be performed fo llowing the intervals as outlined in sect ions 6.0 
Study Flowchart and be submitted to the central imaging vendor.   Note :  As of 
Protocol Amendment 05, tumor assessment scans will no longer be sent to the central
imaging laboratory .
•Any subject deemed clinically  unstable shoul d be di scontinued fro m study treatm ent at 
1st radi ologic evidence of PD and is not required to have repeat imaging for PD 
confirmat ion.
•In subjects who discont inue study  therapy  without docum ented di sease progressi on, 
every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by  tumor imaging 
using the same imaging schedule used while on treatment (every  9weeks ± 1 week in Year1, 
and every  9 to 12 weeks ± 1 week thereafter according to standard of care) , until (1) the start

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedur es.  
1.1  Background  
Although there is a wide array of treatment modalities available and initial response rates are high, most patients with small B -cell, or so -called “low grade”, non -Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) 
will eventually develop recurrent or refractor y disease and many ultimately die from lymphoma -
related complications. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have clearly provided benefits to patients with these disorders, yet the potential for cure is limited and thus new approaches are under investigation. The monoclonal antibody rituximab (directed against the B- cell antigen CD 
20) has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for patients with relapsed low-grade NHL. In a pivotal trial of 166 patients with relapsed low grade NHL, a response ra te of 
48% was observed with a median time to progression (TTP) of 12 months in responders. 
1 A 
higher response rate was observed in patients receiving rituxim ab as second -line therapy 
compared to those patients following three or more prior chemotherapy regimens. In low- grade 
NHL patients who initially respond (time to progression of at least 6 months) and then relapse after single agent rituximab therapy, an o verall response rate of 40% has been reported following 
re-treatment with median TTP of about 18 months after second administration. 
2 However, 
approximately 50% of patients ma y not respond to initial treatment and almost all patients with 
low-grade B -cell lymphomas will experience disease progression at some point following 
rituximab therapy. To overcome rituximab resistance, it is paramount to thoroughly understand the mechani sms involved. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the activity of 
rituximab, including antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)  
3-5, complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)  5,6, and a direct pro- apoptotic effect  7,8.  
1.1.1  Fc Receptor Polymorphisms  
Although F(ab’)2 rituximab homodimers were shown effective in inducing apoptosis of B- cell 
lymphoma cell lines in vitro 8, other works have recently established the importance of ADCC as 
a predominant mechanism of lymphoma cell clearance and that Fcγ receptors (R) are critical for the in vivo actions of rituximab in NHL. In a xenograft model of human lymphoma, knocking out the Fcγ R-loci in mice resulted in complete abrogation of response to rituximab. In contrast, knocking out the inhibitory Fcγ RIIb in mice resulted in enhanced response to rituximab in the same xenograft model. 
9 In addition, the recent demonstration in NHL patients that response to 
rituximab is dependent on specific Fcγ RIIIa polymorphisms supports the importance of  ADCC 
in the in vivo activity of rituximab. 10The activating Fcγ R on natural killer (NK) cells and 
monocytes (Fc γ RIIIA) and on monocytes (Fc γ RIIa) mediates ADCC. Genomic polymorphisms corresponding to phenotype expression of valine (V) or phenylalanine (F) at amino acid 158 on the Fcγ RIIIa greatly influences the affinity of IgG1 to the Fcγ receptor. Stronger binding of antibody to homozygous FcRIIIa -158V has been demonstrated. Similarly, 
polymorphism related to expression of histidine (H) or arginine (R) at amino acid 131 in Fcγ RIIa affects the binding of IgG1. In the abovementioned study of 49 patients with previously untreated fo llicular lymphoma, patients homozygous for the Fcγ Ra- 158V (V/V) had a

(67%). 10Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of bcl -2 re- arranged cells was 
significantly lower in the ho mozygous V/V group. In contrast, Fcγ RIIa-131 polymorphisms 
were not associated with response to rituximab. In a second study, both Fcγ RIIIa- 158 (V/V) and 
Fcγ RIIa -131 (H/H) correlated with response and progression- free survival following treatment 
with r ituximab. 11This study will describe any prognostic significance observed for different Fcγ 
RIIIa receptor polymorphisms on response to combination rituximab – lenalidomide therapy.  
1.1.2  Complement -dependent cell Lysis  
Rituximab is capable of binding C1q and in vitro studies indeed have demonstrated the ability of the antibody to mediate complement-dependent cell Lysis (CDC) of human B-lymphoid cell lines. 
12 These findings are corroborated by the observation that complement is consumed during 
treatment with rituximab and levels of side effects correlate with severity of the side effects associated with rituximab -infusion. 
13 The precise role of CDC in rituximab therapy and its 
potential contribution to rituximab resistance are unclear and require further study. 
1.1.3  CD20 signaling and direct pro- apoptotic effect  
In addition to CDC, binding of rituximab appears to induce CD20- dependent caspase activation 
through increased calcium conductivity with subsequent IL-10 down regulation, invoking several 
signaling pa thways. 14  Gene expression profiling of rituximab resistant follicular lymphoma 
revealed differential expression of genes involved in cellular immune response, including cytokines, complement and T-cell receptor signaling, suggesting a more profound role of the microenvironment than the malignant cells in  rituximab resistance. 
15,16 This is further supported 
by observations that loss of CD20 expression is not an important mechanism of rituximab resistance. This is corroborated by the effectiveness of CD20 radio -immunoconjugates in this 
setting.  
17 
1.1.4 Enhancing ADCC and targeting the microenvironment  
With our current understanding highlighting the apparent role of ADCC and the immunological microenvironment in the response to rituximab, several approaches to stimulate effector cell function have been suggested to augment the response to rituximab and overcome resistance. For insta nce, various human studies have evaluated the role of cytokines in combination with 
rituximab, including IFN- α, Il-12, and Il- 2, demonstrating safety and effector cell 
enhancement.
18   For example, IFN -α, an immunomodulatory cytokine that induces antigen 
expression and enhances cytotoxicity, has been combined with rituximab in a phase II trial with 38 patients. While the overall survival did not differ significantly from that expected with rituximab alone, time to progression in responding patients appeared prolonged. 
19 Trials 
combining IL -2 with rituximab suggested prolonged time to progression in patients with 
follicular lymphoma.20,21 These trials s uggest that targeting the microenvironment to modulate 
antigen expression as well as enhance cytotoxicity could potentially overcome resistance to rituximab.  
1.1.5 Lenalidomide: an immunomodulator  
One agent, which may potentially augment the activity of rituximab in NHL and thus potentially overcome rituximab resistance, is lenalidomide (Revlimid
®), a proprietary IMiD™ compound of 
Celgene Corporation .  Lenalidomide is a potent thalidomide derivate with immunomodulatory 
properties including stimulation of T-cell proliferation as well as production of IL-2 and 
Page 12 of 66

are presumed to be mediated by: (1) activation of the innate (e.g., NK cells) and adoptive (e.g., 
T-cells) immun e systems, and (2) inhibition of angiogenesis. Treatment of lymphoma- bearing 
SCID mice with a combination of Rituximab and IMiD™ compounds demonstrated augmented/synergistic anti -tumor activity compared to monotherapy of either agent alone. This 
synergistic activity was attributed to an NK cell expansion (demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis) and further confirmed by in vivo NK cell depletion studies. 
22,23 Moreover, increased 
production of IFN α, IL-2, and IL-12 enhanced NK cell- and monocyte- mediated tumor cell 
ADCC.24 Lenalidomide- mediated enh ancement of chemokine production by NK cells in the 
context of NK cell -mediated ADCC of tumor cells suggests the concomitant promotion of 
chemoattraction and potential infiltration of tumor -specific T -cells.25 Interestingly, Lenalidomide 
strongly inhibits T-regulatory cell proliferation and suppressor- function. It inhibits IL -2-
mediated generation of FOXP3 positive CTLA-4 positive CD25high 
CD4+ 
T-regulatory cells from 
PBMCs by up to 50%. Furthermore, suppressor function of pre- treated T -regulatory cells against 
autologous responder-cells is abolished or markedly inhibited without drug related cytotoxicity.26 
These results provide a strong rationale for combination of lenalidomide with IgG1 antibodies to tumor- specific surface antigens in cancer patients.  
1.2  Preclinical Data 
Lenalidomide inhibits the proliferation of Namalwa (Burkitt’s lymphoma derived) and Jeko-1 and Rec- 1 (both mantle cell lymphoma derived) NHL cell lines, and this was associated 
with G 0/G1 phase arrest. When lenalidomide and dexamethasone were combined simultaneously 
a clear synergistic interaction was observed related to hypophosphorylation of the Rb protein and activation of caspase- 3 and -8, leading to extensive apoptosis. 
 Non anti-proliferative concentrations of lenalidomide markedly inhibited the production
 
of the pro- angiogenic factors VEGF, IL -8 and PDGF. The inhibition of VEGF production by 
Lenalidomide appears to be through the down-regulation of VEGF gene transcription. The up- regulation of p21 gene expression may partially explain the anti- proliferative effect of 
lenalidomide on NHL cells. However, lenalidomide had no effect on cyclin D1 and p53 
gene expression. These anti -proliferative and anti- angiogenic activities of lenalidomide on a 
variety of NHL cells support the potential study of lenalidomide in patients with NHL.  3 22,23  
 In particular, the anti -proliferative data provide a rationale for combination with dexamethasone. 
 Lenalidomide is a potent enhancer of NK cell and monocyte- mediated tumor cell ADCC.  There 
were similar enhancing effects on various tumor cells us ing trastuzumab (Her-2 + breast cancer), 
cetuximab (EGFR+ colorectal cancer), and rituximab (CD20+ NHL cells). There was no 
enhancing effect with the non-ADCC inducing IgG2a-isotype antibody panitumumab. Enhancement of NK cell -mediated ADCC requires both antibody binding to Fc-γ receptors plus 
IL-2 or IL -12 signaling (i.e., lenalidomide alone does not cause an effect). The NK cell 
stimulatory effect is due to enhanced Fc-γ receptor signaling, likely via inhibition of phospho-SHIP -1, leading to enhanced granz yme B and Fas -L expression. Enhancement of chemokine 
production by IgG- stimulated NK cells suggests the concomitant promotion of chemoattraction 
and potential infiltration of tumor -specific T -cells. Lenalidomide enhances monocyte -mediated 
ADCC of antibody- coated tumor cells, which is completely blocked by a neutralizing anti- IL-12 
monoclonal antibody. 
24,25  These results provide a strong rationale for combination of 
lenalidomide with IgG1 antibodies to tumor- specific surface antigens in cancer patients.

Lenalidomide inhibits IL -2-mediated generation of FOXP3 positive CTLA-4 positive CD25high 
CD4+ 
T-regulatory cells from PBMCs by up to 50%. Furthermore, the suppressor function of 
pre-treated T -regulatory cells against autologous responder- cells is abolis hed or markedly 
inhibited without drug related cytotoxicity. Also, Balb/C mice exhibit 25% reduction of lymph 
node T- regulatory cells after lenalidomide treatment. Inhibition of T-regulatory cell function was 
not due to changes in TGF- beta or IL -10 product ion but was associated with decreased T -
regulatory cell FOXP3 expression. 26 In conclusion, these data provide one explanation for the 
adjuvant properties of lenalidomide and suggests that they may help overcome an important barrier to tumor- specific immunity in cancer patients.  
1.3  Clinical Data  
A phase I/II study evaluating lenalidomide with rituximab for the treatment of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma was presented in 2007 at the 49
th Annual Meeting of 
the American Society of Hematology (ASH). 18 patients were enrolled in this trial, all of which had previously been treated with rituximab. The study indicated that 70% of patients achieved responses with 30% of patients achieving complete responses when given the combination therapy.  
27 The most common Grade 3/4 adverse events observed were neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and myalgia. A separate study evaluated lenalidomide oral monotherapy for relapsed/refractor mantle- cell NHL in 15 patients. Objective response was 
noted in 53% with manageable side effects.
 28 A study of 45 high-risk patients with relapsed or 
refractory CLL, treated with lenalidomide oral monotherapy, showed an overall response rate of 47%, with 9% of the patients attaining a complete remiss ion. Fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and 
neutropenia were the most common adverse effects noted in 83%, 78%, and 78% of the patients, respectively.

1.4  Rationale  
Based on these vitro and in vivo studies, we propose to evaluate the potential of lenalidomide to overcome rituximab resistance. As pre -clinical data and published clinical data suggest a 
synergistic effect between lenalidomide and dexamethasone, we propose initial treatment with both drugs for two 28- day treatment cycles (Part I or “priming”)  for subjects enrolled to Cohort 
1. This combination in itself should have clinical efficacy.  The priming phase in Part I will allow the study of immune -modulatory effects on T-cell subsets and cytokine milieu induced by 
the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone prior to the addition of rituximab .  A 
reduced dose of lenalidomide 10 mg daily was chosen as the starting dose, given the heavily pre -
treated patient population and the potential for lenalidomide -related myelosuppression. After the 
first lenalidomide – dexamethasone treatment cycle, the lenalidomide dose can be increased by 
one dose level based on patient- specific tolerance  (see Section 6 for full details) . After response 
assessment following two cycles of lenalidomide – dexamethasone, patients with responsive or 
stable disease, and patients with progressive disease with an estimated life expectancy of > 3 
months will enter Part II with lenalidomide - dexamethasone and rituximab to evaluate the 
potential reversal of rituximab resistance as measured by response to rituximab and pro gression -
free survival following rituximab.    Subjects enrolled to Cohort 2 of protocol treatment will receive treatment on the same schedule as those subjects in Cohort 1 (10 mg lenalidomide daily, weekly rituximab during Cycle 3), but

will be conducted at the same timepoints (at the end of cycles 2 and 5).  
 To study the immunomodulatory effect of lenalidomide , as well as its possible role in host-
associated rituximab resistance, we will analyze changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) constitution (e.g., changes in NK cell, activated NK cell, activated T cell and Treg numbers) following exposure to lenalidomide and correlate various cell subtype level s and 
changes to the objective response rates to therapy with rituximab + lenalidomide with and without dexamethasone, compared to Part I with lenalidomide with and without dexamethasone alone. In addition, plasma samples both pre- and post -therapy will be  tested for changes in 
plasma cytokines (i.e., interferon- gamma, GM-CSF, sIL -2R, IL-2, IL -10, IL -12, Rantes) in an 
attempt to correlate anti- tumor activity to lenalidomide -associated immunomodulatory effects on 
these cytokines. It is hypothesized that at least some of the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide may be mediated through the release of immunostimulatory cytokines. The proposed correlative studies seek to assay plasma cytokine levels pre- and post -therapy and 
correlate values with clinical outcome.

(SD/PD) to protocol therapy.    
 
3 Study Design 
3.1  General Design  
Phase II Trial of Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) + Rituximab  with and without Dexamethasone in  
recurrent small B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) resistant to Rituximab: 
 
^ Close monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome  (TLS)  should be initiated  concurrent with the initiation of lenalidomide -dexamethasone in Part I  
(see Section 3.2 ).  Subjects will receive tumor lysis prophylaxis if clinically indicated.  All subjects should remain well hydrated during at lea st 
the first 7 days of Cycle 1.  Close  monitoring for TLS and the need for TLS prophylaxis should be repeated during at least the first 7 days of Part 
II treatment.  Additional TLS monitoring and prophylaxis may be employed at any time at the investigator’s discretion.   Tumor flare occurring 
during the first 1 -2 weeks of Cycle s 1, 2 and 3 should be recorded as AEs and not as progressive disease (PD) .  Tumor flare should b e treated 
symptomatically with non- steroidal anti -inflammatory agents (NSAIDs)  and other measures as needed  
* Follow -up staging 3 months after first dose of Rituximab (i.e after 5 months) then after months  12, 18 and 24 (as counted from enrollment of 
trial) , then yearly until disease progression , development of unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal, whichever occurs fi rst. 
‡ In patients with absolute lymphocyte count> 20,000 /ul, prior to rituximab infusion, close monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome should be 
initiated and those patients should receive appropriate supportive care (e.g., allopurinol, intravenous hydration,  additional laboratory test 
monitoring, etc.). A modified dosing scheme is suggested for those patients with absolute lymphocyte count> 20,000/ul (see 6.2)  
# At time of progression or relapse, a biopsy is recommended. If a biopsy is performed, and the patient consented to allow their tissue to be kept 
for future unknown use, the pathology specimen will be asservated at the U Penn Tissue Core facility.  
≠ Subjects with CR, PR, SD or PD with an estimated life expectancy of >3 months will continue to Part II of the trial  
% The l enalidomide dose may be escalated to 15mg daily at the  beginning of Cycle 2 of Part I based on patient -specific to lerance as defined in 
Section 6.   The lenalidomide dose during Part II will be determined by dose modification guidelines in Section 6 .  For patients in Cohort I, the 
dexamethasone dose during Part II may also be adjusted due to toxicities experienced during Part I.  After Part II, patients with SD, PR or CR 
will continue to receive  study treatment as per the schedule above in 2 8-day cycles until disease progression , development of unacceptable 
toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal, whichever occurs first .

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  We plan to include previously treated, histological confirmed follicular lymphoma, marginal 
zone lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma with <5000 lymphocytes / mm³, 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with < 3gm/ml IgM or mantle cell lymphoma  with confirmation 
of CD20 antigen expression by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry on the diagnostic biopsy. Paraffin blocks and/or frozen materia l from the initial biopsy or biopsy at relapse will be 
requested in all cases, but are not required for protocol eligibility.  Subjects must have been treated with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy and must have refractory or progressive lymphoma.  Subjects must have had less 
than a partial response or progressive disease within 6 months of any dose of rituximab.  Subjects must have measurable disease (see Section 3.3).  Subjects will need staging to be completed within 60 days pr ior to registration.  
 Forty -five subjects will be enrolled to this study.  The first twenty -five evaluable subjects will be 
enrolled to Cohort 1 of study treatment, which will consist of daily dosing of lenalidomide, weekly dosing of dexamethasone and week ly dosing of rituximab during Cycle 3, as described 
below.  Cohort 2 will consist of twenty subjects.  These subjects will follow the same treatment schedule as those in Cohort 1, but will not receive weekly dexamethasone.    In Part I of the study, subjec ts in both cohorts will receive lenalidomide 10 mg PO once daily  on 
Days 1 -28 every 28 days for two 28-day cycles.  Subjects in Cohort 1 will also receive  
dexamethasone 8  mg PO  once weekly (dosing on Days 3, 10, 17 and 24 is suggested, but not 
required) for two 28- day cycles. Serum and plasma samples for ancillary studies will be 
collected for all subjects upon entry into the trial, after 2 cycles of study therapy , and at the 
investigator’s discretion in subjects with extended remissions . Subjects will be r estaged after the 
first 2 cycles (Part I) prior to Part II and will continue with Part II (with rituximab) unless progression of disease is documented with life expectancy estimated to be <3 months during Part I.  
 In Part II, all subjects will receive len alidomide once daily  Days 1 -28 over 28 days as well as 
Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV once weekly during cycle  3.  Subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 will also 
receive dexamethasone PO  once weekly  during each 28 day treatment cycle.  The doses of 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (for subjects in Cohort 1) during Part II will be  determined by 
dose modification guidelines in Section 6.  All subjects will be restaged 3 months after first 
rituximab infusion (prior to cycle 6). Again, serum and plasma samples for ancillary studies will be collected at this point. Following Part II , subjects in Cohort 1 will continue on lenalidomide 
once daily  on Days 1-28 every 28 days and dexamethasone once weekly until disease 
progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary wit hdrawal, whichever occurs 
first.     
 Subjects in Cohort 2 will continue on lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28 of each 28 day cycle. Restaging for all subjects will be performed on months 12, 18 and 24 (as counted from 
enrollment of trial) and then yearl y until disease  progression, development of unacceptable 
toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal, whichever occurs first.  These restaging assessments may be performed +/ - 2 months from these timepoints, or at the clinical discretion of the treating 
physician.

Subjects are required to receive prophylactic anti -coagulation with aspirin, Coumadin or low 
molecular weight heparin due to the increased risk of thrombosis reported with lenalidomide therapy .  Coumadin should only be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  Prophylactic 
anti-coagulation should be held for platelet counts < 50,000/mm
3 and restarted when platelet 
counts are ≥ 50,000/mm3.   
 
3.2  Required Data  
 
Guidelines for pre- study testing  
 To be completed within 60 days before registration: 
• Radiological imaging (e.g., CT or MRI) which is utilized for tumor measurement.  If a 
fusion PET- CT has been obtained and is deemed s atisfactory for anatomic evaluation of 
lesions, a separate diagnostic contrasted CT study will not be required. 
 
• Review of diagnostic pathology material to confirm the diagnosis 
 
• Paraffin blocks and/or frozen material from the initial biopsy or biopsy at r elapse will be 
requested in all cases, but are not required for protocol eligibility.   
 
To be completed within 28 days before registration, or on date of registration 
• All blood studies 
• History and physical exam

3.4  Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
• Clinical lesions  will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( e.g skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes). 
• Chest X -ray lesions are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. 
• Conventional CT and MRI  should be performed with cuts of 10mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm. This applies to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Head & neck and extremities usually require specific protocols. 
• Ultrasound  should not be used to measure tumor lesions that are clinically not easily 
accessible when the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation. It is a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination  
• PET/CT may be per formed as an alternative to CT or MRI at the investigator’s 
discretion  
3.5   Correlative Science  
 
All correlative studies will be performed upon completion of the trial as a batch run. 
The correlative studies detailed below may be altered at the discretion  of the Principal 
Investigator. 
3.5.1 FcR Polymorphism 
Genomic polymorphisms corresponding to phenotype expression of valine (V) or phenylalanine 
(F) at amino acid 158 on the Fcγ RIIIa will be analyzed fluorescent automated cycle sequencing of Taq PCR products      
 
3.5.2 Peripheral Blood FACS Analysis  
PBMCs will be subjected to FACS analysis for expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD39, CD73, CD127, FOXP3, CD122, CD212 (IL-12R), HLA -DR, CD14, CD19, CD56, CD69 , FAS -
L and granzyme B  as well as additional antigens as indicated. Flow cytometry to detect

ELISA  assays will also be performed to test production of IL- 2, IL -10, interferon-γ, TGF-β and 
other cytokines as indicated.  Treg function will be determined following isolation of CD4
+CD25+ cells from PBMC using 
published criteria. CD 39 and CD73 will be used to identify memory T reg cells. Functional tests 
include inhibition of T cell proliferation driven by α-CD3 plus α-CD28 mAb exposure, reduction 
in T cell IL -2 or interferon -γ production and reduced cytolytic activity. Sorting of cells into 
additional populations (LAG3+/-, CD27+/-, CD8+/-, Ki-67+/-) may also be attempted prior to 
suppression testing. Foxp3 message will be ascertained by flow cytometry. If primary tissue is 
available, IHC for CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and CD56 will be performed.  
3.5.3 Plasma Cy tokine Analysis  
Samples will be saved until the end of study for a batch run. At that time, cytokines will be tested 
using commercial ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cytokines to be tested include interferon -γ, GM -CSF, sIL -2R, IL-2, IL -4, IL -10, IL -12, Rantes and TGF- β. 
 
3.5.4 Minimal Residual Disease Analysis  
If a paraffin embedded diagnostic tissue specimen is available, this material will be used to 
generate patient specific probes for detection of minimal residual disease in blood at baseline and 
during protocol therapy (at the end of Part I, prior to starting Cycle 6, and at the investigator’s discretion in subjects who experience a durable remission) using a PCR assay. This assessment will be performed using a portion of the peripheral blood collected for ancillary studies (see Section 3.5.3) and will not require blood collection beyond that performed during the study for other analyses.     
 
3.6 Correlative Science Sample S ubmission  
3.6.1 FcR Polymorphism Sample Procurement  (Cohort 1 Only) 
If a patient has consented and agreed to allow their blood to be used for research studies  (Research related Studies Consent Form, see Appendix J), Peripheral blood will be collected prior to treatment for analysis of FcR polymorphisms. 20ml of peripheral blood in two yellow (ACD) or purple (EDTA) top Vacutainer
® tubes. The tubes should be inverted 8- 10 times to mix 
the tube additive and then refrigerated until shipped. Samples should be labeled with the patient’s initials, study number, patient study ID# and date and time of collection. A log sheet (Correlative Science Form A) must be sent with the specimen and a copy retained in the investigator’s file.   This sample can be obtained at baseline, or at any time during a subject’s  
participation in this study.  
3.6.2 FcR Polymorphism Sample Submission 
Blood samples should be send to:

If a patient has consented and agreed to allow their blood to be used for research studies  8 green 
top (heparin) tubes and 1 red top tube will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to 
treatment, prior to beginning C ycle 3 of treatment, and prior to beginning Cycle 6.   If the 3rd 
blood/plasma sample is missed  (i.e. prior to beginning Cycle 6) , it can be drawn at a later time 
point.  Samples should be labeled with the patient’s initials, study number, patient study ID# and 
date and time of collection. A completed “Clinical Research Sample – Information and 
Processing Record” from the Human Immunology Core must be sent with the specimen and a 
copy of  Correlative Science Form B  should be retained in the patient’s study cha rt. 
 Peripheral blood for MRD analysis in subjects with extended remissions will be collected as 3mL in EDTA tube.  This will be performed during a routine blood draw.  This will only be performed if the  patient has consented and agreed to allow their blood to be used for research 
studies.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  • Pregnant or breast -feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed 
while taking lenalidomide).  
• Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the 
subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to  participate in the study or confounds the 
ability to interpret data from the study.  
• Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline.

taking thalidomide or similar drugs.  
• Any prior use of lenalidomide. 
• Known positive for HIV or active infectious hepatitis, type A, B or C.  Patients who test positive or who are known to be infected are not eligible due to an increa sed risk of 
infection with this regimen. An HIV test is not required for entry in this protocol, but is required if the patient is perceived to be at risk.  
• Known CNS involvement by lymphoma. 
 
4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
 
This clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if patients appropriate for the trial are enrolled. All relevant medical and other considerations should be taken into account deciding whether this protocol is appropriate for a particular patient. Physicians should consider the risks and benefits of any therapy and therefore only enroll patients for whom the agents administered are appropriate. Although they will not be considered as formal eligibility (exclusion) criteria, as part of the decision-making process physicians should re cognize that the following might 
increase the risk to the patients entering this protocol:  Serious medical illness or psychiatric condition, which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent.  
Medical conditions such as uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or cardiac 
disease, which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.  Patients at high risk of hepatitis B infection should be screened before starting tre atment. 
Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for evidence of active HBV infection and hepatitis during and for several months after rituximab treatment.  Lenalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to cause thrombosis. When lenalidomide is combined with other agents such as steroids (e.g. dexamethasone,

increased.  Due to the known increased risk of thrombotic events associated with the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone subjects will receive aspirin (81 or 325 mg) or some other form of prophylaxis as deemed appropriat e. Low molecular weight heparin may be 
utilized in patients that are intolerant to ASA. Coumadin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  Patients with absolute lymphocyte count >20,000/ul should be closely monitored for tumor lysis syndrome.  These patients should receive appropriate supportive care and prophylaxis (e.g., allopurinol, intravenous hydration, additional laboratory test monitoring, etc.) prior to rituximab infusion.  A modified dosing scheme is suggested for those patients  with absolute lymphocyte 
count>20,000/ul (see 6.2). 
 
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
Subjects will be removed from protocol for any of the following reasons: 
 
• Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness, which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that, continued treatment with study therapy is not in the best interest of the subject.  
 
• Any toxicity requiring discontinuation as outlined in the dose modifications criteria in 
Table 2, Section 6.1.3. 
 
• The subject declines further therapy.  
 
• The subject experiences progression of disease after the first 2 cycles of study treatment 
(Part I) with estimated life expectancy < 3 months or relapse of lymphoma/progression of disease after having received rituximab (see also Secti on 7). 
 
• It is deemed in the best interest of the subject.  In this instance, the Principal Investigator should be notified. 
 
• Termination of the study by the supporter, Celgene. 
 
• Pregnancy  
 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal should be noted in the case report form and in the subject’s medical record. Survival data on patients that withdraw from the trial will be recorded.  Statistical analysis will be performed on an intent- to-treat basis.

5.1 Lenalidomide  
REVLIMID®  (Lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-
angiogenic properties.  The chemical name is 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -2H -isoindol-2- yl) 
piperidine-2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure:  
Chemical Struc ture of Lenalidomide 
 NNHOO
O
NH2 
3-(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3-dihydro-2H -isoindol-2- yl) piperidine -2,6-dione 
The empirical formula for lenalidomide is C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 259.3.  
Lenalidomide is off -white to pale-yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic solvent/water 
mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in organic solvents and 
low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic buffers, ranging from about 
0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asy mmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically 
active forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of 
zero.  
5.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide 
possesses immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties.  Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines and increased the secretion of anti- inflammatory 
cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomide inhi bited cell proliferation 
with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma 
cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth 
of KG -1 cells (human myeloblastic cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and 
other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX -2) but not COX-1 in vitro.   
5.1.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
Absorption:  
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with 
maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.625 and 1.5 hours post-dose. 
Co-admin istration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does reduce the 
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of 
lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase proportionately with increases in dose. Multi ple 
dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  Pharmacokinetic sampling in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients was not performed. In 
multiple myeloma patients, maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 4.0 hours 
post-dose both on Days 1 and 28.  AUC and Cmax values increase proportionally with dose 
following single and multiple doses. Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
Distribution:  
In vitro (
14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%. 
Metabolism and Excretion:  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two -thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urina ry excretion. 
The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is partially or entirely active.  Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.  
5.1.3   Supplier  
Celgene Corporation will supply Revlimid® (lenalidomide) to study participants at no charge through the Revlimid REMS ®

5.1.5  Packaging 
Lenalidomide will be shipped directly to patients.   Bottles will contain a sufficient number of 
capsules for one cycle (28 days) of dosing .    
5.1.6  Storage 
Lenalidomide should be stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight and protected 
from excessive heat and cold.      
5.1.7  Prescribing Information  
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) will be provided to research subjects for the duration of their 
participation in this trial at no charge to them or their insurance providers.  Lenalidomide will be provided in accordance with the Revlimid REMS ®
 program.  Per standard Revlimid REMS ® 
requirements all physicians who presc ribe lenalidomide for research subjects enrolled into this 
trial, and all research subjects enrolled into this trial must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of Celgene’s Revlimid REMS ®
 program.  Prescriptions must be filled within 7 
days.  Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy will be supplied to the patient each 
cycle.

Females of childbearing potential should not handle or administer lenalidomide unless they are 
wearing gloves.  
5.2  Rituximab (Rituxan®, IDEC-C2B8)   
Rituximab is clinically indicated for the treatment of CD20+ non -Hodgkin lymphomas, and will 
be billed to the patient and/or insurance.  Please refer to the agent’s package insert for additional information. 
5.2.1 Availability 
Rituximab is commercially available in 10ml and 50ml single -use vials containing 100 or 500 
mg of antibody, respectively at concentration of 10 mg/ml.   
5.2.2 Storage and Stability 
Intact vials should be stored under refrigeration. Dilute solutions for infusion (1- 4mg/ml) are 
stable for 24 hours under refrigeration, and for an additional 24 hours at room temperature. 
 
5.2.3 Preparation 
The desired dose of rituximab should be diluted in 0.9% NaCL or D5W to a final concentration 
of 1-4mg/ml. Mix by inverting the bag gently.  
 
5.2.4 Administration 
Rituximab will be administered by IV infusion as described in 6.2. Patients must be pretreated 
with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to each dose of rituximab.  
5.2.5 Toxicity 
The most serious adverse events associated with rituximab include severe infusion reactions, 
Tumor L ysis syndrome and severe muco- cutaneus reactions. Severe infusion reactions consisting 
of hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricula r fibrillation or cardiogenic shock may be fatal. Most reported fatal reactions occurred 
within 24 hours of the first dose of rituximab. If a reaction occurs, the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms resolve, and then restarted at a 50% slower rat e. Because severe infusion 
reactions have been noted more frequently in patients with high leukocyte counts, such patients should be observed closely.  Tumor Lysis syndrome resulting in renal failure has been described and occasional fatalities noted. Tumor Lysis syndrome is more likely in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells.   These patients should receive appropriate supportive care and prophylaxis (e.g., 
allopurinol, intravenous hydration, additional laboratory test monitoring, etc.) prior to rituximab infusion.  Severe muco -cutaneus reactions associated with rituximab include Stevens -Johnson syndrome 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of these reactions has been from 1- 3 weeks.  
 Less severe infusion reactions are common with rituximab. These include fever, chills and dyspnea. The mechanism of rituximab infusion reactions is thought to be the release of cytokines. Infusions should be interrupted until symptoms resolve, and restarted at a 50% slower

minimize the likelihood/severity of infusion reactions. 
 Recent reports describe hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death in some patients receiving rituximab  in combination with chemotherapy. The median time 
to diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 4 months after starting rituximab and approximately 1 month after last dose.  A report in the literature described an increase in fatal infection in HIV -related lymphoma 
patients when rituximab was used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy, as compared to CHOP alone. Patients with HIV infection are not eligible for entry on this research study.  
 
6 Dose Modifications and Management of T oxicities 
6.1 Lenalidomide  and Dexamethasone  
Administration:   For subjects in both Cohorts 1 and 2 with baseline creatinine clearance of >30 
ml/min , the initial dose of lenalidomide for investigation is 10 mg/day, orally on days 1 - 28, 
repeated every 28 days (28 day cycle).  The initial dose for subjects with a baseline creatinine clearance of <30 ml/min will be 5 mg orally on days 1 – 28 of each 28 day cycle.  Dosing will be at approximately the same time each day.  Prescriptions must be filled within 7 days.  
For patients in Cohort 1 only, the initial dexamethasone dose will be 8mg PO once weekly 
(dosing on days 3, 10, 17 and 24 are suggested but not required), repeated every 28 days.  Subjects enrolled to Cohort 2 will not receive dexamethasone as part  of protocol therapy. 
If a dose o f lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If it 
is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up. 
Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed to seek emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.  
Subjects experiencing adverse events may need study treatment modifications (See 6.1.3). 
 
Lenalidomide Dose Escalation Evaluation and Instruction:   All subjects shall be evaluated 
after first cycle of lenalidomide for dose escalation. If no drug- related toxicity of ≥ Grade 3 was 
noted, dose escalation to the next dose level is permissible at the start of Cycle 2 during Part I 
(see Section 6.1.1 for lenalidomide dose levels ). No dose escalation shall be permitted  upon 
entry into Part II of the trial or at any other time except at the start of Cycle 2 during Part I .   
Record of administration : Accurate records of all study drug administration (including 
prescribing and dosing) will be made in the source documents. 
6.1.1 Dose Continuation, Modification and Interruption    
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE v 5.0(Appendix C: NCI 
CTCAE v 5.0) used as a guide for the grading of severity.  Refer to the Dose Modification Steps 
below, and to Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 for full instruction on initiation of a new cycle of therapy 
and dose modifications during a cycle of therapy.

discretion of the Principal Investigator; any dose adjustments at Dose Level -3 must be approved 
in writing by the Medical Monitor.  
 
6.1.2 Instructions for initiation of a New Cycle  
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if: 
• The ANC is ≥ 1000 / mm³ 
• The platelet count is ≥ 50,000 / mm³;  
• Any drug -related rash or neuropathy that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 
severity;  
• Any other drug -related adverse events that may have occurred have resolved to ≤ grade 2 
severity.  
If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be evaluated weekly and 
a new cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the toxicity has resolved as described above.  If lenalidomide dosing was halted during the previous cycle and was restarted with a one- level 
dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of the cycle, then that reduced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 of the new cycle. If lenalidomide dosing was omitted for 
the remainder of the previous cycle or if the new cycle is delayed due to toxicity newly 
encountered on the scheduled Day 1 , then the new cycle will be started with a one- level 
dose reduction of lenalidomide.  
 
If subjects  experience cytopenias and do not meet study requirements to resume lenalidomide, 
they may proceed with rituximab as described in the protocol.

Rituximab 375mg/m2 will be administered by IV infusion on ce weekly during cycle 3 . The 
initial rate during the first infusion should be 50mg/hr. The infusion rate may be increased, if tolerated, by 50mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400mg/hr. If administration is well tolerated during the first infusion, subsequent infusions of therapy may begin at a rate of 100 mg/hr. If tolerated, the rate may be increased by 100 mg/hr increments every 30 min to a maximum rate of 400 mg/h .  
 
  Close monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and TLS prophylaxis should be initiated 
during Cycles 1 on Day 3, 4, or 5 and on Day 8. During the Cycle 3, tumor lysis labs should be 
drawn at one timepoint between days 3-5 and on day 8 after each subject’s first dose of rituximab. .  Additional assessments may be done at any time  (see Sections 3.2 and 6.3) .  Extra 
care should be taken wi th TLS monitoring and with TLS prophylaxis in patients with an absolute 
lymphocyte count>20,000/ul, and those patients should receive appropriate supportive care (e.g., 
allopurinol, intravenous hydration, additional laboratory test monitoring, etc.).  
6.2.1 Infusion and Hypersensitivity reactions  
In subjects with absolute lymphocyte count >20,000/ul, special attention will be given to TLS 
monitoring and TLS prophylaxis (Section 6.2) and the rituximab infusion shall be modified as 
follows: 50 mg absolute dose on Day 1, 150 mg absolute dose on Day 2 and (375mg/m2-200mg) 
on Day 3. 
 
Rituximab infusions must be interrupted if any infusion reactions (e.g., fever, chills, dyspnea 
etc.) > grade 1 occur. When the symptoms have resolved completely, the infusion may be 
restarted at half the previous rate. If tolerated, rituximab may be gradually re- escalated to the 
initial infusion rate. If patients experience a second infusion reaction, the rituximab infusion should be stopped. At the investigator’s discretion, patients unable to complete the full dose of rituximab may resume the incomplete treatment on the following day after dexamethasone 20 mg po is given the night before and the morning of retreatment. 
 Infusion reactions are distinct from hypersensitivity reactions , but they may have overlapping 
manifestations. Hypersensitivity reactions to rituximab are non -IgE mediated and may also 
respond to decreases in infusion rates. For hypersensitivity reactions>grade1, rituximab should be interrupted and the reaction treated with antihistamines, steroids and/or epinephrine. Following complete resolution of grade 1or 2 reactions, rituximab may be restarted at half the previous rate and re-escalated as above. For grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions, rituximab should be discontinued.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  Patients should receive full supportive care, including transfusion of blood and blood products, 
epoietin, antibiotics, antiemetics etc, when appropriate. The reasons for treatment, dosage and dates of treatment should be recorded.  
  6.3.1 Tumor Lysis Prophylaxis 
Close monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) should be initiated concurrent
ly with the 
initiation of study treatment in Part I for all subjects .  Subjects may receive tumor lysis 
prophylaxis if clinically indicated.  All subjects should remain well hydrated during at least the 
first 7 days of Cycles 1.  Close monitoring for TLS and the need for TLS prophylaxis should be repeated during at least the first 7 days of Part II of treatment (the first 7 days of Cycle 3).  Additional TLS monitoring and prophylaxis may be employed at any time at the investigator’s discretion.    Subjects who are felt t o be at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome should receive prophylaxis with 
allopurinol.  Other subjects should receive tumor lysis prophylaxis if clinically indicated.  All subjects should be instructed to maintain adequate hydration and maintain urinary output.  To maintain fluid intake, subjects should be instructed to drink 8 to 10 eight ounce glasses of water each day for at least the first 7 days of Cycle 1.  Hydration levels should be adjusted according to 
age and clinical status, and lowered if the s ubject’s cardiovascular status indicates the possibility 
of volume overload.  Close monitoring for TLS and TLS prophylaxis (allopurinol, if possible, and oral hydration as above) should be repeated during at least the first 7 days of Part II 
treatment (the  cycle including rituximab).  Additional TLS monitoring and prophylaxis may be 
employed at any time at investigator discretion.   
 
6.3.2 Tumor Flare Reaction  
Tumor flare occurring during the first 1 -2 weeks of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 should be recorded as AEs 
and not as progressive disease (PD).  Tumor flare should be treated symptomatically with non-
steroidal anti- inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and other measures as needed.  
 
6.3.3 Prophylactic Anti -coagulation  
Lenalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to cause thrombosis. When lenalidomide is combined with other agents such as steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone), anthracyclines (Doxil, Adriamycin) and erythropoietin the risk of thrombosis is increased.  Due to the known increased risk of thrombotic events associated with the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone subjects will receive aspirin (81 or 325 mg) or some other form of prophylaxis as deemed appropriate. Low molecular weight heparin may be utilized in patients that are intolerant to ASA. Coumadin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  Prophylactic anti-coagulation should be held for platelet counts < 50,000/mm
3 and restarted when platelet counts are ≥ 50,000/mm3.  Prophylactic anti -coagulation 
may be discontinued if dexamethasone is discontinued unless subjects are receiving erythropoietin.

7  Response Definition (see Appendix D + E) 
7.1   Complete Response (CR)  
 
7.1.1 Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of 
disease and disappearance of all -disease related symptoms if present before 
therapy, and normalization of those biochemical abnormalities (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] definitely assignable to NHL.  
 
7.1.2  All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size ( ≤ 1.5 cm 
in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse 
diameter before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1 cm in their greatest 
transverse diameter after treatment, or by more than 75% in the sum of the 
products of the greatest diameters (SPD).  
 
7.1.3  The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan, 
must have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical examination. However, no normal size can be specified because of the difficulties in accurately evaluating splenic and hepatic size.  For instance, spleens thought to be of normal size may contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may not necessarily reflect the presence of lymphoma but variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or other causes.  The determination of splenic volume or splenic index by CT scan is cumbersome and not widely used.   Any macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be present.  Similarly, other organs considered to be enlar ged before 
therapy due to involvement by lymphoma, such as liver and kidneys, must have decreased in size.  
 
7.1.4  If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate 
must be cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy of the same site.  The sample on which this determination is made must be adequate (>20 mm biopsy core).   Flow cytometry, molecular, or cytogenetic studies are not considered part of routine assessment to document persistent disease at the present time.  
 
7.2   Complete Response/Unconfirmed (Cru)  
 CR/unconfirmed (CRu) includes those subjects who fulfill criteria 1 and 3 above, but with one or more of the following features:

that has regressed by more than 75% in the SPD.  Individual nodes that were previously confluent must have regressed by more than 75% in their SPD compared with the size of the original mass.  
 
7.2.2  Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggr egates without 
cytological or architectural atypia).  
 
7.3   Partial Response (PR)  
 
7.3.1  >50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These 
nodes or masses should be selected according to the following features: (a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions, (b) they should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible, and (c) they should also include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved. 
 
7.3.2  No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. 
 
7.3.3  Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD. 
 
7.3.4  With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is 
considered assessable and n ot measurable disease.  
 
7.3.5  Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR because it is assessable and not measurable disease; however, if positive, the cell type should be specified in the report, e.g., large-cell lymphoma or low- grade lymphoma (i.e., 
small, lymphocytic small cleaved, or mixed small and large cells.)  
 
7.3.6  No new sites of disease.  
7.4  Stable Disease (SD)   
 
7.4.1 Stable disease is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is not progressive disease (see below).

7.5.1  Appearance of any new lesion or increase by >50% in the size of previously 
involved sites. (only applies to subjects that achieve a CR). 
 
7.5.2  >50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node greater than 
1 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of more than one node. 
 
7.6   Progressive Disease (PD)  
 
7.6.1  >50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node 
for PRs or non-responders. 
 
7.6.2  Appearance of any new lesion during or at t he end of therapy which is >1.5 cm by 
radiologic evaluation or greater than 1 cm by physical examination. 
 
7.7   Molecular Complete Response (MCR)  
 
7.7.1  For subjects with clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, or 
Bcl2/IgH rearrangement by PCR, MCR will be defined as the inability to detect a 
previously detectable malignant clonal population of cells using a PCR- based 
assay on bone marrow and/or peripheral blood specimens. 
 
7.8   Response Rates  
 
7.8.1 Response to Lenalidomide with and without Dexamethasone :  Response rate is 
defined as the percentage of subjects who attain complete response (CR), 
complete response unconfirmed (CRu), or partial response (PR) after two cycles of –study treatment (lenalidomide -dexamethasone for Cohort 1 subjects ; 
lenalidomide monotherapy for Cohort 2 subjects.  Subjects may be scored as having progressive disease (PD) after 2 cycles of –study treatment and will be removed from the study if the estimated life expectancy is < 3 months at that time.  Following an intent -to-treat analysis plan, all subjects who receive one day of 
chemotherapy will be included in the denominator for this response rate. 
 
7.8.2  Response to Lenalidomide + Rituximab with and without Dexamethasone:   
Response to lenalidomide  plus rituximab  with and without dexamethasone is 
defined as the percentage of subjects in complete remission (CR), complete remission unconfirmed (CRu), partial response (PR), or with stable disease (SD) at the 3 months post- rituximab evaluation.  Only subjects who receive rituximab 
are included in the denominator for this secondary response rate.

TTP is defined as the time from the first day of protocol therapy to the first event 
defining progression of disease or last subject contact.  TTP is defined for all subjects receiving protocol therapy, following an intent- to-treat analysis plan. 
TTP from rituximab is defined for patients receiving rituximab (Part II) from the 
first day of rituximab therapy to the first event defining treatment failure.  
 
7.10   Progression free survival (PFS)  
  PFS is defined as the time from first day of protocol therapy to disease 
progression, death due to any cause or last subject contact.  PFS is defined for all subjects entered on the study, following an intent -to-treat analysis plan.  A 
secondary analysis will also include a calculation of PFS from day of rituximab 
infusion. 
 
7.11   Overall Survival (OS)  
 
Overall survival is defined as the time from first day of protocol therapy to death due to any cause or last subject contact.   
 
7.12 Safety evaluation  
 
Data from all subjects who receive any study drug will be included in the safety analyses. Subjects who entered the study and did not take any of the study drug(s) and had this confirmed, will not be evalua ted for safety.  
 The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v3.0 whenever possible. 
 
8 Statistical Plan 
 
Statistical design and analysis  
Design .  This study will enroll 45 evaluable subjects, all of whom have had lymphoma 
progression or failure to respond within six months of being treated with rituximab alone or with a rituximab -containing regimen.  Twenty -five patients will be enrolled into Cohort 1, which will 
consist of daily dosing of lenalidomide and weekly dosing of dexamethasone.  An additional twenty patients will be enrolled into Cohort 2, in which patients will receive daily dosing of 
lenalidomide, but will not be treated with weekly dexamethasone. Subjects with documented 
Rituxan -refractory disease will be enrolled to the study and treated for two 28-day cycles  with 
lenalidomide  – dexamethasone (Cohort 1) or lenalidomide alone (Cohort 2) .  After th is first 
treatment period, termed Part I, subjects will be re -evaluated and subsequently treated with

CONFIDENTIAL

2) in combination. A subject who does not complete rituxima b therapy as part of this study will 
be considered non- evaluable and  may be replaced by enrolling an additional subject .  Howev er, 
all subjects will be included in the intent- to-treat analysis.  
 
Power to detect adverse effects .  With 45 subjects, we will have 90% power to detect any 
unforeseen toxicity whose prevalence is at least 5.0%.  The half-width of the confidence interval for any fraction (toxicity or response) will extend no more than +/- 15% around the estimate.  Treatment response.  We will use McNemar’s test to compare the fractions of patients  
responding to rituximab therapy without (baseline) and with revlimid.  In the baseline period, we estimate that 10% of patients will have responded to rituximab, although all will ultimately fail within 6 months.  Assuming a modest kappa (intra-subject correlation) of 10%, with 45 patients we have 87% power to detect a significant  effect of revlimid treatment if the treatment-period 
response rate is 35%.  Time to progression.  We will compute a 95% confidence interval for the ratio of median TTP under revlimid+rituximab to the median TTP under rituximab alone, using the nonparametr ic 
method of Jung and Su (1995).  If the interval excludes 1, we will declare the difference to be statistically significant.  
 To evaluate the power of this design, we assumed that TTP in the baseline (rituximab only) period would be statistically independent of TTP in the follow- up (combination treatment) 
period.  This will lead to a conservative estimate of the power, as positive correlation of failure-time endpoints generally increases power for paired comparisons (e.g., see Mick et al. 2000).  Assuming that median TTP in the baseline period is 3 months, we calculated the power to detect significance in a test of the null hypothesis that median TTP is the same in both periods.  If the median TTP in the follow-up period is doubled, to 6 months, then the power is 83%; if the median TTP is tripled, to 12 months, then the power is essentially 100%.  Thus power is satisfactory if there is a substantial increase in the median TTP.  
 Design and analysis of correlative studies .  In correlative studies, we will com pare mean changes 
in immunologic phenotype parameters (fraction Th2
+ cells, NK cells and Treg cells) between the 
subjects who experience a remission (expected to be up to 80%, or 36 of 45 subjects) and those who do not (as few as 20%, or 9 of 45 subjects).  As we do not yet know the likely values of these immunologic parameters, we estimate the power in terms of the difference in means as a fraction of the common standard deviation (SD).  The basic analysis is a t test comparing mean change in the two groups.  Calculations show that if the standardized difference is equal to 1 SD, then the power is 75%, whereas if the standard difference is 1.25 SDs, then the power is 91%.  Thus the power of this correlative analysis is reasonable as long as
 there is a reaso nably large 
difference in mean change between the remission and non -remission groups. 
Analysis of serum albumin as a biomarker . We will test the hypotheses that 1) a decrease in 
serum albumin  by > 0.3 g/dL at commencement of cycle 2 from baseline predicts a response 
(CR/PR)to protocol therapy and that 2) a baseline serum albumin  < 4.1 g/dL predicts no response 
(SD/PD) to protocol therapy.  From preliminary analysis of our first eleven patients, we will assume the same breakdown of responses (3 non-responders: 8 responders).  Using this

2.6; this is 10 times less than expected. 
9 Safety and Adverse Events 
9.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any sympt om, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if  the abnormality: 
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical signific ance 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening
1 
• requires or prolongs hospital stay 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event3 
• positive pregnancy 
 
1 “Life -threatening” as defined by CTCAE Version 5.0. 
2 “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to carry out normal life functions.  
3 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate 
in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be 
immed iately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events  include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically important.  
 
Note: Hematologic toxicities  will not be captured as serious adverse events. 
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- seriou s adverse events .  
 
Unexpected adverse events  
An adverse event  related to therapy  is considered unexpected (or unanticipated) if the event 
severity and/or frequency is not described in the investigator brochure and/or protocol.

CONFIDENTIAL

Related adverse events 
An adverse event is considered related to participation in the research if there is a 
reasonable possibility that an event was caused by an investigational product, intervention 
or research -required procedures.  For the purposes of this study, "reasonable possibility" 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically sig nificant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until the events are resol ved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believe s might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor (S.  Schuster)  of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject 
has discontinued or terminated study participation that may re asonably be related to this 
study.  The sponsor (S. Schuster)  should also be notified if the investigator should become 
aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated i n this study.  
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of 
the following conditions is met:  
• All Grade 3 and 4 lab abnormalities not present at baseline should be captured as adverse events*.   
• Any lab abnormality requiring clinical intervention or dose modification will also be captured as an adverse event *.  
* This excludes lymphopenia.  
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition mee ts the criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported 
as an adverse event in the following circumstances:

procedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization requir ed to allow efficacy 
measurement for the study.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.  
9.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All treatment -emergent adverse events occurring during the study period (after initiation of study 
treatment) must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined t hat the study treatment or participation 
is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 5.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage (https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm).  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 5.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed b y the investigator or reported by the patient, must be recorded, 
with details about the duration and intensity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experien ce for 
its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness.  The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator mus t provide 
details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
9.3 Reporting of Adverse Events  
9.3.1 Pregnancies 
Pregnancy of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject occurring while the subject 
is on lenalidomide or within 4 weeks after the subject’s last dose of lenalidomide are considered 
expedited reportable events.  If the subject is on lenalidomide, it is to be discontinued

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  immediately and the subject is to be instructed to return any unused portion of lenalidomide to 
the Investigator.  The pregnancy must be reported to Celgene Corporation Worldwide Drug Safety Surveillance (WWDSS) within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by phone and facsimile using the SAE Form.  The In vestigator will follow the pregnant female until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Corporation Safety Surveillance of the outcome as specified below.  The Investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial SAE.  
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for Expedited Reporting of SAEs to Celgene (i.e., report the event to Celgene Corporation Drug Safety Surveillance by facsimile within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).  Any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide must be reported to Celgene within 24 hours of being made aware of the event. The pregnant female should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  All neonatal death s that occur within 30 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to lenalidomide should also be reported. In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Corporation Drug Safety Surveillance should be advised as soon as the information is available.

10.1  Analyses and Reporting 
Data will initially be analyzed and reported 3 months after the twenty- fifth patient completes 
dose four of ri tuximab . All subsequent data collected will be analyzed and reported in a follow-
up clinical report. 
10.2  Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  Celgene affirms the subject’s right to protection against invasion of privacy.  In compliance with United States federal regulations, Celgene requires the Investigator to permit Celgen e’s 
representatives and, when necessary, representatives of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws.  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the subject’s statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.  
10.3  Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents   Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accur ate and complete, 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial.  
10.4  Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be

changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
10.5  Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in their country and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing application s in their country or at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by an agreement.  In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  The Investigator agrees to adhere to the document/records retention procedures by signing the protocol.  
10.6  Exceptions and Deviations 
 
Exceptions (prospective action) : 
An exception  is defined as a one-time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB 
and CTSRMC approved study protocol, intended for one occurrence. If this action disrupts the 
study progress, such that the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety and welfare of study subjects , advance documented approval from 
the local regulatory review committees, per institutional guidelines, is required.  Exceptions will not be allowed unless reviewed and approved first by the Study Medical Monitor and the Study Principal Investigator, and then subsequently by the ACC DSMC, and IRB.  Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor approval must be received first and included in with the IRB/DSMC submission. All entities should be given sufficient time to evaluate this request.  
 
Deviation (retrospective action ): 
A deviation is defined as a one-time, unintentional action or process that departs from the 
approved study protocol, involving one incident and identified retrospectively.  If the deviation disrupts study progress, such that the study design or outcomes may be compromised, or the deviation compromises the safety and/or welfare of study subjects, the deviation must be reported  within 48 hours of PI knowledge to local regulatory review committees per institutional 
guidelines.  Reports should include the following information the following information:  
• Protocol number 
• Subject number 
• Description of the exception or deviation 
• Impa ct on subject safety  
• Impact on data integrity  
Deviations that are assessed by the PI to not disrupt the study progress, such as not affecting the study design or outcome, or compromising the safety and/or welfare of study subjects, should be documented in site records and contain documentation of the PI’s assessment.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  Reportable Deviations 
Any accidental or unintentional deviation from the approved protocol, identified retrospectively, 
that in the opinion of the investigator or as defined by the protocol, placed one or more participants at increased risk, compromises the rights or welfare of subjects, and/or disrupts the study design, is considered a reportable event and must be reported to the Study Principal Investigator, Study Medical Monitor, IRB, and ACC DSMC within 10 working days of notification. Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor approval/acknowledgement must be received first and included in with the IRB/DSMC submission. Deviations to protect subjects from immediate harm/danger should be reported immediately following the event to the entities outlined above.  
10.7  Protocol amendments 
Any amendment to this protocol must be agreed to by the Principal Investigator and reviewed by 
Celgene.   Amendments should only be submitted to IRB/EC after consideration of Celgene 
review.   Written verification of IRB/EC approval will be obtained before any amendment is 
implemented.  
 
10.8  Premature discontinuation of study  
The responsible local clinical Investigator as well as Celgene have the right to discont inue this 
study at any time for reasonable medical or administrative reasons.  Possible reasons for termination of the study could be but are not limited to: 
• Unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality.  
• Inaccurate or incomplete data collection. 
• Falsification of records.  
• Failure to adhere to the study protocol. 
Any possible premature discontinuation would be documented adequately with reasons being stated, and information would have to be issued according to local requirements (e.g., IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc.). 
11 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
11.1 Study Oversight  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful asse ssment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -
monitoring plan.  This will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
The inves tigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the DSMC, 
IRB, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data c ollection 
Page 50 of 66 
 
Version: August 24, 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL

applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
This study will be audited by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committe e (DSMC) six months 
from the first subject enrolled and every six month thereafter for the duration of the study.  This schedule may be changed at the discretion of the DSMC. The study team will ensure all study related regulatory documents and subject cha rts are available and organized prior to the arrival of 
the auditor.  Issues identified by the auditors will be addressed within 10 days of receipt of the letter of findings.   
 
On-going Monitoring:  During the course of the trial, safety and data quality monitoring will be  
performed in an on- going manner by the Research Nurse (Ellen Napier, CRNP ) and the 
PI(Stephen Schuster).  The PI will review all Adverse Events in “real -time” to ensure 
appropriateness of the data and timeliness of reporting.  The PI wil l ensure that all amendments 
to the protocol and consent form are distributed to the IRB and CTSRMC prior to implementing any changes that may be required as a result of on -going monitoring . The PI will also ensure that 
all renewals are received in a timel y manner and all IRB correspondences are maintained.  
 
11.2 Medical Monitor  
The Medical monitor for this study will be Adam Waxman  M.D.  Dr. Waxman is not directly  
involved in the trial and is not collaborating with the sponsor/investigator in any other tri al.  In  
this role, Adam Waxman , M.D.  will review all AEs including grading, toxicity assignments, all 
other safety data and activity data observed at each dose level prior to escalating to the next dose. Adam Waxman , M.D.  may recommend reporting of adver se events and relevant safety data not  
previously reported and may recommend suspension or termination of the trial.   The Medical Monitor will be asked to review study data at least quarterly (every 3 months) or more frequently depending on enrollment.  
11.3 Safety Monitoring  
Interim analyses of toxicity are to be performed quarterly or every three patients on -study.  
 
This investigator initiated protocol is considered high risk as per the Abramson Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. As such, high risk protocols are audited approximately six months from their first subject accrual and approximately every six month thereafter for the duration of the study. However, this schedule may be changed at the discretion of the DSMC. The PI will be notified  in advance of the selection of their protocol for review and cases are 
randomly selected. A formal report is written to the PI  by the DSMC.   The committee may alter 
the frequency of re -monitoring based on the audit findings and degree of deficiencies. If an audit 
is unacceptable due to major deficiencies, representatives from the DSMC meet with the PI to discuss the findings of the audit and necessary corrective actions. If the deficiencies involve subject safety or serious regulatory violations, the Cance r Center Director, DSMC Chair, and 
DSMC Administrative Director will meet to discuss necessary actions concerning study status. The PI is given five business days to respond to these finding s. An evaluation of the deficiencies 
will be re -evaluated upon receiving the PI’s response. At this time, if the DSMC Chair and the

of the actions taken by the ACC.  
 Quarterly team meetings will also be held throughout the cour se of this study in order to discuss 
the protocol, ongoing patients, toxicity data, and recruitment issues. 
11.4 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the EC/IRB, the 
suppor ter, government  regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance 
groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspecti ons of applicable study- related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 The Investigator will permit study -related audits by Celgene or its representatives providing 
direct access to the facilities where the study took place, to source do cuments, to CRFs, and to all 
other study documents.  The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at some time during audits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to the subject’s recor ds (e.g., medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study related charts) 
for source data verification.  The data collection must be completed prior to each visit and be made available to the Celgene representative so that the accuracy and completeness may be checked.  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.

Appendix A : Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not been studied nor has 
the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  The risks to a fetus are not known.  However, lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life- threatening  birth defects.  An embryofetal 
development study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to prevent pregnancy must be observed. 
All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS ® program, and be  
willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS ®. 
Criteria for Femal es of Childbearing potential:  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
The investigator must ensure that: 
• Females of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
• Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide 
• Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the potential teratogenic risk 
if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential, and that he understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if enga ged 
in sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must agree to use two reliable forms simultaneously 
or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time 
perio ds related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while 
participating in the study; 3) during dose interruptions and 4) for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method (i.e. intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants], tubal ligation, partner’s vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e. latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap).  FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods if needed.   
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma 
taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended.  If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the effective method listed above.  The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co- treatment with dexamethasone.  
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50  mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below. 
Before starting study drug:   
Female Subjects:    
• FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10-14 days prior to prescribing lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed 
within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled within 7 
days).  The subject may not receive study drug until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.of contraception  
Male Subjects:    
• Must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study even if he has underg one a successful vasectomy.  
                                                 
 † A female of childbearing potential is a  sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy 
or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 c onsecutive months (i.e., has 
had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do no t disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  During study participation and for 28 days following discontinuation from the study: 
All Subjects:  
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject or the partner of a 
male study subject during study participation, lenalidomide must be immediately 
discontinued. 
Female Subjects:    
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study 
discontinuation, and at day 28 following discontinuation from the study. If menstrual 
cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following discontinuation from the study.   
• In addition to the required pregnancy testing, the Investigator must confirm with FCBP that she is continuing to use two reliable methods of birth control at each visit.   
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued.  
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a subject misses her period or if 
her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Study drug treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.
 
• Females must agree to abstain from breastfeed ing during study participation and for at 
least 28 days after lenalidomide discontinuation. 
Male Subjects: 
• Must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 da ys following 
discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
 Additional precautions 
• Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person. 
• Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days following 
discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
• Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 
days following discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
• Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be pre scribed with each cycle of 
therapy.

>50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or 
masses should be selected according to the following features: (a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions, (b) they should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible, and (c) they should also include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.  
 
No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. 
 
Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD. 
 
With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is considered assessable and not measurable disease.  
 
Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR because it is assessable and not measurable disease; however, if positive, the cell type should be specified in the report, e.g., large- cell lymphoma or low -grade lymphoma (i.e., small, lymphocytic small cleaved, or mixed 
small and large cells.)  
 
No new site s of disease.  
 
Stable Disease (SD)  
Stable disease is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is not progressive disease (see below).  
 
Relapsed Disease (RD)  
Appearance of any new lesion or increase by >50% in the size of previously involved sites. (only applies to subjects that achieve a CR).  
 
>50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node greater than 1 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of more than one node. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD)  
 
>50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node for PRs or nonresponders. 
 
Appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy which is >1.5 cm by radiologic 
evaluation or greater than 1 cm by physical examination

2 INTRODUCTION
DOR/ISL (also known as MK -8591A or MK- 8591/DOR) is a novel 2 -drug FDC of DOR (a 
recently approved NNRTI) and ISL (a first -in-class investigational NRTTI) . DOR/ISL is 
being developed for once daily treatment of HIV -1 infection in adults and pediatric patients.
2.1 Study Rationale
Rationale for Amendment 028 -03:
Downward trends of total lymphocytes and CD4+ T- cellcounts were observed in some 
participants ,which triggered ad hoc pediatric eDMC recommendations to discontinue study 
intervention administration for all participants and to initiate safety monitoring of 
participants .  The Sponsor accepted these recommendations.
Original Study Rationale:
As treatment regimens have improved, infection with HIV -1 has become a chronic, 
manageable condition, and those receiving effective ART regimens can now expect to live a 
near-normal lifespan [Trickey, A., et al 2017] . With anticipation of lifelong treatment and 
near-normal lifespans , the long -term tolerability and safety of antiretrovirals areincreasingly 
important considerations for pediatr ic patients living with HIV -1.
The current standard ofcare for the treatment of HIV -1 infection is the use of a combination 
of 2NRTIs with a third agent (eg, InSTI, NNRTI, or PI) [AIDS info 2017] [European AIDS 
Clinical Society 2016] [World Health Organization 2016] . Although such regimens have 
become increasingly well tolerated and highly efficacious , the current paradigm of lifelong
daily treatment is associated with a need for simpler and safer regimens, with reduced drug 
exposure.
There is accumulating evidence that simplified 2 -drug regimens can achieve efficacy 
comparable to that of 3- drug regimens ;improve tolerability and quality of life ; and increase 
medication adherence ;allof which can help to sustain virologic suppression [Llibre, J. M., et 
al 2018] [Cahn, P., et al 2019] [Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and 
Adolescents 2018] . The durability of 2 -drug regimens depends on both components having 
distinct mechanisms of action with at least 1 of the components having a relatively high 
barrier to resistance.
DOR/ISL has the potential to be a nideal agent for the treatment of HIV -1 infection due to its
potent in vitro antiretroviral activity of each component (including activity against common 
NRTI -and NNRTI resistan ce-associated substitutions), inhibition of reverse transcriptase by 
multiple mechanisms of action, lack of food requirements, and favorable safety and DDI 
profile observed to date .
2.2 Background
Refer to the IBs/approved labeling for detailed background information on DOR and ISL.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 028-03 
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
2.2.1 Islatravir
ISL is the first member of a new class of antiretroviral agents, known as NRTTIs, which 
block HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase by novel mechanisms of action. ISL is an inactive 
nucleoside analog that is converted to the pharmacologically active triphosphate (ISL -TP) 
form via endogenous intracellular kinases. It acts through multiple mechanisms, including 
immediate chain termination by blocking translocation and delayed chain termination by 
preventing nucleotide excision [Micha ilidis E 2014] .
ISL is differentiated from other HIV- 1 antiretrovirals by its high potency, long half -life, 
favorable drug resistance profile, and broad pharmacologic distribution. ISL (at the proposed 
dose of 0.75 mg QD) achieves higher steady -state IQ s (the ratio of drug exposure to viral 
susceptibility [Ctrough/IC50]) against wild- type HIV -1 than any NRTI currently approved 
for treatment. It also exhibits potent in vitro activity against the most prevalent NRTI
resistance -associated mutations, including M184V /Iand TAMs.
2.2.2 Doravirine
DOR, a potent NNRTI with demonstrated efficacy and good tolerability, was first approved 
for the treatment of HIV -1 infection by the FDA and the EMA in 2018. DOR is differentiated 
from other NNRTIs by its distinct resistance profile, low likelihood of selection for viral 
resistance in vivo, and low potential for DDIs. As compared with Efavirenz, DOR had fewer 
CNS -related AEs in Phase 3 studies. DOR exhibits potent activity against both wild -type 
HIV-1 virus and frequently transmitted NNRTI -resistan ce-associated substitutions (eg, 
K103N, Y181C, G190A, and E138K). The safety and efficacy profiles of DOR have been 
well characterized in Phase 3 clinical studies conducted in treatment -naïve adult participants 
[Orkin, C., et al 2018] [Molina, J. M., et al 2018] and in virologically suppressed adult 
participants switching from a stable antiretroviral regimen (MK- 1439A Protocol 024)
[Johnson, M., et al 2019] .
An ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study (MK- 1439 Protocol 027; IMPAACT 2014) is evaluating 
the PK, safety, and tolerability of DOR (100 mg) in children and adolescents. Modeling and 
simulation predicted that adolescents ( ≥12 to <18 years of age who weigh ≥35kg) would 
have similar exposures as adults with the DOR 100 mg dose including adolescents who 
weigh between 35 and 45 kg. Initial results from MK- 1439 Protocol 027 confirm that 
projected steady- state PK after a single -dose of DOR (100 mg) is similar to that observed in 
adults (9 adolescents living with HIV- 1 (≥12 to <18 years of age who weigh ≥45kg). The 
safety assessment in these 9 participants demonstrated 1 AE of Grade 1 diarrhea , which was 
considered unrelated to study intervention by the investigator.
2.2.3 Doravirine/Islatravir
DOR /ISL is anFDC tablet containing D OR (100 mg)and ISL (0.75 mg) administered as a 
single tablet QD. DOR and ISL represent 2 distinct classes of antiretrovirals that inhibit 
reverse transcription by different mechanisms. Based on the profiles of each of these drugs
and data available to date, the combination DOR/ISL is expected to be well tolerated, and 
highly efficacious, with a high barrier to resistance . The combination has demonstrated

PRODUCT: MK-8591A  34
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 028-03 
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
additive antiretroviral activity in vitro and has suppressed emergence of resistance at 
clinically relevant concentrations.
DOR and ISL have been studied in a Phase 1 fixed -sequence, 2 -period, multiple -dose, drug -
drug interaction clinical study (MK- 8591 Protocol 10). This study indicated no clinically 
meaningful interactions between DOR and I SL.
The combination of DOR and ISL (administered as single -entities, ISL+DOR) is being 
evaluated in an ongoing randomized Phase 2 study (MK -8591 Protocol 011) in 
approximately 90 treatment -naïve adult participants with HIV -1. Participants were initially 
assigned to receive either ISL+DOR and 3TC or an FDC of DOR, 3TC, and TDF 
(DOR/3TC/TDF). Participants receiving ISL+DOR+3TC who achieved HIV- 1 RNA <50 
copies/mL at Week 20 (or later) discontinued 3TC at their next study visit (most were able to 
discontinue 3TC at Week 24) while continuing DOR+ISL. At Week 48 and 96 , the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL among those who received the 2-
drug regimen of ISL+DOR was comparable to those who received the 3 -drug regimen of 
DOR/3TC/TDF. The majo rity of participants maintained virologic suppression through Week 
144. None of the participants with protocol -defined virologic failure rebounded above the 
clinically relevant >200 copies/mL cut off. As such, no participant met the criteria for 
resistance testing. ISL+DOR , administered with 3TC or alone as a 2 -drug regimen, had a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile through Week 96, comparable to that of 
DOR/3TC/TDF .Mean changes from baseline i n CD4+ T -cell count were comparable for 
DOR/3TC/TDF and each dose of ISL as a 3 -drug regimen (at Week 24) or a 2 -drug regimen 
(at Weeks 48, 96, 144).
The clinical development program of DOR/ISL includes ongoing studies in virologically 
suppressed adults (P 017 and P018), treatment -naïve adults (P020), heavily treatment 
experienced participants (P019), and participants <18 years of age and weighing at least 35 
kg (P028).
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Although it cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit 
from treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information 
about the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine, the totality of available 
nonclinical and clinical data supports continued evaluation of DOR/ISL in Phase 3 clinical 
studies. 
The comprehensive nonclinical safety evaluations of DOR (an approved NNRTI) and ISL 
(an investigational NRTTI) as mono -entities have not revealed toxicities of concern for daily 
dosing. Nonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicity studies did not identify any 
clinically relevant concerns that would preclude continued dosing of DOR/ISL in participants 
who become pregnant during t he study. Both mono- entities are differentiated by a high 
barrier to resistance in vitro with DOR exhibiting potent activity against the most prevalent 
NNRTI -resistant mutations (eg, K103N, Y181C, G190A, and E138K) and ISL against 
common NRTI -resistant mutations (eg , M184V and TAMs). Both may be administered

without regard to food, have a low potential for DDIs, and have favorable PK, and 
tolerability profiles.
In preclinical rat studies, chronic dosing of ISL at very high exposure levels (~204 fold 
greater than the estimated exposure in humans dosed at 0.75 mg) caused incisor breakage and 
molar discoloration. Incisor breakage or molar discoloration were not observed in studies 
conducted with other species including mice or monkeys. In the study with monkeys, no 
effec ts of ISL on dentition (unerupted dental buds) were observed based on results of micro -
CT scans. These findings are not considered to present a risk to the human pediatric 
population based on the high safety multiples, the lack of changes in developing tee th in 
juvenile rats, and the lack of dental changes in monkeys (monkey dentistry being 
evolutionarily and anatomically more similar to humans than rodents) and mice.
High potency against wild- type and resistant variants of HIV -1 virus, and a long half -life
make ISL a suitable candidate for development for the treatment of HIV -1 infection . Across 
the clinical development program, ISL administered alone or with DOR, was generally well 
tolerated. In the dose -ranging study (MK -8591 Protocol 011), ISL+DOR+3TC (a s a 3-drug 
regimen) achieved virological suppression in most (>90%) of treatment -naïve participants by 
Week 24. ISL+DOR (as a 2 -drug regimen) maintained virologic suppression of HIV -1 RNA 
24 and 48 weeks after switching from the 3 -drug regimen and through Week 144. In 2
ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating DOR/ISL for daily treatment of HIV -1 in virologically 
suppressed participants (MK -8591A P017 and MK -8591A P 018),approximately 95% of 658 
participants enrolled in the DOR/ISL arm completed the 48 -week treat ment period in both 
studies. In P017 and P018, t he percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL 
was <1% for the DOR/ISL group and a high percentage of participants (>93% to 95%) in the 
DOR/ISL group maintained virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL) comparable 
to baseline ART and BIC/FTC/TAF, respectively, at Week 48. To date, no viral resistance to 
either component of DOR/ISL has been shown in the Phase 2 ( MK-8591A Protocol 011) and 
Phase 3 studies ( MK-8591A Protocols 017 and 018). 
Down ward trends of total lymphocytes counts and CD4+ T -cell counts were observed in 
studies with ISL alone or in combination with other antiviral agents. In a Phase 2 study 
(MK- 8591 Protocol 013) for once weekly HIV -1 treatment, decreases in total lymphocyte 
and CD4+ T- cell counts from baseline were observed in the ISL 20 mg + MK -8507 treatment 
arms at Week 12 and Week 24 . Decreases from baseline in total lymphocyte count were 
observed in all dosing arms of ISL + MK -8507 starting at Week 8 with further decreases 
continuing through Week 24. Twenty of 58 participants on ISL + MK- 8507 had a decrease in 
total lymphocyte count of >30% (of which 9 had a >50% redu ction) by Week 24. These 
reductions were more pronounced in the 2 higher MK -8507 dose arms (200 and 400 mg), 
potentially indicating a dose -response relationship. Dosing of ISL+MK -8507 in Protocol 013 
has been discontinued.
In the Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study evaluating 60 mg and 
120mg of ISL monthly for PrEP in participants at low -risk of HIV -1 infection (MK -8591 
Protocol 016), there was a 21% mean decrease in total lymphocytes observed in the 60 mg 
arm (the dose being evaluat ed in Phase 3 PrEP studies) and a 36% decrease in total 
lymphocytes observed in the 120 mg arm. In this population of HIV -1 uninfected

participants, the decrease d values remained in the normal range and there was no increase in 
clinical AEs related to infe ction. Dosing of oral ISL 60 mg QM has been discontinued in 
PrEP clinical studies.
In an interim analysis of MK-8591A Protocols 0 17 and 018, (DOR/ISL 100 mg/0.75 mg QD 
for HIV -1 treatment ), mean decreases from baseline in total lymphocyte counts were 
obser ved at Week 48 of 10.6% and 8.5%, respectively in the DOR/ISL groups compared 
with mean increases of 2.27% and 3.46% in the comparator arms. In the same studies, 
DOR/ISL treated participants had a mean change in CD4+ T -cell counts of -0.7% and 0.9%, 
compar ed with an increase of 8.7% in baseline ART group and 12.8% in BIC/FTC/TAF 
group. These decreases in CD4+ T -cell and total lymphocyte counts have not been associated 
with an increased incidence of infection or other AEs. The clinical impact of these labora tory 
changes over the longer -term is unknown, and the Sponsor is assessing the reversibility of 
the reductions in CD4+ T -cell counts and total lymphocyte counts. To mitigate the risk, 
increased monitoring of CD4+ T -cell and total lymphocyte counts and stri ct stopping rules 
have been added to DOR/ISL studies. At this time, the data review supports continuation of 
the Phase 3 clinical studies for the DOR/ISL 100 mg/0.75 mg HIV-1 once -daily treatment 
program.
With regard to this Phase 2 study in the pediatric population, the Sponsor decided to 
discontinue DOR/ISL dosing following review of the available data and benefit/risk 
assessment .
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants in this clinical study 
may be found in the accompanying IBs and informed consent documents .

4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
Amendment 028 -03
As of Amendment 0 28-03 , all participants will have been brought to the clinic for an Early 
Discontinuation of Treatment visit so that non -study ART could be initiated. Participants 
who have CD4+ T- cell and/or total lymphocyte counts that are not decreased by >10% of the 
average baseline value at this visit will discontinue participation from the study at the End of 
Treatment Visit.Participants who have CD4+ T -cell and/or total lymphocyte values that are 
decreased by >10% of the average baseline value will have confirm ation testing at the End of 
Treatment Follow -up Visit.  If that decrease in CD4+ T- cell and/or total lymphocyte count is 
not confirmed at the End of Treatment Visit, the participant will not require further 
monitoring.  If th atdecrease in CD4+ T -cell and/or total lymphocyte count is confirmed at 
the End of Tre atment Visit, the participants will continue on the study with extended
monitoring every 4 to 6 weeks until two samples 12 weeks apart show a recovery of the 
counts to ≤ 10% of the average baseline value . After 6 months, if decreased counts persist, the 
Sponsor should be consulted. Participants who no longer want to undergo extended
monitoring should be advised to follow up with their HIV care provider.
Original Design
This is a Phase 2 nonrandomized, noncomparative, multi site, open- label study to evaluate 
ISL and ISL -TP PKand the safety, tolerability , and efficacy of DOR/ISL in pediatric

participants with HIV-1 who are treatment- naïve or virologically suppressed for ≥3 months 
with no history of treatment failure .
Approximately 45participants (30 virologically suppressed, 15 treatment -naïve) will be 
enrolled to receive DOR/ISL at the adult dose [DOR ( 100mg)/ISL ( 0.75 mg)FDC tablet 
administered QD] through Week 96.
Virologically Suppressed Cohort participants will be required to discontinue us e of their 
current suppressive ART regimen and receive only DOR/ISL as ART during the study . 
Approximately 10 of the 30 participants from the Virologically Suppressed Cohort who 
provide consent for intensive PK sampling (plasma and PBMC) on Day 28 will comprise the 
Intensive PK Cohort. Results from evaluation of the Intensive PK Cohort will be use d for 
dose confirmation of ISL (Section 9.6.1.1). Both Intensive PK Cohort and non- Intensive PK 
Cohort will enroll concurrently. If all 20 non- Intensive PK participants are enrolled prior to 
completing enrollment of the Intensive PK Cohort, then the non -Intensive PK Cohort will 
close to enrollment, and only the Intensive PK Cohort will remain open to enrollment. All 
participants, including those in the Intensive PK Cohort, will undergo sparse plasma PK 
sampling at prespecified visits during the study (Secti on 8.6).
Enrollment of the Treatment -Naïve Cohort will only begin when the adult Phase 3 ISL/DOR 
treatment -naïve study (P020) is open to full enrollment (see Section 4.2 below for additional 
details) .
All participants will be evaluated for efficacy of DOR/ ISL to maintain virologic suppression 
based on predefined, clinically significant, and confirmed viremia. Any participants with 
confirmed viremia, as described in Section 4.2.1.3.1, will be assessed for development of 
viral drug resistance and potential discontinuation from study intervention.
Participant safety will be monitored by an eDMC who will perform periodic review sof 
safety data throughout the study ( Section 9.7; Appendix 1). Details regarding eDMC will be 
provided in a charter.
At the end of Week 96, there will be a mechanism for all eligible participants to continue 
receiving study intervention without interruption until it becomes commercially accessible 
(Section 6.7).
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, as we ll as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Amendment 028 -03
Based on the Sponsor acceptance of the pediatric eDMC recommendat ion to stop study 
intervention administration in this study, Amendment 028 -03 is designed to allow for 
discontinuation of study intervention for all participants ,the follow -up of all participants
with specified decreases in CD4+ T-cell and/or total lymphocyte count, and the 
discontinuation from the study of participants who did not have these specified decreases.

MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
Original rationale:
The open -label, nonrandomized, PK -confirmatory study design is consistent with recent
published re gulatory guidance for conducting clinical studies in the pediatric population 
[Food and Drug Administration 2019] . Aligned with this guidance, the known clinical and 
pharmacological profile of DOR/ISL provides sufficient support to safely evaluate DOR/ISL 
in pediatric patients living with HIV -1in parallel with the pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies in 
adults. Conducting adult and pediatric studies in parallel accelerates the development of 
antiretrovirals in the pediatric population, providing clinically meaningful information about 
the use of DOR/ISL for the treatment of HIV-1 inpediatric patients earlier and more 
efficiently.
The design is consi dered appropriate for a treatment experienced study population that is 
switching from another stable ART regimen with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and for a study 
population with HIV -1 who are naïve to antiretroviral therapy. The Phase 3 study in 
treatment -naïve adults (MK -8591A Protocol 020) is ongoing, and the P028 Treatment -Naïve 
Cohort will not begin enrollment until supportive data from the Sentinel Cohort in P020 is 
available.
As HIV- 1 is a chronic viral infection for which antiretroviral treatment is admini stered 
indefinitely, participants will be treated for 96 -weeks in this study to assess the durability of 
efficacy, emergence of resistance, and long -term safety.
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
4.2.1.1 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Plasma PK
PK samples collected for analysis of ISL plasma concentrations will be used to calculate th e 
steady- state plasma AUC0 -24andCmax .These results will confirm that adequate exposures 
of ISL are achieved in pediatric participants <18 years of age weighing ≥ 35kg and will 
support dos ing recommendations in the pediatric population. As DOR/ ISL is anticipated to 
be chronically dosed, steady -state PK endpoints are the most appropriate endpoints.
Intensive plasma PK samples will be collected from the Intensive PK Cohort participants
(Secti on 8.6) . In addition to these results, data from sparse plasma PK sampling collected 
from all participants will be used in population PK model sfor ISL levels.
PBMC PK
PBMC PK samples collected from theIntensive PK Cohort participants (Section 8.6) will be 
used to evaluate intracellular ISL -TP levels , the active anabolite resulting from ISLdosing.
Intracellular PBMC trough levels (C24) area better predictor of efficacy than the exposure 
(AUC) and can be used along with in vitro potency values to predict efficacy against both 
wild-type virus and drug resistant variants .

4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints
Note:  As of Amendment 028 -03, study intervention administration has been 
discontinued ,but the study will continue so that participants can be monitored for 
decreases in CD4+ T -cell and/or total lymphocyte counts .  If the specified decreases are 
present, those participants will be managed per Section 8.11.5.  
Safety evaluations will include physical examinations (including vital signs) and laboratory 
tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) performed per the SoA (Section 1.3). AEs will 
be evaluated at each visit and assessed according to the guidelines in Section 8.4 and 
Appendix 3. Participants may be asked to return for unscheduled visits to perform additional 
safet y monitoring.
4.2.1.3 Efficacy Endpoints
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, HIV -1 RNA measurements will not be collected beyond 
the Early Discontinuation of Treatment Visit. Management of viremia after that visit 
will be at the discretion of the Investigator outside of the study.
Clinical studies of antiretroviral agents in multiple drug classes have demonstrated that 
virologic suppression of HIV -1 RNA to <50 copies/mL reflec ts a clinically relevant standard 
used across development programs for antiretroviral therapies and in clinical practice 
[Vandenhende, M. A., et al 2015] . Suppressing HIV- 1 RNA to <50 copies/mL preserves the 
immune system and minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections and disease progression.
Plasma HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL is a well -established clinically meaningful endpoint for 
treatment -naïve patients. Plasma HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL is a clinically meaningf ul 
endpoint in virologically suppressed populations, as it reflects inability to maintain virologic 
suppression after switching to a new antiretroviral regimen.
4.2.1.3.1 Definition of Clinically Significant Confirmed Viremia
For the purpose of managing participants in this study, clinically significant confirmed 
viremia is defined as:
Virologic Rebound : A participant who is virologically suppressed and has 2
consecutive (2 to 4weeks apart) occurrences of HIV -1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL at any 
time during the study .
Note: This definition is applicable to participants who are virologically suppressed at 
baseline and participants who are treatment -naïve at baseline and have achieved 
viral suppression ( HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL ).
or
Incomplete Virologic Response : A participant who is treatment -naïve at baseline 
and has 2 consecutive (2 to 4 weeks apart) occurrences of HIV -1 RNA ≥ 200

copies/mL at or after Week 24 in the absence of previous suppression of HIV -1 RNA 
to <50 copies/mL .
There is currently no gl obal standard for definition of patients with low -level viremia (viral 
load ≥50 and <200 copies/mL), and the predictive implication of such low -level viremia is 
uncertain [Vandenhende, M. A., et al 2015] [Ch arpentier, C., et al 2014] . The US Department 
of Health and Human Services guidelines currently define virologic failure as confirmed HIV 
RNA ≥200 copies/mL and do not recommend that low -level viremia (detectable HIV RNA 
<200 copies/mL) automatically re sult in treatment modification or more frequent virologic 
monitoring [Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents 2018] . 
Participants with HIV -1 RNA between 50 and 200 copies/mL have a lower ri sk of 
developing resistance compared to those with HIV -1 RNA >200 copies/mL and should 
continue on their current regimen, with HIV -1 RNA levels monitored as outlined in Section 
8.2.2 .
4.2.1.4 Palatability and Acceptability Assessment Endpoint s
Note: As of Amendmen t 028- 03, study intervention administration has been 
discontinued, so palatability and acceptability assessments will no longer be performed.
Acceptability may play an important role in adherence to treatment in the pediatric 
population as it does in the a dult populati on. Acceptability and swallowability of the whole 
and split tablet will be evaluated in all participants using the most frequently reported 
assessment to measure acceptability in pediatric participants, consist ingof a visual analog 
scale that was modified by including a 5-point facial hedonic scale ( FHS), an expression 
scale depicting various degrees of pleasure [Thompson, C., et al 2015] .
4.2.1.5 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
4.2.1.5.1 Planned Genetic Analysis
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility to, severity, 
and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genet ic determinants 
that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of 
the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, 
where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample w ill be collected for DNA analysis 
from consenting participants.
DNA samples may be used for research related to the study intervention(s), the disease under 
study, or related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic 
tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic 
research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes, the analysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome, or analysis of the entire genome. Analysis may be 
conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to understand study disease or related conditions.

4.2.1.6 Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct future biomedical research on specimens for which consent was 
provided during this study. This research may include genetic analyses (DNA), gene 
expression profiling (RNA), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma), and/or the 
measurement of other analytes, depending on which specimens are consented for future 
biomedical research.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main study) and will only be conducted on specimens from 
appropriately consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for 
future biomedical research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific 
understanding of dise ases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that 
participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The 
details of future biomedical research are presented in Appendix 6.
4.2.2 Rationale for Collecting Race and Ethnicity Data
The differential effect on the safety and efficacy based on any demographic parameter, 
including race or ethnicity, cannot be predicted when eva luating a new investigational drug. 
Therefore, it is important to collect race and ethnicity data to ensure there is not a differential 
effect based on these parameters and to gain assurance the results observed in the clinical 
study will be representative of the drug’s use in a broader patient population. As anexample, 
non-Caucasian females and males were found to have higher plasma concentrations of EFV 
(an NNRTI) than their Caucasian counterparts, indicating an increased risk of EFV -induced 
toxicity in non-Caucasian patients [Burger, D., et al 2005] . As another example, among the 
population with HIV in the United States, those of African heritage have been found to be 
less likely to maintain virologic suppress ion compared to other groups and the factors 
contributing to this remain to be elucidated [Weintrob, A. C., et al 2009] [Ribaudo, H. J., et 
al 2013] . Thus, race and ethnicity data will be collected in this study to characterize baseline 
demographics, andanalyses on race and ethnicity may be performed to better understand 
how these parameters influence clinical outcome and toxicity.
4.2.3 Rationale for Collecting Gender Identity Data
Transgender people, defined as those whose gender identities and/or expressions differ from 
the sex assigned to them at birth, have a high prevalence and incidence of HIV infection 
globally [Poteat, T., et al 2016] . Specifically, transgender women have an increased risk of 
HIV infection attributed to challenges associated with coping with psychosocial issues such 
as discrimination, stigmatization and marginalization [Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 2019] [Department of HIV/AIDS 2015] . When considering HIV treatment, the 
World Health O rganization considers transgender people to be a separate key population 
because of thei r specific health needs and high vulnerability [Department of HIV/AIDS 
2015] . Thus, gender identity data will be collected in this study to characterize baseline 
demographics and assess clinical outcomes in the transgender population.

4.2.4 Rationale for Collecting Infant Safety Follow- up Data
While women who become pregnant during the study will be required to discontinue therapy, 
it is important to collect information on infants born to participants who become pregna nt 
while receiving DOR/ISL . Follow -up through 1 -year of age for infants born to participants 
who become pregnant while receiving study intervention provides the ability to monitor 
growth and development as well as potential adverse effects that may be asso ciated with 
prenatal drug exposure. Growth parameters (ie, length, weight, and head circumference) 
within normal range at approximately 1 -year of age are key noninvasive indicators that a 
serious congenital malformation caused by in utero drug exposure is unlikely.
4.3 Justification for Dose
Note: AsofAmendment 028-03, study intervention administration hasbeen
discontinued .
Pediatric patients treated for HIV have response rates similar to adults when given a dose 
regimen that achieves exposures similar to those observed in adult patients. Pediatric 
participants who are <18 years of age and weigh ≥35kg,are predicted to have similar plasma 
ISL and intracellular ISL -TP concentrations to adults and no dose adjustment is expected to 
benecessary in this population.
In the MK -8591 Protocol 011 of treatment -naïve adults , at Week 48, DOR+ISL maintained 
virologic suppression in participants who achieved <50 copies/mL on DOR+ISL+3TC by 
Week 24 and were maintained on DOR+ISL . All 3 dose levels of ISL(0.25, 0.75, and 
2.25 mg) administered with DOR±3TC in adults demonstrated potent antiretroviral activity 
comparable to DOR/3TC/TDF, as demonstrated by the proportion of participants with HIV -1 
RNA <50 copies/mL at Week s24 and 48. Overall, no ISL dose-response for efficacy was 
observed. Graphical analysis of steady -state ISL-TP trough concentrations and response at 
Week 48 showed no tr ends in exposure -response. The totality of these efficacy data supports 
the conclusion that the dose range studied (0.25 to 2.25 mg daily) is on the plateau of the 
dose-response curve . ISL 0.75 mg was selected for study in adults who are na ïve to treatment
(Protocol 020), virologically suppressed (Protocols 017 and 018), and heavily treatment 
experienced (Protocol 019) in the Phase 3 clinical program. Protocol 011 also demonstrated 
that all doses of ISLstudied, when administered with DOR±3TC , had a favorab le safety and 
tolerability profile through Week 48, comparable with that of DOR/3TC/TDF. Thus, based 
on projected exposure in this population, similar safety and tolerability is expected in 
pediatric participants enrolled in Protocol 028 as adults enrolled in Protocol 011.
A population PK model for ISLand ISL-TP was simulated at the 0.25, 0.75, and 2. 25-mg 
doses for an adult population using demographic data from the NHANES database. The 
allometrically scaled model was also simulated with a 0.75- mg dose forapopulation of 
pediatric participant s (who are <18 years of age and weigh ≥ 35 kg) , also using data selected 
from the NHANES database . ISL plasma AUC0- 24, the PK parameter most closely 
associated with ISL safety, was estimated for pediatric participant safter ISL 0.75 mg QD 
dosing and compared with that from adults after ISL 2.25 mg QD dosing (a dose found to 
have a favorable safety and tolerability profile in adults in MK-8591A Protocol 011 ). Plasma

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 028-03 
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
ISL AUC0 -24 (geometric mean estimated to be 0.1 2µM·hr) for pediatric participants (who 
are <18 years of age and weigh ≥35 kg) is expected to be approximately 2. 3-fold lower than 
that at the 2.25 -mg dose in adults (N=1000 simulated geometric mean of 0.28 µM·hr).
ISL-TP PBMC C24 , the PK parameter most closely associated with ISL efficacy , was 
estimated for pediatric participant s (who are <18 years o f age and weigh ≥35kg)after ISL 
0.75 mg QD dosing and compared to that from adults after ISL 0.25 mg dosing (a dose found 
to be on the plateau of efficacy in adults in MK -8591A Protocol 011 ).The ISL-TP PBMC 
C24 expected in pediatric participant s (who are <18 years of age and weigh ≥35kg)after 
daily dosing of ISL 0.75 mg (1 1.2µM or 2.2 pmol/106cells) is approximately 4.1- fold higher 
than that at the 0.25- mg dose in adults (N=1000 simulated geometric mean of 2.7 µM or 0.54 
pmol/106cells).
Therefore, it is expected that ISL 0.75 mg QD is safe to study in pediatric participants
weighing ≥35 kg and sufficient levels of ISL -TP will be generated to provide efficacy 
comparable to the adult population.
The approved dose of DOR 100mghas been studied in Phase 1 to 3 clinical studies in 
treatment -naïveand virologically suppressed participants with HIV-1 . Itwas selected based 
on favorable efficacy, safety, tolerability, and metabolic profiles as confirmed in the Phase 3 
clinical studi es conducted in adults [Orkin, C., et al 2018] [Molina, J. M., et al 2018] (MK-
1439A Protocol 024) .Initial results from MK -1439 Protocol 027 indicate that projected 
steady- state PK after a single -dose of DOR (100 mg) in 9 adole scents living with HIV -1 (<18 
years of age , weighing ≥45kg) is similar to that observed in adults. DOR plasma C24 is the 
PK parameter most closely associated with efficacy. I t is expected that pediatric participants
dosed with DOR 100 mg QD will have C24 values ≥560 nM, corresponding to 0.6- fold the 
steady- state mean C24 for the 100-mg dose in adults.
Insummary, a 0.75- mg dose of ISLin combination with 100 mg DOR is predicted to be 
tolerable and provide ISL-TPconcentrations in participants <18 years of age ,weighing 
≥35kg that will demonstrate potent antiretroviral activity against both wild-type HIV -1 virus 
and most common NRTI -and NNRTI -resistan cesubstitutions. Specific criteria for dose 
confirmation after PK evaluation in the Intensive PK Cohort are provided in Section 9.6.1.1.
4.4 Beginning and End ofStudy Definition
The overall study begins when the first participant (or legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent/assent. The overall study ends when the last 
participant completes the last study- related contact, withdraws from the study, or is lost to 
follow -up (ie, the participant is unable to be contacted by the investigator) .

All supplies indicated in Table 2 will be provided per the "Sourcing" column depending upon 
local country operational requirements. If local sourcing, every attempt should be made to 
source these supplies from a single lot/bat ch number where possible (eg, not applicable in the 
case where multiple lots or batches may be required due to the length of the study, etc .).
Refer to Section 8.1.8 for details regarding administration of the study intervention.
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Note: AsofAmendment 028-03, study intervention administration has been 
discontinued and all participants will have switched to non -study ART.
6.2.1 Dose Preparation
There are no specific calculations or evaluations r equired to be performed in order to 
administer the proper dose to each participant. The rationale for selection of doses to be used 
in this study is provided in Section 4.3 .
6.2.2 Handling, Storage ,and Accountability
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received, and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention .
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, rec onciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
For all study sites, the local country Sponsor personnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return, or local discard 
and destruction if appropriate. Where local discard and destruction is appropriate, the 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that a local discard/destruction procedure is 
documented.
The study site is responsible for recording the lot number, manufacturer, and expiry date for 
any locally purchased product (if applicable) as per local guidelines unless otherwise 
instructed by the Sponsor.
The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain appropr iate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study 
interventions in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations.

6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Note: AsofAmendme nt028-03, study intervention administration has been 
discontinued and all participants will have switched to non -study ART.
6.3.1 Intervention Assignment
Intervention allocation will occur centrally using an IRT system. All participants will be 
allocated by nonrandom assignment to receive DOR/ISL FDC.
6.3.2 Stratification
No stratification based on age, sex, or other characteristics will be used in this study.
6.3.3 Blinding
This is an open -label study; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and participant will know 
the intervention administered.
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Note: AsofAmendment 028-03, study intervention administration has been 
discontinued and all participants will have switched to non -study ART.
Participants/guardians should bring the study intervention bottle(s) to their visits. At each 
visit, the number of doses remaining in the study packaging will be counted, reviewed, and 
recorded. The results will be used to assess participant compliance. If a discrepancy is noted, 
the investigator/stud y coordinator must discuss the discrepancy with the participant/guardian, 
and the explanation must be documented. When participants are dosed at the site, they will 
receive study intervention directly from the investigator or designee, under medical 
superv ision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the 
source documents and recorded in the CRF.
Participants/guardians should be reminded of the importance of taking the study intervention 
as instructed for the entire dur ation of the study.
Decisions to temporarily withhold study intervention because of an AE or other reasons will 
be reviewed on a case -by-case basis by the investigator. Interruptions from the protocol-
specified treatment plan that are expected to be 7 cons ecutive days or longer require 
consultation between the investigator and the Sponsor and written documentation of the 
collaborative decision on participant management.
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
Note: AsofAmendment 028-03, there are no study defined prohibited medications. The 
local label for the non -study ART should be consulted for potential drug interactions .

Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during time 
periods specified by this protocol for that medication. If there is a clinical indication for any 
medications specifically prohibited, discontinuation from study intervention may be required. 
The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor Clinical 
Director. The final decision on any therapy rests with the investigator and/or the participant’s 
primary physician. However, the decision to continue the participant on study intervention 
requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor, and the participant /guardian.
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements or other specific categories of interest) that the participant is 
receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be reco rded along with:
reason for use , dates of administration (including start and end dates ), and dosage 
(information including dose and frequency ).
Prior and concomitant therapies listed in Table 3 are not permitted from 45 days prior to Day 
1 through the study treatment period. Table 3 is not comprehensive, and the investigator 
should us e his/her medical judgment when assessing whether a participant’s prior and 
concomitant therapy(ies) are prohibited. The Sponsor Clinical Director or designee should be 
contacted if there are any questions about a therapy not listed or regarding potential DDI s
with a specific treatment that the participant may plan to receive.
In instances where the local product circular for DOR is more restrictive with regard to 
prohibited (ie, contraindicated or not recommended) therapy(ies), the local product circular

7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Note:  As of Amendment 028 -03, a s study intervention administration will have
discontinued for all participants , this section is no longer applicable.
Discontinuation of study intervention does not represent immediate withdrawal from the 
study.
As certain data on clinical events beyond study intervention discontinuation may be 
important to the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow -
up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all participants 
who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the protocol -specified treatment 
period will still continue to partic ipate in the study as specified in Section 8.1 1.3.
Participants may discontinue study intervention at any time for any reason or be discontinued 
from the study intervention at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect 
occur. In addition , a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by the 
investigator or the Sponsor if study intervention is inappropriate, the study plan is violated, or 
for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to b e 
performed at study intervention discontinuation are provided in Section 8.1 1.3.
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention but continue to be monitored per 
Section 8.11.3 for any of the following reasons:
The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue 
study intervention.
The participant has confirmed HIV -1 virologic rebound as defined in Section 4.2.1.3.1.
The participant has a medical condition or personal circumstance , which , in the opinion 
of the investigator and/or Sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from 
continued administration of study intervention.
The participant has a positive confirmatory serum pregnancy test.

to be related to study intervention AND that is life -threatening or results in prolonged 
hospitalization.
The participant requires treatment for active tuberculosis infection.
The participant has an estimated eGFR of ≤59mL/min /1.73m2based on the Schwartz 
equation.
-Note: eGFR should be confirmed by repeat analysis prior to discontinuing
7.2 Participant Withdrawal From the Study
A participant must be withdrawn from the study if the participant or participant’s legally 
acceptable representative withdraws consent from the study.
If a participant withdraws from the study, they will no longer receive study intervention or be 
followed at scheduled protocol visits. 
Specific details regarding procedures to be performe d at the time of withdrawal from the 
study, as well as specific details regarding withdrawal from future biomedical research, are 
outlined in Section 8.1.10. The procedures to be performed should a participant repeatedly 
fail to return for scheduled visits and/or if the study site is unable to contact the participant 
are outlined in Section 7.3.
7.3 Lost t o Follow -up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are to be performed:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit. If the 
participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining the protocol -specified visit schedule.
The investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant 
at each missed visit (eg, telephone calls and/or a certified letter to the participant’s last 
known mailing address or locally equivalent methods). These contact attem pts should be 
documented in the participant’s medical record.
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. 
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is

screening failure, as applicable.
Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg, He patitis C), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent , and assent if applicable, be obtained from the 
participant. In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with 
those regulations.
The maximum am ount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study 
will not exceed approximately 521mL for all participants in the Intensive PK Cohort or 
approximately 4 83mL for all other participants (Appendix 2). Repeat or unscheduled 
samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples.

study intervention is dispensed, the participant is instructed to use allstudy intervention in 
the bottle before opening another bottle.
Participants in the Intensive PK Cohort will be required to take their daily dose of DOR/ISL 
in the morning. All other participants may follow an alternative dosing schedule for 
DOR/ISL (eg, afternoon or evening).
The timing of d osing will be aligned with the timing of blood collection for PK analyses (see 
Sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 for timing of blood collection for PK).
Intensive PK Cohort Participants :
oParticipants in the Intensive PK Cohort are required to take DOR/ISL in the 
morning Day 1 through Day 29 tofacilitate the scheduling of blood collection 
during the day on Day 28 and Day 29
oDose administration of DOR/ISL on Day 28 will be observed at the study site and 
must be planned to allow a predose PK blood draw (plasma) , and a 4-hour 
postdose blood draw (PBMC) according to Sponsor instructions
oDose administration of DOR/ISL on Day 29 must be planned such that the Day 28 
24-hour post dose PK blood draw (plasma) can be obtained prior to taking the 
DOR/ISL dose on Day 29.
Note: Participants will be allowed to transition to an alternate dosing schedule for 
DOR/ISL (eg, afternoon or evening) beyond Day 29. Participants should take the 
dose of DOR/ISL at approximately the same time, each day.
All Participants:
oDOR/ISL dosing for Day 1, Day 28, Week 24 and Week 48 visits will be 
observed at the study site and must be planned such that a predose PK blood draw
(plasma) can be obtained prior to the daily dose of DOR/ISL .
Note: If participants (excluding those in the Intensive PK Cohort) take their dose
of DOR/ISL without observation at the study site , and prior to the pre dose PK 
blood draw, then the timing of dose will be verbally reported to study staff by the 
participant or guardian and recorded in the appropriate source documentation.
oFor Week 8, 16 , 36, 6 0, 72, 84, and 96visits, the timing of DOR/ISL dose 
administration should be verbally reported to study staff by the participant or 
guardian and recorded in the appropriate source documentation
If a participant misses a dose of the study medication, the following guidance should be 
followed:
If ≤12 hours from the missed dose , the missed dose should be taken, and the normal 
dosing schedule resumed

If >12 hours from the missed dose , the missed dose should be skipped, and the normal 
dosing schedule resumed. The participant should not double the next dose to compensate 
for what has been missed
8.1.9 Palatability and Acceptability Assessment
Note:  As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
The questionnaire to assess palatability and acceptability is to be completed for all 
participants at the time of DOR /ISL administration on Days 1 and 28 (whole tablet) ,and
Week 24 (split tablet) . The following recommendations should be considered when 
completing the questionnaire :
•Age of less than 12 years: Combined completion where the participant completes the 
faces ques tion, and the observer completes the remaining questions.
•Ages 12to less than 18years : Completion directly by the participant, preferred when 
possible.
Observer assessments should be based on what the legally acceptable 
representative/caregiver/healthcar e provider directly observed during and after intervention 
administration, including the participant’s facial expressions, behavior, and what the 
participant says. Only individuals who have actually observed the participant taking the 
intervention should c omplete the assessment.
Week 24 Asses sment : The palatability of a split tablet is being evaluated at Week 24 . The 
study staff will split the tablet using a pill splitter immediately prior to administ ration at the 
Week 24 visit . Both halves should be taken immediately after splitting . The splitting tool 
should be wiped immediately following each use .The tablet should only be split at Week 24 
for the palatability assessment, and not at any other time .
8.1.10 Discontinuation and Withdrawal
Participa nts who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the treatment period 
should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all remaining study visits as outlined in 
the SoA and Section 8.1 1.3.
Participants who withdraw from the study should be encouraged to complete all applicable 
activities scheduled for the Early Discontinuation visit at the time of withdrawal. Any AEs 
that are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 8 .4.
8.1.10.1 Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
A Participant’s consent for future b iomedical research may be withdrawn by the participant 
or the participant’s legally acceptable representative (as appropriate) and have their 
specimens and all derivatives destroyed. A participant’s consent may be withdrawn at any 
time by contacting the investigator for the main study. If medical records for the main study

are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox 
(clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the participant's consent for 
future biomedical r esearch will be withdrawn. A letter will be sent from the Sponsor to the 
investigator confirming the withdrawal. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform 
the participant or their legal guardian of completion of withdrawal. Any analyses in pro gress 
at the time of request for withdrawal or already performed prior to the request being received 
by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. 
No new analyses would be generated after the request is rec eived.
In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) 
or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
specimen withdrawal cannot be processed.
8.1.11 Participant Blinding/Unblinding
This is an open -label study; there is no blinding for this study.
8.1.12 Calibration of Equipment
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinica l study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion crite ria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the 
study site.

All cases of viremia must be confirmed, and the participant should continue to take the 
full assigned dosage of study intervention while awaiting confirmation .
For Virologically Suppressed Cohort participants, when viremia (HIV -1 RNA ≥50 
copies/mL) is detected (Section 4.2.1.3.1), the investigator should query the participant 
regarding adherence to study intervention, intercurrent illness, or recent immunization
For Treatment- Naïve Cohort participants, when viremia (HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL) is 
detected (Section 4.2.1.3.1) following suppression of HIV -1 RNA to <50 copies/mL at any 
time during the study or at or after Week 24 in the absence of previous suppression to 
<50copies/mL , the investigator should query the participant regarding adherence to study 
intervention, intercurrent illness, or recent immunization .
8.2.2.1 Viremia Confirmation
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
Confirmation of viremia requires 2 consecutive plasma HIV -1 RNA results of ≥50 copies/mL 
(Section 4.2.1. 3.1) with the second sample collected at a “Viremia Confirmation” visit at 
least 2 weeks , butnot more than 4 weeks from the date of the initial sample. This timeframe 
may be extended if study intervention is interrupted for 1 of the following circumstances:
Intercurrent illness : redraw 2 to 4 weeks following resolution of the illness, during 
which time the participant should continue to receive the assigned dosage of study 
intervention(s) without interruption;
Immunization : redraw at least 4 weeks following any immunization, during which 
time the participant should continue to receive the assigned dosage of study 
intervention(s) without interruption;
Toxicity management, noncompliance, or other reason : redraw 2 to 4 weeks 
following resuming the assigned dosage of study intervention(s).
8.2.2.2 Participants W ith Clinically Significant Viremia ( ≥200 Copies/mL)
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
Study participants with confirmed HIV -1 RNA of ≥200 copies/mL (following prior 
suppression to HIV- 1 RNA to <50 copies/mL OR at or after Week 24 in the absence of 
previous suppression to HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL) will be assessed for development of 
viral drug resistance (Section 8.2.2.4) and discontinuation from study intervention (Section 
7.1). Once it is determined that study intervention discontinuation is appropriate, Early 
Discontinuation and End of Treatment visit procedures should be completed (Sections 1.3.2 
and 8.11.3) and the participant managed by the investigator per local standard ofcare.

8.2.2.3 Participants W ith Low -Level Viremia ( ≥50 and <200 C opies/mL)
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
Study participants with confirmed HIV -1 RNA of ≥50 and <200 copies/mL should continue 
study intervention and all regularly scheduled study vi sits during which HIV- 1 RNA levels 
will be monitored per SoA (approximately every 3 months). Additional visits may be 
conducted to monitor HIV -1 RNA levels more frequently than every 3 months, if 
appropriate, after discussion with the Sponsor. Participants with confirmed low -level viremia 
will not be automatically discontinued from study intervention, but will be included in the 
virologic failure rate calculated for the purposes of the efficacy analyses (Section 9.6.1).
Investigators should use their clinic al judgment regarding the most appropriate clinical 
management of participants, if more stringent local guidelines apply, and may contact the 
Sponsor’s Clinical Director to discuss questions on clinical management of individual 
participants.
8.2.2.4 Viral Drug Res istance Testing
Participants with confirmed virologic rebound or incomplete virologic response (Section 
4.2.1.3.1), or who discontinue study intervention for another reason and have HIV -1 RNA 
≥200 copies/mL at the time of discontinuation, will be assessed for development of viral drug 
resistance. Samples with HIV -1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL that were collected either to confirm 
viremia or at discontinuation will be sent for genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing. 
Samples will be collected for genotypic and ph enotypic HIV -1 drug resistance testing per 
SoA (Section 1.3) and used to assess resistance -associated substitutions as applicable during 
the study.
Whole blood samples will be collected per the SoA (Section 1.3) for proviral DNA archive 
resistance t esting. The proviral DNA archive resistance t esting sample will be collected at the 
viremia confirmation visit and only sent for analysis if the HIV -1 RNA is confirmed to be 
≥50 and <200 copies/mL at the viremia confirmation visit. The proviral DNA archive 
resistance t esting sample should only be sent once per confirmed low- level viremic episode. 
8.2.3 T-and B -Lymphocyte and Natural Killer Cell (TBNK) Profile
A TBNK panel, including CD4+ T cell count, will be performed at the central laboratory

becomes pregnant, refer to Section 7.1 and Section 8. 11.3.1.
8.3.4 Clinical S afety Laboratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the la boratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory 
reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings a re those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table 13 in Appendix 2, must 
be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA.
If laborator y values from nonprotocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), t hen the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
For any laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 42days after the last dose of study intervention , every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator .
Note: D ecreases in CD4+ T- cell and/or lymphocyte counts should be managed per 
Section 8.11.5.
8.3.5 HBV Assessments
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, HBV monitoring will not be performed after the Early 
Discontinuation of Treatment visit.
Participants coinfected with HIV -1 and HBV who discontinue an antiretroviral medication 
that also has activity against HBV (3TC, FTC, TAF, or TDF) may experience an acute 
exacerbation of HBV. Therefore, participants who have evidence of past HBV exposure 
(antiHBc positive) and who meet enrollment criteria will be closely monitored during the 
study.
All eligible participants must be HBsAg -negative at screening. Participants who are antiHBc 
positive and HBV DNA positive at screening are excluded. Participants who are antiHBc 
positive but HBV DNA negative at screening are eligible to enroll. For the duration of the

study, participants positive for antiHBc should be monitored for possible HBV reactivation. 
Samples will be taken to monitor HBsAg and HBV DNA each visit per SoA (Section 1.3). 
Investigators should also pay close attention to changes from baseline in ALT, AST, 
bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (included in chemistry laboratory assessments).
Participants who become HBsAg or HBV DNA positive during the study will be managed by 
the investigator per local standard ofcare and/or referred for management of their HBV 
infection. Participants may be allowed to continue study intervention if deemed medically 
appropriate upon consultation with the Sponsor.
Therapies indicated for HBV that also have potent activity against HIV (eg, adefovir, TDF, 
TAF , FTC, or 3TC) are prohibited (Section 6.5). Entecavir therapy for HBV infection is 
allowed.
8.3.6 Infant Safety Follow- up Assessments
Infants, born to participants who become pregnant while receiving study intervention or 
during the protocol -specified follow -upperiod and consent to infant follow -up, will have 
safety follow -up through approximately 1 year of age as outlined in Table 4. This infant 
safety follow -up data may be collected by phone call. Gestational age, Apgar score, l ength, 
weight, head circumference measurements, directed pediatric examination, concomitant 
medications and infant SAEs will be collected at birth. Infant informed consent, length, 
weight, head circum ference measurements, concomitant medications and infant SAEs will be 
collected at 1 year of age. Infant SAEs, including congenital anomalies identifiable on

8.4 Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events ,and Other Reportable Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 .
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized 
representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs , SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3.
The investigator, who is a qualified physician, will assess events that meet the definition of 
an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events with respect to seriousness, 
intensity/toxicity and causality .
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E, SAE ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant provides 
documented informed consent but before intervention allocation must be reported by the 
investigator if the par ticipant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment, if the 
event causes the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a protocol -
specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual 
thera py, diet, or a procedure .
From the time of intervention allocation through the study duration, all AEs, SAEs, and other 
reportable safety events must be reported by the investigator.

PRODUCT: MK-8591A  72
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 028-03 
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside of the 
time period specified in the previous paragraph must be reported immediately to the Sponsor 
if the event is considered related to study intervention.
For infants born to participants who become pregnant and consent t o infant follow -up, SAEs 
(including perinatal HIV -1 infection) occurring through 1 year of age must be reported by the 
investigator to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event .
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE sor SAEs or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicat ed in Table 5 .
For participants that continue to receive study intervention in a rollover study, the collection 
requirements of AEs, SAEs and other reportable safety ev ents are amended as follows:
-AEs, SAEs and other reportable safety events will be collected and recorded through 
the last treatment visit in this protocol. 
-All new SAEs (including those considered related to study intervention) and new 
other reportable safety events (including pregnancy exposure) that occur after the last 
treatment visit will be collected in the rollover study. 
-Pregnancy outcome and infant SAEs will be captured in this protocol, if pregnancy 
exposure is reported in this protocol.
-The last collection of non -serious SAEs will be at the last treatment visit in this 
protocol.

8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAE s, and other reportable safety events,
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, ECI s, cancer, and overdose will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3 ). In addi tion, the investigator will 
make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in allocated participants for 
outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities , IRB/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSAR saccording to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as nec essary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to 
the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reported.
For infants bo rn to participants who become pregnant and consent to infant follow -up, SAEs 
(including perinatal HIV -1 infection) occurring through 1 year of age must be reported by the 
investigator to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event .

8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest
Note:  As of Amendment 028 -03, ECIs will be reported through 42 days after the last 
dose of study intervention.
Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor.
Events of clinical interest for this study include:
1.An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the 
upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less 
than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an unde rlying etiology. The study site guidance for 
assessment and follow -up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File 
Binder (or equivalent). 
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
Note:  As of Amendment 028 -03, as administration of study intervention will h ave

Venous blood samples will be collected from all participants for the measurement of ISL 
concentrations in plasma (Table 6).
The timing of blood collection will be aligned with the timing of dose administration as 
outlined in Section 8.1.8.1. Study staff will observe and record t he tim ingof DOR/ISL dose s
administered to all participants at the investigational site on Day 1, Day 28, Week 24, and 
Week 48 , which are PK sample collection days .
For participants who take DOR/ISL at night, there will be an exception to the time points 
outlined in the S oA. Forthese participants, 1 blood sample (assigned as “random”) will be
collected at the Week 48 visit irrespective of time of the last dose. Ifparticipants
administered their dose of DOR/I SL without observation at the study site atWeek 48 , then 
the dose timing will be verbally reported (Section 8.1.8) and the PK sample will be assigned 
as “random”.
For Week 8, 16, 36, 60, 72, 84, and 96 visits, the timing of DOR/ISL dose administration 
prior to the PK sample collection will be verbally reported to study staff by the participant or 
guardian and recorded in the appropriate source documentation.
Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for plasma samples will be provided in 
a separate manual.
Intensive blood sampling on Day 28 will be conducted only for participants in the Intensive 
PK Cohort. Participants in the Intensive PK Cohort will be required to take their daily dose 
of DOR/ISL in the morning. Sparse PK samples (plasma) will be collected from all
participants. Of note, a single pre dose sample on Day 28 will be collected from all 
participants ( regardless of their participation in the Intensive PK Cohort ).
PK samples (investigational , time relative to dose not specified ) will also be drawn at the 
Viremia C onfirmation Visit ,Early Discontinuation of Treatment Visit , and the End of 
Treatment Follow -up Visit, (Section 1.3.2) .The timing of DOR/ISL dose administration 
prior to the PK sample collection at these visits will be ver bally reported to study staff by the 
participant or guardian and recorded in the appropriate source documentation. Analysis of 
these samples will be triggered by the Sponsor as needed.

8.11.1 Screening /Rescreening
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
Screening
Prior to allocation of study medication, potential participants will be evaluated to determine 
that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5. Participants are expected to 
enroll as soon as possible after eligibility is confirmed. In cases of unexpected delays in 
receiving r epeat screening laboratory results, a screening period of up to 45 days is allowed .
Rescreening
If the screening window has been exceeded, participants are allowed to rescreen one time 
following approval from the Sponsor. Once a participant has started the rescreening process, 
a new screening period (ie, an additional ≤45-day window) will begin, during which time 
screening procedures may be repeated.
The following assessments must be repeated for participants who are rescreened:
•Vital signs, weig ht, height and directed physical examination
•Review medical history and prior/concomitant medications for new information
•All laboratory assessments ( includes urine pregnancy testing for WOCBP) , with the 
exception of HIV -1 drug resistance testing
•Review of AEs
If the informed consent form has been updated, participants should be reconsented before 
rescreening. If no updates have been made, documented informed consent signed during the 
original screening period should be reviewed with the participant and a v erbal reconsent to 
continue in the study should be documented.
8.11.2 Treatment Period
All procedures and their timing should be completed as per SoA (Section 1.3).
8.11.2.1 Optional Nurse Visits and Telephone Visits
A visiting nurse service may be used (if locally availa ble and approved for use) under 
extenuating circumstances and with Sponsor approval. If a visiting nurse service is utilized 
for any visit, the investigator should contact the participant by phone on the same day as the 
nurse visit, or as soon as possible to perform an investigator AE assessment.

Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
A qualified medical designee noted on the study delegation log will be responsible for the 
Day 14 telephone call. During the call, participants will be asked about theuse of 
concomitant medications in Section 8.1.5.2 and AEs experienced as described in 
Section 8.4.2. The participant/guardi an will be reminded of the scheduled Day 28 visit date 
and planned dosing schedule for Day 28 and scheduled domiciling (as applicable). 
Adherence assessment and counseling will also be performed. Open- ended and nonleading 
verbal questioning of the particip ant is the preferred method to inquire about adherence to 
study intervention.
8.11.2.3 Fasting
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
On Day 1 ,Week 48, and Week 96 visits, participants are required to fast (ie, do not consume 
any food or beverages except water) for at least 8 hours prior to the visit. Fasting chemistry 
tests for lipid profile andglucose will be performed at these visits. If the measurements are 
norm al at baseline, then these measurements will be repeated only at 48 and 96 weeks. If the 
baseline fasting lipid profile or fasting glucose is abnormal, then the participant will be tested 
again at Week 24.
The investigator/study coordinator are responsible to remind participants to fast prior to these 
visits and to confirm with participants their fasting status in the appropriate source 
documentation.
8.11.3 Participants Who Discontinue Study Intervention
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, all participants should be managed per Sections 
8.11.3.2, 8.11.3.3, and 8.11.5.
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention butcontinue to be monitored for 
any of the reasons listed in Section 7.1.
For all discontinuations which are not related to pregnancy, when it is determined that 
discontinuation from study intervention is appropriate, the participant should have both an 
Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit (Section 8.11.3.2) and an End of Treatment Follow-
up V isit (Section 8.11.3.3) conducted. After the visit procedures are completed, the 
participant will be withdrawn from the study and managed by the investigator per local 
standard ofcare.
8.11.3.1 Participants Who Become Pregnant

The participant should not be withdrawn from the study butshould have an Early 
Discontinuation of Treatment visit (Section 8.11.3.2). If the pregnancy is reported at a 
scheduled study visit, the assessments for the Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit and 
the End of Treatment Follow -up (42 days after End of Treatment) should be conducted at 
that ti me(Section 1.3.2) .These visits will be registered in IRT, concomitant medications will 
be reviewed, and safety assessments will be completed.
All reported pregnancies occurring during the study must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy (Section 8.4.5). When assessing the severity of AEs 
that are pregnancy- related complications, please refer to the additional guidance provided as 
part of the DAIDS table version 2.1 “Addendum 1: Female Genital Grading Table for Use in 
Microbicide Studies”, particularly the section “Complications of Pregnancy” (found on pages 
11-12 of the Addendum) .
The participant will be asked to join a pregnancy registry, which collects information about 
the outcome of the pregnancy. Infants born to participants who b ecome pregnant while 
receiving study intervention and consent /assent to infant follow -up will have follow -up data 
collected up to approximately 1 year of age (Section 8.3.6) .
8.11.3.2 Early Discontinuation of Treatment
Participants that discontinue treatment early for any reason should have an Early 
Discontinuation of Treatment visit as outlined in Section 1.3.2. If Early Discontinuation 
occurs during the timeframe of a scheduled study visit, the assessments for the Early 
Discontinuation of Treatment visit should be conducted.
Decreases in CD4+ T- cell and/or total lymphocyte counts at the Early Discontinuation of 
Treatment visit should be managed per Section 8.11.5.
8.11.3.3 End of Treatment Follow- up Visit
Participants who discontinue study intervention at any time (including at the Week 96visit) 
for any reason(s) not related to pregnancy will have a safety follow -up visit in -clinic 
approximately 42 days after the last dose of study intervention. Assessments for this visit are 
outlined in Section 1.3.2.
Participants with decreases in CD4+ T- cell and/or total lymphocyte counts at the Early 
Discontinuation of Tre atment Visit and confirmed at the End of Treatment Follow -up Visit 
will be followed every 4 to 6 weeks (Section 8.11.5 and Section 1.3.3 ). The End of 
Treatment Follow -up Visit will be conducted approximately 42days after the last dose of

8.11.4 Viremia Confirmation
Note:  As of Amen dment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
For the Virologically Suppressed Cohort, i f a participant has a viral load of ≥50 copies/mL at 
any time during the study, a Viremia Confirmation visit must be conducted within 2 to 4 
weeks of the initial HIV -1 viremia (Section 1.3.2 and 4.2.1. 3.1).
For the Treatment -Naïve Cohort, if a participant has a viral load of ≥50 copies/mL following 
suppression of HIV -1 RNA to <50 copies/mL at any time during the study or at or after 
Week 24 in the absence of previous suppression, a Viremia Confirmation visit must be 
conducted within 2 to 4 weeks of the initial HIV -1 viremia (see Section 1.3.2 and Section 
4.2.1.3.1).
For both c ohorts, i f a scheduled visit is to occur within the timeframe that a participant wo uld 
return for a V iremia C onfirmation visit, the assessments for the scheduled visit should be 
conducted, and the HIV viral drug resistance sample and whole b lood for proviral DNA 
archiv e resistance t est sample must be collected.
8.11.5 Management of Participants with Regards to CD4+ T -Cell Counts and/or 
Total Lymphocyte Counts
Participants discontinued from DOR/ISL should undergo assessments for CD4+ T- cell 
and total lymphocyte counts at the Early Discontinuation of Treatment Visit.The average 
baseline value (defined as the average of the screening [ within 45 days prior to the first 
dose of study intervention] and Day 1 values ) for CD4+ T -cells and total lymphocytes 
will be compared to the v alues at the Early Discontinuation of Treatment Visit.
oIf the CD4+ T -cell and/or total lymphocyte counts at the Early Discontinuation of 
Treatment Visit are not decreased by > 10% of the average baseline value , the 
participant will proceed to an End of Trea tment Follow -Up visit approximately 
42 days later and will discontinue from the study at that visit. If the CD4+ T -cell 
and/or total lymphocyte counts at the Early Discontinuation of Treatment Visit 
are >10% below average baseline value, the participant will need to have the 
decrease in counts confirmed at the End of Treatment Follow -up Visit. If at the 
End of Treatment Follow -up visit the counts are not decreased by > 10% of the 
average baseline value , then the participant will discontinue from the study at the 
End of Treatment visit .
oIf the CD4+ T -cell and/or total lymphocyte counts at the Early Discontinuation of 
Treatment Visit are >10% below average baseline value , the participant will need 
to have the decrease in counts confirmed at the End of Treatmen t Follow -up Visit.  
If at the End of Treatment Follow -up visit the counts are still decreased by >10% 
of the average baseline value , then the CD4+ T -cell and total lymphocyte counts 
should be monitored every 4 to 6 weeks (per Section 1.3.3 ) until both the CD4+ 
T-cell count and total lymphocyte count are not decreased by > 10% of the 
average baseline value on 2 measurements 12 weeks apart .

Statistical Methods for 
Key AnalysesPK(Intensive PK Cohort) :
PK data from t he Intensive PK Cohort will be used to estimate the posterior 
probabilities that in pediatric participants the true steady -state plasma ISL 
AUC 0-24is <0.28 µM·hr (ie,GM of plasma ISL AUC 0-24in adults 
following ISL 2.25 mg QD); the true steady -state PBMC ISL-TP C24 is 
˃2.68 µM ( or 0.5 4pmol/106 cells) (ie,GM of PBMC ISL -TP C24 in adults 
following ISL 0.25mg QD) . The PK profile is considered acceptable if the 
posterior probabilities are greater than 90% and 90% respectively.
Safety: Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all 
relevant parameters including AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for these safety parameters.
Efficacy: The p ercentage of participants with HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 and < 50 
copies/mL will be estimated with a 95% CI (via the Clopper -Pearson method). 
The primary missing data approach will be the FDA snapshot approach. 
Change from baseline in CD4+T -cell counts will be esti mated using the DAO 
approach with a 95% CI based on the t -distribu tion. 
Interim Analyses An eDMC will review the safety and tolerability data at regular intervals 
throughout the study . After the target enrollment has been met and all the 
participants have completed the Week 24 Visit,the primary safety and the 
secondary efficacy analysis at Week 24 will be conducted by the Sponsor and 
results will be shared with the eDMC.
Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment is needed as there are no hypotheses to be tested in 
the study .
Sample Size TheIntensive PK Cohort size is supported by clinical trial simulations using 
the ISL population PK model based on adult data (from MK -8591 -001, 002, 
003, 009, and 011) that indicated N=10 is required to estimate clearance in 
pediatric participants with adequate precision (relative standa rd error <30%).
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the 
Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor. The statistical analyses of the PK data will 
be conducted in col laboration with the departments of Quantitative Pharmacology and 
Pharmacometrics and Clinical Research of the Sponsor.
This study will be conducted as a nonrandomized, open -label study, ie, participants, 
investigators, and Sponsor personnel will know the i ntervention administered.
The Clinical Biostatistics department will generate the allocation schedule for study 
intervention assignment. Allocation number will be assigned via an IRT.

9.4.2 Safety Endpoints
An initial description of safety measures is provided in Section 4.
Adverse Events
The following AEs will be summarized: 1) participants with at least 1 AE; 2) participants 
with at least 1 drug- related AE; 3) participants with at least 1 SAE; 4) participants with at 
least 1 serious and drug -related AE; 5) participants with at least 1 Grade 3 to 4AE; 6)

who discontinued study intervention due to an AE; 8) participants who discontinued study 
intervention due to a drug- related AE; 9) participants with AE(s) leading to death.
Predefined Limits of Change in Laboratory Parameters
For the summaries of laboratory tests, participants must have both a baseline and 
postallocation on -treatment measurement to be included. Participants’ laboratory values 
(based on their most abnormal laboratory test values, in the direction of interest, while on 
study intervention) will be classified as to whether or not they fall outside the PDLC and are 
worse in grade (ie, more abnormal in the direction of interest) than at baseline. The criteria 
are adapted from the DAIDS table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events, July 2017, version 2.1 (Appendix 3). A listing of the participant s who meet the

9.4.3 Efficacy Endpoints
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, the available efficacy dat awill be summarized .
Percentage of Participants With HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL
The Abbott RealTime PRC Assay with a reliable lower limit of quantification of 
40copies/mL will be used to measure the HIV -1 RNA level in blood samples obtained at 
each visit . The percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL will be estimated 
separately for Treatment -Naïve and V irologically Suppressed Cohort s at each visit time point 
in the S oA.A second objective will be assessed based onthe percentage of participants with
HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Weeks 24, 48, and 96.
Percentage of Participants With HIV -1 RNA ≥50 Copies/ mL
The percentage of participants with ≥ 50 copies/mL will be estimated at each visit time point 
in the SoA for Virologically Suppressed Cohort . A second objective will be assessed based 
upon the percenta ge of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50copies/mL at Weeks 24, 48 ,and 
96.
Change From Baseline in CD4+ T -cell Count
Change from baseline in CD4+ T- cell count will be assessed at Weeks 24, 48 ,and 96 in the 
Virologically Suppressed Cohort and the Treatment- Naïve Cohort separately .
For analyses of change from baseline (eg, change in CD4+ T -cell count, change in laboratory 
tests, etc.), baseline measurements are defined as the Day 1 value for each participant. In the 
rare event when data for this vis it are missing, the value obtained at the most recent screening 
visit will be used as baseline, when available .
Clinically Significant Confirmed Viremia
Participants with confirmed virologic rebound or incomplete virologic response as defined in 
Section 4. 2.1.3.1 will be identified.
Viral Resistance -associated Substitutions
Participants who meet the definition of confirmed virologic rebound or incomplete virologic 
response (Section 4.2.1.3.1 ), or who discontinue study intervention for another reason and 
have HIV -1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL at the time of discontinuation, will be assessed for 
development of viral drug resistance. Among such participants, those with HIV -1 RNA ≥400 
copies/mL or anyone for whom available genotypic or phenotypic data show evidence of 
resistance, irrespective of viral load, will be included for resistance analyses. The resistance 
analysis will summarize the number and percentage of participants who have evidence of 
resistance -associated substitutions with primary interest at Weeks 24, 48 ,and 96.

Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, only descriptive statistics based on available data is 
applicable for this section.   Both non -model based and model -based analysis will be 
performed on available data, as applicable.
Individual values will be listed for each PK parameter and the following (non- model -based) 
descriptive statistics will be provided: N (number of participants with nonmissing data), 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic percent CV (calculated as 1 00 x standard 
deviation/arithmetic mean), median, minimum, maximum, GM, and geometric percent CV 
(calculated as 100 x sqrt (exp(s2) -1), where s2 is the observed variance on the natural log
scale).
ISLplasma concentrations from sparse PK sampling will be summarized by nominal 
timepoint with the following descriptive statistics: N (number of participants with 
nonmissing data), arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic percent CV (calculated as 
100 x standard deviation/arithmetic mean), median, minimu m, maximum, GM, IQR 
(interquartile range), and geometric percent CV (calculated as : 100 x sqrt(exp(s2) - 1), where 
s2 is the observed variance on the natural log scale).
ISL PK data will also be added to the ISL population PK model along with data collecte d 
from other studies. The analysis plan for the population PK analysis will be described in a 
separate MAP.
9.6.1.1 Dose Confirmation
Note:  As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable.
In the Intensive PK Cohort, posterior probabilities with a no ninformative flat prior will be 
used to assess whether pediatric participants have acceptable PK. Acceptable PK is defined 
as follows:
A posterior probability that the true ISL steady -state plasma exposure (AUC0 -24) in 
pediatric participants does not exceed 0.28 µM·hr (corresponding to the GM exposure 
simulated using the population PK model for adults at ISL 2.25 mg QD) at Day 28
greater than 90%
A posterior probability that the true ISL-TP steady -state PBMC trough concentration 
(C24) in pedia tricparticipants exceeds 2.68 µM ( or 0.5 4pmol/106cells)
(corresponding to the GM exposure simulated using the population PK model for 
adults at ISL 0.25 mg QD )at Day 28 greater than 90%
If the participants in the Intensive PK Cohort meet the acceptable PK definition and there are 
no safety concerns, then the ISL dose will be established .

Continuous Measures
For continuo us measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory and vital signs, 
summary statistics for baseline, on- treatment, and change from baseline values will be 
provided (Table 7 ).Missing safety laboratory, or vital signs will be handled using the DAO 
approach, ie, any missing value will be excluded from the analysis , with the exception that a 
missing Day 1 result will be replaced with the value obtained at the most rec ent screening 
visit will be used as baseline, when available. If no baseline result is available, that 
participant will not be included in the summary.
For PDLC assessments, p articipants’ laboratory values (based on their most abnormal 
laboratory test values, in the direction of interest, while on study intervention) will be 
classified as to whether or not they fall outside the PDLC and are worse in grade (ie, more 
abnormal in the direction of interest) than at baseline. The criteria are adapted from DAIDS 
table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, July 2017, version 2.1 , 
Appendix 3. A listing of the participants who meet the criteria will also be provided .

9.6.3 Efficacy Analyses
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, this section is no longer applicable . Only descriptive 
statistics for all available data is applicable for this section. 
Time Windows for Analyses
Table 8 lists the definition of time windows that will be used for the purposes of the 
statistical analyses and the target relative day for the scheduled visits. The last available on-
treatment measur ement within a window will be used for analyses at a specific time point, 
unless otherwise specified. Results from additional time points beyond Week 96may be 
summarized, and day -range rules for determining the analysis time windows will follow the 
same pattern where the ranges start and end at the mid points between target days.

FDA Snapshot Algorithm and Missing Data Approaches
There are 3 types of missing values:
Intermittent missing values due to a missed or skipped visit or due to an inadequate 
sample
Nonintermittent missing values due to premature discontinuations because of 
treatment -associated reasons including adverse events (regardless of relationship to 
study intervention) or lack of efficacy
Nonintermittent missing values due to premature discontinuations because of other 
reasons which are not related to treatment such as loss to follow- up, protocol 
violation, participant withdrew consent, etc.
Three approaches will be used to handle missing values (Table 9 ). The primary approach for 
the analysis of the percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL and the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA <50 is the FDA snapshot approach [Food and 
Drug Administration (CBER) 2015] . Under this approach, v irologic outcome will be defined 
according to the following categories:
HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL : Participants who have the last available on -treatment 
HIV-1 RNA measurement < 50 copies/mL within the analysis window specified in
Table 8 for the time point of interest .
082RKV
PRODUCT: MK-8591A  92
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 028-03 
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL : This includes participants who:
1)Have the last available on -treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement 
≥50copies/mL within analysis window specified in Table 8 for the timepoint 
of interest .
2)Do not have on -treatment HIV -1 RNA data in the window of interest and
Who discontinue study intervention due to lack of efficacy prior to or 
in the analysis window for the time point of interest , or
Who discontinue study int ervention due to reasons other than lack of 
efficacy prior to or in the analysis window for the time point of interest 
and have the last available on -treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement 
≥50copies/mL
No Virologic Data in Specified Analysis Time Window : This in cludes participants 
who do not have on -treatment HIV -1 RNA data in the window for the time point of 
interest because of the following:
1)Discontinued study intervention due to AE or death: This includes participants 
who discontinued because of an AE or death at any time point from Day 1 
through the time window if this resulted in no virologic data on -treatment 
during the specified window and have the last available on -treatment HIV -1 
RNA meas urement <50copies/mL
2)Discontinued study intervention for other r easons : This includes participants 
who discontinued study intervention due to reasons other than lack of efficacy 
or AE/Death (ie, lost to follow -up, noncompliance with study intervention, 
physician decision, protocol deviation, withdrawal by participant, etc.) prior to 
or in the analysis window for the time point of interest and have the last 
available on- treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement <50 copies/mL
3) On study intervention but missing data in window : Only data in the window 
can be used for participants remaining on study intervention. Participants 
should be classified as on study , but missing data in window regardless of the 
HIV-1 RNA results outside the analysis window for the time point of interest.
The number of participants classified as “HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL” according to the FDA 
snapshot algorithm defined above, divided by the number of participants in the FAS, is the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at a timep oint. Similarly, the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at a timepoint is calculated using 
the number of participants classified as “HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL” according to the FDA 
snapshot algorithm defined above, divided by the number of participants in the FAS.
A second approach, the missing data treated as treatment failure (M=F) approach, will be 
performed as a sensitivity analysis for the percentage of participants achieving HIV -1 RNA 
082RKV
PRODUCT: MK-8591A  93
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 028-03 
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
<50copies/mL. Under this approach, participants who 1) have at least 1 on -treatment HIV -1 
RNA measurement within the analysis window specified in Table 8 for the time point of 
interest and have the la st available on -treatment measurement within the window HIV -1 
RNA measurement <50 copies/mL at the timepoint of interest, OR 2) are on study 
intervention and have no HIV -1 RNA measurements within the analysis window specified in 
Table 8 for the time point of interest and have both the immediately preceding and 
immediately subsequent on- treatment HIV -1 RNA measurements <50 copies/mL, will be 
classified as a virologic “success” at the timepoint of interest. Participants with other reasons 
for missing data will be classif ied as a virologic failure at the timepoint of interest.
A third approach, the OF approach will also be performed as a sensitivity analysis for the 
HIV-1 RNA measurement <50 copies/mL endpoint. Under this approach, participants with 
nonintermittent missing data who prematurely discontinue study intervention due to lack of 
efficacy or who discontinue treatment for other reasons and are failures (HIV- 1 RNA 
≥50copies/mL) at the time of study intervention discontinuation are considered as failures at 
timepoints thereafter. Participants who discontinue study intervention for reasons other than 
lack of efficacy and who are not failures at the time of study intervention discontinuation will 
be excluded from the analyses at subsequent timepoints. Participants with intermittent 
missing data will be considered as successes if both the immediately preceding and 
immediately subsequent on- treatment HIV -1 RNA measurements are <50 copies/mL; all 
other intermittent missing results will be imputed as failures.
Percentage of Participants With HIV -1 RNA ≥50 Copies/mL
The snapshot approach will be used as the primary approach to analysis with respect to the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL.
The percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies will be e stimated at Weeks 24, 
48, and 96 . For each time point of interest, the associated 95% CI will be calculated based on 
the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson (1934) [Clopper, C. J. 1934] . 
Virologic response over all time points will also be summarized in a similar fashion.
Percentage of Participants with HIV -1 RNA < 50 copies/mL
The snapshot approach will be used as the primary approach to analysis with respect to the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL . The percentage of participants 
with HIV- 1 RNA <50 copies/mL will be estimated at Weeks 24, 48, and 96. For each time 
point of interest, the associated 95% CI will be calculated based on the exact binomial 
meth od proposed by Clopper and Pearson (1934) [Clopper, C. J. 1934] . Virologic response 
over all time points will also be summarized in a similar fashion. The supportive analys is 
using the OF approach (as defined ab ove) will also be presented.
Change From Baseline in CD4+ T -cell Count
Change from baseline in CD4+ T- cell count will be summarized at Weeks 24, 48, and 96
with the associated 95% CI calculated based on the t -distribution (Table 9 ).

The DAO approach will be used to handle missing data for these analyses. Under the DAO 
approach, participants must have both a baseline measurement and at least 1 post baseline 
measurement within the analysis window specified in Table 8 for the time point of interest in 
order to be included in the analyses of the mean change from basel ine in CD4+ T -cell count. 
Supportive analyses will also be provided using the LOCF and BOCF methods to account for 
missing data.
Clinically Significant Confirmed Viremia
The number of participants with confirmed virologic rebound or incomplete virologic

9.6.4 Palatability and Acceptability Assessment of the Tablet (Whole and Split)
Note:  As of Amendment 028 -03, study intervention administration will have been 
discontinued , so descriptive statistics will be prepared on available data .
Each participant will rate the palatability and respond to questions on the acceptability of 
treatme nt with oral DOR/ISL FDC tablet as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). This 
assessment will be based on the 5- point facial hedonic scale ( FHS),anexpression scale 
depicting various degrees of pleasure as an assessment of palatability (Section 4.2.1.4 and 
Section 8.1.9 ).
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the palatability and acceptability responses 
by cohorts on Day 1 and Day 28 for full tablet, and on Week 24 for split tablet . Missing data 
will not be imputed, and the analyses will be based on observed data only. These analyses 
will be based on the APaT population.
9.7 Interim Analyses
An eDMC will review accumulating safety data throughout the study as detailed in the 
eDMC Charter and will make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or protocol 
modifications to an executive committee of the S ponsor (Appendix 1).
9.8 Multiplicity
There will be no multiplicity adjustments in the analy sis of this study.
9.9 Sample Size Calculations
Note: AsofAmendment 028-03, the study has closed to enrol lment therefore the 
following sample size calculations are no longer applicable.
9.9.1 Sample Size for PK Analysis
TheIntensive PK Cohort size is supported by clinical trial simulations using the ISL 
population PK model based on adult data (from MK -8591- 001, 002, 003, 009, and 011) that 
indicated N=10 is required to estimate clearance in pediatric participants with adequate 
precision ( relative standard error <30%).
In addition, the operating characteristics of posterior probability -based thresholds for 
acceptable PK (defined in 9.6.1.1) are provided below. With approximately 10 participants in 
Intensive PK Cohort :
Assuming the log scale SD of steady- state plasma ISL AUC0 -24 in pediatric 
participants (<18 years of age, weighing ≥35kg)is 0.285 after the administration of 
DOR/ISL (100 mg/0.75 mg) QD, if the true steady -state ISL AUC0 -24 is 0.1 2µM·hr, 
the probability that this PK endpoint will be deemed within the acceptable range is 
>99%. The true SS plasma ISL AUC0 -24 can be as high as 0.23 µM·hr to still have a 
conclusion of acceptable PK with 80% probability.

Assuming the log scale SD of steady-state PBMC ISL- TP C24 in pediat ric 
participants is 0.4 96after the administration of DOR/ISL (100 mg/0.75 mg) QD, if 
the true SS PBMC ISL -TP C24 is 11.22 µM(2.24pmol/106cells) , the probability that 
this PK endpoint will be deemed within the acceptabl e range is >99%. The true SS 
PBMC ISL- TP C24 can be as low as 3.76 µM (0.75pmol/106cells) to still have a 
conclusion of acceptable PK with 80% probability.
9.9.2 Sample Size for Safety Analysis
The probability of observing at least 1 of a particular type of AE in this study depends on the 
number of participants treated and the underlying percentage of participants with that AE in 
the study population.
If the underlying incidence of a particular AE is 1% (1 of every 100 participants receiving 
DOR/ISL ), there is a 36.4 % chance of observing at least 1 of that particular AE among the 45
participants in the study. If no AE of that particular type is observed among the 45
participants in the study , this study will provide 9 7.5% confidence that the underlying 
percen tage of participants with that particular AE is < 6.4% (1 in every 16 participants).
The estimate of and the upper bound of the 95% CI for the underlying percentage of 
participants with a particular AE given various hypothetical observed number sof participants 
with the AE are provided in Table 10. These calculations are based on the exact binomial 
method proposed by Clopper and Pearson [Clopper, C. J. 1934] .

9.9.3 Sample Size for Efficacy Analysis
The key efficacy objective for the V irologically Suppressed Cohort will be assessed based on 
the percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 24. The anticipated
virologic failure rate for the study population is approx imately 2% . With 30participants, the 
maximum half -width of the 95% exact CIwill be no greater than 19%. The calculation is 
based on the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson [Clopper, C. J. 1934]
and is performed using SAS v9.4. Table 11 shows the 95% CIs for percentage of participants 
with HIV- 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL given varying assumptions of number sof responders in 30
participants. Note that the intervals are not symmetric around the point estimate.

The key efficacy objective for the T reatment -Naïve Cohort will be assessed based on the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 24. The anticipated rate 
of participants with HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL for the study population is approx imately 
80% to 90%, based on experience from MK -8591 Protocol 011 and assuming DOR/ISL will 
be similarly active in adults and pediatric participants. With 15participants, the maximum 
half-width of the 95% exact CI will be no greater than 26%. The calculat ion is based on the 
exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson [Clopper, C. J. 1934] and is 
performed using SAS v9.4. Table 12 shows the 95% CIs for percentage of participants with

9.10 Subgroup Analyses
Note: As of Amendment 028 -03, subgroup analyses will no longer be conducted.
To assess the consistency of the response across various subgroups, the percentage of 
participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL (Virologically Suppressed Cohort only)and
HIV-1 RNA <50 copies /mL, and associated 95% CIs will be estimated within each category 
of the following classification variables:
Age category ( ≤ median, > median)
Sex at birth
Gender identity
Region (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.)
The consistency o f the response will be assessed descriptively via summary statistics by 
category for the classification variables listed above as applicable based on the number 
available in each potential subgroup . Other clinically relevant variables may be identified for
which additional subgroup analyses may be performed. Subgroup summaries will be 
presented separately for the Virologically Suppressed and Treatment -Naïve Cohorts.
9.11 Compliance (Medication Adherence)
In this study, as part of the routine recording of the amo unt of study intervention taken by 
each participant in the study intervention CRF page, the number of tablets remaining in study 
packaging will be counted and reviewed at regular intervals.

For the main analysis of compliance in this study, a day within th e study will be considered 
an “On Therapy” day if the participant takes at least 1 tablet from any bottle provided for this 
study.
The “Number of Days Should be on Therapy” is the total number of days from Day 1 to the 
date of the last dose of study intervention for each participant. As such, the “Number of Days 
Should be on Therapy” will be the number of days from Day 1 to the date of the scheduled 
Week 96visit for those participants who are on study intervention for the entire study period. 
For participa nts who discontinue study intervention early (ie, prior to completion of the study 
at Week 96), the “Number of Days Should be on Therapy” will be the number of days from 
Day 1 to the date of discontinuation of study intervention. For each participant, perc ent 
compliance will then be calculated using the following formula:
Summary statistics will be provided on percent compliance for the FAS and will be presented 
separately for the Virologically Suppressed and Treatment -Naïve Cohorts .

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I. Introduction
A. Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participants in clinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials. In all cases, MSD clinical trials will be conducted 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations (including all applicable data protection re gulations), and 
International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP), and also in accordance with the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
B. Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be e ndorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (e.g., contract research organizations, 
collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials t hat are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator- initiated trials, which are not under the 
full control of MSD.
II. Scientific Issues
A. Trial Conduct
1. Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD 
may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or v alidate various endpoint measures, or trials to 
determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i.e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific 
purpose of the trial. Participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2. Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by MSD personnel (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability 
to successfully conduct the trial.
3. Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites ar e monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus 
source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if fraud, 
082RKV
PRODUCT: MK-8591A  101
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 028-03 
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
scientific/research misconduct or serious GCP -non-compliance is suspected, the issues are investigated. 
When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review 
commit tees notified.
B. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data a nalysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing; in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be 
underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity.
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscr ipt. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications.
III. Participant Protection
A. Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [IRB]/ Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by MSD for regulatory authority 
acceptance/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations.
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant trial 
documents must be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations. C hanges to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an 
immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval.  
MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect partic ipant safety, in compliance with 
local and/or national regulations.
B. Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefit s of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At 
a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care.
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is 
obtaine d. Participants may withdraw from an MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C. Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to t he greatest extent possible. Unless required by 
law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory 
authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the participa nt by name.
D. Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an 
ethics committee.

IV. Financial Considerations
A. Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible participants.
B. Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by MSD, and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for perfor ming the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a s ource of funding.
C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e.g., to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices.
V. Investigator Commitment
Investigators will be expected to review MSD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards.
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for 
Financial Disclosure information is requir ed. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's 
responsibility to comply with any such request.
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrang ements with the Sponsor to 
allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a fina ncial disclosure form, provided by 
the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this 
information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the 
transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.
10.1.3 Data Protection

datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or any information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related da ta will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the participant. 
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance aud itors or other authori zed personnel appointed by the S ponsor, by 
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.
10.1.3.1 Confidentiality of Data
By signing this protocol, the investigator affirms to the Sponsor that information furnishe d to 
the investigator by the Sponsor will be maintained in confidence, and such information will 
be divulged to the IRB , 
IEC,or similar or expert committee; affiliated institution and 
employees, only under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality w ith such board or 
committee, affiliated institution and employees. Data generated by this study will be 
considered confidential by the investigator, except to the extent that it is included in a 
publication as provided in the Publications section of this protocol.
10.1.3.2 Confidentiality of Participant Records
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees that the Sponsor (or Sponsor representative), 
IRB/IEC, or regulatory authority representatives may consult and/or copy study documents to 
verify worksheet/ CRF data. By signing the consent form, the participant agrees to this 
process. If study documents will be photocopied during the process of verifying 
worksheet/ CRF information, the participant will be identified by unique code only; full 
names/initials will b e masked prior to transmission to the Sponsor.
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to treat all participant data used and 
disclosed in connection with this study in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules 
and regulations.
10.1.3.3 Confident iality of IRB/IEC Information
The Sponsor is required to record the name and address of each IRB/IEC that reviews and 
approves this study. The Sponsor is also required to document that each IRB/IEC meets 
regulatory and ICH GCP requirements by requesting and maintaining records of the names 
and qualifications of the IRB/IEC members and to make these records available for

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definition of AE
AE definition
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (includin g an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
NOTE: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic 
agent, medical device, combination product, or protocol specified procedure whether 
investigational or marketed (including placebo, active comparator product, or run -in 
intervention), manufactured by, licensed by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor 
for human use in this study .
Events meeting the AE definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either a n 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
Note: Congenital disorders (eg, present from birt h) not detected or diagnosed prior to 
study intervention administration do not qualify for reporting as AE.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.
For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”

Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endosc opy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).

Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s ) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Surgery planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened.
Refe r to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
10.3.2 Definition o f SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inp atient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened is not an SAE. )A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medica l 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza,

and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital a nomaly/birth defect
In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in t he above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do no t result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
10.3.3 Additional Events Reported
Additional events that require reporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH defi nition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
Is a cancer
Is associated with an overdose 
10.3.4 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE r ecording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs /worksheets at each examination.
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participa nt’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the parti cipant

MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the 
Sponsor.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diag nosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) by recording the grade according to the NIH DAIDS Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, version 2.1. Any AE which 
changes DAIDS grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade 
recorded on the AE CRFs/worksheets.
-Grade 1 Mild event: Mild symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual 
social and functional activities with intervention not indicated.
-Grade 2 Moderate event: Moderate symptoms causing greater than minimal 
interference with usual social and functional activities with intervention indicated.
-Grade 3 Severe event: Severe symptoms causin g inability to perform usual social and 
functional activities with intervention or hospitalization indicated.
-Grade 4 Potentially life -threatening event: Potentially life -threatening symptoms 
causing inability to perform basic self -care funtions with inter vention indicated to 
prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death.
-Grade 5 Death: Deaths related to an AE.
Assessment of c ausality
Did the Sponsor’s product cause the AE?
The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product c aused the AE will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of c ausality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a 
relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information.
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Sponsor’s product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and

their respective elements (in number and/or in tensity), the more likely the Sponsor’s 
product caused the AE:
-Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the 
Sponsor’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill 
count, diary, etc.), expected ph armacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?
-Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug -induced effect (a pplies to studies with investigational medicinal 
product)?
-Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors.
-Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor’s pro duct discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?
◦If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
◦If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanen t 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the Sponsor’s 
product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are 
only used 1 time.)
-Rechallenge: Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor’s product in this study?
◦If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
◦If yes, this is a positive rechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (3) Sponsor’s 
product(s) is/are used only 1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT, OR IF RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT POSES ADDITI ONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINICAL DIRECTOR, AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
IRB/IEC.

Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor’s product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms/worksheets by 
an investigator who is a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.
Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor’s product relationship).
-Yes, there is a reasonable poss ibility of Sponsor’s product relationship:
◦There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor’s product. The temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor’s product is 
reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the Sponsor’s product than by 
another cause.
-No, there is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship:
◦Participant did not receive the Sponsor’s product OR temporal sequence of the 
AE onset relative to administration of the Sponsor’s product is not r easonable 
OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Sponsor’s 
product. (Also entered for a participant with overdose without an associated 
AE.)
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investiga tor always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.
The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.

New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.5 Reporting of AE s, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and o ther reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic d ata 
collection t ool
The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the EDC tool.
-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will 
use the paper AE Reporting form.
◦Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requireme nts.
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
If a sit e receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acce ptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time fr ames.
Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

10.5.1 Definitions
Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman (including a transgender male who is assigned female sex at birth) is considered 
fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile 
(see below):
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
Transgender women (assigned male sex at birth)

Premenarchal
Premenop ausal female with 1 of the following:
-Documented hysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.

Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Progestogen -only contraceptive implantc,d
IUSc,d,e
Non-hormonal IUD
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause)
This is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of 
the WOCBP and the absence of sperm ha s been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method 
of contraception should be used. A spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Note: Documentation of azoospermia can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical re cords, medical examination, or medical history interview.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependentb
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) hormonal contrac eptionc,d
-Oral
-Intravaginal
-Transdermal
-Injectable
Progestogen -only hormonal contraceptionc,d
-Oral
-Injectable
Sexual Abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.
Acceptable Contraceptive Methods
Failure rate of >1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Progesterone- only hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action
Male or female condom with or without spermicide
Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double 
barrier methods)e
aContraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of 
contraceptive methods for participants of clinical studies.
bTypical use failure rates are higher than perfect -use failure rates (ie, when used consistently and 
correctly).
cIf locally required, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to 
those which inhibit ovulation.
dIUS is a progestin releasing IUD.
eA combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide are considered 
acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.
Note: T he following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
-Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and LAM.
-Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).

10.6 Appendix 6: Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical 
Research
1.Definitions
a.Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a 
sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be 
used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition.1
bPharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics as 
related to drug/vaccine response.2
c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence of 
variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2
d.DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid.
e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid.
2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section 8.8 will be 
used in various experiments to understand:
◦The biology of how drugs/vaccines work
◦Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by the body
◦Other pathways with which drugs/vaccines may interact
◦The biology of disease
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations 
with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or 
with the Sponsor.
3. Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research.
a.Participants for Enrollment
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered fo r enrollment in future 
biomedical research.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   028 -03  
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
b.Informed Consent
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during 
screening for protocol enrollment from all participants or legal guardians, at a study visit 
by the investi gator or his or her designate. Informed consent for future biomedical 
research should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in the SoA. If 
delayed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed by the 
participa nt will be kept at the clinical study site under secure storage for regulatory 
reasons.
A template of each study site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the Sponsor’s 
clinical document repository.
c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical r esearch will be captured in 
the eCRFs . Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be 
destroyed.
d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s )
Collection of specimens for future biomedical r esearch will be performed as outlined in 
the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens ar e being collected for future 
biomedical r esearch, these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is 
having blood drawn for other study purposes.
4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research
In order to optimize the resea rch that can be conducted with future biomedical r esearch 
specimens, it is critical to link participant' cli nical information with future test results. In 
fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to 
the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing 
participant characteristics like gende r, age, medical history and intervention outcomes are 
critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results.
To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for future 
biomedical r esearch, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical r esearch 
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain an y personally 
identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant 
identifiers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will 
appear on the specimen tube.

MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
5.Biorepository Specimen Usage
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific 
practices. Analyses utilizing the future biomedical r esearch specimens may be performed 
by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university investigator) designat ed by 
the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy 
and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the 
specific scope o f analysis outlined in future biomedical research protoc ol and consent . 
Future biomedical r esearch specimens remaining with the third party after specific 
analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor.
6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biome dical r esearch and ask that thei r 
biospecimens not be used for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may withdraw 
consent at any time by contacting the investigator for the main study. If medical records 
for the main study are still available, the inves tigator will contact the Sponsor using the 
designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the 
participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study 
use only. If specimens were collected from s tudy participants specifically for future 
biomedical r esearch, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and 
destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or 
destruction, if applicable. It is the responsib ility of the investigator to inform the 
participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any 
analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already 
performed prior to the request being received by th e Sponsor will continue to be used as 
part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated 
after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
invest igator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study 
records) or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a 
link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation,
the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed.
7.Retention of Specimens
Future biomedical r esearch specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential 
analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the main study. Spec imens may be stored for 
longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being 
answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions 
have been adequately addressed.
Specimens from the study sit e will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to 
the Sponsor -designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular 
study, the study site will ship directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. The 
specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   028 -03  
MK-8591A -028-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-FEB-2022
operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according 
to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the 
biorepository database.
8.Data Security
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research 
personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is 
accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international 
standards to protect against unauthorized access.
9.Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants
No information obtai ned from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation.
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to 
rapidly report this information to doctors and participants. Participants will not be 
identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific 
publication or presentation.
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population
Every effort will be made to recruit all participants diagnosed and treated o n Sponsor 
clinical studies for f uture biomedical r esearch.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been mini mized and are 
described in the fu ture biomedical r esearch informed consent.
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation, there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may be misused.
12.Questions
Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be e mailed directly to 
clinical.specimen.mana gement@merck.com.

Additionally, about 320 people will participate at the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center for a total 
enrollment of 740 people at all sites.  
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
If you agree to join and do not withdraw from the study before all procedures are complete, your 
participation in this study will last for o ne study visit.  Participants may withdraw from the study at any 
time.      
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
Informed consent will be provided by participants prior to their participation in this study.  They will 
then undergo tests of hearing sensitiv ity and function.   All of the tests will be performed by trained 
laboratory personnel.  Each study session will take up to 2 hours.  The procedures which will involve 
you may include:  
 
Chart review:   After you have agreed to participate, your previous audi ologic evaluations and 
information about your ear health (e.g., from primary care doctor; emergency room doctor; ear, nose 
and throat doctor) will be gathered from your VA medical record.  If you are a non-Veteran subject 
recruited from the community you will be asked to provide a copy of your medical record for your 
hearing or ear disorder.  
 
Otoscopy:   The researcher will look in both of your ear canals using an otoscope.  This is a standard 
clinical procedure.  Otoscopy will take approximately two minute s, and all you have to do is sit quietly.  
There are no known risks with the exception of discomfort of the speculum in your ear canal.  If your 
ear canals are clogged with ear wax ( cerumen ), you may be asked to have them cleaned before 
participating in th e study.  If there is evidence of drainage or something else that may be associated 
with a medical condition, you will be referred to your primary care doctor or an ear, nose, and throat 
doctor.  You may be asked to return to continue participation after y ou see the doctor and after any 
physician -recommended intervention.

 Pure tone hearing test:   You will receive a standard clinical pure tone hearing threshold test.  You 
will be asked to sit in a quiet booth with insert earphones in your ears or while we aring headphones.  
You will raise your hand or say ‘yes’ when you hear soft tones.  This test will take approximately 20 to 
30 minutes.  There are no known risks for taking this test.  You will not be excluded from the study 
based on your hearing test resu lts unless you were specifically recruited for a normal hearing group, 
the results indicate you have a hearing loss, and we do not currently need subjects for our groups 
with hearing loss.  If we identify a previously unknown hearing loss, you will be refe rred to an 
audiologist.  
 
Speech perception tests:   You will receive standard clinical speech audiometry tests.  You will be 
asked to repeat words at soft levels and at a comfortable volume.  You will be asked to indicate at 
what volume the words are uncomf ortably loud.  You will hear the words in the same location and 
with the same equipment as for the pure tone hearing test.  This set of tests will take approximately 
15 minutes.  There are no known risks for taking these tests.  You will not be excluded fr om the study 
based on the results from these tests.   
 
Standard clinical immittance test battery:   You will receive a standard clinical test battery that tells 
us how well your middle ears (tympanometry test) and middle ear muscles (acoustic reflex thresho ld 
test) are working.  You will be tested in a quiet room.  You will have a small plastic probe tip in each 
ear canal, you will hear several different beeps, but you do not have to do anything except quietly sit.  
This test battery will take approximately 10 minutes.  Some people do not like the feeling of pressure 
in their ear canals that is associated with the tests.  If you feel uncomfortable during this test, please 
tell the researcher and s/he will stop the test.   You will not be excluded from the stu dy based on the 
results of this test.  
 
Experimental immittance test battery:    This test is similar to the standard clinical immittance test 
battery with the exception that the sounds are different and it is completed using experimental 
equipment.  The tes t environment, expectations for you, and risks are the same as for the standard 
test.  You will not be excluded from the study based on the results of this test.

 Otoacoustic emissions (OAE):   You will receive an OAE test that tells us how well your inner ears 
are working and it is completed using the same system as the experimental immittance test battery.  
You will be seated in a quiet room with a foam probe tip in your ear canal.  You will hear some 
sounds but all you have to do is quietly sit.  This tes t will take approximately 10 minutes.  There are 
no known risks from taking this test.  You will not be excluded from the study based on the results of 
this test.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS and POSSIBLE DISCOMFORTS of PARTICIPATION?  
The tests in this study are standard clinical tests of hearing or tests that are similar to standard tests. 
The rubber tips that will be used in your ear canals for some tests may produce a plugged -up feeling, 
but they should not be painful. You may also experience slight discomfort from air pressure changes 
in the ear canal. The test uses loud sounds to evoke the middle -ear reflex which is detected in the ear 
response. The tests maintain safe levels of sound. However, you may find the sounds too loud which 
may cause discomfort. If so , please tell the researcher and the test will be stopped to prevent further 
discomfort. You can take a break anytime.  
 
WILL I BENEFIT BY PARTICIPATING?  
You may or may not personally benefit from being in this study. However, by serving as a subject, you 
may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.  
 
DO I HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY?   
No, you may choose not to be in this study.  
 
HOW WILL MY CONFIDENTIALITY BE PROTECTED?   
Your information used for this study will be kept confidential as required by law. The results of your 
participation in this study may be used for publication or for scientific purposes, but the results will not 
include any information that could identify you. Your identity will not be disclosed unless you give

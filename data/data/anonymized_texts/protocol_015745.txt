 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to United States standards of Good Clinical Practice in accordance with applicable Federal regulations and institutional research policies and procedures.  
 Prostate cancer (PCa) is the third most common cause of cancer related death in the United 
States and is the most prevalent non- cutaneous cancer [1].  Pelvic lymph node dissection 
(PLND) following robot -assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is an established technique for 
determining lymph node metastases [2].  The most frequent post -operative complication of 
PLND is lymphocele formation. Lymphoceles occur as a result of lymph leakage from lymphatic channels that ha ve been cut during dissection. The Principal Investigator (PI) has  previously 
published findings of an occurrence rate of 51% for lymphocele formation with 15.4% from them being clinically symptomatic. The overall frequency of symptomatic ly mpocele in patient’s 
that underwent bilateral PLND was equal  6.6% of the evaluated group in this publication [3].   
 We hypothesize that the incidence of lymphocele’s  should decrease significantly by attending to 
careful sealing of these channels using adequate hemostatic tools [3].    
Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
 Bovie Medical Corporation’s J -Plasma® helium based plasma technology is a hemostatic t ool 
with FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue.  The J -Plasma® 
system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpiece, and a supply of helium gas.  Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode.  When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.  The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy.  Previous studies comparing J -Plasma® to 
other energy sources demonstrated less or comparable lateral and depth of thermal spread for J -
Plasma® in porcine peritoneum, bladder, and small intestine [4].  The precise delivery of energy and minimal thermal injury to collateral tissue makes J -Plasma® a useful surgical too l in 
procedures such as radical prostatectomy where minimizing damage to collateral tissue is crucial to preserving sexual function and continence.  As an example, J -Plasma® has been shown to be 
clinically effective in the treatment of endometriosis on fallopian tubes, ovaries, and other delicate structures where current RF energy sources cannot be used due to risk of damage [5,6].  
 This study protocol will evaluate the efficacy of the J -Plasma® helium based plasma technology 
in the reduction of lymphoceles  following PLND during RARP.  The J -Plasma® h andpiece will 
be used during the PLND by dissecting the lymph nodes and sealing the lymphatic channels to prevent lymph leakage.

 Study Objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the J -Plasma ® helium based 
plasma technology in the reduction of lymphoceles following PLND during RARP.  
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE /AIM/GOAL/HYPOTHESIS  
J-Plasma ® helium based plasma technology will reduce the occurrence of lymphoceles 
when used to perform PLND  during RARP.

Study Design  
RESEARCH DESIGN  
The study will be a single institution, single arm prospective trial where by 100 patients will be enrolled.   
Participants evaluated and scheduled for a PLND during Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy by Dr. Vipul Patel who have met the study inclusion criteria and who have also given informed consent will be enrolled. Enrolled participants will have their PLND performed using J -Plasma® for dissection and sealing of lymphatic channels. An 
abdominal -pelvic ultrasound will be completed at a follow -up peri od ranging from 4- 12 
weeks post operatively to determine if a lymphocele is present a s this is the standard  of 
care within Dr. Vipul Patel’s clinical practice for all patients who undergo a PLND during RARP .  The occurrence rate of lymphoceles in this trial group of 100 patients  will 
be compared to retrospective data of 100 patients  acquired from the IRB approved 
Urologic Robotic Surgery Outcomes Registry  # 237998  using the same inclusion/ exclusion 
criteria as defined for enrollment in this protocol   and f rom other published data to 
determine if the occurrence rate has been reduced.    
  
STUDY AGENT , DEVICE , AND/OR INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION  
 
The study will be conducted using components of the Bovie Medical J -Plasma® 
system that have received FDA clearance and are currently commercially available.  The J -Plasma® handpieces were cleared under FDA 510k numbers 
K112233 and K151325 for the delivery of helium gas plasma for cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue.  The Bovie Ultimate high frequency electrosurgical generator was cleared under FDA 510k number K142975 for delivery of RF energy and/or helium gas plasma to cut, coagulate, and ablate soft tissue.  Therefore, the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue during PLND would be c onsidered on label for the study devices.

Study Procedures  
 
SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING  
 Participants  for enrollment  will be recruited fr om the clinical practice of Dr. Vipul Patel.  
A researcher will screen the patient’s medical record specifically looking at diagnostic lab and path reports to verify inclusion/exclusion criteria for potential enrollment. If the patient indicates he would like more information, a qualified researcher will 
approach the patient, in a private room, to provide an overview of the study.   
 
CONSENT PROCE SS AND DOCUMENTATION  
      If the patient  meets the criteria for enrollment and  is interested in 
participating in the study, a researcher will be notified and the informed consent process will commence. Patients will be informed that th eir 
participation in the study is voluntary and the decision to participate in no way will affect their care for prostate cancer .  If the patient continues to 
express interest in the study, a copy of the  IRB approved informed consent 
form will be given to the patient to read.  The patient will be able to ask questions and have a sufficient amount of time prior to signing the informed consent document. After signing the informed consent form, a complete and signed copy will be  given provided to the patient.  
      In the unlikely event that a non- English speaking patie nt meets criteria for 
enrollment, then IRB Short Form procedures will be initiated.

Study Outcome Measures  (Endpoints)  
The primary outcome  to be measured will be  the incidence of lymphocele formation as 
diagnosed upon post - operative abdominal ultrasound.  The incidence of lymphocele formation 
in patients undergoing pelvic lymphnode dissection using the J Plasma ® will be compared to de -
identi fied retrospective data of lymphocele formation without the use of JPlasma® extracted 
from Dr. Patel’s urologic outcomes registry identified by IRBnet #237998.    
 
The following data variables and materials will be collected for analysis in this study:  
• Age at day  of surgery  
• Pre-operative Gleason  Score 
• Pre-operative PSA lab value  
• Clinical variables: pathology report from RARP, radiology report from abdominal ultrasound, physician notes, nurses notes.

 Data Management and Quality  Plan  
DATA DE-IDENTIFICATION  
 
• Unique identifiers  will be generated by the researcher at the time of enr ollment.  The 
number will consist of the  last two digits of the year enrolled as well as the n umber to 
designate the order in which enrollment  occurred .  
Ex: first patient enrolled during 2016 would be designated as patient 16- 01 
•  Data is linked by the research coordinator creating a master log containing patient 
Name,  DOB , DOS  MRN and study ID number.  
• This link will be used for auditing purposes. 
• The linked st udy master file will be kept on the FH H: drive in a password protected 
file. 
• Members of the GRI Study team as listed on the Delegation Log will have access to this linked file.  
• Data will be stored for a minimum of 7 years after the closure of the study.  
• The link will be kept for a minimum of 7 years after study closure.  
 
 
DATA CONFIDENTIALITY , STORAGE , AND RETENTION  
 
All electronic data will be stored in the FH H: drive.  Only FH employees will have access to this drive.  All files with identifiable data will be encrypted with password protection.  Only those indicated on the Delegation Log will have access to the data .  The 
study documentation and paperwork will be stored at Florida Hospital Global Robotics 
Institute in  a locked storage closet  during the  course of the  study. A fter study closure  data 
will be retained for 7 years  at Iron Mountain Records Facility. After that period of time, 
all individual patient study information will be shredded.  
  
DATA QUALITY  
 Quality control procedures for this research study include source data verification by randomly selecting 10% of subj ect records with comparison between the paper case 
report form (CRF) and the  medical record and/or  electronic database record of those 
same data.  If errors are common, data will be completely checked prior to data analysis .   
 
 
DATA SHARING (OUTSIDE OF FLORIDA HOSPITAL )  
If any data is to be shared outside of Florida Hospital a formal request will be made to the ORA and FH legal.

 Sample Size Determination  
 
 The primary outcome measure is the incidence of lymphocele after robot assisted  pelvic lymph 
node dissection. A previously published paper by Dr. Patel on this topic using a cohort of 76 patients was referred to for sample size determination [3].     
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS  
The primary variable of interest is the incidence of lymphocele formation measured at approximately 8 weeks post -operatively.  The incidence of lymphocele formation will be 
compared between the 100 enrolled  “treatment ” group and a propensity matched “ non-
treatment ” group that will be established using  equal inclusion/exclusion criteria, this  
retrospective lymphocele data will be retrieved from the
 Urologic Robotic Surgery Outcomes 
Registry  identified by IRBnet #237998 .  Additional comparisons of demographic (age, 
race/ethnicity) and oncological information will be accessed to ensure no differences between the two groups.     
Potential Risks and Benefits 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Lymphocele’s can l ead to symptoms and secondary complications such as abdominal 
pain, leg pain, lower limb edema, constipation, urinary frequency, deep vein thrombosis and infection or sepsis . 
The potential benefits  of enrollment of this study will be a hypothesized reducti on in the 
incidence of lymphocele formation thus resulting in a decrease of the symptoms associated with such formation.    
POTENTIAL RISKS  
Risks associated with robotic radical prostatectomy as discussed and stated by the physician and included in the surgery consent  signed by the patient regardless of 
enrollment in this study  include: severe loss of blood, damage to surrounding organs, 
tissues, vessels, infection / any of which may necessitate a return to surgery, cardiac arrest which may result from the performance of any surgery/ procedure(s), and in some cases, may lead to partial or permanent disability or death.  Additional risks may include, but are not limited to: urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, rectal/bowel/ureter injury, bladder neck contracture, pulmonary embolism, urine leak, pneumonia, problems related t o positioning and endotracheal tube, blood transfusion, embolus from pneumo-
peritoneum, unrecognized injuries and lymphocele  formation . 
 JPlasma® has minimal lateral and depth of thermal spread in a variety of tissue types however; possible  risks associate d with JPlasma® are: unintended surgical site burns due 
to direct contact with the cutting tip electrode.  Inadvertent activation or movement of the cutting tip instrument outside the field of vision may result in injury to the patient or

 surgical team.  Electrosurgical devices may cause interference with pacemakers or other 
implants.  
 
MITIGATION OF  RISKS  
Side effects will be monitored during follow -up study visits.   
 
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTEREST OF SUBJECTS  
Subjects will be assigned unique identifiers for study- related records.   All precautions 
will be taken to make sure that only authorized individuals will access subject research 
records.   Each member of the Florida Hospital Celebration GRI research team will have 
access to the securely stored medical charts within Dr. Patel’s practice, also the team has a unique id and password allowing them access to electronic medical records.  All 
research team members are trained to follow Florida Hospital’s policy on the protection of patient’s  health and private information.  The collection of sensitive information about 
subjects will be limited to minimum necessary to achieve the aims of the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information will be collected.    
Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
INVESTIGATOR  WITHDRAW AL OF  SUBJECTS  
Patients  that did not receive a pelvic lymph node  dissection at the discretion of the 
surgeon during their robotic radical prostatectomy will be withdrawn from the study.    Patients that do not return for the abdominal ultrasound post operatively as ordered by the physician will be withdrawn from the st udy. 
 
If a patient is withdrawn from the study they will be notified vi a telephone call by GRI 
Research Staff . After 3 failed attempts by phone  a certified letter will be mailed to the 
patient as the final attempt of notification.    All withdrawn particip ants will be documented in the regulatory binder.  
 
SUBJECT  REQUEST FOR WITHDRAW AL FROM STUDY  
 
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent at any time during the s tudy without penalty. 
In all cases of withdrawal, the date and the reason for withdrawal are to be documented per site standard operating procedure.   
 
DATA COLLECTION AND FOLLOW -UP FOR WITHDRAWN SUBJECTS  
 
Patients who request withdrawal  prior to the post -operative abd ominal ultrasound will not 
be included in the final analysis as the re would be unsuccessful collection of the  data 
necessary to conclude  the study’s  end point .  Patients who request to withdraw after the 
abdominal ultrasound will have their data maintained  in the research database up to the

 point of withdrawal.  This data will be included in subsequent analysis because keeping 
these patients in the analysis is essential for study validity.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting:  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether o r not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
 Adverse events will be documented as anticipated or unanticipated; minor or serious; and, related or unrelated to study intervention.   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : A Serious Adverse Event is defined as an AE meeting 
one of the following outcomes:  
• Death du ring the period of protocol defined surveillance  
• Life Threatening Event (defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization during the period of protocol defined surveillance  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for “serious ” should be regarded 
as minor  adverse events .  
 A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical proce dures for a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator. 
 
RECORDING AND NOTIFICATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
At each contact with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse

BACKGROUND  
Rosacea is a common chronic skin condition categorized into 4 subgroups based on clinical manifestations : 
erythematotel angiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular  [1]. Although the clinical features may

vary with rosacea, the most common primary feature of all subtypes is transient or persistent facial 
erythema [2 ,3]. Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea is primarily ch aracterized by flushing and persistent 
central facial erythema [ 4].  
Early diagnosis and treatment based on subtype are recommended to halt progression of symptom 
severity [5]. Flushing is better prevented rather than treated, by avoiding specific triggers , decreasing 
transepidermal water loss by moisturizers, and blocking ultraviolet light [5]. Nonselective β -blockers and 
α2-adrenergic agonists decrease erythema and flushing [5], while pulsed dye laser [5, 6] and intense 
pulsed light are used for telangiec tasias [5].  Pulsed dye laser also addresses the diffuse erythema and 
enlarged pores characteristic of rosacea [6].  
Oxymetazoline hydroc hloride 1% cream (RHOFADE ™) is a newly FDA -approved topical medication for 
adult rosacea patients. A primarily alpha -1a agonist, oxymetazoline hydrochloride (HCl) is thought to 
diminish erythema through vasoconstriction [ 7]. RHOFADE was evaluated for the treatment of persistent 
erythema associated with rosacea in two identical, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -
group clinical trials  [8]. A total of 489 subjects with persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea 
were treated with RHOFADE once daily for 4 weeks. An additional 440 subjects with persistent facial 
erythema associated with rosace a were also treated with RHOFADE once daily for up to one year in a long -
term (open -label) clinical trial [8].  Disease severity was graded by the clinician using a 5 -point clinician 
erythema assessment (CEA) scale [4] and by the subject on a similar 5 -poin t subject self -assessment (SSA) 
scale, on which subjects scored either “moderate” or “severe” on both scales. Composite success, defined 
as the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2 -grade improvement on both CEA and SSA, was 15% in 
Trial 1 and 12% in Trial 2 on Day 29 of treatment [8].   
Nonpurpuragenic pulsed dye laser (PDL) and intense pulsed light treatment have resulted in significant 
reduction in cutaneous erythema, telangiectasia and patient -reported associated symptoms of 
erythematotelangiect atic rosacea [9]. The PDL is an ideal energy -based device to treat the cutaneous 
vasculature of rosacea , since the 595 nm wavelength is strongly taken up by the hemoglobin in blood 
vessels  [6, 10].  With Vbeam 595nm PDL, ultra -long pulse duration s reduce pu rpura while  treat ing the 
telangiectasias  associated with rosacea, which is more comfortable for patients [5, 6].  
The cutaneous  manifestations of rosacea significantly impact  patients’ well -being , social and emotional 
health [5], and alternatives to furthe r improve management and treatment of this condition  are 
necessitated.  
The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of Rhofade topical drug therapy combined with 
Vbeam  PDL treatment. The study hypothesis is that a synergistic approach to treatment may improve the 
treatment course by a mechanism of action in which oxymetazoline acts as a vasoconstrictor, slowing  
down vascular flow and allowing for occlusion with PDL to c lose off the vessels quicker.

Study Device  
The Candela Family of Pulsed Dye Laser Systems, including the 595nm pulsed dye laser w avelength , are 
FDA-cleared systems (K051359; K050673). The Vbeam  595nm PDL is indicated for treatment of benign 
cutaneous vascular lesions, benign epidermal pigmented lesions and periorbital wrinkles. The Vbeam is 
also indicated for treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris.  
The FDA -cleared Vbeam system includes s pot si zes of 3, 5, 7, 10, 12 mm and 3x10 (elliptical).  The study 
device is a modified version of the FDA -cleared system that includes an additional 15 -mm spot size. The 
Vbeam and modified Vbeam are  non-significant risk ( NSR) device s. The modified Vbeam system  provides 
epidermal cooling by either cryogen spray (Dynamic Cooling Device), as with the FDA -cleared system, or 
contact with a cooled window (termed contact -cooling) . The modified Vbeam system (Vbeam Prima) 
recently received FDA clearance ( K180593 ) on June 5, 2018 . 
 
Study Drug  
RHOFADE™ is an alpha 1A adrenoceptor agonist indicated for the topical treatment of persistent facial 
erythema associated with rosacea in adults  [8]. 
There are no contraindications associated with topical use of RHOFADE for the top ical treatment of 
persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults.  
There are warnings and precautions associated with use of the 1% topical cream, as indicated in the FDA -
cleared package insert. These include the following:  
• Alpha -adrenergic ag onists as a class may impact blood pressure.  
• Use with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud’s phenomenon, 
thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren’s syndrome.  
• Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if signs  and symptoms of acute narrow -angle 
glaucoma develop.  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence > 1%) are application site dermatitis, worsening 
inflammatory lesions of rosacea, application site pruritus , application site erythema, and application site 
pain. In clinical trials, a dverse reactions occurred in 1% - 2% of subjects treated with RHOFADE through 4 
weeks of treatment. In the long -term (open -label) clinical trial, the rates of adverse reactions over a one -
year treatment period were as follows: wo rsening inflammatory lesions of rosacea (3%), application site 
dermatitis (3%), application site pruritus  (2%), application site pain (2%), and application site erythema 
(2%). Subjects with persistent erythema along with inflammatory lesions were allowed t o use additional 
therapy for the inflammatory lesions of rosacea [8].  
STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, two -arm randomized, baseline -controlled, pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of 
combined Vbeam PDL and topical RHOFADE cream for improvement in eryth ematotelangiectatic rosacea.

Up to 60 healthy male or female subjects will be enrolled at two investigational sites. All subjects will 
undergo an assessment of their general health. Following enrollment, subjects will be randomized to a 
study arm. Subjec ts in Arm 1 will receive RHOFADE topical cream  at the screening visit and will be 
instructed to apply it  daily for 4 weeks prior to the first PDL facial treatment.   Arm 1 subjects will receive 
three  (3) monthly PDL facial treatments at 4 -week intervals. Su bjects will apply RHOFADE topical cream 
once daily during the 6-month  study, according to the study protocol, with a 3-day wash -out period 
prior to each PDL treatment. Immediately following the PDL treatment, s ubjects in Arm 1 will apply 
RHOFADE topical cr eam  in-office. If subjects find it irritating to the skin to apply RHOFADE immediately 
after PDL treatment, then they may apply it within 24 hours of subsequent treatments.  
Arm 2 subjects will receive RHOFADE topical cream  at the screening visit and will be instructed to apply 
it daily for  6 months of continuous use until the 6 -month post -baseline follow -up visit. . Subjects in Arm 
2 will not receive laser  therapy.   
A one-week post first PDL treatment safety follow -up visit will be conducted (1wk FU post Tx.1)  for Arm 1 
subjects . In addition, efficacy and safet y evaluations will be performed  at each study  visit (1, 2, 3 and 6 
months post -baseline visit), as shown in Figure 1 below. .  
Erythema  severity will be assessed  at baseline and at each study visit . Improvement in erythema severity  
will be assessed at each post baseline visit . Additionally, investigator and subject questionnaires will be 
completed.  Photography will be performed at each study visit under visible light conditions of the front  
full face , right and left 45 -degree profile and right and left 90 -degree profile .  VISIA photography may also 
be performed for spectrometry measurements (optional). Safety assessments will be conducted at each 
study visit.

Screening Procedures  
• A brief relevant medical history will be obtained  to address inclusion/exclusion criteria for the 
study . 
• Clinician erythema assessment (CEA) and subject self -assessment (SSA) will be obtained  to 
address inclusion criteria for the study . Subjects with “moderate” or “severe” (Grade 3 or 4)  are 
eligible for  study participation  (Appendix II ). 
• Pregnancy will be assessed for female subjects based on their last menstrual period, ability to 
become pregnant (surgical sterilization, birth control), and whether they have plans to become 
pregnant during the 6 -month s tudy period.   
• The subject will undergo a standard skin exam to determine if they meet the study criteria.  
• If the subject meets the criteria for the study, he or she will discuss  with the study staff the study 
procedures, risk s, benefits, and commitments associated with enrollment into the study.  The staff 
will then review the consent form in detail with the subject, after which the subject will be given 
ample time to review the form.  The subject will sign a consent form after the subject fully 
understands the possible risks/benefits of the study and wants to participate in study.  The person 
conducting the session and the investigator will subsequently sign the consent form.  
• Once the consent  form  is signed, the subject will be assigned the next consecutive subject number 
and will be randomized to a treatment arm.  
• Women capable of childbearing will undergo a urine pregnancy test.

• Skin type will be recorded using the Fitzpatrick Scale.  
• Test spots may be performed (optional) for subjects in Arm 1 to determine the subject’s response 
to selected treatment parameter s.  Test spot  locations  will be selected  by the investigator.   
• Subjects in Arm s 1 & 2 will be provided with RHOFADE topical cream and instructed to apply once 
daily , according to the drug insert instructions:  apply a pea -sized amount once daily in a thin layer 
to cover the entire face (forehead, nose, each cheek, and chin) avoiding the eyes and lips.  
• The RHOFAD E topical cream will be applied  daily for 4 weeks prior to the first PDL facial treatment . 
• Subjects must discontinue topical use for a 3-day washout period prior to each PDL treatment.  
Pre-Treatment PDL Care  
In order to minimize pain during laser irradiat ion, subjects will be offered to use topical anesthetic 
cream (EMLA) , which will be applied to the skin surface 30 -60 minutes prior to laser irradiation.  
PDL Treatment Procedure  
• Treatments will be performed every 4 (± 1) weeks.  Subjects in Arm 1 must discontinue topical use 
for a 3-day washout period prior to each PDL treatment.  
• Laser treatment procedures will conform to all laser safety instructions and should be conducted 
per the procedure described.   
• The investigator , all personnel in the trea tment room and the subject will wear protective 
eyewear , appropriately  rated for the device wavelength(s) being operated.  
• Based on the subject’s response to the test spot evaluation  (optional)  or experience from 
treatment of prior subjects in this study  or in practice , the investigator will select the p arameters 
used for treatment, based  on the threshold for nonpurpuragenic  settings.  
• Parameters include choice of: the 12 mm or 15 mm spot size, the laser fluenc e, the duration of 
the laser pulse exposures  and the cooling procedure .  The investigator will treat the face  with the 
parameters chosen and will document the parameters.

follow -up visit.  Optional photography can include photos at  10 minutes  (approximately) after each 
treatment .  
• All subjects will be treated as follows:    
- The 12 mm or 15 mm spot size will be used.  
- Treatment pulse s will be deliver ed at the threshold for nonpurpuragenic  settings.  
• Subject s will be instructed to report any discomfort and/or comments during and post treatment.  
Discomfort will be rated on a scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain using the NRS 
scale (Appendix III).   
• Immediate c linical respons e post -treatment wil l be recorded  for: purpura, edema, erythema, and 
blistering , based on a predefined scale ( Appendix IV, Table 3 ).  
• Post-treatment photographs (optional)  may  be taken , approx imately  10 mins post treatment,  to 
document post treatment effects such as the colla pse of blood vessels, or to document post

Study Termination Procedure  
The s tudy  termination visit occurs i n parallel with the last follow -up visit.  The only additional procedure 
required for the termination evaluation is to complete  the study termination case report form ( CRF). 
Photographs  
Photographs will be taken at each study visit , before and approximately 10 minutes after (optional) each 
treatment  for subjects in Arm 1 , and at the 6 -month follow -up (2 month s following the final PDL treatment  
for subjects in Arm 1) .  Photography  will be standardized for reproducibility of photos  (Appendix I ): i.e., 
same photographer  for each subject’s study visit s, use of the same camera, background, position of 
camera with respect to the treated area , same lighting and exposure conditions. These photographs will 
be taken for documentation , as well as for the investigator  and subject  assessments .   
Post -treatment Care  
After treatment, no special care is usually necessary for the treatment site. Aquaphor ( similar to  Vaseline) 
may be supplied to the subject to be applied to any area that feels irritated. The subject will also be 
instruc ted to apply cool compresses if they have any areas of swelling after treatment and to wash the 
treated area with soap or a gentle cleanser as they normally would for the week following treatment. The 
subject will be able to continue with their preferred r outine skin care, excluding any method of wrinkle 
removal, the day after treatment. Sunscreen should be worn.  
Data Recording  
All data will be recorded in source documents and transcribed onto Case Report Forms (CRFs) . Site will be 
monitored by Syneron sta ff or designees to assure adherence to the clinical trial requirements, subject 
safety, protocol procedures, and for data accuracy. The Case Report Forms and image s will be reviewed 
and retrieved during the monitoring visit.  All source documentation will remain in the subject's files at 
the site.  
Protocol Revisions and/or Deviations  
With the exception of emergency situations, no chan ges or deviations in the conduct of this protocol will 
be permitted without the prior approval of the sponsor.  
The IRB/IEC that granted original approval for the study must be notified of all chan ges in the protocol  
and will approve any chan ge or deviation that may increase risk to the subject, and/or that may adversely 
affect the rights of the subject or validity of t he investigation.

In the event of an emergency, the Investigator will institute any medical procedures deemed appropriate. 
However, all such procedures must be promptly reported to the sponsor and the IRB/IEC.  
ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is a ny adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a study participant 
during their participation in the study.  
Anticipated Adverse Effects  
Antic ipated adverse effects of laser -based treatments include : hyperpigmentation, blistering, crusting, 
bruis ing, scabbing, scarring, hypopigmentation, infection, and pinpoint bleeding.  While unlikely, some 
adverse events may be permanent.  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesired clinical occurrence in a study subject as indicated by signs, 
symptoms, illnesses, ev ents that develop or worsen in severity in association with the study when deemed 
by the Investigator to be related to use of the device or study procedures. The Investigator will document 
all adverse signs and symptoms regardless of severity or frequency that are either volunteered by subjects 
or observed during the course of the study that are related to the device.  The Investigator will also record 
adverse experiences of subjects resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, 
or progression of disease states that the Investigator deems related to the device. Included in the 
description will be the nature of the sign or symptom, the date of onset, whether the event was serious, 
the severity, the relationship to study procedures or investigational device, the action taken, the date of 
resolution, and the outcome. The Principal Investigator will then determine the relationship of the adverse 
device effect to the investigational device.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
For devic e studies, part 21 CFR 812.3(s) uses the term unanticipated adverse device effect which is defined 
as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
An unanticipated adverse effect will be graded as follows : 
Mild : Sign or symptom, usually transient, non -life-threatening requiring no special 
treatment and generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate : Sign or symptom, non -life-threatening which may be ameliorated by simple 
therapeutic measures  and may interfere with usual activity.

Protocol #  DHF24671  Rev. Date  June 11, 2018  Page 20 of 28 
 
Major : Sign or symptom that is intense or debilitating but non -life-threatening and that 
interferes with usual a ctivities. Recovery is usually aided by therapeutic measures 
and the discontinuation of the study device may be required.  
Severe : Any untoward medical occurrence that at any time results in death or life -
threatening illness, resulting in persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity.   
The relationship of the adverse effect to the study is defined as follows : 
Probable : An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study device, and another 
etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
Possible : An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, and an 
alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship 
to study device.  
Probably not : An adverse event has little or no temporal rela tionship to the study device and/or 
a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Not related : An adverse event has no temporal relationship to study device or has a much more 
likely alternative etiology.  
Reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse E vents (SAE)  
The Investigator must report all unanticipated adverse device effects that are serious in nature to the 
clinical study monitor immediately or within twenty -four  hours by telephone (see below). If such an 
unanticipated adverse device effect is r eported after normal working hours, the Investigator will leave a 
voice message at the monitor’s telephone number with accompanying report of the unanticipated 
adverse device effect faxed or sent to the fax number/e -mail address below:

 4.3 Duration of Treatment 
Part I: The study will be a SAD study with subjects admitting t o the clinic on Day -1, and dosing 
on Day 1, followed by a residential period that concludes on Da y 4 after assessments are 
completed, except in cases where the residence is extended due to safety concerns determined by 
the Investigator in consultation with the study Medical Monitor . An EOS visit will be performed 
7 days after discharge from the in-patient unit (Day 11). The t ime from Screening to the EOS 
Visit is 39 days per cohort in Part I, inclusive of the Screeni ng window. 
Part II: The study will be a cross-over, single-dose study with  2 treatment periods. Admission 
will occur on Day -1, followed by dosing (Day 1), and a washout  period of at least 1 week or at 
least 5 half-lives between dosing, whichever period is longer. The duration of the washout period 
could be adapted based on the review of PK data of INDV-2000. S ubjects will be discharged on 
Day 2 unless tolerability from Part I indicates a longer stay i s warranted. If that is the case, 
subjects will stay in the clinical unit until Day 4. If dischar ged on Day 2, subjects will return to 
the clinical unit on the morning of Day 3 and Day 4 for PK test ing. Depending on PK results 
from Part I, the visit schedule may be modified. An EOS visit w ill be performed on Day 10 of 
the last Treatment Period (Part II, Period 2). The time from Sc reening to the EOS Visit is 
approximately 45 days, inclusive of the Screening window.

 If any of these criteria are not met, the subject will not be e nrolled and randomized in Part 1, or 
will not be enrolled in Part II, Period 1 – Dosing Under Fasting Conditions, or will not be 
allowed to move forward into Part II – Dosing after High-Fat Content Meal. 
5.5 Deviation from Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
This study is intended to be conducted as described in this pro tocol. Waivers from inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are not allowed because they have the potent ial to jeopardize subject safety, the 
scientific integrity of the study or regulatory acceptability o f the data. Indivior does not grant 
waivers to the protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteri a, and strict adherence to these 
criteria as outlined in the protocol is essential. The Principa l Investigator (PI), sub-Investigator or 
suitably qualified designee will be responsible for identifying , documenting and reporting all 
deviations, which are defined as isolated occurrences involving  a procedure that did not follow 
the study protocol or study-specific procedure. In the event of  a major deviation from the 
protocol due to an emergency, accident or mistake (e. g., eligi bility or dosing errors), the PI, sub-
Investigator or suitably qualified designee must contact the In divior Medical Monitor at the 
earliest possible time by telephone. This will allo w an early joint decision regarding the subject’s 
continuation in the study. This decision will be documented by the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Deviations will be reported as required to the Institutional Re view Board (IRB) per their 
reporting process and criteria, and in the final study report. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and documented through p rogrammatic checks of study 
data, as well as through review of selected subject data listin gs prior to database lock.

  For a subject who discontinues due to an AE, see Section 10.1.1  for follow-up procedures. Any 
subject withdrawn or discontinuing the study after being dosed  will not be replaced. 
Subjects can be withdrawn from the study for the following reas ons: 
x Pregnancy 
x Termination of the study 
x Upon the subject’s request (withdrawal of consent)  
x Significant deviation from the protocol 
x Concurrent illness or requirement for prohibited medication 
x At the discretion of the Investigator 
6.5.1 Subject Withdrawal of Consent 
If a subject withdraws consent, the subject will not receive an y additional doses of study drug in 
Part II. However, the subject may be offered additional tests a s needed to monitor their safety 
(e.g., EOS safety assessments or procedures). 
6.5.2 Subjects Lost to Follow-up 
In cases of a missed visit, the Investigator or designee must a ttempt to contact the subject and re-
schedule as soon as possible. The Investigator or designee must  counsel the subject on the 
importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascer tain whether or not the subject 
wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
In the event a subject is lost to follow-up, the Investigator o r designee must make a reasonable 
effort to contact the subject. Two documented attempts (e. g., phone, email, etc.) to contact the 
subject followed by a certified mailed letter is considered rea sonable. 
For the purpose of documenting date of discontinuation for a su bject confirmed to be lost to 
follow-up, the date of discontinuation should be the date of la st contact with the subject. 
In the case where a certified letter is sent but not confirmed as received by the subject, the date of 
discontinuation is the date the certified letter was sent. 
In the case where a certified letter is sent and has been confi rmed as received by the subject, the 
date of discontinuation is the date of the confirmed subject re ceipt. 
In the event that neither of these above cases applies (which s hould be explained in the source 
documents), the date of discontinuation is the date of the subj ect's last study visit.

 7 STUDY SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION 
Indivior reserves the right to temporarily suspend and/or perma nently discontinue the study at 
any time and for any reason, including safety or ethical concer ns or severe noncompliance. If 
such action is taken, Indivior will discuss the rationale for t he decision with the PI. In cases 
where a study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, In divior will promptly inform 
Investigators and the Regulatory Authorities of this action and  the reason(s) for the suspension or 
termination. 
If required by applicable regulations, the Investigator must in form the IRB promptly and provide 
the reason(s) for the suspension or termination. If the study i s prematurely discontinued, all study 
data and drug substance remaining on-site will be returned to I ndivior or its designated 
representative.

 No food will be allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose administ ration. Water is allowed as 
desired except for at least 1 hour before and at least 1 hour a fter drug administration. 
For the food effect evaluation of Part II, subjects will consum e a high-fat meal within 30 minutes 
prior to INDV-2000 administration. The high-fat meal should pro vide approximately 800 to 
1000 calories, and should derive approximately 150, 250 and 500  to 600 calories from protein, 
carbohydrate and fat, respectively. Examples of an appropriate high-fat meal are provided in 
Secition 22.5, Appendix 5 . Subjects should consume the entire meal in 30 minutes or less ; 
however, the dose must be administered 30 minutes after the sta rt of the meal. If the subject 
cannot complete the meal, the approximate percentage of the mea l consumed should be recorded 
in the eCRF and continue with the study. Additionally, the star t and finish time of the meal will 
be recorded in the eCRF. INDV-2000 will be administered with 24 0 mL (8 ounces) of water. No 
food will be allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose administrat ion. Water is allowed as desired 
except for at least 1 hour before and at least 1 hour after dru g administration. 
Lunch will be provided at least 4 hr post- INDV-2000 (or - plac ebo) dose for both parts. 
9.4 Accountability 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all drug subs tance and study drug is inventoried, 
accounted for and documented in accurate accountability records . Upon completion of the study 
and/or as requested by Indivior, copies of study drug and drug substance accountability records 
will be provided to Indivior. After the monitor completes recon ciliation, all unused study drug 
will be destroyed by the Investigator, as per local standard op erating procedures (SOP), after 
Indivior has approved the commencement of destruction. All unus ed drug substance and 
requested retain samples will be maintained at appropriate stor age conditions and shipped 
according to the details in the Pharmacy Manual. The IMP must b e handled strictly in 
accordance with the protocol, handling guidelines and the label ; it must be stored in a locked, 
limited-access area under appropriate environmental conditions.  
Subject level dispensation of IMP must be documented on the app ropriate subject level 
accountability form. All IMP dispensation will be performed by a pharmacist or designee, 
checked by a study site staff member and documented on a drug d ispensation form. 
Used IMP bottles (for both powder in solution and capsule), and  unused IMP must be available 
for verification by the site monitor during monitoring visits. 
9.5 Reporting Product Complaints 
The Investigator and study site staff are responsible for promp t reporting of product quality 
complaints to Indivior. A product complaint is any concern pert aining to the preparation or 
quality of the drug substance or IMP, and includes, but is not limited to, broken capsules, 
labelling defects or packaging defects, IMP that is thought to be ineffective, or has an 
appearance, taste or odour that is outside of what is expected.

Subjects will not be permitted to drink caffeine-containing bev erages, eat caffeine-containing 
foods or use caffeine-containing products prior to check-in thr ough the EOS visit. 
In addition to 90 days prior to screening, subjects will refrai n from smoking and from using e-
cigarettes and nicotine-containing products through the EOS vis it. 
Subjects will refrain from drinking alcohol from prior to check -in throughthe EOS visit. 
9.7 Compliance 
The PI or sub- Investigator may terminate a subject based on the subject’s abi lity to comply with 
the protocol requirements. 
 
Study drug will be administered by designated qualified study p ersonnel at the clinical facility. 
The PI or sub-Investigator will be present during the administr ation of study drug. The time and 
duration, the dose delivered and any dosing observations will b e recorded in source 
documentation. The PI, sub-Investigator or designated individua l will maintain a log of all study 
drugs dispensed and returned. Drug supplies will be inventoried  and accounted for throughout 
the study. The clinical site will have access to the Indivior M edical Monitor for any safety events 
that occur.

 10 ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator or designee is responsible for identifying, do cumenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an AE. 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject associate d with the use of an IMP 
regardless of the presence of a causal relationship to the IMP.  An AE can be any unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) symptom or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with an IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP. 
x Events meeting the definition of an AE include: 
x New condition detected after IMP administration even though the  AE may have been 
present prior to receiving IMP. 
x Exacerbation of a pre-existing condition (including intensifica tion of a condition and/or 
an increase in frequency). 
x Any abnormal laboratory test results or other safety assessment s felt to be clinically 
significant in the opinion of the Investigator (including those  that worsen from baseline). 
x Symptoms and/or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interactio n or an overdose of either 
IMP or a concomitant medication. 
x Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae resulting from special  interest conditions (e.g., 
IMP misuse, medication error, IMP withdrawal, etc.). Overdose p er se will not be 
reported as an AE/SAE. 
x Symptoms and/or clinical sequelae that resulted in intervention . 
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include: 
x Medical or surgical procedures; the condition that leads to the  procedure is an AE. 
x Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( e.g., social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, hospitalization for electi ve surgery, hospitalization 
for observation in the absence of an AE). 
x Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
10.1 Assessment of Adverse Events 
The Investigator is ultimately responsible for assessing and re porting all AEs as outlined in the 
protocol. The assessment and reporting of AEs may be delegated to a medically qualified sub-
Investigator, trained on this study protocol, who is listed on the delegation of authority log. All 
INDV-2000 Indivior 
Clinical Study Protocol: INDV-2000-101 10 December 2020 
  
 
Confidential  Page 47 of 89 
 
  
 AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relations hip to the IMP will be reported as 
described in this protocol. 
Adverse events should be volunteered by the subject or solicite d from the subject using a 
standard statement, obtained from examination of the subject at  a site visit, or from observations 
of clinically significant laboratory values or special examinat ion abnormal values. If an event 
assessed by one of the study scales requires intervention, or i f in the opinion of the Investigator, 
it is clinically significant, then it will be reported as an AE . 
All AEs are to be assessed and recorded in a timely manner and followed to resolution or until 
the Investigator determines that there is not an anticipated re solution. Each AE is to be 
documented with reference to severity, date of occurrence, dura tion, treatment and outcome. 
Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or no n-serious. In addition, the 
Investigator must assess whether the AE is IMP-related or not. 
10.1.1 Time Period for Collecting Adverse Events 
Adverse event monitoring and reporting will begin after the sub jects sign the ICF, continue 
throughout the study and include EOS/ET/Follow-up. Subjects wil l be monitored by the study 
site staff for untoward effects and will be released from the s tudy after the last procedure is 
completed and confirmed that the subject has no residual untowa rd effects from the IMP that 
may affect safety. Treatment-emergent AEs will be defined event s observed after starting 
administration of INDV-2000 or placebo. 
Surgical procedures, planned before enrolment of the subject in  the study, are not considered 
AEs if the condition was known before study inclusion. In this case the medical condition should 
be reported in the subject’s medical history.  
Any clinically significant symptoms will be reported as AEs. Al l AEs and corresponding 
treatment will be recorded in the eCRFs and a summary of all th e safety data will be presented in 
the final Clinical Study Report (CSR). Any ongoing AEs will be appropriately followed up until 
resolution or 14 days after EOS/ET. The study site personnel wi ll make every effort to contact 
the subject for a minimum of 2 attempts after which the outcome  of the AE will be considered 
ongoingand the subject will be noted in source as  lost to foll ow-up. 
If a subject experiences the onset of an SAE within 5 days foll owing study completion and in the 
opinion of the Investigator, that SAE is associated with the st udy drug, it will be followed and 
reported as described in Section 11.2 . 
If an SAE occurs that is deemed related to study drug, a PK sam ple will be taken as soon as 
possible after the event is reported. If possible, an additiona l sample should be collected when 
the SAE has been resolved.

 10.1.2 Assessment of Intensity 
The term “severe”  is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific eve nt (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe); the event itself, however, may be of rela tively minor medical significance 
(such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,”  which is based on subject/event 
outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for d efining regulatory reporting 
obligations.  
Intensity Definition 
Mild Causes transient or mild discomfort; no limitation of usual act ivities; no 
medical intervention required. 
Moderate Causes mild to moderate limitation in activity; some limitation  of usual 
activities; no or minimal medical intervention or therapy is re quired.  
Severe Causes marked limitation in activity; some assistance is usuall y required; 
medical intervention or therapy is required; hospitalization is  probable.  
For vital sign assessments and clinical laboraty abnormalities considered by the Investigator to 
be an Adverse Event according to Section 10.1.4 , the intensitiy of adverse events will be graded 
in accordance with the FDA Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grad ing Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinic al Trials ( Section 22.6, 
Appendix 6 ). 
Adverse events with changes in severity should be documented as  separate events. 
10.1.3 Assessment of Causality 
The Investigator or a medically qualified sub-Investigator, tra ined on this study protocol and 
listed on the delegation of authority log is responsible for de termining the AE relationship to the 
IMP. 
The following categories will be used to define the relationshi p of an AE to the administration of 
the IMP: 
Not Related:  Data are available to identify a clear alternative cause for th e AE other 
than the IMP.  
Related:  The cause of the AE is related to the IMP and cannot be reasona bly 
explained by other factors (e.g. , the subject’s clinical state, 
concomitant therapy and/or other interventions).  
A "reasonable possibility" is meant to convey that there are fa cts/evidence or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship canno t be ruled out. The Investigator will 
use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternativ e causes, such as natural history of 
the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factor s and the temporal relationship of 
the event to the IMP will be considered and investigated. The I nvestigator will also consult the 
INDV-2000 Indivior 
Clinical Study Protocol: INDV-2000-101 10 December 2020 
  
 
Confidential  Page 49 of 89 
 
  
 IB in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the Investigator must document 
in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and ha s provided an assessment of 
causality. 
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the Inves tigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Indivior or des ignated representative. However, it is 
imperative that the Investigator always make an assessment of c ausality for every event prior to 
the initial transmission of the SAE data to Indivior or designa ted representative. The Investigator 
may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up i nformation and amend the SAE 
data collection tool accordingly. The causality assessment is o ne of the criteria used when 
determining regulatory reporting requirements. 
10.1.4 Clinical Laboratory Changes 
Changes in laboratory values, vital signs or other safety param eters (e. g. , neurological and 
clinical symptom assessments) as noted in the protocol are a su bset of AEs and are reportable 
only if the lab test result is associated with accompanying sym ptoms, and/ or requires additional 
diagnostic testing or intervention (medical, surgical), and/or requires additional significant 
treatment, and/or requires temporal or permanent discontinuatio n of IMP, or a change to dosing 
other than as permitted by protocol, or if considered to be cli nically significant by Investigator or 
medically qualified designee. 
Screening laboratory assessments, if determined to be clinicall y significant by the Investigator, 
are not AEs.

 11 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator or designee is responsible for identifying, do cumenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an SAE. 
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria: 
x Death 
x Life-threatening 
x In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospital ization 
x Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject w ho received INDV-2000 
x Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, b e life-threatening or 
require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based u pon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medic al or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defi nition. Examples of such 
events are: 
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm 
 Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patien t hospitalization 
 Development of IMP abuse or diversion 
x Potential Hy’s Law  cases indicative of medication-induced hepatocellular injury, defined 
as: 
o ALT 3x ULN and total bilirubin of 2x ULN (or INR >1. 5 if measured) 
o ALT or AST >3x ULN with systemic symptoms (fatigue, nausea, vom iting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophi lia [>5%]) 
x Potential Hy’s Law cases should be managed as described i n Section 22.3, Appendix 3 . 
An AE is considered “life -threatening” if the subject was at immediate risk of death from  the 
event as it occurred; i.e. , it does not include a reaction tha t if it had occurred in a more serious 
form might have caused death. For example, IMP-induced hepatiti s that resolved without 
evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threat ening even though IMP-induced 
hepatitis can be fatal. 
AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. Hospit alization for elective surgery or 
routine clinical procedures that are not the result of AE (e. g . , elective surgery for a pre-existing 
condition that has not worsened) should not be considered AEs o r SAEs. If anything untoward is 
INDV-2000 Indivior 
Clinical Study Protocol: INDV-2000-101 10 December 2020 
  
 
Confidential  Page 51 of 89 
 
  
 reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported  as an AE (either 'serious' or 
'non-serious') according to the usual criteria. 
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been  detained (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observ ation and/or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the physician's office or other ou tpatient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolong s hospitalization or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalization' occurred 
or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a substantial and/or permanent 
disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life fu nctions. 
11.1 Documenting Serious Adverse Events 
When an SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigato r to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostic repor ts) pertaining to the event. The 
Investigator will then record all relevant information regardin g the SAE on the appropriate 
electronic or paper form(s). 
It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the subj ect’s medical records to 
Indivior in lieu of completion of the SAE Reporting Form. Howev er, there may be cases where 
copies of medical records are requested by Indivior or designat ed representative. In this instance, 
all subject identifiers, with the exception of subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the 
medical records prior to submission to Indivior. 
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the e vent based on signs, symptoms 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis  will be documented as an AE or 
SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
11.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
11.2.1 Investigator Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Once the Investigator determines that an event meets the protoc ol definition of an SAE, the SAE 
will be reported to Indivior (or designated representative) by the Investigator (or designee) 
within 24 hours  from first being aware of the event using the form provided by  Indivior or 
designated representative. Any follow-up information on a previ ously reported SAE will also be 
reported to Indivior within 24 hours. 
Where additional information is needed or expected, the Investi gator will not wait to receive all 
information before reporting the event to Indivior. The Investi gator must provide an assessment 
of causality at the time of the initial report as described in Section 10.1.3 . 
In the event of an SAE, the Investigator or designee will notif y both the Indivior Medical 
Monitor at the phone number and/or email address listed under S tudy Personnel Information and

 12 PREGNANCY 
Participants will include women of non-childbearing potential a nd men who agree to use highly 
effective means of contraception. Pregnancy is not anticipated during the conduct of this study. 
In the case where a subject’s routine pregnancy test as require d per protocol is positive for 
pregnancy prior to dosing, the subject should not be dosed. If the subject has a positive urine 
pregnancy test, a confirmatory serum pregnancy test should be p erformed. 
12.1 Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs in a Female Partner  
If the partner of a study subject becomes pregnant, the pregnan cy will be reported to the clinical 
unit within 48 hours of the subject’s knowledge of the pregnanc y. The Investigator will attempt 
to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a ran domized male study subject who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. 
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the female partner directly, the 
Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropria te form and submit it to Indivior 
or designated representative within 24 hours of learning of the  partner’s pregnancy. The partner 
will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy  and information on the status of 
the mother and child will be forwarded to Indivior or designate d representative. Generally, 
follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the est imated delivery date. Any 
premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardl ess of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.

 13 DATA MANAGEMENT 
13.1 Data Collection and Management 
Data will be entered into the eCRF and will be combined with ot her data captured centrally 
outside of the eCRF into a validated system. Clinical data will  be managed in accordance with 
the data management plan to ensure that the integrity of the da ta is maintained. Adverse events, 
medical history and indication for concomitant medications will  be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Concomitant medi cations will be coded using 
the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. The eCRFs (including queries and 
audit trails) will be retained by Indivior. An electronic copy of the eCRF will be sent to the 
Investigator for their records. Subject identifiers will not be  collected or transmitted to Indivior 
according to Indivior standards and procedures. Data collection  will be completed according to 
the study plans. 
13.1.1 Database Quality Assurance 
The eCRFs will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors and values requiring 
further clarification using computerized and manual procedures.  Data queries requiring 
clarification will be generated and addressed by the investigat ional site. Only authorized 
personnel will make corrections to the eCRFs, and all correctio ns will be documented in an audit 
trail. 
13.1.2 Source Documents 
The Investigator is responsible for the quality of the data rec orded in the eCRFs. The data 
recorded should be a complete and accurate account of the subje ct’s record collecte d during the 
study. 
Study data are not to be gathered directly onto the eCRF, but m ust be gathered onto primary 
source documents at the clinical site. Completion of source doc uments will precede the 
completion of the eCRF. Source documents may be electronic, har d copy, or a combination of 
both and are defined as the results of original observations an d activities of a clinical 
investigation. Source documents will include, but are not limit ed to, progress notes, electronic 
data, screening logs and recorded data from automated instrumen ts. All source documents 
pertaining to this study will be maintained by the Investigator  and made available for direct 
inspection by the authorized study personnel outlined in the IC F. The CRF will be considered the 
source document for individual CRF elements such as study-speci fic scales if those data are 
collected directly onto a CRF.

 14 STATISTICS 
14.1 General Procedures 
This section describes the sample size, analysis populations an d planned analyses for PK and 
safety endpoints. A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SA P) will be developed to detail the 
statistical methodology for all aspects of the planned analyses . The SAP will be approved after 
the protocol is finalized and before the database is locked. An y deviations from the analyses 
described below will be identified in the SAP (and subsequently  the CSR). Any unplanned 
analyses not described in the SAP will be identified in the CSR . 
Data will be listed and summarized separately for Parts I and I I of the study. For Part I, data will 
be summarized by dosing cohort for active treatment and for all  placebo subjects combined. For 
Part II, data will be summarized by treatment group (fed or fas ted) where applicable. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations 
(SD), medians, minimums and maximums. Categorical variables wil l be reported as frequency 
counts (including number missing) and the percentage of subject s in corresponding categories. 
Individual subject data will be presented by subject in data li stings. Data listings will include all 
data collected from screened subjects (i.e., subjects who sign informed consent). 
For change from baseline calculations, baseline will be defined  as the last measurement taken 
prior to dosing. 
14.2 Sample Size 
The sample size is not based on formal power calculations becau se the study is only designed to 
provide initial assessment of the safety, tolerability and PK f or INDV-2000. The sample size 
used is typical for studies of this nature and should be adequa te to assess the parameters 
described. 
14.3 Analysis Populations 
14.3.1 Safety Population 
The Safety Population is defined as subjects who received at le ast one dose of IMP. 
14.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Population 
The PK analysis population is defined as subjects who received at least one dose of INDV-2000 
and have an adequate number of PK samples collected to derive P K parameters. 
14.3.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics (e.g., sex, race, age,  weight, height, BMI) will be 
summarized for the Safety Population and separately for screen failures.

 14.5 Interim Analysis 
No formal interim analysis is planned. In Part I, there will be  a review of safety data for the 
sentinel group in each cohort before proceeding to the next sub ject in the cohort. There will also 
be a review of the safety and PK data for each cohort before do se escalation. The safety data 
review will be conducted by the DRSC (Section 15.2 ) using stopping rules defined in Section 
6.4. 
14.6 Handling of Missing Data 
In general, missing data (caused by premature discontinuation o r otherwise) will not be imputed. 
14.7 Other Safety Analyses 
Other safety endpoints will be listed and summarized using the Safety Population. Other safety 
endpoints include changes from baseline in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, ECG 
parameters and physical examinations. 
14.8 Extent of Exposure 
Frequency  and percentage of subjects dosed in each cohort for Part I and dosed in each 
Fed/Fasted group separately for Part II will be provided. 
14.8.1 Laboratory Data 
Observed values and changes from baseline in laboratory paramet ers will be summarized by 
analysis visit. 
Clinically abnormal laboratory results will also be summarized by frequency and percentages for 
each category. 
14.8.2 Vital Signs 
Observed values and changes from baseline in vital signs (SBP a nd DBP, respiratory rate, heart 
rate and temperature) will be summarized by analysis visit. 
14.8.3 Physical Examination 
Clinically significant physical examination findings will be su mmarized by analysis visit. 
14.8.4 Electrocardiogram 
Results from 12-lead ECG will be categorized as normal, abnorma l not clinically significant, or 
abnormal clinically significant and will be summarized by analy sis visit using frequencies and 
percentages for each category. Observed values and changes from  baseline in ECG interval 
measurements will also be summarized by analysis visit.

 informed consent documents are required to have been reviewed a nd received a favorable 
opinion/approval from an IRB prior to presenting them to a pote ntial subject. 
Any changes to the ICF must be reviewed by Indivior before subm ission to the IRB. 
The written informed consent process will include the review of  oral and written information 
regarding the purpose, methods, anticipated duration and risks involved in study participation. 
The Investigator is to ensure that each subject is given the op portunity to ask questions and 
allowed time to consider the information provided. The Investig ator or a person designated by 
the Investigator must also explain to each subject that partici pation is voluntary, and that consent 
can be withdrawn at any time and without reason. Subjects will receive a signed and dated copy 
of the signed ICF before any study-specific procedures are cond ucted. 
In the event that new safety information emerges that represent s a significant change in the 
risk/benefit assessment, the signed ICF should be updated accor dingly. All subjects should be 
informed of the new information, provide their consent to conti nue in the study, and be provided 
with a signed and dated copy of the revised signed ICF. 
15.5 Records Management 
The Investigator must maintain all study-related records (excep t for those required by local 
regulation to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and secure loc ation throughout the conduct and 
following the closure of the study. The records must be accessi ble upon request (e. g. , for an 
IRB, Indivior or regulatory inspection) along with the facility , study personnel and supporting 
systems/hardware. All documents pertaining to the study, includ ing all versions of the approved 
study protocol, copy of the ICF and other documents as required  per local laws and regulations 
(e. g. , Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [H IPAA] documents), completed 
CRFs, source records (subject records, subject diaries, hospita l records, laboratory records, drug 
accountability records, etc. ), and other study-related materia ls will be retained in the permanent 
archives of the study site. 
Where permitted by local laws and regulations, records may be m aintained in a format other than 
hard copy (e. g. , electronically in an electronic medical reco rds system). The Investigator must 
ensure that all reproductions are an accurate legible copy of t he original and that they meet 
necessary accessibility and retrieval standards. The Investigat or must also ensure that a quality 
control process is in place for making reproductions and that t he process has an acceptable back-
up of any reproductions. 
The minimum retention time for retaining study records will be in accordance with the strictest 
standard applicable for the study site as determined by local l aws, regulations or institutional 
requirements. At a minimum, records will be maintained for 25 y ears. If the Investigator 
withdraws from the study (e. g. , relocation, retirement) all s tudy-related records should be 
transferred, in a written agreement with Indivior, to a mutuall y agreed upon designee within 
Indivior-specified timeframe.

 CRFs with source documents. The Investigator agrees to particip ate with audits conducted at a 
reasonable time in a reasonable manner. Full consultation with the Investigator will be made 
prior to and during such an audit, which will be conducted acco rding to Indivior's or a Contract 
Research Organization's QA SOPs. In addition, this study is sub ject to inspections by Regulatory 
Authorities. If such a regulatory inspection occurs, the Invest igator agrees to allow the regulatory 
inspector direct access to all relevant study documents. The In vestigator must contact Indivior 
immediately if this occurs and must fully cooperate with the in spection conducted at a reasonable 
time in a reasonable manner.

 17 AMENDMENTS 
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immedia te risk to study subjects, may be 
made only by Indivior. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to 
subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB is no tified within 5 days. 
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a proto col amendment. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the IRB and the Investigator mus t await approval before 
implementing the changes. Indivior or designated representative  will submit protocol 
amendments to the appropriate Regulatory Authorities for approv al. 
If in the judgment of the IRB, the Investigator and/or Indivior , the amendment to the protocol 
substantially changes the study design and/or increases the pot ential risk to the subject and/or has 
an impact on the subject's involvement as a study subject, the currently approved written ICF 
will require similar modification. In such cases, informed cons ent will be renewed for subjects 
enrolled in the study before continued participation, based on IRB determination.

22.3 APPENDIX 3 – Liver Safety 
 
The following should occur if a subject meets any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria as 
outlined in Section 6.4  of the protocol: 
x Subject should immediately be withdrawn from treatment. Do not re-challenge with study 
treatment. 
x Notify the Indivior Medical Monitor or specified designee withi n 24 hours of learning of 
the abnormality. 
x Completed the “Safety Follow -up Procedures” listed below.  
x Upon completion of the safety follow-up, the subject must be wi thdrawn from the study 
unless further follow-up is required. 
Subjects with ALT 3x ULN and bilirubin 2x ULN (>35% direct); or ALT 3x ULN and 
INR >1. 5: 
This event is an SAE  and should be reported using the SAE Reporting Form ( Section 11 ). 
Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed, if testing i s available. If fractionation is 
unavailable, urinary bilirubin is to be measured via dipstick ( a measurement of direct bilirubin, 
which would suggest liver injury). 
Make every reasonable attempt to have the subject return to the  clinic within 24 hours for repeat 
liver chemistries, additional testing and close monitoring (wit h specialist or hepatology 
consultation recommended). 
Monitor the subject twice weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline valu es. 
Subjects with ALT 5x ULN or ALT 3x ULN who have hepatitis symptoms or rash, 
cannot be monitored for 4 weeks or have elevations that persist 4 weeks:  
x Make every reasonable attempt to have the subject return to the  clinic within 24-72 
hours for repeat liver chemistries and additional testing. 
x Monitor subject weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkal ine phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline valu es. 
Subjects with ALT 3x ULN and <5x ULN and bilirubin <2x ULN, who do not exhibit 
hepatitis symptoms or rash:

 x Contact the Indivior Medical Monitor within 24 hours of learnin g of the abnormality to 
discuss subject safety. 
x Subject may continue study treatment, if liver chemistries (ALT , AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) can be monitored weekly for up to 4 wee ks. 
x If the subject later meets the liver chemistry stopping criteri a (outlined in  
Section 6.5  of the protocol), immediately withdraw study treatment, perfor m additional 
testing and continue safety follow-up until liver chemistries r esolve, stabilize or return to 
baseline values. 
x After 4 weeks of monitoring, if ALT <3x ULN and bilirubin <2x U LN, subject must be 
monitored twice monthly until liver chemistries normalize or re turn to within baseline 
values. 
Additional follow-up procedures for subjects who meet any of th e stopping criteria: 
x Viral hepatitis serology including: 
x Hepatitis A Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, 
x HBsAg and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM), 
x Hepatitis C RNA, 
x Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, 
x Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailab le, obtain 
heterophile antibody or monospot testing), and 
x Hepatitis E IgM antibody. 
x Blood sample for PK analysis, obtained within 48 hours of last dose. 
x Serum creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase. 
x Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin 2x ULN. 
x Assess eosinophilia. 
x Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepa titis (fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, feve r, rash or 
eosinophilia) as relevant on the AE eCRF. 
x Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal re medies, other 
over-the-counter medications or putative hepatotoxins on the Co ncomitant 
Medications eCRF.

 x Record alcohol use in the eCRF. 
x In addition, the following are required for  subjects with ALT 3x ULN and 
bilirubin 2x ULN (<35% direct) but optional for other abnormal liver 
chemistries : 
x Anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, Type 1 anti -liver 
kidney microsomal antibodies and quantitative total immunoglobu lin G 
(IgG or gamma globulins). 
x Serum acetaminophen adduct High-Performance Liquid Chromatograp hy 
(HPLC) assay (quantifies potential acetaminophen contribution t o livery 
injury in subjects with definite or likely acetaminophen use in  the 
preceding week [  
x James  2009 ]). 
x Liver imaging (ultrasound, MRI, or CT) to evaluate liver diseas e. Data 
should be entered into the eCRF, if these tests are performed.

 FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not estab lish legally enforceable 
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA’s current thi nking on a topic and should be 
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or s tatutory requirements are cited. 
The use of the word should in FDA’s guidances means that something is suggested or 
recommended, but not required. 
 
II. BACKGROUND 
Standardized toxicity assessment scales have been widely used t o evaluate products treating 
specific disease s. For example, the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity  Criteria Scale 
and the Division of AIDS’ Toxicity Grading Scale standardize th e evaluation of adverse events 
among patients with cancer and HIV/AIDS, respectively (Refs. 1,  2). The defined toxicity 
parameters in those scales are designed for patients who may al ready experience mild, moderate, 
or severe adverse clinical or laboratory events due to the dise ase process, and may not be 
appropriate for healthy volunteers. 
In the development of the toxicity grading scales for healthy v olunteers, we chose parameter 
limit values based on published information, when such values w ere available (Refs. 1-6). For 
example, the Brighton Collaboration has developed case definiti ons and guidelines to evaluate 
some adverse events associated with administering vaccines (Ref . 3). In some cases, parameter 
limit values were based on clinical experience and experience r eviewing vaccine clinical trials 
that enroll normal healthy subjects. 
Toxicity grading scales for laboratory abnormalities should con sider the local laboratory 
reference values when the parameter limit values are defined. T he characterization of laboratory 
parameters among some populations of healthy adults and adolesc ents may require the exercise 
of clinical judgment, for example, consideration of the potenti al for ethnic differences in white 
blood cell (WBC) counts or gender differences in creatine phosp hokinase (CPK) values. 
III. TOXICITY GRADING SCALE TABLES 
Adverse events in a clinical trial of an investigational vaccin e must be recorded and monitored 
and, when appropriate, reported to FDA and others involved in a n investigation (sponsors, IRBs, 
and investigators). (See, for example, 21 CFR 312.32, 312.33, 3 12.50, 312.55, 312.56, 312.60, 
312.62, 312.64, 312.66). Although the use of a toxicity grading  scale for adverse events would 
not replace these regulatory requirements, using a scale to cat egorize adverse events observed 
during a clinical trial may assist you in monitoring safety and  making required reports. 
Nonetheless, we believe that categorization or grading of data as outlined in this document is 
supplementary to and should not replace full and complete data analysis. 
These guidelines for toxicity grading scales are primarily inte nded for healthy adult and 
adolescent volunteers. The parameters in the tables below are n ot necessarily applicable to every 
clinical trial of healthy volunteers. The parameters monitored should be appropriate for the 
specific study vaccine. For some preventive vaccines under deve lopment, it may be appropriate 
INDV-2000 Indivior 
Clinical Study Protocol: INDV-2000-101 10 December 2020 
  
 
Confidential Page 84 of 89 
  
 to include additional parameters to be monitored during a clini cal trial or to alter the choice of 
values in the toxicity table. For example, additional parameter s might be added based on one or 
more of the following: safety signals observed in pre-clinical toxicology studies, the biological 
plausibility of the occurrence of certain adverse events, or pr evious experience with a similar 
licensed product. 
As discussed above, the tables do not represent a recommendatio n to monitor all the listed 
parameters in all clinical trials of healthy volunteers, nor do  the tables represent all possible 
parameters to be monitored. In addition, these tables do not re present study inclusion or 
exclusion criteria. We recommend that the parameters monitored be appropriate for the study 
vaccine administered to healthy volunteers participating in the  clinical trial.

Sponsor Signatories  Updated sponsor signatory  Change in internal responsibilities  
1.1 Synopsis  
4.1 Overall Design  Relocated text about double -blind 
design to clarify descriptions specific to 
SAD and MAD design, due to 
inclusion of food effect evaluation in 
Part A (for which IMP assignment is 
not blinded).  Moved to descriptions specific to 
SAD and MAD design, due to 
inclusion of food effect evaluation in 
Part A (for which IMP assignment is 
not blinded)  
1.1 Synopsis  
 
4.1.1  Single Ascending Dose 
and Food Effect  - Part A  Added descriptions on Part A design 
aspects regarding SAD evaluation for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 and food effect 
evaluation for Cohort 3  Previous protocol version noted that 
additional dose levels or food effect 
would be explored in Cohort 3. 
Based on outcome of SAD 
evaluation (Part A Cohorts 1 and 2), 
Cohort 3 will be used for evaluation 
of food effect only . 
1.1 Synopsis  
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessmen t 
4.1 Overall Design  
4.1.2 Multiple Ascending 
Dose  - Part B  Revised text regarding sequential 
conduct of Parts A and B  Dose escalation was completed in 
Part A SAD evaluation (Cohorts 1 
and 2), enabling determination of 
dosing paradigm for Part B MAD 
evalua tion and rescheduling of food 
effect evaluation in Part A 
(Cohort  3) to allow overlap with Part 
B conduct

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  
Sponsor Name : Cerevel Therapeutics, LLC  
Name of Investigational Medicinal Product : CVL -354 
Protocol Title: A Phase 1, Double -blind (Investigator and Participant), First -in-Human Trial to 
Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Ascending Doses 
of CVL -354 in Healthy Participants  
Short Title: A Single and Multiple Ascending Dose Trial of CVL -354 in Healthy Participants  
IND Number : 155,364  
Trial Phase : 1 
Treatment/Indication : Major depressive disorder  
Rationale: Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activation is implicated in reduced activity of the 
reward (mesol imbic) pathway. Recent evidence suggests that selective antagonism of KORs may 
provide therapeutic benefit in treating major depressive disorder (MDD). CVL -354 is a 
brain -penetrant, potent KOR antagonist with  pharmacological selectivity over mu 
opioid receptors (MORs) that is being developed for treatment of MDD. Nonclinical data 
generated to date support development of CVL -354 for treatment of MDD.  
The aim of this 2 -part, first -in-human trial is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and

Overall Design:  
This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo -controlled, single -center trial that will be conducted in 
2 parts to evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK of CVL -354 following single and multiple doses 
in healthy participants.  
Part B of the trial will start after completion of single dose escalation in Part  A (Cohorts 1 and 2). 
The evaluation of food effect for Part A (Cohort 3) may be conducted in parall el with Part B, 
using a CVL -354 dose of 50 mg. Single doses of CVL -354 up to 200 mg are considered to be 
safe and well tolerated based on review of data from Part A Cohorts 1 and 2.  
Part A (Single Ascending Dose and Food Effect)  
Dose escalation will proce ed according to a double -blind (investigator and participant), 4 -period 
crossover, single ascending dose methodology. Up to 2  cohorts of participants will be evaluated . 
  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 21 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
Dose -escalation decisions for Part A and Part B will be made by the SRT, comprising sponsor 
personnel (or designee/supporting personnel) and site investigator or physician designee.  
If a participant discontinues before completing all perio ds within a cohort or withdraws for 
reasons unrelated to the safety of the IMP, the participant may be replaced at the investigator’s 
and sponsor’s discretion. In Part A, if a participant discontinues from the trial, the replacement 
participant will comple te the rest of original treatment sequence of discontinued participant.  
Disclosure Statement:  This is a 2 -part single dose (4 -way crossover, Part A ascending dose;) 
and multiple ascending dose (Part B) trial that is blinded to the investigator and particip ants. The 
food effect evaluation in Part A is an open -label, 2 -way crossover design.  
Number of Participants:  
• Part A (SAD, food effect): 8 participants per cohort for a total of approximately 
16 participants if 2 cohorts complete single ascending dose eval uation. The food 
effect cohort will comprise approximately 8 participants, for a total of approximately 
24 participants in Part A.  
• Part B (MAD): 10 participants per cohort (8 CVL -354, 2 placebo) for a total of 
approximately 50 participants if 5 cohorts com plete . 
In the event of higher than anticipated early terminations due to coronavirus disease -2019 
(COVID -19) or other reasons, Cerevel may extend enrollment in order to achieve trial 
objectives.  
Key Entry Criteria:  
• Healthy women of nonchildbearing potential and men, ages 18 to 55 years, inclusive  
Intervention Groups, Trial Treatment, and Duration:  
Part A (SAD, food effect) – In Cohorts 1 and 2, all participants will receive treatment with up to 
3 single oral doses of CVL -354 and/or 1 single oral dos e of placebo in a 4 -period crossover 
design. The starting dose of CVL -354 will be 0.5 mg. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 
treatment sequences for Cohorts 1 and 2.  
Cohort 3 will be used to evaluate food effect, with participants randomized to a t reatment 
sequence (fed/fasted or fasted/fed).  
Total trial duration per participant during dose escalation will be approximately up to 100 days 
and include the following: a 4 -week Screening Period, a Treatment Period (in -clinic) comprising 
up to 4 periods of 3 days each, at least 5 days washout between doses, and a follow -up contact 
14 days after the final dose of IMP.  
For the food effect evaluation, total trial duration per participant will be approximately 50 days 
and include the following: a 4 -week Scree ning Period, a Treatment Period (in -clinic) comprising 
2 periods of 3  days each, a 2 -day washout between periods, and a follow -up contact 14 days after 
the final dose of IMP.  
Part B (MAD) – All participants will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive trea tment with 
multiple oral doses of CVL -354 (dose and regimen to be determined) or placebo. Total trial 
duration per participant will be approximately  up to 58 days and include the following: a 4 -week 
  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 22 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
Screening Period, a Treatment Period (in -clinic) of up to  14 days, follow -up (in clinic) for 3 
days, and a follow -up contact 14 days after the final dose of IMP.  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Estimation :  
The sample size is not based on statistical hypothesis testing. Based on historical precedent, it is 
expected that the proposed sample sizes of 8 participants per cohort in Part A (SAD, food effect) 
and 10  participants per cohort in Part B (MAD) will address the overall aim of the trial.  
In the event of higher than anticipated early terminations due to COVID -19 or other factors, 
Cerevel may extend enrollment in order to achieve trial objectives.  
Statistical Methods :  
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this trial. All available 
data for randomized participants will be liste d by participant. Separate analyses will be 
performed for each part of the trial (Part A SAD, Part A food effect, Part B MAD).  
All PK exposure parameters (eg, C max, AUC) will be summarized by dose, where applicable, 
using descriptive statistics including the arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient 
of variation, minimum and maximum values, Q1, Q3, and geometric mean.  
For food effect assessment, the single dose of CVL -354 administered in fasted state is the 
reference treatment and the single dose of CVL -354 administered in fed state is the test 
treatment.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events , including AEs potentially related to abuse, will be coded 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and  summarized by treatment, 
system organ class, and preferred term. Further summaries will be done by seriousness, severity , 
relationship to IMP , and dose at the time of onset . Other safety endpoin ts will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics by treatment and timepoint, including vital sign measurements, ECG, 
clinical laboratory assessments and suicidality monitored during the trial using Columbia -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale.

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Trial Rationale  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating and chronic illness characterized by a broad 
spectrum of emotional and physical symptoms. Despite the availability of numerous treatments 
(eg, pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy), 
approximately 30% of patients remain untreated, only 40% to 70% of pa tients respond to their 
treatment, and 10% to 30% of patients are treatment -resistant ( Jaffe et al, 2019 ; Hasin et al, 
2018 ; Khan and Brown, 2015 ; Al-Harbi, 2012 ). In treatment -responsive patients, high rates of 
relapse and recurrence have been reported ( Bai et al, 2020 ; Rush et al, 2006 ). Moreover, 
remission rates are low (approximately ≤50%) across clinical trials evaluating antidepressants 
(Oluboka et al, 2018 ; Machado et al, 2006 ; Thase et al, 2005 ) and partial response is common 
(Trivedi et al, 2006 ). Incomplete (inadequate) response to treatment for MDD is associated with 
an increased risk of relapse ( Mulder et al, 2009 ; Möller, 2008 ), impaired social and occupational 
functioning ( Jaffe et al, 2019 ; Judd et al, 2002 ) and consequently, an increased economic burden 
(Gauthier et al, 2019 ; Jaffe  et al, 2019 ; Sobocki et al, 2006 ; McIntyre and O'Donovan, 2004 ). 
Thus, novel antidepressant therapies that can achieve consistent and more favorable short - and 
long-term outcomes represent an unmet medical need in patients with MDD.  
Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activation is implicated in reduced activity of the reward 
(mesolimbic) pathway, negative mood states, and dysphoria. Recent evidence suggests that 
selective antagonism of KORs may provid e therapeutic benefit in treating MDD ( Jacobson et al, 
2020a ). CVL -354 is a brain -penetrant potent KOR antagonist with >10 -fold pharmacological 
selectivity over mu opioid receptors (MORs), which is being developed for treat ment of MDD. 
Nonclinical pharmacology and safety data generated to date support CVL -354 for treatment of 
MDD.  
The aim of this 2 -part, first -in-human trial is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of CVL -354, following single as cending dose (SAD) and multiple 
ascending dose (MAD) oral administration in healthy participants.  
2.2. Background  
A growing body of data suggests that antagonism of KORs is a promising approach to 
addressing mood disorders ( Carle zon and Krystal, 2016 ). KORs are highly expressed in brain 
regions associated with anhedonia, depression (nucleus accumbens) and anxiety (amygdala) 
(Cahill et al, 2014 ; Naganawa et al, 2016 ). As  regulators of key circuits involved in reward and 
mood, KORs present a unique therapeutic target to intervene in MDD ( Jacobson et al, 2020a ). 
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of KORs results in 1) reduced 
dopaminergic tone in the nucleus accumbens and 2) induction of negative mood states ( Carlezon 
et al, 2006 ). In humans, KOR agonism led to dose -dependent dysphoric and psychotomimetic 
effects ( Pfeiffer et al, 1986 ).  
KOR antagonism is a well -known target for treatment of MDD and there have been efforts at 
development of therapeutic agents for this mechanism of action. In an example of polypharmacy

4. TRIAL DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design  
This is a Phase 1 , randomized, placebo -controlled, single -center trial that will be conducted in 
2 parts to evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK of CVL -354 following single and multiple doses 
in healthy participants. The single ascending dos e and food effect portion (Part A) are described 
in Section  4.1.1  and the multiple ascending dose portion (Part B) is described in Section  4.1.2 .  
Part B of the trial will start after completion of single dose escalation in Part  A (Cohorts 1 and 2). 
The evaluation of food effect for Part A (Cohort 3)  may be conducted in parallel with Part B, 
using a CVL -354 dose of 50 mg. Single doses of CVL -354 up to 200 mg are considered to be 
safe and well tolerated based on review of data from Part A Cohorts 1 and 2.

4.1.1.  Single Ascending Dose and Food Effect - Part A  
4.1.1.1.  Single Ascending Dose (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
Dose escalation will proceed according to a double -blind (investigator and participant), 4 -period 
crossover, single ascending dose methodology. Up to 2  cohorts of participants will be evaluated.  
Cohorts 1 and 2 will b e dosed in a sequential manner for up to 4 periods each (see schema in 
Section  1.2). Progression to each dose level will occur following evaluation of all available 
cumulative safety, tolerability, PK, and other emergent data from the previous cohorts and 
periods.  
The current trial may evaluate up to 8 different dose levels in Cohorts 1 and 2; however, some 
doses may be repeated, if required. The starting dose for Pa rt A will be 0.5  mg. Doses, in 
general, will be escalated in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 until the maximum tolerated dose is achieved 
or the CVL -354 exposures (C max and AUC 24) reach, or are projected to reach, the predefined 
human exposure limits  
 Dose escalation may also be stopped if it is determined that sufficient 
exposures are achieved, based on estimated target occupancy. The proposed doses in Part A for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 ar e presented in Table  8. Based on emergent data, the actual doses may change 
(from those presented in Table  8); however, new doses will not exceed half -log increments 
(3.3-fold) from previous dose. Smaller increments (eg, ≤2 -fold) will be evaluated as exposures 
approach the proposed stopping criteria. All d osing decisions will be made jointly by the sponsor 
and the investigator after review of all available safety, tolerability (through 72 hours postdose), 
and PK data (through 24 hours postdose) at an SRT meeting.  
Actual doses administered to Cohorts 1 and 2  at the time of the protocol amendment 
(Version  3.0) are provided in Section  2.2.5 .

Doses/treatment may be modified based on emergent safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data.  
Doses may be repeated to confirm safety/tolerability.  
During dose escalation, Cohorts 1 and 2 will employ sentinel dosing (n=2; 1 CVL -354 and 
1 placebo) during each period to ensure safety and tolerability before proceeding to dosing of 
non-sentinel participants for that period. The investigator will review AEs (serious and

nonserious) and all available safety data from the first 24 hours after dosing for the 2 sentinel 
participants. If clinically significant safety concerns are observed in sentinel participants, dosing 
of the rest of the cohort will be paused  in order for the SRT to discuss the findings and determine 
subsequent actions. If no safety concerns are observed in the sentinel participants, the 
investigator will provide written documentation for sponsor confirmation before proceeding to 
dosing of non -sentinel participants.  
Check -in assessments conducted on Day -1 of each period will include both sentinel and 
non-sentinel participants. No additional check -in assessments will be required for non -sentinel 
participants prior to dosing if the Check -in ass essments are performed within 48 hours prior to 
dosing.  
Each dosing period for the dose escalation portion of Part A will be separated  by a washout 
period of at least 5 days (ie, administration of subsequent doses of investigational medicinal 
product [IMP]  will not occur until at least 5 days after the previous dose of IMP).  
Cohorts 1 and 2 will comprise approximately 8 participants each (3:1 ratio of CVL -354 to 
placebo within each treatment period). All participants will receive single oral doses of CVL -354 
or placebo during each period. All doses during dose escalation will be administered under fasted 
conditions following a 10 -hour overnight fast. Participants will continue to fast for 4 hours 
following dosing on Day 1.  
4.1.1.2.  Food Effect Evaluation (Cohort 3)  
Cohort 3 will be scheduled after completion of single dose escalation to evaluate the effect of 
food on CVL -354 exposures after a single 50 mg dose. The selected dose is 4 -fold lower than the 
top single CVL -354 200 mg dose that is considered to be safe and  tolerated. For evaluation of 
food effect, a 2 -period crossover design will be utilized, with approximately 8 participants 
randomized to 1 of 2 sequences (fed/fasted or fasted/fed). Details of fasted and fed conditions are 
provided in Section  5.3.1 . Sentinel dosing will not be employed for evaluation of food effect.  
Participants will remain domiciled after Check -in for both periods of the food effect eva luation. 
The duration of each period will be 3 days, with a 2 -day washout between Period 1 and Period 2.  
4.1.2.  Multiple Ascending Dose - Part B  
The safety and PK of double -blind (investigator and participant), multiple -dose administration of 
CVL -354 will be eva luated in Part  B of the trial after completion of dose escalation in Part A. 
Part B may overlap with Part A Cohort 3 (evaluation of food effect on CVL -354 exposures).  
A schematic of the trial design is provided in Section  1.2.  
Up to 5 sequential cohorts of 10 participants each will be evaluated in Part B. Participants will 
receive oral doses of either CVL -354 or placebo for up to 14 days. Eligible part icipants will be 
admitted to the clinic on Day -1 and will be randomized in  a 4:1 ratio (8 participants active 
treatment: 2 participants placebo). Cohorts will be initiated in a sequential manner after review 
of all available safety, tolerability, and PK d ata (at least up to Day 15) from previous cohorts.  
Each dose of CVL -354 will be administered once daily (QD) throughout Part B of the trial based 
on data obtained during Part A of the trial.

5.3. Lifestyle Considerations  
5.3.1.  Meals and Dietary Restrictions  
Participants are required to abstain from consumption of caffeine -containin g foods or caffeinated 
beverages (eg, coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks), grapefruit -containing foods or beverages, and 
Seville orange -containing foods or beverages  from 7 days prior to Day -1 through Check -out 
from the clinic for each treatment period.  
On days with intensive ECGs (extractions by central ECG service) and PK collection (Day 1 in 
Part A, Days 1 and 14 in Part B), participants will fast for at least 10 hours prior to dosing and 
remain fasting for the first 4 hours following dosing with a small  snack given right after the 
4-hour time point and lunch right after the 6 -hour time point. Participants must abstain from all 
food and drink (except water) for at least 4 hours prior to any safety laboratory evaluations. 
Water is permitted until 1 hour pr ior to IMP administration and can be consumed ad libitum after 
dosing.  
Meals consist of a light breakfast (~0700 hours, 1 hour prior to dosing), lunch (~1200  hours, 
4 hours after dosing), and dinner (~1800 hours), and an evening snack (~2130 hours).  
The following guidelines apply for dosing under “fed” conditions during food effect evaluation:  
• Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, participants should start breakfast 
approximately 25 minutes prior to administration of IMP.  
• The entire breakfast will be consumed approximately over a 20 -minute period with 
the IMP administered within approximately 5 minutes of completion of the meal. 
Actual start and stop times for breakfast and IMP administration time will be 
recorded.  
  
Protocol CVL -354-1001

Confidential  Page 54 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
• There ar e no water restrictions prior to dosing for participants dosed under fed 
conditions. The IMP should be administered with 240 mL of ambient temperature 
water.  
• No water is permitted for at least 2 hours postdose. No food will be allowed for at 
least 4 hours postdose.  
• The breakfast will be a high calorie/high fat meal (approximately 150, 250, and 
500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively)  consisting of 
2 eggs fried in butter, 2 strips of bacon or 50 g of meat or sausage, 2 slices of toast 
with butter, 4 ounces of hash brown potatoes, and 8 ounces of whole milk.  
5.3.2.  Alcohol and Tobacco Restrictions  
Participants will abstain from alcohol for at  least 24 hours prior to each admission to the clinic 
until each Check -out. Participants may undergo an alcohol breath test or blood/urine alcohol test 
at the discretion of the investigator.  
Use of tobacco or nicotine -containing products (cigarettes [incl uding e -cigarettes], cigars, 
chewing tobacco, snuff, etc) is prohibited within 28 days prior to signing the informed consent 
form (ICF) and during the trial. Vaping is not permitted during the trial.  
5.3.3.  Activity  
Participants will abstain from strenuous exerci se for 48 hours before each blood collection for 
clinical laboratory tests. Participants may participate in light recreational activities during the 
trial (eg, walking, watching television, reading).  
5.3.4.  Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machinery  
The effect  of CVL -354 on the ability to drive and use machines has not been systematically 
evaluated.  
5.4. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are 
not subsequently randomized to trial treatment . A minimal set of screen failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. M inimal information includes demography, screen failure details, and eligibility 
criteria.  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) at screening 
may be rescreened once at the discretion of the investigator an d after consultation with the 
sponsor unless screen failure is due to a positive urine drug screen for illicit substances. 
Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant number.

6.2. Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability  
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit (original shipment and/or moving of IMP supply from 1 office or 
facility to another within the site’s network) for all IMP received and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the IMP.  
CVL -354 and placebo oral dosing solution will be prepared by site staff and details of the dose 
preparation requirements  will be provided by Cerevel in a separate extemporaneous dispensing 
record. Prepared doses will be provided in unit dose containers and labeled in accordance with 
appropriate regulations and the investigator’s site labeling requirements.  
Only participants  enrolled in the trial may receive IMP and only authorized site staff may supply 
or administer IMP. All IMP must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and 
monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions w ith 
access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  
The investigator is responsible for IMP accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
Further guidance and information for the preparation, handling, storage, accountability, and 
disposition of IMP are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
6.3.1.  Participant Assignment to Treatment  
Treatment assign ments will be based on a computer -generated randomization code provided by 
the sponsor or designee.  
For the food effect evaluation (Part A, Cohort 3), participants will receive the same 50 mg dose 
and will be randomized to a treatment sequence (fed/fasted  or fasted/fed).  
Participants who discontinue may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor and investigator. If 
a participant is replaced, he or she will receive a mirror randomization number (such that the 
same sequence [Part A, Cohorts 1 and 2] or t reatment [Part B] assigned to the original 
discontinued participant would be assigned  to the replacement participant). Participants who 
discontinue during Part A (SAD portion) of the trial may be replaced; however, the replacement 
participant will only nee d to complete the trial periods that were not completed by the original 
participant.  
Further instructions on replacement participants are available in the Operations Manual.  
6.3.2.  Blinding  
During the entire trial, treatment will be blinded such that participan ts and the investigator and 
other site personnel (with the exception of pharmacy staff) will not have knowledge of the 
treatment assignment at any visit.  
Treatment assignment will not be blinded for the food effect portion of the trial.   
  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 57 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
At the initiation  of the trial, investigators and site personnel will be instructed on the method for 
breaking the blind. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for 
determining if unblinding of the treatment assignment for an individual parti cipant is warranted. 
Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the 
investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to 
contact the sponsor before unblinding a pa rticipant’s treatment assignment unless this could 
delay emergency treatment of the participant. The sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after 
breaking the blind for a trial participant.  
Documentation of unblinding should be recorded in the participa nt’s medical record, including 
the reason for breaking the blind, the date and time the blind was broken, and the names of the 
personnel involved. Once the blind is broken for a participant, treatment with the IMP may not 
be reinitiated for that participan t. 
A list of sponsor personnel who will be unblinded to treatment allocation for the purposes of 
dose escalation and safety monitoring (SRT) will be provided in a separate document.  
6.4. Trial Treatment Compliance  
The time and dose of each IMP administration, a long with information on any missed or 
inappropriately administered dose, will be recorded in source documents and the eCRF. 
Compliance will be ensured by a hand and mouth check during the oral dosing administration.  
6.5. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All pres cription and over -the-counter medications are prohibited from 28 days prior to first dose 
of IMP through the end of the trial (as defined Section  4.5) with the exception of acetaminophen 
(maximum total daily dose of 1 g) and topical steroid use as needed for treatment of an AE. Use 
of herbal medications, vitamins, and supplements is also pr ohibited during the trial.  
The investigator will record all medications and therapies taken by the participant for treatment 
of an AE until the end of the trial. The following information will be recorded in the eCRF: 
medication, indication, dose, frequenc y, route, start date, and end date.  
The medical monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy.  
6.6. Dose Modification  
Guidance for dose escalation/stopping rules is provided in Section  4.4. 
The decision to proceed to the next dose level of CVL -354 in successive cohorts/periods will be 
made by the SRT based on a full review of the safety, tolerability, and pre liminary PK data 
obtained from the completed prior doses.  
If ongoing data surveillance during the treatment interval reveals consistent notable AEs or 
safety concerns at a dose, which are determined to be attributable to the drug treatment, 
continued dosin g within the cohort will be temporarily halted and no participants will be dosed 
until full safety review can take place to determine if dose modification or termination of the 
cohort are appropriate.

6.7. Intervention after the End of the Trial  
There will be n o provision of CVL -354 for participants after they complete or discontinue 
treatment in this trial.  
7. DISCONTINUATION OF T RIAL TREATMENT AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of Trial Treatment  
After treatment assignment, a participant may stop treatment permanently for a variety of 
reasons. Treatment discontinuations may be initiated by a participant or may become medically 
necessary due to AEs, required treatment with a disallowed medication or therapy, or other 
issues, as determined b y the investigator. If IMP is permanently discontinued, the participant will 
be encouraged to remain in the trial for the evaluations at safety follow -up. See the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of IMP and 
follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
The IMP may be discontinued for any of the following reasons listed b elow:  
• Adverse event  
• Protocol deviation  
• Noncompliance with study schedule  
• Withdrawal by participant  
• Physician decision  
If a participant discontinues the IMP due to an AE, the investigator or other trial personnel will 
make every effort to follow the event u ntil it has resolved or stabilized.  
7.2. Discontinuation of Trial  
7.2.1.  Discontinuation of Entire Trial  
If the sponsor terminates or suspends the trial for any reason, prompt notification will be given to 
investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and regulatory authorities in accordance with 
regulatory requirements.  
7.2.2.  Discontinuation of Individual Site  
Trial site participation may be discontinued by the sponsor, the investigator, or the IRB if judged 
to be necessary for medical, safety, regulatory, ethic al, or other reasons consistent with 
applicable laws, regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The investigator will notify the 
sponsor promptly if the trial is terminated by the investigator or the IRB at the site.

7.2.3.  Individual Participant Discontinua tion From the Trial  
All participants have the right to withdraw their consent from further participation in the trial at 
any time without prejudice. Participants cannot withdraw consent for use of data already 
collected as part of the trial, but only for future participation. The investigator can also 
discontinue a participant’s participation in the trial at any time if medically necessary.  
At the time of discontinuing from the trial, if possible, an early termination visit should be 
conducted. See the Sc hedule of Assessments ( Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of 
trial discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the IMP and from the trial at that 
time.  
Complete withdrawal of consent requires a participant’s refusal of ALL of the following 
methods of follow -up: 
• Participation in all fol low-up procedures specified in the protocol (whether in -clinic, 
by telephone, or by an in -home visit).  
• Participation in a subset of protocol -specified follow -up procedures (by a frequency 
schedule and method, as agreed by participant and staff).  
• Contact of  the participant by trial personnel, even if only by telephone, to assess 
current medical condition, and obtain necessary medical or laboratory reports relevant 
to the trial’s objectives.  
• Contact of alternative person(s) who have been designated in source records as being 
available to discuss the participant’s medical condition, even if only by telephone, 
mail, or e -mail (eg, family, spouse, partner, legal representative, friend, neighbor, or 
physician).  
• Access to medical information from alternative source s (eg, hospital/clinic medical 
records, referring doctor’s notes, public records, dialysis, transplantation or vital 
registries, social media sources).  
Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and, therefore, should be approached with the same 
degre e of importance and care as is used in initially obtaining informed consent. The reasons for 
a participant’s intended withdrawal need to be completely understood, documented, and 
managed to protect the rights of the participant and the integrity of the tri al. A participant may, 
however, indicate that further trial participation is creating a burden on their work, school, or 
social schedule. Therefore, the investigator should determine if the participant can continue 
participation in the trial if modificatio ns to his/her treatment and/or schedule of assessments can 
be accommodated. Only participants who withdraw their permission for all of the above methods 
of follow -up are considered to have completely withdrawn their consent to participate in the trial.  
7.3. Procedures to Encourage Continued Trial Participation  
In all cases of impending consent withdrawal, investigators will be instructed to meet and discuss 
(without undue coercion) with the participant their options of continuing in the trial. The

8.3.2.  Physical/Neurological Examinations  
The full physical examination will include a review of the following body systems: head, ears, 
eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, and 
musculoskeletal systems.  
The limited physical examinations will include evaluation of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and 
gastrointestinal systems.  
A full neurological examination will include an assessment of the participant’s mental status 
(level of consciousness, orientation, speech, memory, etc), cranial nerves, motor (muscle 
appearance, tone, strength and reflexes), sensation (including Romberg sign), coordination, and 
gait. 
The investigator (or designee ) is responsible for performing the physical and neurological 
examinations. If the appointed designee is to perform these examinations, he or she must be 
permitted by local regulations and his or her name must be included on the delegation of 
authority log . Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all physical and 
neurological examinations.  
Any condition present at the post -treatment physical and neurological examinations that was not 
present at the baseline examination should be documented as  an AE and followed to a 
satisfactory conclusion.  
8.3.3.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body 
temperature. Supine blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be obtained aft er at least 
3 minutes of rest.  
At specified time points (see Schedule of Assessments [ Section  1.3]), the supine measurements 
will be followed by measu rements in the standing position (after standing for at least 3 minutes) 
to allow for orthostatic assessments. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease of 
≥20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure upon standing compared with the supine blood pressure 
measurement (at Screening, relative to the average measurement).  
Any clinically relevant changes occurring during the trial will be recorded  in the AE section of 
the eCRF.  
Further details on taking vital sign measurements are provided in the appropriate trial  specific 
manuals.  
8.3.4.  Electrocardiograms  
This section describes the procedures for continuous ECG recordings and standard 12 -lead 
ECGs.  
8.3.4.1.  Continuous Electrocardiogram Recordings  
During the SAD portion of the trial (Part A), a one -time baseline report of contin uous ECG 
telemetry will be recorded for each participant by the site for a minimum of 12  hours starting on 
Day -1 prior to first dose. This baseline report will also be required for any replacement 

  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 63 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
participants during Part A. The investigator is required t o review the baseline telemetry report 
prior to randomizing each participant.  
During the SAD and MAD portions of the trial, continuous ECGs will be recorded for a 
minimum of 26 hours, starting at least 2 hours predose and continuing until 24 hours postdose  on 
the days indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  1.3). Electrocardiograms will be 
extracted from the continuous recording by a central EC G service (note: these data are not 
required for dose escalation decision -making). Participants should be resting quietly in a supine 
position for at least 10 minutes before the nominal ECG extraction time points and 5 minutes 
after each extraction time po int without any significant environmental distractions (noise, loud 
music, TV, computer or phone use, etc). Holter leads will be checked for proper connectivity 
prior to each time point.  
Procedures to limit the sources of electrocardiographic variability w ill be used throughout the 
trial and will include the following: staff training to ensure proper recording technique, 
standardized lead placement including ink marks on the skin to allow for exact duplication of 
lead position, shaving lead placement sites prior to lead placement and controlling the timing of 
ECG assessments relative to phlebotomy, sleep, activity, and meals.  
Instructions regarding the collection and transfer of continuous ECG data are detailed in a 
separate manual.  
8.3.4.2.  Standard 12 -Lead Electro cardiograms  
Electrocardiogram recordings will be obtained after the participant has been supine and at rest 
for approximately 3 minutes. Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be obtained at the investigator’s 
discretion and should always be obtained in the event of an early termination. The ECG results 
will be evaluated at the investigational site to determine the participant’s eligibility, to monitor 
safety during the trial and dose escalation decisions. The principal investigator (or qualified 
designee) will review , sign, and date each ECG reading, noting whether or not any abnormal 
results are of clinical significance. The ECG will be repeated if any results are considered to be 
clinically significant. Any clinically relevant changes occurring during the trial will  be recorded 
in the AE section of the eCRF. Additional guidance on collection of ECGs will be provided in 
the Operations Manual.  
At Screening, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs are required to assess participant eligibility. A triplicate 
set of ECGs is 3 consecutive  ECGs collected 1 to 2 minutes apart over a 5 -minute period. If, 
during screening, according to the investigator’s judgment, any abnormal ECG finding is deemed 
medically significant (impacting the safety of the participant or the interpretation of the tria l 
results) or meets an exclusion criterion (see Section  5.2), the participant should be excluded from 
the trial. The central ECG service will provide the QTcF corrections and average of the 3 ECGs 
performed.  
At all other specified time points in the Sc hedule of Assessments ( Section  1.3) where an ECG 
recording must be performed, only a single ECG is required.  
Exclusion criteria for screening do not apply as mandatory discontinuation criteria for 
participants who are already randomized. A repeat ECG should be performed in case of any 
clinically significant abnormality that is identified in a randomized participant during the 

  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 64 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
treatment period and, in t hese cases, the medical monitor should be consulted on the 
appropriateness of the participant continuing in the trial.  
8.3.5.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
See Section  10.2 (Appendix 2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section  1.3) for the timing and frequency.  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the trial in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed  with the source documents.  
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the trial should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer 
considered clinically significant  by the investigator or medical monitor.  
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the 
investigator, the etiology should be identified and the medical monitor notified.  
All protocol -required laboratory ass essments, as defined in Section  10.2 (Appendix 2), must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the Schedule of Assessments.  
8.3.6.  Suicid al Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring  
Suicidality will be monitored during the trial using the C -SSRS. This semi -structured interview 
was originally developed to evaluate the link between antidepressants and suicidal behavior and 
ideation in youth and a dverse events from pediatric clinical trials ( Posner et al, 2011 ). It was 
designed to quantify the severity of suicidal ideation and behavior. Trial personnel administering 
the C -SSRS must have completed the appropriate training and have valid certification. Access to 
training on the scale will be provided by the sponsor or designee.  
This trial will use the “Baseline/Screening” and “Since Last Visit” versions of the scale. The 
“Baseline/Screening” version, which assesses the lifetime experience of the participant with 
suicide events and suicidal ideation and the occurrence of suicide events or ideation within a 
specified time period prior to entry into the trial, will be completed for all participants at 
screening to deter mine eligibility. The exclusion criteria based on the C -SSRS are provided in 
Section  5.2. 
The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all specified time points after 
screening. The investigator will review the results of the “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS during the 
trial to determine whether it is safe for the participant to continue in the trial. If a participant has 
any “YES” answers on the C -SSRS for the su icidal ideation or suicidal behavior items, the 
investigator will evaluate whether a risk assessment by a qualified mental health professional (or 
the investigator alone if the investigator is a qualified mental health professional) is needed and 
discuss w ith the medical monitor whether the participant should continue in or be discontinued 
from the trial.  
8.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section  10.3 (Appendix 3).  

  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 65 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant’s legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qu alified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the IMP or trial procedures, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue IMP (see Section  7) 
8.4.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded fr om the first dose of IMP until follow -up contact at the time 
points specified in the Schedules of Assessments ( Section  1.3). 
Medical occurrences that b egin before the start of IMP dosing but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded as medical and/or psychiatric history.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the medical monitor immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours , as indicated in Section  10.3 (Appendix 3). The 
investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the medical monitor within 24 hours of it being 
available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the trial 
participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the trial, and he/she considers the event to be related to 
the IMP or trial participation, th e investigator must promptly notify the sponsor.  
8.4.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section  10.3 (Appendix 3).  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is t he preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
8.4.3.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, s tabilization, the event 
is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.4). Further 
information on follow -up procedures is given in Section  10.3 (Appendix 3).  
8.4.4.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs/AESIs  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the s ponsor regarding an SAE/AESI is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of 
an IMP under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the loc al regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of an IMP under clinical investigation. The sponsor will 

  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 66 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, IRB, and investig ators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as 
necessary.  
An investigator who receives an investigator s afety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review, acknowledge, 
and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB, if appropriate 
according to loc al requirements.  
8.4.5.  Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female partners of male participants will be collected after the start 
of IMP and until the final contact.  
If a pregnancy in a female partner is reported, the investigator should inform the medical monitor 
within 24  hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in 
Section  10.4 (Appendix 4).  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
8.4.6.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
All AESIs should be reported according to the procedures and timelines for SAEs (see 
Section  10.3.4 ). Detailed narratives will be written for any part icipant who develops an AESI.  
The following events will be reported as AESIs:  
• AEs that result in the discontinuation of IMP  
• Events that satisfy the criteria for suspected Hy’s Law (alanine aminotransferase 
[ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] >3 × up per limit of normal [ULN], AND 
serum bilirubin ≥2 × ULN  
− Repeat for confirmation and notify the medical monitor immediately  
• QTcF >500 ms or increase >60 ms from baseline  
− Repeat for confirmation and notify the medical monitor immediately  
• Grade 2 moderate AE s that are related to the gastrointestinal system (eg, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia, etc)  
• Grade 2 moderate AEs that are related to the central nervous system (eg, headache, 
dizziness, syncope, irritability, anxiety, etc)  
• AEs potentia lly related to abuse (refer to the APMP document for details)  
The primary objective of the APMP is to monitor events that may suggest that CVL -354 
produces drug effects that could be sought out for abuse purposes. In addition to monitoring for 
irregulariti es in medication handling, AEs that may be suggestive of a developing abuse issue 

  
Protocol CVL -354-1001  
CVL -354 
 
 
Confidential  Page 67 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
will also receive special attention. As part of the APMP, AEs potentially related to abuse and 
medication handling irregularities related to suspected or known abuse of IMP m ust be reported 
as AESIs. Investigators and site staff at each trial site will be trained on reporting potentially 
abuse -related AEs. While the investigators will be provided with examples of AE terms as a 
guide during trial conduct, the analysis of potent ially abuse -related AEs will be based on a search 
by the sponsor of all relevant Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms, all 
verbatim terms, and any open text fields within the AE data to identify text strings suggestive of 
abuse poten tial, consistent with US FDA guidance ( FDA Guidance for Industry, 2017 ). 
8.5. Treatment of Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by a trial participant, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual 
participant according to the protocol.  
There is no specific antidote for overdose with CVL -354. In the event of an overdose, treatment 
should consist of general supportive measures. The investigator shou ld complete the following:  
1. Contact the medical monitor immediately  
2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and clinically significant vital signs, 
ECG, or laboratory abnormalities. Additional safety procedures may need to be 
performed at the investi gator’s discretion.  
3. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose (if 
multiple time points) in the eCRF  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the me dical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.  
8.6. Pharmacokinetics  
This section includes descriptions of the blood and urine samples obtained for PK assessments, 
including metabolite scouting.  
All PK samples should be obtained at the exac t nominal time relative to dosing. Samples 
obtained within 10% of the nominal time point (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 -minute sample) will 
not be considered a protocol deviation, as long as the exact time of sampling is captured in the 
source documents.  
Plasma and urine samples will be processed, stored, and shipped to the bioanalytical facility 
according to the instructions provided to the investigator in advance of the trial. A fully validated 
bioanalytical method will be used to quantitate the concentra tions of CVL -354 in plasma and in 
urine. Plasma and urine PK samples from this trial may be used for further evaluation of 
bioanalytical methods and identification of additional metabolites. Plasma samples from this trial 
may be stored up to 1 year after c ompletion of the clinical study report (CSR).  
The results from metabolite scouting work (plasma and urine) will be captured in an exploratory 
metabolite scouting report, which will not be included in the CSR.

variation patterns of participants who respond well and  those who respond poorly to treatment 
may help to better define the most appropriate group of participants in which to target a given 
treatment. Collecting biospecimens for exploratory pharmacogenomic/biomarker analyses and 
retaining them at Cerevel makes  it possible to better understand the drug’s mechanism of action 
and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, pharmacodynamics, 
tolerability, or safety not anticipated prior to the beginning of this trial.  
Future biospecimen research  samples will be collected from participants who provide additional 
consent specifically for this sample collection. Research performed on these samples may 
include genetic analyses (DNA), gene expression profiling (RNA), proteomics, metabolomics 
and/or th e measurement of other analytes. Such research is for biomarker testing to address 
emergent questions not described elsewhere in the protocol (as part of the main trial). The 
objective of collecting these specimens is to explore and identify biomarkers tha t inform the 
scientific understanding of diseases or their therapeutic treatments.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal hypothesis testing is planned for this trial.  
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
The sam ple size is not based on statistical hypothesis testing. Based on historical precedent, it is 
expected that the proposed sample sizes of 8 participants per cohort in Part A (SAD, food effect) 
and 10  participants per cohort in Part B (MAD) will address the overall aim of the trial.  
In the event of higher than anticipated early terminations due to COVID -19 or other factors, 
Cerevel may extend enrollment in order to achieve trial objectives.  
9.3. Populations for Analyses

10.1.8.  Trial and Site Closure  
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the trial site or terminate the trial at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Trial sites will be closed upon trial 
complet ion. A trial site is considered closed when all required documents and trial supplies have 
been collected and a trial -site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate trial -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause an d 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not 
limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator  
• Discontinuation of further trial treatment development

complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as 
to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, an d accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which 
may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
f. Other situations : 
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised  in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other 
situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergi c bronchospasm, or blood dyscrasias.

Information  
10.4.1.  Definitions  
10.4.1.1.  Highly Effective Form of Contraception (Failure Rate <1%)  
A highly effective form of contraception (failure rate of <1%) is defined as fo llows:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of  ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Intravaginal  
− Transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of  ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine  device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing  system  
• Bilateral tubal  occlusion  
• Vasectomized  partner  
• Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk  associated 
with the trial treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the  
participant.  
10.4.1.2.  Acceptable Birth Control Methods (Failure Rate >1%  per Year)  
Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include 
the following:  
• Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not 
the primary mode of  action  
• Male or female condom wi th or without  spermicide*  
• Cap, diaphragm or sponge with  spermicide*  
*A combination of male condom with a cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double -
barrier methods) is also considered acceptable but is not a highly effective birth control method.

10.4.1.3.  Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Procedures  
The following definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures:  
A woman is considered a woman of childbearing potential following menarche and until 
becoming postmenopausal unless permane ntly sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and complete salpingectomy.  
In this trial, postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for at least 12 consecutive months 
without an alternative medical cause in addition to an FSH level >40 IU/mL.  
Sterilized male participants should be at least 1 year postbilateral vasectomy and have confirmed 
that they have obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate or have had 
bilateral orchidectomy.  
10.4.2.  Collec tion of Pregnancy Information  
10.4.2.1.  Male Participants With Partners Who Become Pregnant  
• The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male 
participant’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in 
this trial. This  applies only to male participants who receive IMP.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female 
partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the sponsor wit hin 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
sponsor. Generally, the follow -up will be no  longer than 12 weeks following the 
estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless 
of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.

Use/Ana lysis of Deoxyribonucleic Acid  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to trial treatment, susceptibility 
to, and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to trial treatment may 
be due to genetic determinants that impact drug ab sorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular 
subtype of the disease being treated.  
• DNA samples will be used for research related to CVL -354 or major depressive 
disorder and related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including 
diagnostic tests related to CVL -354 and/or interventions of this drug class and major 
depressive disorder. Genetic research may consist of the analysis of one or more 
candidate genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome or analysis 
of the entire genome (as appropriate).  
• There are no planned analyses of DNA samples. Analyses may be conducted if it is 
hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.  
• The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -trial assessment of genetic factors 
involved in the response to CVL -354 or IMPs of this class to understand trial disease 
or related conditions.  
• The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the CSR or in a s eparate trial 
summary.  
• The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality.  
• The samples will be retained while research on CVL -354 or trial treatments of this 
class or major depressive disorder  continues but no longer than 15 years or other 
period as per local requirements.

10.6. Appendix 6: Kidney Safety for First -in-Human Trial  
10.6.1.  Elevations in Serum Creatinine  
Serum creatinine (SCr) level may be affected by age, muscle mass, diet, activity, and tubular 
transporter activity, and SCr elevations can occur without impacting overall kidney function. 
Nonetheless, kidney function is closely monitored using blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum 
creatinine, and urinalysis.

Abbreviations: RBC=red blood cell; ULN=upper limit of normal; WBC=white blood cell.  
Contact the medical monitor if the repeat confirmation SCr >1.2 × ULN or urine continues to 
have proteinuria, glucosuria, or active urine sediments.  
10.6.2.  Potential Cases of Acute Kidney Injury  
Abnormal values in SCr that meet the KDIGO 2012 ( KDIGO , 2012 ) criteria below, in the 
absence of other causes of kidney injury, are considered potential cases of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) and should be regarded as important medical events.  
• Increase in SCr ≥0.3  mg/dL (26.5  mmol/L) within 48  hours   
• Increase in SCr ≥50% from baseline  
• Urine volume output <0.5  mL/kg/h for 6 hours  
The baseline is defined as the most recent SCr prior to randomization/dosing.  
10.6.2.1.  Marked Elevations in Serum Creatinine  
For increases of SCr ≥50% relative to the participant baseline:  
• Temporarily withhold IMP until a repeat SCr as soon as practically feasible, 
preferably within 24  hours of awareness.  
• If the second measurement of SCr is still ≥50% from the participant baseline, IMP 
should be permanently discontinued.  
• Adequate, immediate, supportive measures should be taken if AKI is suspected.

Confidential  Page 85 of 96 Version 3.0: 25 May 2022  
 
10.6.2.2.  Evaluation of Potential Cases of AKI  
Participants suspected of having potential AKI should promptly (as soon as practically feasible, 
preferably within 24 hours of awareness) hav e an evaluation, which includes a detailed medical 
history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.  
Laboratory tests include, at a minimum:  
• Serum:  
− BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphorus, and 
calcium  
− Creatine kinase and c ystatin -C 
• Urine: Dipstick, microscopic examination, indices, and β-2-microglobulin.  
Consider consultation with a nephrologist.  
Close daily observation of the participant and assessment of kidney function should be continued 
until the SCr elevations and the  associated abnormal UA results return to baseline or normalize.  
10.6.2.3.  Stopping Criteria for the Cohort  
Further dosing with IMP will be stopped for the cohort if ≥2 healthy participants within a given 
dose level meet the criteria established in  Section  10.6.2.1  and permanently discontinued IMP.  
10.6.2.4.  Stopping Criteria for Dose Escalation  
Serum creatinine may be potentially impacted by OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K trans porter 
inhibition by test drugs. Serum cystatin -C, which is not affected by the above transporters, may 
be used to monitor renal function. If ≥2 healthy participants within the same dosing level/cohort 
have a decline in eGFR cystatin -C ≥25% from baseline u sing the CKD -EPI 2012 formula for 
cystatin -C (Inker et al, 2012 ), then dose  escalation stops.

10.8. Appendix 8: Protocol Amendment History  
The Protocol  Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly before the Table of Contents.  
Amendment: Protocol Version 2.0 (16 Sep 2021)  
 
 
Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
1.1 Synopsis  
3 Objectives and Endpoints  Added AEs potentially related to abuse 
to TEAE endpoint (SAD and MAD 
tables)  To align with addition of such events 
to Section 8.4.6 (Adverse Events of 
Special Interest)  
 Added clarification that the following 
PK endpoints are for Day  14: CL/F; 
VZ/F; PTR; Rac, C max; Rac, AUC; t 1/2; 
and renal clearance (MAD table)  Data required for calculation of 
these endpoints are only collected at 
steady state  
1.1 Synopsis  
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Trial 
Design  Deletion of parallel -group language 
(MAD)  Internal consistency about sequential 
dosing of cohorts  
1.2 Schema  
4.1.1 Single Ascending Dose - 
Part A  Figure 1 and Table 6:  
Revised CVL -354 dosing paradigms 
for Cohort 2   
To align with proposed doses as 
presented in Table 7  
1.2 Schema  Figure 1:  
Randomization symbol (R) moved 
from beginning of Treatment Phase to 
text boxes for each cohort   
To reflect randomization to sequence 
rather than to cohort  
 Figure 1, Figure 2:  
Changed text boxes for cohorts in 
Treatment Phase from parallel to 
staggered   
To more accurately depict sequential 
dosing of cohorts  
1.3 Schedule of Assessments  Table 1 (SAD), Table 2 (MAD):  
Revised tables to indicate that medical 
occurrences before the start of IMP 
dosing but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded as medical 
and/or psychiatric history and that AEs 
will be recorded from the first dose of 
IMP  
To clarify recording timeframes 
relative to informed consent and first 
dose of IMP, in cluding for 
replacement participants  
 SAD: Changed limited physical and 
neurological examinations to full 
examinations at each Check -out (or 
ET) 
MAD: Changed limited physical and 
neurological examinations to full 
examinations on Day 7 and Day  17/ET  To pro vide additional opportunities 
to potentially identify AEs related to 
the gastrointestinal or central 
nervous systems, reflecting the 
addition of such events to 
Section  8.4.6 (Adverse Events of 
Special Interest)

Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria  Exclusion Criterion #11:  
Added “at Screening” to criterion for 
estimated glomerular filtration rate   
To clarify timeframe for 
determination of  eligibility  
 Exclusion Criterion #13:  
Moved symptomatic orthostatic 
dizziness text to a separate bullet 
within the criterion   
To separate the text from the bullet 
that defines orthostatic hypotension  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Exclusion Criterion #16:  
Increased duration of abstention from 
48 hours prior to Day -1 to 7  days prior 
to Day -1  
To ensure minimal to no interaction 
with IMP  
5.3.1 Meals and Dietary 
Restrictions  Increased duration of abstention from 
48 hours prior to Day -1 to 7  days prior 
to Day -1  
5.4 Screen Failures  Deleted language about SAEs  To align  with changes to language 
about AE recording starting from 
first dose of IMP  
6.3.1 Participant Assignment to 
Treatment  Revised language to specify that 
replacement participants in Part A 
(SAD) will be randomized to the same 
sequence and replacement participants 
in Part B (MAD) will be randomized to 
the same treatment  To reflect differences in trial design 
between SAD (randomization to 
sequence) and MAD (randomization 
to treatment)  
6.3.2 Blinding  Added instructions in the event of 
emergency unblinding  To clarify unblinding procedures in 
case of emergency  
8.4.1 Time Period and 
Frequency for Collecting AE 
and SAE/AESI Information  Clarified that AEs will be recorded 
from the first dose of IMP and medical 
occurrences that begin before the start 
of IMP dosing but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded as 
medical and/or psychiatric history  To confirm timeframes for medical 
history and AE recording relative to 
informed consent and fi rst dose of 
IMP 
8.4.6 Adverse Events of Special 
Interest  Detailed narratives, rather than brief 
narratives, will be written for any 
participant who develops an AESI  
Revised AESI definitions as follows:  
Added Grade 2 moderate AEs related 
to the gastrointes tinal system  
Added Grade 2 moderate AEs related 
to the central nervous system  
Added AEs potentially related to abuse 
(followed by summary of key aspects 
of the APMP)  To enhance understanding of the 
safety profile of CVL -354 and to 
provide guidance to site personnel 
for identification and reporting of 
AEs potentially related to abuse  
8.6 Pharmacokinetics  Added a sentence regarding possible 
retention of samples for evaluation of 
bioanalytical methods and metabolites 
for up to 1 year after CSR completion  Updated as per sponsor’s policy on 
PK sample management

Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
9.4.2 Safety Analyses  Added AEs potentially related to abuse  To align with addition of such events 
to Section 8.4.6 (Adverse Events of 
Special Interest)  
10.3.3 Recording and Follow -
Up of AEs and/or SAEs/AESIs  Deleted the following language:  
...that are identified at any time during 
the trial...  
...having been identified throughout the 
trial...  To align with changes to language 
about AE recording starting from 
first dose of IMP  
10.3.3 Recording and F ollow -
Up of AEs and/or SAEs/AESIs  
10.3.4 Reporting of SAEs and 
AESIs  Addition of “AESI” or “AESIs” to 
section headings and throughout tables 
within the respective sections  To correct inadvertent omission in 
the previous version of the protocol  
11 REFERENCES  Added new reference:  
FDA Guidance for Industry, 2017  To reflect inclusion of citation in 
content regarding abuse potential 
monitoring added to Section 8.4.6 
(Adverse Events of Special Interest)  
Overall  General grammatical and wording

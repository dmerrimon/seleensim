Page 7 Study Design This will be an open-label, randomized, 2-part study in adult smokers.  
All subjects will participate in both study parts. Part  2 will begin 
immediately after Part  1. 
Screening procedures will be performed within 28  days prior to study 
procedures on Day -2. 
Subjects who successfully complete the screening procedures and 
meet the eligibility criteria will be eligible to check in to the clinical 
research uni t (CRU ) on Day -2 and will complete all subjective effects 
questionnaires for the purpose of familiarization with the questions, scales, and computerized tablet.  Subjects will also participate in a 
brief trial on Day  -2 (approximately 30 minutes) using the myblu™ 
device with a 0% nicotine e -liquid, to familiar ize with the use of the 
device.  Baseline study assessments , including BoE, BoPH, spirometry  
(Day  -1 only) , BP, HR, and puff topography  (in a subset of 16 subjects 
[2 subjects from each sequence in Part 1] on Day -1 only ) will be 
performed on Days  -2 through -1, as appropriate. Subjects will 
continue to smoke their usual brand combustible cigarette from check -in through Day -1, but will abstain from use of any tobacco- or 
nicotine -containing products for at least 12  hours prior to the start of  
product use on Day 1. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8  sequences 
(Part  1) on Day -1. 
Part 1 (Days  1 to 9) 
On Days 1, 3, 5, and 7, subjects will use the study product they are assigned to use the following day according to the randomization scheme. Subjects will use the assigned study product ad libitum  until 
the start of the abstinence period (i.e., at least 12 hours prior to the 
start of the first product use session on the next day). A fully charged battery and a fresh pod will be provided on each day. Additional pods will be provided as needed. Pods will be weighed within 24 hours before the start and after  completion of product use on each day.
 On 
Day 1, puff topography measurements will be performed in the same 
subset of 16 subjects (2  subjects from each sequence in Part  1) for 
1 hour during ab libitum  product use. Puff topography should be 
performed withi n ± 2 hours of the time of the baseline assessment on 
Day -1. 
On Days  2, 4, 6, and 8, subjects will participate in two product use 
sessions on each day, using the assigned study product  according to 
the randomization scheme. In the first (controlled) product use 
session, subjects will use the assigned study product under controlled conditions (i.e., 10 puffs taken at 30 -second intervals, with puffs 
3 seconds in duration). Blood samples for nicotine pharmacokinetic 
(PK) assessment will be collected prior to and for 3  hours following 
the start of the first product use session. S ubjects will complete the 
Urge to Smoke questionnaire during and following the first product 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 8 use session  and the Product Liking, Product Evaluation Scale (PES), 
and Future Intent to Use questionnaires following the first product use 
session . Following collection of the last PK blood sample (180- minute 
time point) and completion of the subjective effects questionnaires, subjects will start the second ( ad libitum ) product use session , during 
which they will use the same assigned study product  ad libitum  (with 
no limits on puff duration or inter -puff interval ) until approximately 
23:00. Subjects will complete the Urge to Smoke, Product Liking, PES, and Future Intent to Use questionnaire s at least 6 hours after the 
start of the second product use session. A fresh pod and fully charged 
device will be provided for each product use session. Pod weights will 
be measured before and after each  product use session . On Day  8, puff 
topography measurements will be performed in the same subset of 
16 subjects (2  subjects from each sequence in Part  1) for 1  hour during 
the second  (ab libitum ) product use session. Puff topography will be 
performed at least 4  hours after the start of the second ( ab libitum ) 
product use session and should be within ±  2 hours of the time of the 
baseline assessment on Day  -1.  
On Day  9, subjects may  use all or any of the  4 study products (used 
previously on Days  1 to 8) ad libitum  until approximately 23:00. For 
BoE and BoPH assessments, b lood samples will be collected on Day  9 
and urine samples will be collected over 24  hours (starting on Day 8 
after completion of the second [ ab libitum ] product use session ). BP 
and HR measurements  will be taken  throughout the period of 
ad libitum  product use. Subjects will complete the Questionnaire on 
Smoking Urges -Brief (QSU -Brief), the Minnesota Tobacco 
Withdrawal Scale- Revised (MTWS -R), and the Penn State 
[Electronic] Cigarette Dependence Index (PSCDI/PSECDI)  
questionnaires at least 6 hours after the start of the ad libitum  product 
use session on Day  9. Spirometry measurements will be conducted 
following completion of all subjective effects questionnaires  on 
Day 9. Fresh pods and a fully charged device will be provided on 
Day 9 and pod weights will be measured. 
Depending on the availability of topography equipment, puff topography may not be performed at all scheduled time points and may not be performed for some or all assigned subj ects. 
Part 2 (Days  10 to 1 4) 
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 study arms (Part  2) on Day 10. 
Subjects will use any or all of the 8  study products and/or smoke their 
usual brand combustible cigarettes ad libitum  for 5  days  (until 
approximately 23:00 on each day) according to the randomization 
scheme.  For BoE and BoPH assessments, blood samples will be 
collected on Day  14 and urine samples will be collected over 24  hours 
(starting on Day 13 after the end of product use for that day ). On 
Day 14, BP and HR measurements  will be taken  throughout the period 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 9 of ad libitum  product use/smoking. The QSU -Brief, MTWS -R, and 
PSCDI/PSECDI questionnaires will be completed at least 6 hours 
after the start of the ad libitum  product use session on Day  14. 
Spirometry measurements will be conducted f ollowing completion of 
all subjective effects questionnaires on Day 14. Product use behavior 
will be assessed by documenting the number of cigarettes smoked , the 
flavor and strength of the my blu™ products, and pod weights, per day, 
as appropriate. On each study day, fresh pod s and a fully charged 
device will be provided, as appropriate . 
The CRU will attempt to contact all subjects who used at least one 
study product (including subjects who terminate the study e arly) using 
their standard procedures approximately 14 days after the last study product use to determine if any adverse event (AE) has occurred since the last study visit.  
Study Population  The study population will be comprised of healthy, adult male and female smokers, who are between 21 and 65 years of age (inclusive). 
Each subject must self -report smoking an average of 10 or more 
manufactured combustible cigarettes per day (CPD) for at least 12 months  prior to Screening.  
Forty (40) subjects will be expected to complete the study  and will 
participate in both study parts . Every attempt will be made to enroll no 
more than 60 % of either sex.  
Duration of Study Conduct  The duration of the study from S creening to Day  15 is approximately 
6 weeks.

Page 27 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
1.1 Background 
E-cigarettes have become a popular alternative to cigarette smoking and are garnering 
significant attention as potentially reduced exposure products and smoking cessation 
products. E -cigarettes consist of a battery, heating component, and a reservoir (often referred 
to as a pod, cartridge, or tank) containing tobacco- derived nicotine in a s olution composed of 
glycerin and/or propylene glycol and flavorings. Upon activation, the heating element heats the solution and the consumer inhales the resulting vapor.  
Because e-cigarette use does not involve the combustion of tobacco, it is expected th at 
e-cigarette consumers will experience reduced exposure to most biomarkers of tobacco 
exposure compared to combustible cigarettes. Previous studies have shown that switching from combustible cigarettes to e- cigarettes with high rates of compliance result s in large 
reductions in a number of cigarette smoke toxicants ( Cravo  2016, Goniewicz  2017, 
O'Connell  2016, McRobbie 2015, Hecht  2015).  
Therefore, to be of greatest benefit, e- cigarettes must provide smokers with an experience 
that would allow for maximal displacement of combustible cigarettes while at the same time not serve as a gateway to other more t oxic products for nonsmokers. Key elements that 
contribute to an acceptable initiating experience include the nicotine content in the products as well as the response that consumers have in terms of satisfaction and prevention of symptoms of withdrawal. 
1.2 myblu™ Previous Clinical Experience  
One previous clinical study has been conducted with the myblu™ closed system 
(FON-01blu- 2018). Fifteen healthy adult smokers enrolled in an open-label, 6-period 
crossover study to characterize nicotine uptake and subjectiv e effects during a 10 -puff 
controlled exposure (puffs 3 seconds in duration, taken at approximately 30- second intervals) 
relative to usual brand combustible cigarettes and the blu PRO open system product and to 
determine the potential impact of a nicotine salt e -liquid (with lactic acid).  
Blood samples for plasma nicotine analysis were collected approximately 5 minutes prior to and at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 30 minutes following the start of product use. The subjective effects questionnaires  were completed at approximately 20  minutes following the 
start of each product use and included 6  questions presented on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 7 
(extremely).  
Nicotine overall exposure over 30 minutes (AUC0 -30) and peak exposure (Cmax) increased 
with increasing nicotine content in the myblu™ products (16 - 40 mg nicotine), and was 
higher in the 25 mg nicotine salt formulation compared to the non- salt formulation. The time 
to reach maximal plasma nicotine concentrations (Tmax) ranged from approximately 6.0 - 7.9 minutes following use of myblu™ and blu PRO products with nicotine salts and 
approximately 8.0 minutes following use of myblu™ non- salt formulation. AUC0- 30 and 
Cmax of nicotine were lowest following use of blu PRO compared to all other produc ts 
tested. AUC0- 30 and Cmax of  nicotine was highest following use of cigarette compared to 
any other product tested. Tmax was shorter following use of the five e -cigarette test products

Mean scores for the subjective effects assessments tended to be highest after combustible 
cigarette use and generally followed by my blu™ 40 mg. With the exception of the questions 
“was it enough nicotine?” and “was it too much nicotine?”, the responses following use of the 25 mg salt formulation were comparable to the 25 mg non- salt formulation.

Overall, the study products were well -tolerated under the conditions of use in the study. 
There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the study, and no subjects were 
discontinued due to AEs. Product use emergent AEs were infrequently reported with four subjects reporting a total of 10 AEs. Veni puncture site pain was the most frequently reported 
AE, experienced by two subjects. All remaining AEs were experienced by one subject each. All AEs were mild in severity, with the exception of moderate insomnia (blu PRO 48 mg). The PI considered one AE of headache ( myblu™ 25 mg [non- salt formulation]) to be 
possibly related to study product and the remaining nine events unlikely or unrelated.  
1.3 Study  Purpose  
This study is being conducted to evaluate the overall performance of  the currently- marketed 
myblu™ e-cigarette device and pods, as assessed by nicotine uptake and consumer 
satisfaction . The endpoints to be assessed are based on the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems Draft Guidance for Industry (FDA 2019), and t he data may be included in future premarket tobacco application 
submissions to the Center for Tobacco Products.

3. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Design and Proce dures  
This will be an open -label, randomized, 2- part study in adult smokers. All subjects will 
participate in both study parts. Part  2 will begin immediately after Part  1. 
Screening procedures will be performed within 28  days prior to study procedures on D ay -2. 
Forty (40) adult, male and female, self -affirmed smokers (smoke an average of 10 or more 
manufactured combustible CPD for at least 12 months  prior to Screening), who successfully 
complete the screening procedures and meet the eligibility criteria, w ill be eligible to 
check -in to the CRU  on Day -2. Every attempt will be made to enroll no more than 60% of 
either sex.  
Following check- in, subjects will complete all subjective effects questionnaires for the 
purpose of familiarization with the questions, s cales, and computerized tablet. Subjects will 
also participate in a brief trial on Day  -2 (approximately 30 minutes) using the my blu™ 
device with a 0% nicotine e- liquid, to familiarize with the use of the device. Baseline study 
assessments, including BoE, BoPH, spirometry  (Day  -1 only) , BP, HR, and puff topography  
(in a subset of 16 subjects [2 subjects from each sequence in Part  1] on Day - 1 only ) will be 
performed on Days  -2 through -1, as appropriate. Subjects will continue to smoke their usual 
brand combustible cigarette from check -in through Day -1, but will abstain from use of any 
tobacco - or nicotine -containing products for at least 12  hours prior to the start of product use 
on Day 1. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8  sequences (Part  1) on Day -1. 
Part 1 (Days  1 to 9) 
On Days 1, 3, 5, and 7, subjects will use the study product they are assigned to use the 
following day according to the randomization scheme. Subjects will use the assigned study 
product ad libitum  until the start of the abstinence period (i.e., at least 12  hours prior to the 
start of the first product use session on the next day) . A fully charged battery and a fresh pod 
will be provided on each day. Additional pods will be provided as needed. Pods will be weighed within 24  hours be fore the start and after completion of product use on each day.  On 
Day 1, puff topography measurements will be performed in the same subset of 16 subjects 
(2 subjects from each sequence in Part  1) for 1 hour during ab libitum  product use. Puff 
topography should  be performed within ± 2 hours of the time of the baseline assessment on 
Day -1. 
On Days  2, 4, 6, and 8, subjects will participate in two product use sessions on each day, 
using the assigned study product according to the randomization scheme. In the  first 
(controlled) product use session, subjects will use the assigned study product under controlled conditions (i.e., 10 puffs taken at 30 -second intervals, with puffs 3 seconds in 
duration). Blood samples for nicotine PK assessment will be collected prior to and for 
3 hours following the start of the first product use session. Subjects will complete the Urge to 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 35 Smoke questionnaire during and following the first product use session and the Product 
Liking, PES, and Future Intent to Use questionnaires foll owing the first product use session. 
Following collection of the last PK blood sample (180- minute time point) and completion of 
the subjective effects questionnaires, subjects will start the second (ad libitum ) product use 
session , during which they will use  the same assigned study product  ad libitum  (with no 
limits on puff duration or inter -puff interval ) until approximately 23:00. Subjects will 
complete the Urge to Smoke, Product Liking, PES, and Future Intent to Use questionnaires at 
least 6 hours after the start of the second product use session. A fresh pod and fully charged 
device will be provided for each product use session. Pod weights will be measured before and after each product use session . On Day  8, puff topography measurements will be 
performed in the same subset of 16 subjects (2  subjects from each sequence in Part  1) for 
1 hour during the second ( ab libitum ) product use session. Puff topography will be performed 
at least 4  hours after the start of the second ( ab libitum ) product use s ession and should be 
within ± 2 hours of the time of the baseline assessment on Day  -1. 
On Day  9, subjects may use all or any of the 4  study products (used previously on 
Days  1 to 8) ad libitum  until approximately 23:00. For BoE and BoPH assessments, blood 
samples will be collected on Day  9 and urine samples will be collected over 24  hours 
(starting on Day 8 after completion of the second  [ab libitum ] product use session ). BP and 
HR measurements  will be taken  throughout the period of ad libitum  product use. Subjects 
will complete the QSU -Brief, the MTWS -R, and the PSCDI/PSECDI questionnaires at least 
6 hours after the start of the ad libitum  product use session on Day 9. Spirometry 
measurements will be conducted f ollowing completion of all subje ctive effects 
questionnaires on Day 9. Fresh pods and a fully charged device will be provided on Day 9 
and pod weights will be measured. 
Depending on the availability of topography equipment, puff topography may not be 
performed at all scheduled time point s and may not be performed for some or all assigned 
subjects . 
Part 2 (Days  10 to 1 4) 
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 study arms (Part  2) on Day 10. Subjects will use any or 
all of the 8  study products and/or smoke their usual brand combustible cigarettes ad libitum  
for 5  days (until approximately 23:00 on each day) according to the randomization scheme. 
For BoE and BoPH assessments, blood samples will be collected on Day  14 and urine 
samples will be collected over 24  hours ( starting on Day 13 after the end of product use for 
that day ). On Day  14, BP and HR measurements  will be taken  throughout the period of 
ad libitum  product use/smoking. The QSU -Brief , MTWS -R, and PSCDI/PSECDI 
questionnaires will be completed at least 6 hours after the start of the ad libitum  product use 
session on Day  14. Spirometry measurements will be conducted f ollowing completion of all 
subjective effects questionnaires on Day 14. Product use behavior will be assessed by 
documenting the number of cigarettes smoked, the flavor and strength of the my blu™ 
products, and pod weights, per day, as appropriate. On each study day, fresh pods and a fully 
charged device will be provided, as appropriate. 
Subjects will not be forced to use any tobacco/nicotine products at any time during the study.

Page 36 The overall study design is depicted in Figure  1. 
Safety will be monitored through physical examination (symptom -driven), vi tal signs 
measurements, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests ( serum chemistry, hematology, and 
urinalysis).  
AEs spontaneously reported by the subjects or observed by the Investigator or other study 
personnel will be monitored from the time of first use of a ny study product until the 
follow- up. Device malfunctions will also be recorded.  
The safety monitoring practices employed by this protocol (i.e., vital signs, 12- lead ECGs, 
clinical laboratory tests, AE questioning, and physical examination s) are adequate to protect 
the subjects’ safety and should detect all expected emergent AEs.  
Discontinued subjects may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor.

• Subjects will be advised to avoid eggplant, meats cooked at high temperatures (e.g., barbecued, grilled, pan -fried), cured sandwich meats, bacon, salami, and 
sausages for 48 hours  prior to Check -in and throughout the  study.  
• Caffeinated beverages will be restricted throughout confinement.  
4.3.2 Medications  
Medication use will be assessed to satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All 
medications (and reasons for their use) taken from 30 days prior to Check -in through the 
end-of-study will be recorded. Except for those medications noted in the exclusion criteria 
(Section  4.2) and albuterol used during spirometry measurements for this study, prescription 
or over- the-counter medications required to treat a disease or condition are permitted at the 
discretion of the Investigator . Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., oral, vaginal ring, transdermal 
patch, implant, injection) and hormonal replacement therapy are permitted. Occasional or 
seasonal use of over- the-counter products such as analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen ), 
antihistamines, nasal decongestants, and dietary supplements are permitted. Exceptions may 
be permitted at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor, providing 
the medication in question would have no impact on the study. Any exceptions will be documented. 
Decisions to use concomitant medications during the study will be made in the best interest 
of the health of the subject. If use of a prohibited medication is required during the study, a joint decision will be made by the Investigato r and Sponsor to continue or discontinue the 
subject.  Any exceptions will be documented and r equired medications that might impact 
study endpoints should be considered during interpretation of the study results.  
4.3.3 Meals /Dietary Considerations 
For all subjects, m eals and snacks will be provided at the appropriate times during 
confinement at the CRU . Each meal and/or snacks served at the CRU will be standardized 
and will be similar in caloric content and composition and will be taken at approximately the 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 43 same time on each day . When confined in the CRU, subjects will be required to fast from all 
food and drink except water between meals and snacks . 
Subjects will fast for at least 1  hour prior to and for at least 4  hour s after the start of each first  
product use session  on Days  2, 4, 6, and 8. Subjects will also fast for at least 1  hour prior to 
each puff topography session  and for at least 8  hours prior to blood sample collection for 
biomarkers (other than COHb) . 
During confinement, water will be allowed ad libitum , except that subjects  may not consume 
beverages of any kind (including water) during the  first product use  session on Days  2, 4, 6, 
and 8, and during each puff topography session. An exception to the water restriction can be 
made if a subject st arts coughing uncontrollably while smoking or using the e- cigarettes . 
4.3.4 Activity  
Subjects will be instructed to refrain from abnormal strenuous physical activity which could 
cause muscle aches or injury, including contact sports at any time from 48  hours pri or to 
Screening  and Check -in, and during confinement.  
During each 24 -hour urine collection period, s pecific measures will be taken to prevent the 
subject from missing a urine collection by strictly controlling and providing access to designated restrooms only. Subjects will be asked to void prior to entering the shower . 
4.3.5 Tobacco Use/Considerations  
Except as required by the study, consumption of tobacco- or nicotine -containing products 
will not be permitted from Check -in through discharge . 
4.4 Subject Early Disc ontinuation or Withdrawal  
Subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, s ubject participation in this study may be discontinued for any of the following 
reasons:  
• AE 
• Lost to follow- up 
• Non-compliance with st udy procedures  
• Protocol violation 
• Study terminated by Sponsor, FDA, or other regulatory authorities  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Investigator ’s discretion, including a severe laboratory abnormality or other medical 
condition that indicates to the Investigator  that continued participation is not in the 
best interest of the subject  
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 44 Protocol deviations/violations should not lead to subject withdrawal unless they indicate a 
significant risk to the subject’s safety or jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study . 
If premature withdrawal from the study occurs for any reason, the Investigator must 
determine the primary reason and record this information in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Additionally, subjects withdrawing after study product administration will undergo 
all discharge safety procedures as feasible and as deemed necessary by the Investigator . 
A subject withdrawn from the study due to any AE or clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values will be evaluated by the Investigator or other qualified individual and 
will be treated and/or followed up until the symptoms or values return to normal or acceptable levels or until lost to follow -up, as appropriate in the opinion of the Investigator . 
Subjects withdrawing or removed from this study ca nnot re -enter . 
4.5 Subject Randomization 
Subjects who complete the study screening assessments and meet all the eligibility criteria and are randomized will be assigned a unique randomization identification number on Day -1 
for Part  1 and on Day 10 for Part  2, and will rec eive study products according to the 
randomization scheme generated by  
In Part 1, t he sequences to be used in the randomization of Part  1 will be ABDC, BCAD, 
CDBA, DACB, EFHG, FGEH, GHFE, and HEGF . 
In Part  2, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 study arms (i.e., I, J, or K). 
If replacement subjects are used, the replacement subject number will be 100 more than the original (e.g., Subject No. 101 will replace Subject No. 1).

Page 46 5.1.2 myblu™ E-Cigarettes 
myblu™ is a two -piece closed system available in the US market. The myblu™ system is 
comprised of a rechargeable 350 mAh battery and a disposable pod. The pods connect 
directly and contain the mouthpiece, heating element, are pre- filled with e -liquid, and are 
compatible only with my blu™ batteries. During use, a consumer inhales through the 
mouthpiece and a sensor in the battery detects the change in air pressure which activates the heating element. The e- liquid heats to an aerosol which the consumer inhales.  
The battery is charged with a micro -USB charger and produces a typical output of 3.7 V 
(maximum 3.9  V). The pods contain 1.5 m L of e-liquid which lasts approximately 200 puffs, 
depending on individual use behaviors. Each e -liquid contains a mixture of glycerin, 
propylene glycol, nicotine freebase, and a proprietary blend of flavors.  
5.2 Study Product Accountability  and Dispensing  
All my blu™ e-cigarettes ( devices and  all e-liquids including the 0% nicotine e -liquid) will be 
provided by the Sponsor. The CRU  staff will coordinate shipping of e-cigarettes from the 
Sponsor. The staff will document the date each shipment was received and recorded in the inventory records. The CRU staff will document and reconcile the total number of products 
shipped to the CRU , the total number of products dispensed during the study, and the total 
number of products remaining at the end of clinical conduct.  Subjects will bring a 2 -week 
supply (unopened packs) of their usual brand combustible cigarettes for personal use at designated tim es throughout confinement in the CRU . 
All products will be stored in a locked, limited -access area at the CRU and kept at controlled 
room temperature (defined as 20  - 25°C [68  - 77°F], with excursions permitted to 15 - 30°C 
[59 - 86°F]). Humidity is record ed but not controlled. 
Study products for dispensing (including usual brand combustible cigarettes)  to subjects will 
be prepared by the study staff  according to instructions provided by the Sponsor . Individual 
study product dispensing records will be maintained by the CRU staff for each subject. Care 
should be taken when repackaging the study products for use at the CRU to avoid exposure 
to air and moisture to the e xtent possible. The pharmacy will maintain records of the number 
of cigarettes dispensed for each subject.  
The study staff will document the start time and stop time of each product use session . A 
fresh pod and fully charged device  will be used for each product use session  and each 
product use day (as applicable) . The number of cigarettes smoked will be documented on 
Days  -2 and  -1, and on Days  10 through 14 for subjects in Arm s J and K. The flavor and 
strength of the my blu™ products will be documented as appropriate. Pod weights
 will be 
documented in grams to 4  decimal places.  
Subjects will smoke their usual brand combustible cigarettes and use each assigned product 
only in designated areas of the CRU . 
Opened and unopened packages of e- cigarettes and components will be returned to the 
Sponsor or destroyed at the direction of the Sponsor. Unopened packages of subject’s own 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 47 brand combustible cigarettes will be returned to the subjects; opened packages will be 
destroyed. All returns or destruction of study products will be documented.

Exhaled CO levels will be measured using a Bedfont Micro+ Smokerlyzer or similar device, 
at Screening.  
6.2 Check -in and Confinement  
Subjects  will check in to the CRU on Day -2 at a time specified by the CRU . Check -in 
procedures will be performed as delineated in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Table  1).  
After check -in, subjects will complete one set of questionnaires for the purpose of 
familiarization with subjective effects questions, appropriate use of the VAS, and use of the computerized tablet system. Data collected from the training session will not be used for any 
analysis.   
Subjects will also participate in a brief trial on Day  -2 (approximately 30 minutes) using the 
myblu™ device with a 0% nicotine e- liquid, to familiarize with the use of the device.  
Instructions on the proper use of the myblu™ products will be provided prior to use. 
Subjects will have their personal belongings thoroughly checked during Check-in. All 
subjects will be required to shower and will receive clean articles of clothing prior to the start 
of the first study product use on Day  1.  
Subjects will be confined from Check-in on Day -2 through completion of scheduled study 
events on Day  15. 
A subject may be required to remain at the CRU  for longer at the discretion of the 
Investigator  or designee.  
6.2.1 Baseline Assessme nts (Days -2 and -1) 
Subjects will continue to smoke their usual brand combustible cigarette from Check-in 
through Day -1, but will abstain from use of any tobacco- or nicotine -containing products for 
at least 12  hours prior to the start of product use  on Day 1.  
The number of usual brand combustible cigarettes smoked per day will be documented.  
Baseline assessments will be performed as delineated in the Study Events Flow Chart (Table  1). Urine samples will be collected for biomarkers over a 24 -hour period from the 
start of the overnight abstinence on Day  -2. On Day  -1, blood samples for biomarkers will be 
collected , BP and H R measurements  will be taken  throughout the period of ad libitum  
smoking, and spirometry will be performed.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8 sequences on Day  -1 and 2  subjects from each 
sequence will have puff topography measurements (Section  6.4.4) performed on Day -1.

Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take precedence over all routine scheduled procedures . 
6.4.1 Nicotine Pharmacokinetics 
On each of Days  2, 4, 6, and 8, a 4  mL blood sample  for plasma nicotine analysis will be 
drawn into  a plastic K
2-EDTA (lavender top) vacutainer tube at the time points  delineated in 
the Study Events Flow Chart  (Table  1). Allowable deviation windows for PK sampling are:  
± 30 seconds for samples collected from 3 - 15 minutes, ± 1 minute for samples collected 
from 20 - 60 minutes, and ±  3 minutes for all other  sample s. 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 51 PK blood samples will be collected by direct venipuncture or through an intravenous catheter 
port as determined by the clinical staff.  
Additional blood (typically up to approximately 1 mL) may be d rawn between the blood 
draws during the first 15 minutes for the purpose of keeping the needle patent, if required. 
The blood from the 1 mL draws will be discarded. In total, approximately 192 mL of blood will be drawn from each subject during the entire s tudy for nicotine PK analysis.  
The blood samples collected for plasma nicotine analysis may be kept at room temperature prior to centrifugation, and will be centrifuged at approximately 1000 to 1300 RCF at ~5°C for approximately 10 minutes, within 60  minut es from collection. After centrifugation, the 
plasma will be transferred to two methanol prewashed 3.5  mL polypropylene screw cap 
tubes, properly labeled, and then stored at -20°C ( ± 10°C) or below (within 120 minutes from 
collection) until analysis.  
Sampl es will be analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectrometry detection  analytical method with the appropriate quality controls in accordance 
with FDA Good Laboratory Practice  regulations (Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
[CFR] Part  58). 
6.4.2 Biomarkers Sample Collection

The Urge to Smoke (VAS), Product Liking (VAS), PES (7 -point scale), Future Intent to Use 
(VAS) , QSU -Brief, MTWS -R, and PSCDI/PSECDI  questionnaires will be completed using a 
computerized tablet device. All relevant software and staff training specific to the electronic 
questionnaires will be provided by the vendor . Any electronic device used must meet all 
regulatory requirements, including FDA 21 CFR Part 11.  
All questionnaires will be completed at the time points delineated in the Stu dy Events Flow 
Chart ( Table  1). 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 53 When scheduled at the same time as a PK blood draw, the Urge to Smoke questionnaire will 
be completed approximately 30 seconds prior to the scheduled blood draw  (except for the 
one scheduled  at Time  0, which will be performed approximately 10 minutes prior to the start 
of the first product use session) , and all other questionnaires will be completed within 
approximately 2 minutes after the scheduled blood draw, as applicable.  
6.4.4 Puff Topography  
Puff topography will be evaluated during ad libitum  product use on the days indicated in the 
Study Events Flow Chart (Table  1). Subjects will engage in a 1 -hour ad libitum  product use 
with their usual brand combustible cigarette (Day  -1) or the assigned study product (Days 1 
and 8), using the topography device (SPA -M). The topography session should start at least  
4 hours after the start of the ad libitum  product use of that day. 
The puff topography session on Days 1 and 8 should be within ± 2 hours of the time of the 
Day -1 session.  
The topography device will be monit ored to ensure the device is actively recording during 
each session.  
Additional details and instructions for puff topography procedures will be provided separately.  
Depending on the availability of topography equipment, puff topography may not be performed at all scheduled time points and may not be performed for some or all assigned 
subjects . 
6.4.5 Spirometry  
Subjects will undergo lung function testing at Screening to affirm eligibility (FEV1, FEV1:FVC ratio) and as a safety endpoint (FEV1, FVC, FEV1:FVC ratio, and forced 
expiratory flow [FEF]25-75%) on the days indicated in the Study Events Flow Chart 
(Table  1).  
Spirometry measurements will be conducted in accordance with the 2005 American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society Joint Task Force on the standardization of spirometry (Miller  2005). The spirometry predicted values will be standardized by the Third National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey predicted set. Personnel performing spirometry 
tests must receive appropriate training and the spirometer must be kept calibrated as recommended by the manufacturer.  
The spirometry tests should be performed in a sitting position following at least 15 minutes of rest and at least 1  hour from the last combustible cigarette smoked or last myblu™ product 
use. Spirometry must be performed after exhaled CO measurements when these events are to be performed on the same day. Multiple measurements may be attempted, but no more than 8 test maneuvers should be performed during a test session. If a subject shows signs of fatigue during repeated testing, testing will be halted and further attempts will only be allowed at the Investigator’s discretion.  
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 54 The subjects will be instructed on how to correctly perform spirometry tests by appropriately 
trained perso nnel prior to the measurements being recorded. Spirometry measurements will 
be performed before and after administration of a short -acting bronchodilator (albuterol). 
Following acceptable pre- bronchodilator measurements, subjects will be administered 4  puffs 
from an albuterol metered -dose inhaler at approximately 30  second intervals (~360 µg total 
dose assuming 90 µg per puff) using a spacer and a 5 -second breath hold after each puff. 
Post-bronchodilator measurements will be made approximately 10  - 15 minut es following the 
last albuterol puff.  
The CRU  will be responsible for procuring sufficient supplies to perform the spirometry 
measurements, including quantities of albuterol and any additional materials for its 
administration, and for keeping accurate documentation of accountability, dispensing/administration, and disposal of these items as appropriate. 
6.4.6 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments  in addition to those below may be obtained as necessary at the discretion 
of the Investigator . In the case of an earl y subject withdrawal, discharge  safety assessments 
should be collected to the extent possible. 6.4.6.1 Physical Examination  
A standard physical examination assessing the general physical well -being will be performed 
at Screening . A symptom -driven physical examination will be conducted at other times as 
deemed appropriate by the Investigator (Table  1). 
6.4.6.2 Body Weight, Height, and BMI  
Body weight and body height will be measured as delineated in the Study Events Flow Chart 
(Table  1). BMI will be recorded as kg/m
2. 
6.4.6.3 Electrocardiogram 
Single 12 -lead ECGs will be performed as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Table  1). 
ECGs will be taken following resting in the supine position for at least 5  minutes. All ECG 
tracings will be reviewed by the Investigator or a qualified designee.  
6.4.6.4 Vital Signs  
Single measurem ents of v ital signs (respiratory rate, HR, BP, and oral temperature) will be 
performed as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Table  1). Additional vital signs may 
be taken at any other times, if deemed necessary.  
BP and HR measurements will be taken following a rest period of at least 5  minutes in a 
seated position. V ital signs are to be measured  at least 15  minutes after the last tobacco - or 
nicotine -containing product used.  When BP and HR measurements are scheduled at the same 
time or immediately after a puff topography session, subjects may not have abstained from 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 55 tobacco - or nicotine -containing product use for 15  minutes prior to the BP and HR 
measurements . 
On Day s 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 through 12, vital signs  measurements will be taken  within 2  hours 
prior to the start of the first product use session. 
6.4.6.5 Clinical Laboratory 
All clinical laboratory tests (with the exception of the urine cotinine test) will be conducted 
by a laboratory accredited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 [CLIA -88]) or at the study site  using 
CLIA -waived kits or procedures . Values for the clinical laboratory parameters are to be 
within the laboratory normal ranges or deemed not clinically significant in the opinion of the 
Investigator . All tests listed below will be performed as delineat ed in the Study Events Flow

Page 56 6.4.7 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward  medical occurrence associated with the use of the study product , 
whether or not considered study product -related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study product, whether or not related to the study 
product. 
6.4.7.1 Monitoring  
The subjects will be instructed to inform the Investigator  or staff of any AEs and intercurrent 
illnesses experienced during the study. Additionally, a specific inquiry regarding AEs  will be 
conducted prior to each product use and at discharge ( or upon ear ly withdrawal ). The inquiry 
will be posed in a non- specific manner using open -ended questions so as not to bias the 
response (e.g., How are you feeling  today?). 
A subject who has any clinically significant AE or clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
test value will be evaluated by the Investigator or other qualified individual and will be 
treated and/or followed up until the symptoms or values return to normal or acceptable levels (as appropriate in the opinion of the Investigator ), or until the subjec t is lost to follow -up. 
Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of the event(s).  
6.4.7.2 Reporting  
All AEs occurring during this clinical trial after the subject has received  the first study 
product must be recorded on the eCRF, including the date and time of onset, action taken, 
outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown/lost to follow -up), 
duration, relationship to product administration, and severity for each event. AEs will be listed . 
Even ts captured between S creening  and the first study product use will be documented as 
baseline signs and symptoms.  
The Investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to product administration 
as unrelated, unlikely, possibl y, probabl y, or likely.  
In addition, each sign or symptom reported will be graded on a 3- point severity scale using 
mild, moderate, or severe . 
6.4.7.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event ( SAE) is any AE that in the view of either the Investigator (or 
designee) or Spons or, results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life threatening AE, 
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functi ons, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 57 appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and m ay require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. 
Life threatening is defined as an AE that in the view of the Investigator (or designee) or 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate ri sk of death. It does not include an 
AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not consistent with the known risk information 
associated with the study product . 
All SAEs, whether or not c onsidered study -related , must be reported by telephone and by fax 
or e-mail to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the CRU ’s learning of the SAE or, at the latest, 
on the following workday. The Sponsor’s representative to contact about this study is 
provided in  the list of study contacts  and on the Sponsor signature page . The Investigator 
must also inform the IRB, in compliance with GCP  reporting guidelines, and the site monitor 
of any SAE.  
6.4.7.4 Pregnancy  
A pregnancy occurring in a female study subject during the study will be documented in the clinical conduct study report to the IRB. Pregnancy itself is not an AE . The Investigator or 
designee will discontinue the pregnant subject from the study and will adv ise her to seek 
prenatal care and counseling from her primary care provider. Advice given will be documented in the subject’s source document.  
The CRU staff will request the pregnant subject to notify the CRU of the outcome of the 
pregnancy ( e.g., birth, l oss, termination). To help ensure this, the CRU staff will follow up 
with the subject until the end of pregnancy, if in compliance with the CRU ’s standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) and with the subject’s consent. This request and the subject’s response w ill be documented in the subject’s source document.  
6.4.7.5 Smoking Cessation Information 
At Screening and prior to discharge  from the study (or upon e arly t ermination ), all subjects 
will be advised that to reduce the health effects of smoking, the best thing to do is to quit, and will be encouraged to contact a qualified medical  professional for advice on smoking 
cessation.  
7. DATA ANALYSIS  
Data will be handled and processed according to  and/or the site’s SOP s, as 
appropriate, which are written based on the principles of GCP . A brief description of the 
statistical analysis is included below, detailed methodology for all summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial will be documented in a statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) prepared by  and agreed upon by the Sponsor. The SAP may modify the plans 
outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoints and/or their analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. If deemed appropriate, 

CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 58 additional statistical analyses other than those described in this section may be performed and 
included in the plan.  
7.1 Sample Size Estimation  
The sample size chosen for this s tudy was selected without statistical considerations. It has 
been determined adequate to meet the study objectives.  
7.2 Analysis Populations  
7.2.1 Safety Population  
The Safety Population will include all subjects who have successfully completed eligibility 
requirements  after checking in to the CRU and used at least one study product. 
7.2.2 Outcomes Population  
The Outcomes Population is a subset of the safety population and will consist of subjects who used a study product and have evaluable PK, biomarkers, subjective effects, BP, HR, 
spirometry, or topography data. This population will be used in the summary and analysis of PK, subjective effects, topography, biomarkers, spirometry, and product use, and all available data will be included in the summary tables to the extent possible.  
7.3 Data Analysis, Summarization, and Statistical Methods 
SAS software (version 9.3 or higher) will be used for all data presentation and summarization including summary tables, graphs, and data listings.  In general, all data will be listed  by 
subject and time point and summarized by study product, time point, and sex using descriptive statistics appropriate for the endpoint. Figures will be used to display the data graphically.  
Missing data will not be imputed. Where individual data points are missing because of dropouts or other reasons, the data will be considered missing at random and summarized based on reduced denominators.  
7.3.1 Nicotine Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Individual nicotine concentrations will be adjusted for baseline nicotine (“bas eline -adjusted”) 
and all PK parameters will be calculated based on the adjusted concentrations. Baseline 
adjustment will be performed by subtraction of the pre- existing nicotine concentration from 
each nicotine concentration obtained after test product adm inistration in that period/day for 
each subject using the following equation:  
C
t  = C t unadjusted  – [C 0 · e-Kel· t1] 
where C t is the adjusted concentration at time t, C t unadjusted  is the observed concentration at 
time t, C 0 is the pre -product use concentr ation ( -5 minutes), Kel = ln (2)
t½, t½ is 2 hours 
(average nicotine half -life), t is the actual sampling time since product administration, and t1 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA22736 (NER 01/003) Amendment 1, 04Dec2019  
 
Page 59 is the actual sampling time since the time of the pre- product use sample. Any resulting 
negative concentration values following the baseline adjustment will be set to 0.  
Nicotine PK parameters will be determined from the adjusted individual subject plasma 
concentration -time profiles by applying a non -compartmental approach using appropriate 
validated PK software (e.g., Phoenix® WinNonlin® version 6.3 or higher).  
For each study product and each first product use session on Days  2, 4, 6, and 8, the 
following PK parameters will be calculated from the baseline- adjusted nicotine 
concentration -time data:  
AUC0-180 Area under the nicotine concentration -time curve from time 0 (defined as the 
start of the first product use session) to the 180- minute time point as 
calculated by the linear trapezoidal method  
Cmax  Maximum baseline -adjusted plasma concentration.  
Tmax  Time to reach the maximum baseline- adjusted plasma concentration. If the 
maximum value occurs at more than one time point, Tmax is defined as the first time point with this value.  
Plasma concentrations below the limit of quantitation will be set to on e-half of the lower 
limit of quantitation for the calculation of descriptive statistics of unadjusted plasma nicotine concentrations and for the calculation of baseline- adjusted nicotine concentrations.  
Nicotine concentrations and PK parameters will be lis ted by subject and summarized by 
study product, by sex and overall using descriptive statistics. 
7.3.1.1 Analysis of Variance 
A linear mixed model for analysis of variance will be performed on the log -transformed PK 
parameters Cmax and AUC following the first product use session on each of Days  2, 4, 6, 
and 8 . The model will include sequence, study product, and period as fixed effects and 
subject -nested -within -sequence as a random effect. Sequence will be tested using 
subject -nested -within -sequence as the error ter m. Geometric least -squares means (LSM) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided for the PK parameters of Cmax and AUC by 
study product. Geometric LSM ratio, 95% CIs of geometric LSM ratio, and p- values will be 
provided for the study product comparisons in Cmax and AUC. The comparisons of interest will include each of the study products compared to each other.  
The above statistical analyses will be performed using the appropriate SAS procedure.  
Non-parametric analysis (Wilcoxon Signed Rank test) will be performed for the comparisons 
of Tmax.  
Details of the statistical methods will be provided in the SAP.

Page 60 7.3.2 Biomarkers  
Biomarker concentrations reported as below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) will be reported 
as “BLQ” in the listings and set to one -half of the limit of quantitation for summarization and 
statistical analysis.  
The following variables will be determined and summarized for each urine biomarker.  
• Measured concentration  
• Total biomar ker mass excreted per 24 hours  
• Creatinine -adjusted excretion level  
Absolute and percent change- from-baseline will be determined for the mass excreted and

change -from-baseline value will be used as the primary variable in the statistical analysis.  
7.3.2.1 Urine  Nicotine Equivalents  
Nicotine equivalents will be calculated as the molar sum of nicotine and 5  major nicotine 
metabolites. Values of individual components reported as BLQ will be set to one- half of the 
limit of quantitation prior use in the calculation below. Missing urine data will not be 
imputed. 
Nicotine equivalents (µg/mL) =  (nicotine [ng/mL]/162.23 [mg/mmol] + nicotine -gluc 
(ng/mL)/338.36 [mg/mmol] + cotinine [ng/mL]/176.22 [mg/mmol] + cotinine -gluc 
[ng/mL]/352.34 [mg/mmol] + trans-3'- hydroxycotinine [ng/mL]/192.22 [mg/mmol] + trans -
3'-hydroxycotinine -gluc [ng/mL]/368.34 [mg/mmol]) x 162.23 (mg/mmol) x 1 µg/1000 ng  
7.3.2.2 Calculation  of Total Mass Excreted 
Urine biomarker concentrations will be converted into biomarker quantities excreted in 
24 hours by multiplying the measured concentration by the total weight (i.e., 1 kilogram = 
1 liter) of urine produced by the subject during the 24 -hour period. 
7.3.2.3 Creatinine Adjustments  
Urine creat inine will be measured and used to adjust the values of the primary and secondary 
urine BoE and BoPH as follows.

FULL PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Impact of Contact Lens Coefficient of 
Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 4 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  1.0 Objectives  
The primary study objectives are to determine the amount of L id W iper 
Epitheliopathy (LWE) induced in subjects  after contact lens fitting  that do not 
have LWE at study enrollment . Subjects in the trial will be fit in 2 contact lenses  
with different coefficients of friction (CoF ). One eye will be fit in a contact lens 
with a low coefficient of friction  (Acuvue Oasys ®, Johnson & Johnson Vision, 
Jacksonville FL)  while the c ontralateral eye will be fit in a contact lens with a 
high CoF  (Air Optix® Night & Day® Aqua , Ft. Worth, TX) , as reported in the 
scientific literature . The eye receiving each lens will be assigned randomly. The 
presence of LWE will be assessed at 2 different time points:  
• Approximately 2 hours after contact lens fitting  and 
• After 7( ±2) days  of contact lens wear  
 
Study Hypothes es: Contact lenses with a greater coefficient of friction  will induce 
a greater amount of LWE  than contact lenses with a lower coefficient of friction.  
The presence of LWE will be assessed at 2 different study time points . As such, 
the following hypotheses will be tested: 
 
After one week of contact lens wear  
• H01: There is no statistically signific ant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact lens es with different coefficients of friction   
• Ha1: There is a statistically significant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact lens es with different coefficients of friction   
After 2 hours of c ontact lens wear  
• H02: There is no statistically significant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact lens es with different coefficients of friction  
• Ha2: There is a statistically significant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact lens es with different coefficients of friction   
 
2.0 Background  
Today in clinical practice, dropout from contact lens wear  remains a significant 
problem , with up to 34% of patients discontinuing lens wear. Contact lens 
discomfort is one of the main causes of contact lens dropout. There are many 
factors that may play a role in contact lens comfort, but the primary factor may be the interaction of the eyelid and the contact lens material. It has been proposed 
that reduced contact lens  lubricity, a measure of the frictio n inherent to a contact 
lens material, may lead to increased contact lens discomfort . Contact lens 
lubricity can be described by the coefficient of friction (CoF)  of the contact lens 
material . CoF has been reported to be inversely proportional t o reported contact 
lens comfort;  therefore, materials with a higher CoF tend to be less comfortable. 
FULL PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Impact of Contact Lens Coefficient of 
Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 5 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  While CoF is a useful lab oratory  metric, it cannot be measured clinically. 
Therefore, a clinical corollary for CoF may be useful in determining which 
contact lens mat erials will minimize the potential for contact lens dropout. A 
possible clinical corollary for CoF is Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE), which has  
been reported to be related to contact lens discomfort. LWE leads to a loss of 
superficial epithelial cells in the lid wiper region of the eye lid. If CoF is indeed 
related to contact lens discomfort, subjects wearing a high CoF lens could 
potentially develop greater amounts of LWE compared to that observed with a 
low CoF lens .  
While previous studies have determined the amount of LWE present in habitual contact lens wearers and non- contact lens patients, it is currently unknown how 
quickly LWE may develop in patients after contact lens fitting. Development of 
LWE in the post -contact lens fitting period may allow clinicians to predict the 
potential for contact lens discomfort and future dropout. This pilot study will 
collect data examining the development of LWE in the period immediately following contact lens fitting (2 hours post -fit) and after approximately 1 week of 
contact lens wear, corresponding to the time for a typical post -contact lens fitting 
assessment in clinical practice.  
 
3.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria  
Potential study subjects must meet the following study inclusion criteria: 
1. Must be able to read  and understand the study informed consent  
2. Must be a minimum of 18 years of age and less than 46 years of age at 
study enrollment  
3. Must be healthy non -soft contact lens wearers (neophytes), or experienced 
contact lens wearers that have not worn their contact l enses for a minimum 
of 7 days  
4. Have a spherical equivalent refractive error between –0.75 to –6.50DS  at 
the spectacle plane  
5. The subject must be able to attend study visits at the prescribed visit times and adhere to the study instructions  
Potential study s ubjects cannot meet any of the following study exclusion criteria:  
1. Pregnant and/or lactating females by self -report  
2. Presence of current LWE on the upper eyelid (>0.5 in height or width)  
3. Has greater than –1.00DC of refractive cylinder  
4. Has greater than 1.00D of anisometropia  
5. Is aphakic  
6. Has clinically significant corneal or conjunctival staining that would prevent contact lens fitting, as assessed with sodium fluorescein dye  
FULL PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Impact of Contact Lens Coefficient of 
Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 6 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  7. Has s ignificant ocular surface disease (e.g. Sjögrens Disease, Stevens -
Johns on Syndrome, etc.)  or significant Dry Eye Syndrome  
8. Has clinically significant corneal vascularization or central corneal scaring  
9. Has active ocular surface infection (e.g. conjunctivitis)  
10. Has a p ositive h istory of eyelid surgery  or trauma   
11. Has a p ositive  history of refractive surgery  
12. Takes m edications that significantly impact contact lens comfort and /or 
ocular surface health  
13. Has taken part in another contact lens or contact lens solution clinical trial 
within the last 7 days  
14. Is unwilling to have eyes photographed or video recorded  
Potential subjects will be  initially  screened for study eligibility  through collection 
of demographic data and medical history . An upper age limit for study inclusion 
is set at 46 years of age to 1) prevent the inclusion of presbyopic patients (i.e. 
those that need bifocal glasses), given that the contact lenses used in the study are single vision contact lenses and 2) reduce the number of individuals who would 
screen fail due to significant dry eye disease.  Subjects will comp lete a 
questionnaire, the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), and subjects with a 
score ≥23 will be excluded from the study. A s lit lamp evaluation  will be 
performed to  screen for  the presence of LWE  of the upper lid and for significant 
corneal/conjunctiv al staining that would prevent contact lens fitting. If the subject 
does not have LWE, the subjects will be refracted to determine eligibility  based 
on their refractive error. If the refractive error is within the study specified 
inclusion criteria, the su bject will be fit into contact lenses.  
4.0 Vulnerable Populations  
The following vulnerable  populations will be excluded from the study:  
1. Adults unable to consent  
2. Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers under the age of 18)  
3. Pregnant/lactating women  
4. Prisoner s 
The following vulnerable  population may be included in the study:  
1. Students for whom the principal investigators have direct access to/influence on grades .  
 Study subjects may be students for whom the principal investigators have access to or influence over their grades. For this reason, the principal investigators will not be responsible for recruiting or obtaining consent from students in their own 
FULL PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Impact of Contact Lens Coefficient of 
Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 7 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  courses i n order to prevent undue influence or coercion. A study team member  
(e.g. study coordinator)  without access to or influence on grades will be 
responsible for these tasks. 
 
5.0 Number of Subjects  
 
The proposed single -site study will be conducted at The Ocular Surface Institute 
at the University of Houston College of Optometry. Up to 60 subjects will be 
screened for stu dy inclusion, with the goal of  completing 20 subjects . Subjects 
that screen fail m ay be rescreened for study inclusion up to 3 additional times  at 
the discretion of the study investigator .  
Currently, there is no information on the time from contact lens fitting to the development of LWE. This pilot study is designed to collect data whi ch can be 
used to determine the sample size required to conduct a large r-scale clinical trial. 
It is anticipated that enrolling 20 subjects will approach the requirements  of the 
central limit theorem for statistical analysis . Since the  subjects in the stud y will be 
wearing FDA -approved contact lenses on a daily wear modality (i.e. not sleeping 
in contact lenses), the  study doe s not present more than mini mal risk to the 
subject and a power analysis is not required.  
 
6.0 Recruitment Methods 
 Potential subjects will be recruited from the patients, students and staff of the University Eye Institute/University of Houston College of Optometry, as well as the surrounding community via verbal communication, print media (e.g. study fliers, newspaper adverts), telephone  and electronic media (e.g email, The Ocular 
Surface Institute Website, social media). Additionally, potential subjects will be identified and recruited via The Ocular Surface Institute’s research database.  
The total duration of an individual subject's pa rticipation in the study will be 
approximately 1 week (±2 da ys). The study will consist of 3 visits  on 2 days . Visit 
1.1 will be a pre -fitting clinical assessment and contact lens fitting. Visit 1.2 will 
be a post contact lens insertion assessment  complete d approximately 2 hours after 
contact lens fitting in Visit 1.1. Visit 2 will be a 7 day (±2 days) post -contact l ens 
fitting assessment for LWE. Expected visit timing is summarized in the table 
below:  
Anticipated Visit Duration  
Study Visit  Duration  
Visit  1.1: Baseline and Contact lens fitting  90 minutes  
Approximately 2 hour waiting period  
Visit 1.2: 2 -hour post contact lens insertion  55 minutes

Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 8 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  Visit 2: 1 -week post contact lens fitting  55 minutes  
The anticipated duration to enroll and complete all study subjects is 
approximately 3 months . The estimated date for the investigators to complete 
primary analyses for this study is October, 2017.  
 
7.0 Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint s are as follows:  
• Examine the development of LWE  post -contact lens fitting at the 
following time points  
o 1-week post contact lens fitting  
o 2 hours after contact lens fit ting 
The s econdary study endpoints are as follows:  
• Examine the level of expression in ocular surface tear MMP s post -contact 
lens fitting at the following time points  
o Pre-contact lens fitting  
o 1-week post contact lens fitting  
o 2 hours after contact lens fit  
 
8.0 Procedures Involved  
The study is a clinical trial. Twenty subjects who are either neophytes or 
experienced soft contact lens wearers who have not worn contacts  for at least the  
past 7 days will be enrolled. Patients will be seen for 3 visits over a period of 
approximately 1 week. The pre -contact lens insertion assessment (Visit 1.1) will 
determine subject eligibility for the study and will take approximately 90 minutes. Subjects will then be released to a waiting room for a 2 -hour waiting period . The 
2-hour post contact lens fitting assessment (Visit 1.2) will take approximately 55 
minutes.  The 7 day post -insertion assessment (Visit 2) will take approximately 55 
minutes.  
 Data from subject’s  routine medical care that is pertinent to the study (e.g. topical 
ophthalmic medications, oral medications, etc .) will be collected by querying the 
subject (see Step 1.1.3 below). This data will be considered subject source 
documentation and will be kept as part of the subject’s study  binder  in a secure 
room in the Ocular Surface Institute (TOSI).

 The tears collected by capillary tubes will be stored at - 80°C until luminex 
multibead analysis. 15 µg of total protein will be analyzed for matrix 
metal loproteinases (MMP) -1, -2, -7, -9, -10. Pre - and post -contact lens wear 
concentrations of MMP will be compared for each subject. MMPs are a family of zinc proteases and an increase in MMP expression occurs in response to a wide range of stimuli, including adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines and hormones and is associated with ocular surface damage. The correlation coefficient, r, will be determined between LWE and the tear film levels of MMPs.  
A p≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant . 
 
Layman’s Description of Procedures  
Patient demographics  The subjects will be asked questions about  their 
age, sex, race and  ethnicity . 
History  The subjects will be asked questions about  their 
systemic health, ocular  disease and surg ical 
history . 
Concomitant Medications  The subjects will be asked questions about  their 
current ocular and systemic medications . 
Habitual Contact Lens 
Information  The subject s will be asked questions about how 
they use their current contact lenses, such as their current  contact lens brand and wear time, as 
performed during a normal eye exam . 
Auto -refraction  A machine will shine light into a subject's eye 
and will estimate their prescription using different powered lenses  without making contact 
with the eye . 
Oculus Keratograph  A machine uses a video camera to determine 
how long it takes for a subject's tear film to 
FULL PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Impact of Contact Lens Coefficient of 
Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 14 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021    evaporate and the height of the pooled tears 
between the lower lid and the ocular surface 
without making contact with the eye . 
Phenol Red Thread  A small thread containing a pH indicator that 
turns from red to yellow when it contacts tears 
will be placed at  the subject's lower lid margin 
and left for 15 s econds. The length that the tears 
have traveled will be measured.  This test does 
not require anesthesia.  
Slit Lamp Exam  A specialized microscope is used to shine light 
on the eye and to examine the health of the 
eyelids and the front of the eye.  
Subjective 
Refraction/Spherical Equivalent Refraction The subject’s prescription is determined by 
placing differ ent power  lenses in front of the 
subject’s eye, according to the subject’s 
responses.  
Contact Lens Fitting  A contact lens is placed on the eye and the fit is 
assessed (how much is moves, where it sits on the eye, etc.). Th is is done using a slit lamp 
biomicroscope.  
Contact Lens Over -
Refraction and Power Adjustment  Lenses will be placed in front of the subject’s 
eye while wearing the study contact lenses to determine if the prescription needs to be changed according to the subject’s responses. The contact 
lens power will be adjusted if needed.  
Questionnaire: Ocular 
Surface Disease Index 
(OSDI )  The questionnaire asks the subject ’s vision 
during various tasks, eye pain, comfort in 
various environments , etc.

Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 15 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  9.0 Setting  
All study v isits will be conducted at the University of Houston College of 
Optometry at The Ocular Surface Institute (TOSI)  within the Human and 
Biological Sciences Building .  
 
10.0 Drugs or Devices   
No investigational medical devices or investigational ophthalmic pharmaceuticals 
will be assessed in this study.  The contact lenses fit in the study (Acuvue Oasys, 
Johnson & Johnson Vision Care; Air Optix Night and Day  Aqua , Alcon 
Laboratories) are commercially available, FD A approved contact lenses  that will 
be fit per the manufacturers recommended fitting guide on a daily wear basis (i.e. subjects will not sleep in lenses) . The ophthalmic drops used in the trial to 
evaluate LWE (sodium fluorescein, lissamine green) are comm ercially available 
ocular diagnostic agents  commonly used in clinical practice .  
 
11.0 Risks to Subjects  
The risks to the subjects  in the trial are the same risks found in standard clinical 
practice.  During study procedures, there is the risk of mild ocular di scomfort 
during clinical procedures due to light being shined on the eye (e.g. Slit lamp biomicroscopy), by being asked to not blink for a short period of time  during a 
procedure (e.g. Oculus Keratograph NITBUT), during surface tear collection  or 
through t he use of topical ophthalmic diagnostic agents (sodium fluorescein, 
lissamine green). Potential discomfort from these procedures is transient and self -
limiting.  
Contact lenses will be fit as part of this study. The US Food and Drug 
Administration consider  daily wear contact lenses Class II medical devices . While 
most individuals wear contact lenses successfully without incident, problems with contact lenses or lens care products can result  in serious injury to the eye. 
Ulcerative keratitis (infection of the cornea), can develop rapidly and lead to loss 
of vision.  Ulcerative keratitis is estimated to happen to about 4.1 out of 10,000 people who use daily wear contact lenses.  The overall risk of ulcerative keratitis 
may be reduced by carefully foll owing di rections for lens care, and subjects in the 
study will be educated on proper contact lens use and care.   
The following problems may also occur when wearing contact lenses:  
• Burning, stinging, and/or itching of the eyes  
• Less comfort after daily wear than wh en the lens was first placed on the eye  
• A feeling like there is something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area)  
• Reduced vision or temporary loss of vision due to peripheral infiltrates (white blood 
cells), peripheral corneal ulcers (inflammation of the  cornea), and/or corneal erosion 
(defects in the corneal surface)  
• Local or generalized edema (swelling)

 Page 16 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  • Corneal neovascularization (small blood vessels growing into the cornea)  
• Corneal staining (defect in the corneal surface)  
• Redness  
• Tarsal abnormalitie s (bumps on the inside upper eye lid)  
• Iritis (internal inflammation of the eye)  
• Conjunctivitis (infection or inflammation of the white part of the eye or under the 
eyelids)  
• Excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or redness of the eye  
• Poor visual acuit y 
• Blurred vision  
• Rainbows or halos around objects  
• Sensitivity to light  
• Dry eyes may also occur if lenses are worn continuously or for too long a time  
Many of the potential problems associated with contact lens wear are self -limiting and 
can be resolved with discontinuation of lens wear.  These problems can be minimized or 
avoided with proper contact lens fitting and follow -up. Subjects in the study will be 
examined approximately 7 days after contact lens fitting, which is typical in clinical 
practice for  contact lenses worn in a daily wear modality.  
Subject  safety will be monitored in the trial through slit lamp evaluation of the ocular 
surface. Subjects will be educated to potential risk with contact lens wear and instructed 
to discontinue contact lens w ear and contact the study investigators if they experience 
any eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, redness of the eye, or other 
problems. 
Subjects will be instructed that in the event they experience signs or  sym ptoms 
associated with a poten tial adverse event, they should contact the study personnel  
immediately for evaluation.  
12.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
 
There is no direct benefit that the individual subjects may experience from taking part in the research; however, participation in the t rial may lead to clinical insights that could 
potentially predict future contact lens comfort in patients.  
 
13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw consent to participate in the study at any time. Subjects  
may be withdrawn from the trial by the study investigators if they are lost to 
follow up (fail to complete V isit 2 within the allotted  time period), become 
pregnant during the trial , have a study -related adverse event that warrants  study 
withdrawal  or they fail to follow the study instructions .  
 
14.0 Costs/Payments to Subjects  
 
FULL PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Impact of Contact Lens Coefficient of 
Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 17 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  There are no expected additional costs to subjects that participate in the study. There is no 
cost to subjects for contact lens fitting in this study. Subjects will be provided contact lenses and care so lution at no cost for the duration of the study. Subjects will be provided 
with a token for parking  at each study visit ( if necessary ). Subjects that complete contact 
lens fitting (i.e. that is completes both study V isit 1 .1 and 1.2)  will be compensated $30.  
Subjects who complete the 1- week follow up will be compensated $10. If subjects are 
determined ineligible at screening (screen fail), the subject will be compensated $5, with the opportunity for a total of 3 re -screen ings at the investigators discretio n.  Total subject 
reimbursement (without rescreening visits) will be $40. Subjects will be compensated using Amazon electronic gift cards in the amounts indicated above, delivered to the subject via an e -mail address provided by the subject, after completi on of their last study 
visit. Subjects who fail to complete a visit will not be compensated for that visit. Subjects will be instructed to contact the study PI in the event that they do not receive the electronic gift card.   
 
15.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
 The risks to subjects from participation in the study are minimal. The clinical procedures used in the study (slit lamp biomicroscopy, non- invasive tear break up time) are 
commonly used clinical procedure in optometry and ophthalmology and may cause some discomfort due to light shining on the surface of the eye , during ocular surface tear 
collection  or during contact lens wear . In the rare case that a subject is injured as part of 
their participation in the study, the subje ct will be responsible for any associated medical 
bills.  
 
16.0 Confidentiality  
 Subjects will be assigned a unique subject ID. Subjects IDs are two digits and should start at 01 and continue in the order of enrollment. No one outside of the research team will  
have access to the subject identifiers. A key to the study code will be maintained for 3 years  at the time of study completion ( i.e. Last Subject, Last Visit) .  
 
Any source documents with patient identifiable information will be kept only at the local site (inf ormed consent form, linking log). Individual documents will be kept in a secure 
room in the Ocular Surface Institute (TOSI).  
  
17.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects.  
 
Those who are potentially eligible and interested in the study w ill be referred to a study 
investigator or coordinator who will discuss the study with the patient. This discussion will take place in a quiet, private area and as much time as necessary will be spent discussing 
the details of the study.

18.0 Informed Consent  Process  
 
The participant will be provided an opportunity  to read the informed consent and to have 
any questions answered before agreeing to participate. Prior to any testing, the investigator or study coordinator will obtain written informed consent from all participants. The consent form will be signed and dated by both the participant and a member of the study personnel who has been approved to obtain consent. The participant will receive a copy of the signed 
consent documents and the originals will be f iled in the subject binder on site in a secure 
location.  
 
19.0 HIPAA  
 
We will be collecting demographic information along with general medical and eye health information. Since protected health information will be collected, the Health Insurance Portability a nd Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form will be 
included as part of the Informed Consent process.   
 
The linked PHI will be destroyed upon completion of the study. PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by law, for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of protected health information for which an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is not required by 45 CFR 164.512.   
 
20.0 Data Management  
 
Paper source documents ( i.e. case report forms ) will only be asso ciated with a subject ID 
number and will not contain direct subject identifiers . 
 
21.0 Specimen Use and Banking  
The tear specimens will be stored in a - 80°C freezer until luminex multibead 
analysis. The specimens will be stored for up to 3 months. The principal 
investigators and other membe rs of the research team will have access to the 
specimens.  
 
22.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
 
There are no plans to share study results with subjects as it will not directly be nefit their 
eye/vision health. If findings are discovered during the trial  that potentially have an 
impact on the subject’s health or wellbeing, the subject will be educated to these findings.  
 
23.0 Resources   
 
FULL PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Impact of Contact Lens Coefficient of 
Friction (CoF) on the Development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)  
 Page 19 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  The study team completed all necessary ethics training requirements. The co -PIs (Eric 
Ritchey, OD, PhD and Rachel Redfe rn, OD, PhD) have over a decade of clinical research 
experience conducting clinical studies and will oversee the other study personnel.  
The number of subjects to be recruited is based on the typical number of subjects 
needed to approach the central limit theorem. With an abundance of contact lens 
wearers in the surrounding community, we believe that we should be able to 
complete enrollment within 3 months.  
This study utilizes the clinics of The Ocular Surface Institute to see study subjects on the 
campus of the University of Houston.

Addendum: Statistical Analyses  
 
Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS v26 (IBM) and GraphPad. When data were 
not signi ficantly different from a normal distribution (non- invasive tear break up time, 
tear meniscus height), statistical analyses were conducted using paired t -tests and 
repeated -measures analyses of variance (RM -ANOVA), with adjusted post -hoc t -tests, 
when appr opriate. For NITBUT and TMH, the RM -ANOVA included two repeated 
factors —lens type (Acuvue Oasys and Air Optix Night and Day) and time (baseline, 2 
hours post -fitting and 7 days after lens fitting). For data that was not normally distributed 
(LWE staining),  Friedman and Mann- Whitney non- parametric statistics were performed.  
MMP concentrations were adjusted by multiplying raw values by the dilution factor. Tear film MMP concentrations under the level of detection (LOD) were divided by √2 (Croghan et al. 2003) . Outliers in MMP data sets were analyzed using the ROUT function 
in Graphpad Prism 8.4.1 and were removed prior to analysis.

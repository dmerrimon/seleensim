1.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Ventricular tachycardia (VT)  and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)  
 
Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the single largest  cause of death in the developed world. In 
the United States, over 325,000 deaths are due to SCA; more than lung cancer , breast 
cancer and AIDS combined  [1]. A majority of SCA is due to c ardiac arrhythmias, namely 
ventricular tachycardia (VT). Underlying cardiomyopathies and scarring most often cause 
ventricular arrhythmias. The scar from the cardiomyopathy (i .e., previous heart attack) 
forms the substrate for abnormal electrical circuits within the heart, which causes VT. 
Survival from an out -of-hospital SCA is only  10%.  Patients who survive SCA have an 
estimated 40 -60% chance of developing another ventricular arrhythmia in the 
subsequent year. [2, 3] 
 
1.2 Current management of VT  
 
For patients who have survived SCA from VT, the current clinical management strategy 
consists of two goals: 1) prevent the arrhythmia from happening again and 2) protect the 
patient from dying if the arrhythmia does happen again.   
 
The second goal (protection) consists of installation of a n impla ntable cardiac defibrillator 
(ICD) into the body .  This device is used to deliver a burst of energy (shock) to restore 
regular rhythm if VT were to recur.  While life -saving, shocks from an ICD are painful to 
patients and repeated shocks lead to a poor qua lity of life, largely driven by anxiety  and 
depression [4-6].  Some evidence has also linked ICD shocks to increased risk of death [7].  
 
To prevent VT and subsequent ICD therapies, patients can opt to take oral antiarrhythmic 
medications. Long -term medication use usu ally consists of administration of amiodarone, 
which has a significant cumulative adverse effect profile, including toxicities to hepatic, 
pulmonary, thyroid, skin, ophthalmologic  and neurologic systems. An invasive catheter 
ablation procedure is  often vie wed as second -line, adjunctive therapy for the 
management of VT after failure of medication . This procedure generally takes 4 -8 hours, 
often uses general anesthesia, and requires access to the inside of the heart through the 
veins or arteries of the leg or  access to the outside of the heart through the skin 
underneath the breastbone. Long flexible catheters are inserted and maneuvered to 
identify critical components of the abnormal electrical circuit that causes VT. Once 
identified, radiofrequency energy is  applied to the tip of the catheter (usually 3.5mm tip) 
to heat up the critical tissue to the point of cellular destruction (ablation), thus rendering 
it electrically inert. These critical components of the circuit are often located within 
abnormal cardiac  tissue , most commonly from previous myocardial infarctions.  
 
Despite important advances in invasive cardiac mapping and catheter ablation 
technologies, the success rates of catheter ablation to prevent VT in patients with 
Version 09/26/2018   page 6 of 41 structural heart disease remain modest. Five randomized clinical trials of VT ablation 
procedures have been performed [8-12] and are summarized in a recent meta -analysis   
[13]. Other large multi -center studies have been published which did not randomize 
catheter ablation against medical t herapy but are nonetheless important when assessing 
the overall success rates of this therapy [14-17]. In the meta -analysis that included 457 
participants with largely ischemic cardiomyopathy and mean left ventricular ejection 
fraction of 30 -35%, the recurrence rat e of VT was 35% (range 12 -50%) with catheter 
ablation (n=266) during a follow up of 6 -22 months.  This compared favorably to a 
recurrence rate of 55% (range 33 -75%) in the medical -only control group (n=191).  In other 
large prospective observational studies , risk of VT recurrence at one year after extensive 
catheter ablation approaches 50%  [14-17].  
 
VT ablation procedures can “fail” for many reasons. Commonly cited limitations  include: 
1) inability to map hemodynamically unstable VT; 2) difficult mapping due to multiple 
different VT circuits; 3) inability to create necessary radiofrequency ablation due to depth 
of myocardial scar ; 4) inability to reach the critical component of t he VT circuit with a 
catheter; 5 ) protective structures (i .e., epicardial  fat) around the critical component of the 
VT circuit; and 6) late development of new abnormal circuits through myocardial scar 
after the original ablation. Methods to improve the success of VT ablation procedures 
need to address these key lim itations.  Examples of alternative methods in development 
for enhanced tissue destruction include: 1) injection of alcohol into smaller blood vessels 
to induce larger myocardial infarction; 2) development of catheters with extendable 
needles to impale ventr icular myocardium to allow deeper radiofrequency ablation; and 
3) using two ablation catheters to encircle the critical component of the scar in hopes of 
deeper penetration of thermal energy.   
 
Because of its invasive nature, there are risks to a catheter ablation procedure. Risks of 
serious  complications include death ( 3%), stroke/transient ischemic attack (1 -2%), cardiac 
perforation (1 -2%),  third -degree heart block (1.6%) , pericardial effusion/tamponade (1%), 
worsening heart failure and cardiogenic shock (1-2%), uncontrollable  VT (1%) , and sepsis 
(<1%) . Anecdotally, several centers report higher rates of adverse events in patients with 
more advanced and global cardiomyopathies. Future improvements in VT ablation 
technologies will need to address these significant adverse event rates, particularly 
among the sickest patients , and for those who have already failed traditional catheter 
ablation . A noninvasive  approach to cardiac ablation has the potential to significantly 
improve safety  and provide a viable  option for VT refractory to ablation and medication . 
An attractive alternative to thermal ablation with radiofrequency energy may be  
noninvasive ster eotactic radiotherapy .            
 
1.3 Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)  
 
Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT), also known as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy 
(SABR) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), is a culmination of several decades worth of 
progress in radiation oncology, allowing for the precise delivery of high doses of radiation 
Version 09/26/2018   page 7 of 41 to targets in the b ody over few (typically, < 5) fractions with minimal exposure of normal 
adjacent tissue.  [18] 
 
Such treatments have been successfully used to treat malignant and benign tumors in all 
body sites, most commonly in the brain, lung, liver, and spine.  Advances in image 
guidance (orthogonal kV:kV imaging, conebea m CT (CBCT), etc.) and motion management 
(4D-CT, internal and external fiducials, etc.) have been central to the success of SBRT, 
particularly for tumors that are mobile.  For example, it is now well established by multiple 
prospective clinical trials that  SBRT delivered over 3 -5 fractions results in local control 
rates > 90% for inoperable early stage lung cancer, with remarkably low rates of toxicity 
(<5-10% risk of grade 2+ pneumonitis, 15% risk of grade 1+ chest wall pain). [19, 20])  An 
example of a typical lung cancer SBRT plan and follow -up is provided in Figure 1.

All manufacturers of modern radiotherapy delivery systems have SBRT options or 
capabilities, with a variety of different methods for delivery.  None of these delivery 
methods has been shown to be any more successful at delivering SBRT treatments than 
anoth er when performed in the context of a carefully commissioned machine and 
workflow including standardization of immobilization, imaging, planning techniques and 
tissue constraints, and plan and machine QA.  To this end, SBRT has now become a 
commonly used a nd mainstream method for tumor treatments with rapidly expanding 
indications.  
 
1.4 SBRT for arrhythmia  
 
Preclinical dose finding studies in porcine models have demonstrated that large (25 to 35 
Gy), single fraction doses of SBRT can be accurately delivered to  discrete targets in the 
heart, resulting in fibrosis that correlates to elect rical  isolation, similar to that found in 
catheter ablation.  [21-26] In the earliest of these publications, Maguire et al  reported on 
single fraction Cyber Knife  radiosurgery (25 Gy  (N=1), 35 Gy (N=1)) delivery to the right 
superior and le ft superior pulmonary veins in two Hanford mini -swine. [21] Animals were 
followed for six months and underwent electrophysiology ( EP) testing, transesophageal 
echocardiography, and subsequently pathologic analysis.  At the last time point, th e EP 
study documented intended pulmonary vein isolation (electrical block) using a  decapolar 
Lasso catheter , and e chocardiographic monitoring of atrial and ventricular function six 
months post radiosurgery  demonstrated normal cardiac function .  Histologic analysis 
showed  transmural fibrosis and contiguity  of the ablation scar within the target .  No 
adverse events were noted.  
 
In a follow -up study from the same group, Sharma et al reported  results from a dose  (25 
to 50 Gy)  and location response experiment using single fraction Cyber Knife  radiosurgery 
in 16 Hanford -Sinclair mini swine. [23] Targets included the cavotricuspid isthmus, AV 
node,  pulmona ry vein –left atrial junction, or left atrial appendage .  Ranging from 25 to 
196 days after treatment, animals were investigated with  repeat electroanatomic voltage 
mapping and transesophageal  echocardiography, when possible. The animals then were 
sacrifice d and pathology specimens taken.   Dose finding suggested that 25 Gy was the 

Version 09/26/2018   page 9 of 41 minimum dose needed to produce an electrophysiologic effect , and this was consistently 
observed by 90 days.  The method was deemed feasible for producing bidirectional 
cavotricuspi d isthmus block  and AV nodal conduction block .  In addition, the pulmonary 
vein –left atrial  junction and left atrial appendage showed marked voltage reduction  to 
less than 0.05 mV .  Histologic analysis demonstrated effects consistent with radiotherapy 
effect confined to the targeted areas with no evidence of damage outside the heart.  
 
In a more recent publication from Blan ck et al , a dose response experiment was 
performed on 9 mini -pigs (0 Gy and 17.5 -35 Gy in 2.5 -Gy steps ) delivered to the right 
superior pulmonary vein . [7] Baseline MRI and electrophysiology were performed at 
baseline and 6 months after treatment. In contrast to the CyberHeart group, t ransmural 
scarring of cardi ac muscle tissue was noted with doses ≥ 32.5 Gy.   Likewise, complete 
circumferential scarring of the RSPV was not achieved  at any dose level.  Heart function 
was not affected, as verified by MRI and electrocardiogram evaluation.   Adjacent critical 
structu res were not damaged, as verified by pathology . 
 
While the reasons for discrepancy in the required single fraction dose for effect are 
somewhat unclear, part of the difference may stem purely from subtleties in differences 
in dose planning and delivery  for a given prescription dose .  In the studies from the 
CyberHeart group, for a prescription dose of 25 Gy, maximum doses in the target volume 
may have exceeded 120 -130% of prescription dose (Max doses > 30 -39 Gy).  In contrast, 
in the study from Blan ck et al, for a suggested dose of 32.5 Gy, the maximum dose to the 
target with their delivery system would generally not exceed 107%  of prescription dose 
by convention  (Max dose 35 Gy).  As such, both studies may in fact be suggesting the same 
dose range for e ffect, despite the differences in prescription dose.  
 
The published literature on the use of SBRT for treatment of arrhythmia in humans is 
limited and appears restricted to only 5 patients to date  (November 2015 ).  The first -in-
man report was presented in poster form at the Heart Rhythm On Demand meeting in 
2013 [27] and has since been published  [28].  In th is first reported experience by Loo et 
al, a case of a 71 year old male with medically refracto ry VT was presented. [28] The 
patient had known coronary artery disease treated with bypass in 2000, a baseline 
ejection fraction of 24%, and placement of an ICD in 2009 when VT began.  The patient 
also had a history of atrial fibrillation and COPD.  He became refractory to escalating doses 
of sotalol and mexil etine. Catheter ablation was deemed medically contraindic ated, and 
he was therefore treated with single fraction CyberKnife radiosurgery to 25 Gy prescribed 
to the 70% isodose line (Max dose 33 Gy) delivered in a single fraction to an area of the 
left ventricular scar as defined by pre -treatment PET and 12 -lead ECG , encompassing the 
infero -septal,  inferior, and infero -lateral walls from base to apex .  A temporary pacing 
wire (Oscor, Inc., Miami Lakes, FL)  was fluoroscopically placed in the RV apex as an 
imaging  fiducial marker that could be dynamically tracked to co mpensate  for respiratory 
motion .  Total beam -on time was 90 minutes.  All dose constraints to nearby organs at 
risk were met.   
 
Version 09/26/2018   page 10 of 41 There were no immediate complications following treatment.  Follow -up ICD 
interrogations revealed a decrease in total VT episodes from an average of 562 episodes 
per month in the 2 months pre -SBRT  to an average of 52 episodes per month in months 
2 to 9 post -STAR. At 3 months post -STAR, frequent nonsustained and pace -terminated VT 
occurred, associated with reduction  of the sotalol dose to 40 mg bid and mexil etine do se 
to 150 mg bid. Intracardiac electrograms from the patient’s ICD during  VT were similar to 
those from pretreatment VT; however, the cycle length of the VT slowed from 380 –411ms 
to 470 ms pre versus post STAR. Titration of mex iletine and sotalol dosing  back to 150 mg 
tid and 80 mg bid, respectively, resulted in no further episodes of VT. Repeat PET/CT  at 
2.5 months post SBRT  demonstrated mild extension of the inferior scar, with a more 
complete perfusion d efect within the inferior scar.  Nine months after treatment, the 
patient was admitted with COPD exacerbation and recurrent VT, and expired from 
respiratory failure.  
 
In 2014, Cvek et al  reported their experience in a 72 year old female with VT refractory to 
medication and both endocardial and epicardial catheter ablations.  [29]  The patient had 
been treated for more than a decade for cardiomyopathy, had a baseline ejection fraction 
of 25%, and grade III/IV mitral regurgitation.  ICD was placed in 2013 following an episode 
of syncope.  The patient was maximally treated with beta -blockers as amiodarone was 
contraindicated due to prolonged QT -interval.  Because of repetitive arrhythmic storms, 
other  treatment options were evaluated. She was not a candidate for cardiac surgery due 
to severe  comorbidity, including  systemic hypertensio n, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 
diabetes mellitus,  chronic pulmonary obstruction disease, and chronic renal dysfunction. 
As all standard treatment  options were exhausted, she became a candidate for 
stereotactic radiosurgery .  A total dose of 25 Gy was p rescribed to the 82% isodose line 
(Max dose 30.5 Gy) to the base of the lateral wall of the left ventricle based on CARTO 
mapping and prior EP studies.  The LV electrode of the stimulation system in the lateral 
branch of coronary sinus was used as  fiducial  marker for respiratory tracking .  Ten days 
after the radiosurgery session, the number of PVCs  decreased from 9 -10% to 1 -3%, and 
non-sustained ventricle tachycardias (nsVT) diminished as documented in ECG monitoring 
during hospitalization and during repeti tive ambulatory ECG Holter monitoring.  Ten days 
post -treatment, only minimal elevation of troponin T serum level was detected (0.024 -
0.033). After six weeks, no complications or side effects were found. There were no signs 
of radiation pneumonitis nor per icardial effusion.  
 
Lastly, in a recently reported abstract at EHRA Europace – Cardiostim 2015, Zei et al  with 
the CyberHeart group reported on 4 patients (3 refractory VT, 1 refractory atrial 
fibrillation) treated with cardiac SBRT, one of which was alrea dy reported in the first -in-
man report above. [30] A total dose of 25 Gy was delivered in a single fraction for all 
patients ( 2- inferior wall of left ventricle; 1 - ventricular septum; 1 - atrial myocardium ).  
Average ablation volume was 2.1 cc.  There were no post treatment IC D firings.  Reduction 
in arrhythmia burden was seen in all patients.  Quality of life was stable or improved.  
 
As such, th ere is now solid preclinical por cine data suggesting feasibility and safety of 
Version 09/26/2018   page 11 of 41 delivering single fraction SBRT to discrete areas in the heart for purposes of creating scar 
and reducing arrhythmia burden.  Similar ly, though the literature base is quite small and 
median follow -up short, there are now at least 5 documented cases  in the literature  of 
successfully delivering SBRT to 25 Gy i n a single fraction for refractory arrhythmia (4 VT, 
1 atrial fibrillation).  Thus, t he ear ly safety and promising efficacy results, particularly in 
the at risk VT population who often have limited options (continued medical 
management, heart transplant, o r hospice, etc.), justifies exploring this noninvasive 
strategy further.  
 
1.5 Electrocardiographic Imaging ( ECGI ): Noninvasive Electrical Mapping  
 
The scattered previous reports of  noninvasive cardiac abla tion have been performed  in 
the absence of detailed ele ctrical mapping. Washington University has been at the 
forefront of developing a noninvasive cardiac mapping system , called 
Electrocardiographic  Imaging ( ECGI ), which is an important development toward 
improving four -dimensional precision of imaging cardia c electrophysiology. This is a 
noninvasive imaging approach, similar to CT or MRI, except that it is designed to image 
cardiac electrical function.   In brief, ECGI  measures body surface electrical potentials at 
over 200 sites on the torso. It incorporates the patient -specific anatomy of the heart with 
the recording leads on the body surface to noninvasively reconstruct the electrical activity 
on a three -dimensional model of the patient’s heart surface.  
 
This modality has been validated extensively in anima l and tank -torso models. It has been 
used to image cardiac electrophysiology in a number of normal and disease states in 
humans as well. [32-41] 
 
ECGI  represents an important link in the development of an entirely noninvasive mapping 
& ablation system, as it adds noninvasive electrophysiologic mapping to the other 
noninvasive myocardial scar imaging (from standard modalities  such as echo, SPECT, MR I) 
to provide the most accurate plan for noninvasive ablation.   
 
1.6 ENCORE  for VT at Washington University  
 
Combining the noninvasive electrical map ( ECGI ) with noninvasive anatomic/scar images 
allows for greatest precision to target noninvasive stereotactic  beam radiation for cardiac 
arrhythmias.  We call this process  EP-guided Noninvasive Cardiac Radioablation  
(ENCORE ).  In April 2015, the first patient was treated with ENCORE  at Washington 
University  for refractory VT.   As of May  2016 , we have treated a total of 5 patients with 
refractory VT. Three of the patients had one or more prior catheter ablations with  
subsequent progression of VT.  One patient had recent mitral valve replacement, and 
catheter ablation was contraindicated .  The most recent  patient treated was 83 years old, 
with multiple medical comorbi dities, previous intolerance to anesthesia necessitating ICU 
admission, and subsequently declined catheter ablation.   Table 1 summarizes our 
experience to date.

Of the first 3 patients, all had a dramatic reduction in the number and frequency of VT 
episodes after ENCORE, and all eventually had termination of VT.  The 2 most recent 
patients had substantially more VT (bo th over 1000 episodes in the month before) , and 
one of the two patients was demonstrating a reduction in VT pattern as of censored follow 
up. Only one of the five patients who received ENCORE  protocol did not have an 
improvement in VT burden. At 3 weeks post -ENCORE  treatment, a repeat catheter 
ablation was performed. Analysis of the invasive study will help answer questions 
regarding efficacy.   While there have not been any acute toxicities to  date with ENCORE  
protocol, and all patients who received ENCORE  protocol were discharged from the 
hospital, Patient #5  did suffer from an embolic stroke 13 days after ENCORE  protocol.  She 
was known to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 18%, had a  history of atrial 
fibrillation.  She was deemed to be a poor candidate for oral anticoagulation. As such, she  
was at risk of such a complication independent of therapy . However, given the temporal 
nature of treatment to the stroke, we are assuming that this  is possibly related to therapy.  
 
The overall pattern of efficacy for all five patients in the ENCORE -VT Pilot study is shown 
below in Figure 2A, 2B, 2C. Importantly, all patients who underwent ENCORE had a 
reduction in ICD therapies and VT burden. This e ffect is seen in the absence of 
antiarrhythmic medications, which were aggressively weaned off in the first  6 weeks after 
treatment. The longitudinal heart function, as measured by cardiac echocardiography, is 
shown in figure 2D. N one of the 5 patients had  a reduction in LVEF after treatment (mean 
+5% in LVEF, range 0 to +15%).  Serial CT scans were also performed, showing mild peri -
ablation lung fibrosis at 3 months that largely resolved by 12 months (Figure 2E).

In all of the clinical cases reported in the literature to date, treatment was delivered using 
the CyberKnife, a robot linac with orthogonal kV:kV image guidance.  Such a delivery 
system allows for diverse treatment to all sites of the body, but does require placement 
of a fiducial for x -ray image guidance, and due to the nature of the step -and-shoot 
delivery of the robot linac, treatment times average 1.5 hours.  
 
At Washington University, all treatments delivered to date have been on an image -guided 
radiotherapy  (IGRT) -equipped linear accelerator per our typical lung SBRT workflow.  
These units are equipped with an onboard cone beam CT (CBCT) which allows for 
acquisition of high fidelity volumetric images of the thorax which can be directly 
registered to the planning CT,  allowing for accurate, near real time alignment of the heart 
and target volume.  This precludes the need for invasive placement of a fiducial marker.  
In comparison, VMAT treatment times for our patients have averaged approximately 10 

Version 09/26/2018   page 16 of 41 minutes.  Figure 3  is an example of a ENCORE  treatment plan for patient #1.  In all cases, 
overall treatment time is substantially faster than the previously reported cases in the 
literature, which results in improved patient comfort and may also improve overall 
delivery accur acy, as increased time on the treatment machine has been correlated with 
“drift” away from the isocenter over time. [31] 
 
Unlike other centers, treatments at Washington University have been delivered to regions 
that combine anatomic and electrical abnormalities. An atomic abnormalities are defined  
as regions of ventricular scar, det ermined from clinical cardiac imaging mo dalities such as 
delayed -enhancing cardiac MRI (DE cMRI), nuclear computed tomography (SPECT) and/or 
previous intracardiac mapping. Electrical abnormalities are identified by 12 -lead ECG 
during a clinical VT or 12 -lead ECG during an induced VT from a noninvasive programmed 
stimul ation procedure (NIPS). Figure 3  is an example of a ENCORE  treatment plan 
developed for patient #1, targeting an area of anatomic scar that was identified with DE 
cMRI which overlapped with the area of electrical abnormalities based on 12 -lead ECGs 
of VT obtained during NIPS.  The results for each patient are depicted in the bar graph.

As such, the delivery methods within this protocol are novel inasmuch as they are 1) 
rapid; 2) entirely  non-invasive ; 3) guided by noninvasive imaging of the electrical  and 
structural  abnormalities .

1.7 Study Rationale  
 
Patients with VT either refractory to catheter ablation  or deemed medically too frail or 
challenging to treat with catheter ablation have limited options , with one -year survival 
below 20% .  Preclinical data described above  demonstrate that  single fraction SBRT to 
discrete portions of the heart is feasible and may result in a reduction or elimination of 
VT.  Overall safety and early efficacy of SBRT have not been rigorously studied i n a 
prospective trial to date. The ENCORE  therapy described  herein provides for a potentially 
rapid and totally non -invasive method for delivering such therapy.  
 
The purpose of this phase I/II study is to d emonstrate the short -term safety and 
preliminary efficacy of ENCORE  for patients with VT  refractory to standa rd treatments . 
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES   
 
2.1 Primary Objectives  
 
1. Phase I  - Demonstrate acute (≤ 90 days) safety of noninvasive stereotactic cardiac 
ablation radiotherapy ( ENCORE ). The primary safety endpoint  is defined by a ≤  20% 
rate of serious adverse events (SAEs)  using CTCAE v4.0 criteria  that are 
possibly/probably/definitely related to study treatment , based o n previously 
published data for expected invasive catheter -based VT -ablation procedures .   
  
2. Phase II  - Demonstrate preliminary efficacy of ENCORE . The primary efficacy endpoint  
is defined by the number of subjects with a reduction in ICD therapies  (ATP and ICD 
shocks) comparing the period six months  before ENCORE  treatment  to the six month s 
after ENCORE  treatment  as adjudicated by continuous ICD monitori ng.  There will be 
a six -week “blanking period” after therapy to allow for ablation effect.  For patients 
with PVC -induced cardiomyopathy, the primary efficacy will be any reduction in PVC 
burden based on ambulatory heart monitors.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1. Determine six -month and twelve -month survival (overall mortality  endpoint ) after 
treatment with ENCORE.  
 
2. Determine late toxicity  endpoint  (>90 days  to 12 months ), as tracked prospectively 
after treatment using CTCAE v4.0 criteria.  
 
3. Determine patient -reported health related quality of life endpoint  (HRQOL) as 
measured by  changes between  pre-treatment  and 6-week , 6-month , and 12 -month  
post treatment scores on the standardized SF -36 questionnaire.  
Version 09/26/2018   page 19 of 41  
4. Evaluate  stricter efficacy endpoint  of ENCORE  treatment, as defined by number of 
patients who have had 50% reduction in  any VT therapies  (ATP or ICD shocks)  after 
ENCORE  treatment  (6 months before vs. 6 months after treatment, with a 6 week 
blanking period immediately after treatment) . For p atients with PVC -induced 
cardiomyopathy, the stricter efficacy will be >50% reduction in PVC burden based on 
ambulatory heart monitors.  
 
5. Evaluate strict est efficacy  endpoint  of ENCORE  treatment, as defined by number of 
patients who have had 95% reduction i n any VT (ATP or ICD shocks) after ENCORE  
treatment (6 months before vs. 6 months after treatment, with a 6 week blanking 
period immediately after treatment) . For patients with PVC -induced cardiomyopathy, 
the strictest efficacy will be abolition of PVC bur den (<1%) based on ambulatory heart 
monitors.  
 
6. Evaluate the most clinically useful efficacy endpoint  of ENCORE  treatment, namely , 
number of patients with reduction specifically in ICD shocks (6 months before vs. 6 
months after treatment, with a 6 week blanking period immediately after treatment) . 
For patients with PVC -induced cardiomyopathy, the most clinically useful efficacy will 
be improvement in cardiac function in the setting of any improvement in PVC burden.  
 
7. Evaluate longer -term durability endpoi nt of ENCORE  treatment, as defined by 
number of patients with reduction in VT therapies (ATP or ICD shock  and ICD shock 
alone ) during the early phase (treatment to 6 months, with 6 week blanking period) 
vs. the late phase (6 months to 1 year). For patients  with PVC -induced 
cardiomyopathy, the longer -term durability efficacy will be persistence of any 
reduction in PVC burden based on ambulatory heart monitors during early phase vs. 
late phase.  
 
 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
 
1. To better understand the mechanisms and  timing of radiotherapy injury , we will 
obtain serum blood markers  of myocardial injury (troponin), endothelial injury (E -
selectin) , fibrosis (galectin -3) and prothrombotic markers (von Willibrand factor) at 
baseline, 3 days and 3 months after ENCORE  treat ment.  
 
2. Evolution of electrical remodeling  as obtained with noninvasive ECGI  from  baseline  
to 3 months  and 12 months after ENCORE  treatment  
 
3. To better understand the effect of radiotherapy on edema, fibrosis , cardiac 
inflammation, cardiac metabolism  and localized cardiac function,  we plan to use  
serial cardiac imaging ( DE-cMRI  when possible, FDG -PET in all ) at baseline, 3 days and 
3 months after ENCORE  treatment

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
4.1 Noninvasive Imaging  for Scar/Fibrosis, Edema, Inflammation  
 
To maximize the potential benefit and minimize the risks of noninvasive 
radioablation, we will perform extensive  imaging of cardiac ventricular scar  or 
inflammation  harboring the VT circuit  using clinically ava ilable imaging tests, 
including  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),  positron emission testing (PET) , and 
myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI/SPECT) when available . If the se studies have 
been performed previously within one year, additional testing is not needed. Refer 
to Section 7.0 Study Calendar  for anticipated timing of clinical cardiac imaging 
modalities.  The role of each test and potential risk to each is described briefly 
below.  
 
4.1.1  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
 
When coupled with administration of IV contrast agent (gadolinium), cardiac MRI 
is the gold -standard imaging study for detailed evaluation of the distribution of 
fibrosis and scar . In this study, MRI will be performed  prior to the procedure 
(baseline study)  to help determine the target volume for radioablation  using the 
best -practices to safely acquire the data and the latest sequences for ar tifact -
reduction, called Wideband sequences (55, 56) .  
 
Immediately after treatm ent (day 3), MRI will be used  to evaluate  for the presence 
of local edema at the treated site  (T2-weighted imaging)  and to screen for acute 
injury, such as pericardial effusion .  
 
MRI will be performed again 3 months after the treatment to evaluate for any 
changes in cardiac fibrosis and scar from the baseline study. It will also screen for 
Version 09/26/2018   page 22 of 41 potential toxicities, including changes in myocardial function, valvular 
performance or p ericardial effusion.  
 
This type of serial MRI has never been performed after administration of cardiac 
radiotherapy, and the results a re expected to provide important  insight into the 
mechanisms and timing of the radiobiological effect  of this treatment . We 
perceive this knowledge to be of utmost importance in determining the projected 
time course of the safety and clinical effect for future patients receiving this type 
of therapy.  
 
We anticipate that most or all of the patients who are enrolled into this study will 
have cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) to treat ventricular arrhythmias. Historically, the 
presence of an ICD has been a contraindication to performing MRI for various 
theoretical and observed concerns. Over the course of the past decade, great  
strides have been made to safely allow patients with ICDs to undergo MRI scans.  
These are reviewed in several recent publications ( 42-53).  The most prominent of 
these is the completion of a large registry to characterize the risks of undergoing 
MRI with a cardiac device  (MAGNASAFE.org ). This registry and other publicati ons 
(50) have defined the substantial safety margin of MRI use in patients with cardiac 
devices,  and these studies form the  basis for an upcoming professional guideline 
statement regarding the expanded and safe use of MRI in patients with cardiac 
devices  (anticipated 2016 release) . In short, the MAGNASAFE registry was a 
multicenter trial of 1,500 patients with cardiac devices who underwent MRI 
scanning on a 1.5 T scanner. Of the 1500 MRI sca ns, only 1 patient developed a 
clinical event (generator failure due to inappropriate sensing) which was deemed 
to be caused by inappropriate ICD programming. The overall positive results of the 
MAGNAS AFE study have resulted in the national CMS National Co verage 
Determination (NCD) allowing  for coverage of MRIs in patients with cardiac 
devices if they are per formed in a research study that meets CED (coverage with 
evidence development) criteria.” (Medicare website: CAG -00399R2). Since the 
release o f MAGNASA FE, a number of trials including  patients who are specific to 
our population (patients with VT, with implanted ICD, undergoing cardiac MRI) 
have been published  (42-53). In these studies, there were  no adverse effect s of 
cardiac MRI  with appropriate pre -scan ICD programming , further supporting the 
overall safety of this scan in the appropriately selected patients.  
 
A second major advance i s the development of MRI -conditional cardiac devices, 
which are now commercially available from several manufacturers (M edtronic, 
Biotronik). Whenever possible, we plan to use these devices for new implants at 
our hospital. However, we expect most patien ts who enroll into this study will  
have older legacy devices, which do not have specific MRI -conditional labeling.  
 
In th is study, we recognize the potential risks involved with MRI in patients with 
ICDs, and these risks will be shared with patients in full disclosure , using language 
Version 09/26/2018   page 23 of 41 and images from a recentl y published “Cardiology Patient Page ” article ( 54). MRI 
remains the  gold standard for assessment of fibrosis and edema, and we believe 
the large benefits of precision guidance of radiotherapy outweigh the small 
potential risks of ICD system changes.  Patients who are unwilling to accept these 
risks, or patients in whom we  believe the risks to  be excessive will not undergo 
MRI. We will then use clinically available imaging, such as nuclear MPI/SPECT, 
which is less specific and sensitive than MRI.  
 
Patients in whom we wi ll NOT offer an MRI include:  
a) Newly implanted ICD syste m (any component added < 6 weeks ) 
b) Dependence on ICD system for pacing (complete heart block or severe 
sinus node dysfunction  without ventricular escape )  
c) Presence of abandoned , fractured  or epicardial cardiac leads  
d) Active noncardiac implanted device (other  than cardiac device)  
e) Abdominal position of cardiac device  
f) Battery voltage of ICD at elective replacement interval  
g) Increased risk to administration of IV gadolinium such as renal 
impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 40) or 
previous adv erse reaction to IV gadolinium.  
h) Patient preference  
 
For patients who undergo MRI, several safeguards have been developed as “best 
practices” and will be used for this study. These include:  
a) Supervision of appropriately trained personnel for the duration of the 
MRI scan  
b) Pre-treatment and post -treatment ICD device checks  
c) Pre-treatment ICD programming per standardized protocol 
(MAGNASAFE registry) to minimize chances of untoward ICD effects, 
including asynchronous or inhibited pacing  mode  (VOO/DOO or 
VVI/ DDI setting), disabling magnet response,  disabling episode 
memory, and disabling therapies for tachyarrhythmia. A full risk -
mitigation protocol has been developed and is available as a 
supplement to this protocol.   
 
4.1.2   Positron Emissions Testing (PET)  
 
PET uses a special camera to measure specific  signal in heart cells emitted from 
injected radioisotopes (called tracers). The amount of radiation received from PET  
is small, and the risk of procedural complication is exceedingly low.  In this study, 
the rad ioisotope will be Fludeoxyglucose (FDG). This isotope tests for areas of 
inflammation  and ischemia , which may be particularly important in patients with 
nonischemic reasons for cardiomyopathy. The FDG -PET imaging will be done in all 
patients, unless contra indicated due to previous adverse reaction. The 
Version 09/26/2018   page 24 of 41 information gained from FDG -PET cardiac metabolism will be combined with the 
scar imaging from MRI  to help guide radioablation.  
 
 
4.2 Noninvasive Electrical Imaging   
 
The method of electrocardiographic imaging ( ECGI ) is described in Section 1.5 
above.  Graphically, it is illustrated below:  
 
 
 
In brief, the patient undergoes a CT scan while wearing a “vest” of electrodes that 
record heart beats. The electrical information from the surface of the body can 
then be computed onto the patient -specific heart model to noninvasively display 
the characteri stics of the imaged heartbeat. Useful information includes: where 
the beat begins, how it depolarizes the h eart, which parts of the heart have 
abnormal si gnals from previ ous heart attacks or scar . Fitting the vest of electrodes 
on the patient, obtaining electrical signals, and performing the CT scan is generally 
completed in under 30 minutes.  
 
In this study, prior to treatment, patients will undergo ECGI  during a noninvas ive-
programmed stimulation (called NIPS) procedure. A NIPS procedure is a 
commonly performed procedure in the cardiac electrophysiology lab. The patient 
receives light IV sedation  for the procedure,  and vital signs are  monitored closely. 
Communication with  the patient’s  ICD is established, and the ICD is used to 
intentionally ind uce ventricular tachycardia through  basic pacing maneuvers. 
Once the VT is induced, a 12 -lead ECG and 256 -lead ECGI  are obtained (less than 
10 seconds). The ICD is then again used t o pace -terminate the VT  (less than 10 
seconds).  
 
In this study, the NIPS will be performed in a standardized fashion. In the fasting 
state, single, double, and then triple extrastimuli will be delivered to refractoriness 
at drive trains of 600 and 400 ms,  via the right ventricular ICD lead. Results from 

Version 09/26/2018   page 25 of 41 the NIPS will yield electrical information (ECG and ECGI ) that guides targeting of 
the noninvasive ablation to the areas of origin of the ventricular arrhythmias.  
 
Despite the perceived risk of intentional ly inducing a potentially life -threatening 
arrhythmia, NIPS is  considered a rather low -risk procedure in the EP lab. Common 
risks include:  
 Hypotension or adverse reaction to  IV seda tion (usually propofol) ; 
 Induction of  an arrhythmia that cannot be terminated by pacing, requiring 
external cardioversion /defibrillation  or use of the ICD is neces sary to 
restore regular rhythm  
 
Contraindications for NIPS include:  
 Because of the possibility for cardioversion /defibrillation , the most 
common contraindication for NIPS is the presence of atrial fibrillation in a 
patient that cannot receive anticoagulation  
 Hemodynamic or medical instability prior to procedure  
 ICD at elective replacement interval (ERI) or end of service (EOS)  
 
During follow -up after treatment, ECGI  will be performed as a standalone 
procedure, without the need to perform NIPS.  
 
 
4.3 Targeting the Area for Noninvasive Ablation  
 
The clinical cardiac electrophysiologist will determine the region of the heart to 
be targe ted for noninvasive a blation on an individual patient basis. The decision 
combines: A) scar arch itecture from cardiac MRI ; B) inflammation location from 
PET; C) 12 -lead ECG interpretation; D) 3 -dimensional ECGI  interpretation, using 
previously published cr iteria for origin of VT; E) anatomic considerations from CT 
scan ; F) reduced cardiac motion or myocardial thinning, suggestive of previous 
cardiac injury or scar .  As a general rule, efforts will be made to target all areas of 
VT origin and adjacent scar o r inflammatory regions that harbor related circuits . 
In almost all cases, the targeted area will avoid areas of healthy tissue and focus 
on areas that demonstrate severely reduced cardiac motion .    
 
  
4.4 Radiation Therapy Guidelines  
 
4.4.1 Dose, Fractionation  
 
Radiotherapy will consist of stereotactic body therapy  to be given over one 
fraction.  Patients will be planned for a dose of 25 Gy in a single fraction to the PTV .   
  
4.4.2 Simulation Procedures/Patient Positioning  
Version 09/26/2018   page 26 of 41  
Patients will be immobilized using a system (such as BodyFIX) that is known to 
keep immobilization setup uncertainty to ≤ 3 mm. All patients will undergo free 
breathing CT simulation using thin (≤ 3 mm) slice thickness CT.  An addition al 
respiratory correl ated 4D -CT will be acquired and co -registered to the planning CT 
for purposes of assessing respiratory motion. IV contrast will be used to facilitate 
definition of cardiac structures when not otherwise contraindicated.  Esophageal 
contrast will be used to facilitate definition of the esophagus and upper stomach 
when not otherwise contraindicated.   Additional clinical images may be co -
registered to the planning CT based on availability and at the discretion of the 
clinician.  
 
4.4.3 Target Volumes  
 
The treatment ta rget will be defined using radiation oncology principles of target 
definition.  The gross target  volume (GTV) will be segmented through 
corroboration of all previously acquired imaging (MRI, CT, SPECT, etc.) and EP data 
(12-lead EKG, prior catheter mapping , ECGI , etc.).  An internal target volume (ITV) 
will be created based on the 4D -CT to account for any impact on the summative 
effect of respiratory and averaged -out cardiac motion.  No clinical target volume 
(CTV) expansion s will be utilized.  The PTV will be generated at the discretion of 
the treat ing physician based on immobilization, machine uncertainties, and setup 
uncertain ty, but should generally range between 0.3 cm  and 0.7 c m.  
 
4.4.4 Treatment Planning  
 
All patients will b e planned to a target dose of 25 Gy in a single fraction  to the PTV , 
subject to organ at risk (OAR) dose constrain ts.  Coverage goal of the PTV will be 
for > 95% of the PTV to be covered by > 95% of the prescription dose, although in 
situation s where a cri tical OAR  structure is violated, coverage of PTV will be 
compromised in order to meet dose constraints.  
 
Dose limits are being employed as means to minimize the likelihood of toxicity, 
but true tolerance to OARs are not well described for single fraction schemes  to 
the central thorax , and therefore prioritization will be employed for planning 
purposes taking into account the balance between PTV coverage and relative 
consequences of toxicity to specific OARs.

2 Respect PTV coverage requirements.  
3 Respect OAR  constraints.  If the PTV is next to  or involving an OAR 
(not the spinal cord), then likely the guideline constraints cannot be 
met.  In such cases, do se to OAR should  not exceed 105% of 
Version 09/26/2018   page 27 of 41 prescription dose and effort should be made to avoid treating the 
entire circumference of the structure (particularly trachea, 
bronchus, esophagus).  
 
4.4.5 OAR Contouring  
 
In order to verify dose limits to OARs, OARs must be contoured such t hat 
appropriate volume histograms can be generated. Instructions for the contouring 
of these organs are as listed in the table below .  An OAR may be omitted from 
contouring and subsequent evaluation in the DVH if it is > 10 cm from the PTV, or 
at the discr etion of the treating radiation oncologist if it is determined that no 
clinically meaningful dose will be received by the OAR.

4.5 Evaluability Guidelines  
 
Patients who complete  the full intended dose of single fraction SBRT  are evaluable for 
both the primary and secondary objectives . 
 
4.6 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
In the rare event that a patient is taking an anti -neoplastic therapy (chemotherapy, 
targeted therapy) for any reason (immune disease, malignancy), said medication must be 
withheld at least 7 days prio r to and 7 days after delivery of SBRT.    
 
All other standard concomitant medications deemed necessary for management of the 
patient’s arrhythmia and overall health should be continued, and need not be altered for 
purposes of SBRT delivery.  
 
Though not yet  seen in our preliminary experience, g iven the proximity of the esophagus 
and stomach to the heart, it is possible that patients may develop esophagitis or gastritis.  
Treatment of esophagitis /gastritis  varies with the severity of the patient’s symptoms; for 
example, diet adjustment and narcotic management may be sufficient for grade 2  
complications . Nutritional support via gastric tube or jejunostomy tube may be initiated 
upon development of grade 3 -4 complications , per mutual preference of the treating 
physician and patient.  
 
4.7 Women of Childbearing Potential  
Version 09/26/2018   page 29 of 41  
Women of childbearing potential (women with regular menses, women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding, and women who have had a tubal ligation) are required 
to have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the start of SBRT.  
 
If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, SBRT should not be administered . In addition a 
positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. If it is confirmed that 
the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume therapy .  
 
4.8 Duration of Therapy  
 
Because this study involves administration of a single fraction of SBRT over the course of 
approximately 10 minutes, there is no option for discontinuation of treatment once 
initiated.  
 
4.9 Duration of Follow up  
 
Patients will be followed  per protocol  for 12 months following the completion of SBRT or 
until death, whichever occurs first. Follow -up is per the treatment calendar (see Section 
8.0) and consist s of routine clinical visits, 12 -lead EKG and implanted device interrogations  
to evaluate  toxicity and  treatme nt response, and evaluation of QOL . Patients will be 
followed by office visits, phone calls, and review of medical record.  Any additional follow -
up and imaging will be obtained off -study as per routine clinical policies of the treating 
physician.   After 12  months, patients will be followed at the discretion of the treating 
physicians. Patients will be tracked for clinical outcomes up to 5 years after completion of 
radiation via review of the medical record.  
 
4.10 Management of ICD Programming and Antiarrhythmic Medications During 
Follow up  
 
ICD p rogramming parameters and antiarrhythmic medication dosing should be patient -
specific decisions, left to the treating physician taking into account risks and benefits of 
the various strategies.  Ideal settings are suggested below:  
 ICD programming should inc lude a zone for detection at least 20ms slower than 
the slowest clinical or induced VT . ICD therapy may or may not be  programmed to 
deliver therapy  in this zone, subject to decisions about patient symptoms and 
tolerances during VT.  
 Antiarrhythmic medicati ons should be maintained at pre -treatment doses for at 
least the first 6 weeks , barring any development of adverse medication effect.  
 With each subsequent visit after the first 6 weeks, doses of at least one 
antiarrhythmic medication should be reduced if n o VT has been observed  on ICD 
device check .  
Version 09/26/2018   page 30 of 41  If not contraindicated, oral anticoagulation is preferred during the first month 
after treatment ( warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban) to 
minimize risks of stroke.   
 
 
5.0 REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
5.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
Definition: any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject including any 
abnormal sign, symptom, or disease.  
 
Grading: the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity 
reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  
 
Advancing heart failure symptoms will be monitored closely , and represent a difficult 
endpoint to assess objectively. It is acknowledged that heart failure  progression is an 
expected natural history  irrespective of cardiac ablation . Inotrope or mechanical support 
may become necessary, and if used, specific scoring criteria will be used to a djudicate 
treatment -related HF progression vs. natural history of HF.  For the purposes of this study, 
which studies the short -term toxicities of the therapy, treatment -related adverse heart 
failure event will be defined as either :  
1) Acute worsening of h eart failure symptoms requiring initiation of new 
IV vasoactive m edications (inotropes  or vasopressors) within the  first six 
weeks of treatment;    
2) Acute reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (>1 0% reduction)  
within the first six  weeks of treatmen t 
 
We recognize that because of the relatively slow -acting nature of radiotherapy, potential 
treatment -related heart failure progression fall outside the six -week window defined 
above.  Long -term clinical care and observation will be important, but are outs ide the 
scope of this project. For best patient care, decisions regarding heart transplant status 
and candidacy for inotrope or mechanical support will not be affected by enrollment in 
this study.  
 
Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human 
Services’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). A copy of this guidance can be 
found on O HRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html  
 
  
Version 09/26/2018   page 31 of 41 5.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
Definition :  An adverse event that is any undesirable experience associated with the use 
of a medical product in  a patient that results in death, hospitalization (new or 
prolonged), disability or permanent damage, or is life -threatening.  
 
Specific to this protocol, SAEs are defined as AEs with CTCAE v4.0 grade 3 or higher 
resulting in hospitalization or grade 4 -5 AE . Treatment -related SAEs were SAEs  that are 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to protocol treatment.  
 
5.3 Unanticipated Problems  
 
Definition:  
  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the sub ject population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by the procedures involved in the resear ch); and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
5.4 Noncompliance  
 
Definition: failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that govern 
human subjects research or failure to follow the determinations of the IRB. 
Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate choice to ignore 
regulations, institutional policies, or dete rminations of the IRB  
 
5.5 Serious Noncompliance  
 
Definition: noncompliance that materially increases risks, that results in substantial harm  
 
5.6 Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved protocol that are under the research 
team’s co ntrol.  Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.  
 
Pre-approval of all protocol exceptions must be obtained prior to the event.  
 
Version 09/26/2018   page 32 of 41 5.7 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO ) at Washington 
University  
 
The PI is required to promptly notify the IRB of the following events:  
 
• Any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others which occur 
at WU, any BJH or SLCH institution, or that impacts participants or the conduct 
of the study.  
• Noncomp liance with federal regulations or the requirements or determinations 
of the IRB.  
• Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to 
participate or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within 10 working days of the occurrence of 
the event or notification to the PI of the event. The death of a research participant that 
qualifies as a reportable event should be reported within 1 working day of the o ccurrence 
of the event or noti fication to the PI of the event  
 
5.8 Timeframe for Reporting Required Events  
 
Adverse events captured in the CRF s will be tracked for 12 months following SBRT. For 
the purposes of this protocol, reportable adverse events are grade  3, 4, or 5 toxicities that 
did not predate SBRT and are  possibly,  probably or definitely attributable to treatment. 
Patients will be assessed using the CTCAE v4.0.  
 
 
6.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
Quality of life (QOL)  will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month s, and 12 months  post 
completion of ENCORE , using the SF -36 questionnaire .  Changes between baseline and each time 
point, as well as changes between time points, will be measured.  
 
ECGI  will be obtained at baseline , 3 and  12 months after ENCORE  treatment.   Comparisons will 
be made of the putative purely ECGI -derived target volume vs. clinically -derived target volume 
on protocol, as well as c omparison of post -ENCORE  month ECGI  with baseline ECGI  with 
correlation of changes on ECGI  with ENCORE  dose distributi on 
 
Delayed contrast enhanced cardiac MRI (DE cMRI) will be obtained at baseline, 1 -3 days and 3 
months after ENCORE  treatment. While initial MRI will help identify anatomic scar to target 
therapy, follow up DE cMRI will be used to identify tissue edema and myocardial ablation, as well 
as assess for cardiac and extracardiac complications.  
 
Blood wo rk will be drawn at ba seline, 3 days and 3 months after ENCORE  treatment. Specific 
markers will be used to assess for biochemical evidence of myocyte injury (troponin), endothelial 
Version 09/26/2018   page 33 of 41 injury/activation (E -selectin), fibrosis (galectin -3), and prothrombotic effects (von Willibrand 
factor).   
 
In patients who die or undergo a heart transplant, clinical reports will be reviewed and abstracted 
of any pathologic,  histologic , or autopsy analysis.  Additionally, clinically processed tissue 
submitt ed to the Department of Pathology may be requested for additional analysis for research 
purposes, including, but not limited to, assessment of the location and degree of baseline injury 
outside the radiotherapy target and evidence of on and off -target inju ry from radiotherapy.

9.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
1. Acute (≤ 90 days) safety of ENCORE  will be defined as  a ≤ 20% rate of protocol -
specific serious of serious adverse events (SAEs) using CTCAE v4.0 criteria that are 
possibly/probably/definitely relat ed to study treatment, based on  previously 
published data for expected invasive catheter -based VT -ablation proc edures.   Early 
stopping rules have been created such that if 5 or more patients develop ENCORE  
related SAEs out of the first 10 patients, this would be deemed significantly greater 
than 20% (alpha < 0.05), and the trial will be halted.  
 
2. Preliminary efficac y of ENCORE  will defined by the number of subjects with a 
reduction in ICD therapies (six month period before ENCORE  treatment compared to 
six month period after ENCORE  treatment) as adjudicated by continuous ICD 
monitoring.     
 
Version 09/26/2018   page 35 of 41 10.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the 
Data and Safety Monitoring  Committee  (DSM C) will meet to review data semi -annually beginning 
six months after accrual has  begun . The report will be prepared by the study statistician with 
assistance from the study team and will be reviewed by the DSMC, which will consist at minimum 
of a radiation oncologist, a cardiologist, and a statistician.  The  report will include:  
 
• HRPO protocol number, protocol title, P rincipal Investigator name, data coordinator 
name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician .  
• Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, date 
of HRPO expiration, study status, and phase of study .  
• History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, 
error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason .  
• Study -wide target accru al and study -wide actual accrual .  
• Protocol activation date .  
• Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  
• Expected accrual end date  
• Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who have 
met e ach objective .  
• Measures of efficacy .  
• Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants who have 
met the early stopping rules .  
• Summary of toxicities  
• Abstract submissions/publications  
• Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
The study principal investigator and Research Patient Coordinator will monitor for serious 
toxicities on an ongoing basis. Once the principal investigator or Research Patient Coordinator 
becomes aware of an advers e event, the AE will be reported to the HRPO according to 
institutional guidelines.  
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Early Stopping  Criteria  
 
Through a one  sample test for proportions , assuming a maximal clinically acceptable SAE 
rate of 20%, 5 or more SAEs out of the first 10 patients would be significantly greater than 
20% (alpha < 0.05).  As such, the protocol will be halted if 5 or more of the first 10 patients 
develop a SAE.  
 
11.2 Sample Size  Justification  
Version 09/26/2018   page 36 of 41  
A total of 19  patients will be enrolled, which provides an optimal balance between 
assuring a high likelihood of safety (Phase I) with a preliminary assessment of efficacy  
(Phase II) . 
 
For the phase I component, the baseline rate of SAEs for catheter ablation is assume d to 
be 10 -15%.  Given the population being studied and a reasonable expectation that 
patients may be at a higher than typical risk of toxicity from any salvage therapy, we 
assume that SAE rates up to 20% would be clinically acceptable.  Having said that, given 
that this is a totally noninvasive technique, it may well be that rates of toxicity are lower 
than that expected with catheter ablation.  After exploring patient ranges from 15 -25 
patients, it was determined that 19 patients would provide a 75.4% pow er to detect an 
SAE rate about 20% (range, 5% -20%, alpha = 0.0829).   
 
For the phase II component, while some single institution series report much higher 
success rates, the baseline efficacy rate of catheter ablation in prospective trials ranges 
from 50 -65%.  As this is a salvage therapy in a high risk population, we assume that 
efficacy rates as low as 40% would be clinically acceptable.  Using the 19 patient sample 
determined above, it was determined that 19 patients would provide 81.5% power to 
determin e that ENCORE  is not worse than 40% effective for the treatment of VT (range, 
40-65%, alpha = 0.0885).  
 
11.3 Analytic Plan for Primary Objective s 
 
SAEs defined  by CTCAE v4.0 criteria within 90 days of ENCORE  that are 
possibly/probably/definitely related to study treatment will be recorded.  ENCORE  
therapy will be deemed safe if the rate of SAEs is ≤ 20%.  An additional early stopping rule 
dictates that if 5 or more out of the first 10 patients develop ENCORE  related SAEs, the 
trial will be halted.  
 
The number of IC D therapies delivered in the 6 month periods preceding and following 
ENCORE  therapy will be recorded for each patient by interrogation of the ICD.  ENCORE  
therapy will be deemed efficacious if there is a reduction in ICD therapies before and after 
treatment.   The proportion of patients with efficacious ENCORE  therapy will be 
calculated, with the intent of demonstrating at least 40% efficacy.  
 
11.4 Analytic Plan for Secondary and Exploratory Objective s 
 
Adverse events will be tabulated by type and grade.  
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe efficacy and strict efficacy, changes in SF -36 
scores, changes in ECGI , differences in purely ECGI  derived vs. clinically -derived target 
volumes.  
 
Version 09/26/2018   page 37 of 41 Dose -volume parameters to the ENCORE  target as defined by ECGI  and the clinical target 
volume  will be correlated with the reduction in VT  through descriptive statistics and Cox 
regression.

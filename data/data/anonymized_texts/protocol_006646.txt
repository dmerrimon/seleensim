Diagnosis and main criteria for 
inclusion /exclusionAdult patients (18 to 75 years) with symptomatic PAH who are treated w ith a 
stable dose of a PDE -5i with or w ithout ERA , but are not at treatment goal
i.e., remaining at intermediate risk according to European Respiratory 
Society/European Society of Cardiology (ERS/ESC) guidelines, as indicated 
by their WHO FC and a6MWD test.
Patients on combination therapy with ERAs may best represent the clinical 
situation in which transition would be considered, whereas for most patients 
on PDE -5i monotherapy ,combination therapy may be the next appropriate 
step of treatment escalation. There may however be clinical conditions where 
a transition to riociguat from PDE -5i monotherapy appears to be appropriate 
at the discret ion of the treating physician.
Patients with symptomatic PAH according to WHO FCIII and 6MWD of 
165-440m at screening and at randomization ,with a pulmonary vascular 
resistance (PVR) of > 400dyn*sec*cm -5,mean pulmonary artery pressure 
≥25mmHg, and pu lmonary  capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≤15mmHg 
as as sessed by right heart catheteriz ation in medical history prior to screening
to confirm the diagnosis .Alternatively, PCWP can be replaced by left 
ventricular end -diastolic pressure.
PAH of the following types: idiopathic, hereditary ,drug/toxin induced, and 
associated PAH due to connective tissue disease or congenital heart disease 
(patient shad to have undergone surgical repair more than 1year before 
enrolment ),and portal hypertension with li ver cirrhosis (patients with clinical 
relevant hepatic dysfunction are excluded) .
Patients who are on stable doses of a PDE -5i and ERA combination therapy 
or on stable PDE -5i monotherapy for at least 6weeks prior to and at 
randomization (tadalafil daily dose 20 to 40 mg or sildenafil daily dose at 
least 60mg). Stable is defined as no change in the type of the PDE -5i and the 
daily dose of PDE -5i and ERA during the 6-week period prior to and at 
randomization . 
Patients who signed informed consent and are able to follow  the study 
instructions.
Study design Prospective, randomized, international, multicenter, double -arm, controlled, 
24-week open -label study. Patients will be randomized to remain ontheir 
current PAH -specific treatment or to replace the PDE -5i treatment with 
riociguat.
Patients on specific combination therapy with PDE -5i and ERA need to
continue taking ERA at a stable dose in both treatment arms.
At Week 24 a com posite endpoint of satisfactory clinical respons ewill be 
assessed.

Methodology Patients who are not at treatment goal and at intermediate risk according to 
ERS/ESC guidelines will be randomi zed in a 1:1 ratio to remain on their 
current PAH -specific treatment or to replace the PDE -5i treatment with 
riociguat for 24 weeks.
Patients need to be pretreated with a stable dose of PDE -5i +/-ERA for 
6weeks prior to and at randomization . 
Riociguat treatment willbe start ed after a wash-out period of 24hours w ith 
previous sildenafil therapy (daily dose at least 60mg) and 48 hours after 
previous tadalafil therapy (daily dose 20 to 40mg).
Type of control A mandatory screening period of 2weeks before randomization will be 
performed for all patients to ensure stability and similar starting conditions at 
baseline. Patients randomized to the control arm will continue to receive 
stable doses of tadalafil ( daily dose 20 to 40mg) or sildenafil (daily dose at 
least 60mg) as well as other supportive treatments at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
Number of patients 218patients in total ( 109per arm)
Prim ary variable The primary efficacy endpoint ‘satisfactory clinical response ’is defined as 
the composite endpoint comprising the following components (independent 
central adjudication) :
2 of 3 m ust be fulfilled
6MWD increase by ≥10% or ≥30mfrom baseline to 
Week 24
WHO FCI or II at Week 24
NT-proBNP reduction ≥ 30% from baseline to 
Week 24 (NT -proBNP Week 24/baseline ratio ≤0.7), 
AND
Noclinical worsening (i.e, death of any cause, hospitalization 
due to w orsening PAH ,disease progression )

Plan for statistical analysis All demographic variables and baseline characteristics will be summarized 
for all analysis sets. Medical history findings and adverse events will be 
coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and 
medications by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical class according to the 
World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary.
An efficacy analysis will be performed in patients valid for the Full Analysis 
Set(primary an alysis set) and additionally in patients valid for the Per 
Protocol Set . Both groups (riociguat vs. active control) w ill be compared 
using a stratified Mantel -Haenzel test with a tw o-sided alpha level of 5%. 
Stratum is disease class. 
The null hypothesis tested for the primary endpoint of efficacy is that there is 
no difference in the satisfactory clinical response rates ( odds ratio [OR]) 
when treated w ith riociguat compared to patients who remain on their 
previous therapy ( i.e.,H0: OR = 1). The tw o-sided alternative is that there is 
a difference ( i.e.,H1: OR ≠1).
For statistical analysis of the primary endpoint with missing data, the last 
observation carried forw ard (LOCF) will be utilized. For composite 
endpoints each single component is independently replaced with the last 
available observation .
To assess the influence of missing data ,a supportive analysis without LOCF 
will be performed with a generalized estimating equations (GEE, binomial 
distribution) approach ,utilizing all adequate investigations of all primary 
variable components at any time from including baseline up to Week24.
To assess the influence of missing values not at random ,a sensitivity analysis 
is planned. A multiple imputation with penalty will be performed where the 
penalty is given by crossed improvement rates in both arms. Additionally, a 
tipping point analysis is planned.
A multiplicity correction is not necessary for the primary endpoint because 
only one primary endpoint is defined. Secondary endpoints are tested 
hierarchically with an alpha level of 5% .

3. Introduction -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.3 .
Background
Riociguat (BAY 63 -2521) is a direct stimulator of the soluble Guany late Cyclase (sGC) . The
randomi zed, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical Phase 3study  (PATENT -1) 
investiga ted the efficacy  and safet y of riociguat in patients with pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension (PAH). The study met the primary  endpoint (placebo -corrected change from 
baseline in 6-minute w alking distance [6MWD ]by 35.8 m)and showed statistically  
significant improvements in secondary  endpoints ,including p ulmonary  vascular resistance, 
N-terminal pro -brain natriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP), World Health Organization 
Functional Class (WHO FC), clinical worsening, living with pulmonary  hypertension (LPH) 
question naire, and Borg dy spnea score ( 1).
PAH is a devastating, life -threatening disease that is characterized by  rapid progression and a 
high mortality  (2).
Sequential combination therapy  has been the most widely  used clinical strategy of treatment 
escalation if th e treatment effect reached by  oral monotherapy  alone is not sufficient ( European 
Societ y of Cardiology  [ESC] /European Respiratory  Society  [ERS]guidelines 2015) (3). 
Transition between pulmonary  hypertension ( PH)-specific drug therapies has not been 
investigated in controlled studies and treatment response in the individual patient cannot be 
predicted. Failure of phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitor (PDE -5i) treatment however may  indicate 
impairment of the nitric oxide (NO) -sGC-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway (4). 
In contrast the treatment effect of sGC -stimulation is based on a NO -independent mode of action. 
Preliminary  data from the open -label transition study RESPITE indicate that patients transitioned 
from PDE -5i to riociguat may benefit based on this principle of pathway  optimization .
Rationale of the study
Oral monotherapy  including PDE -5i is one recommended treatment approach for patients with 
PAH who are classified as WHO FC II or III (3,5). However, a significant proportion of PAH 
patients fail to reach or maintain treatme nt goals with PDE -5i monotherapy  (6,7,8,9) indicating 
that the NO -sGC-cGMP pathway  in these patients may  be impaired (4). The clinical approach in 
patients demonstrating an insufficient clinical response on PDE -5i monotherapy  is typically  to 
add an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA). Most PAH treatment guidelines ,including 
ESC/ERS ,suggest that sequential combination therapy  is reasonable to be considered in patients 
with an inadequate clinical response, but the clinical evidence supporting this is weak (3,5).
An increasing body  of evidence suggests that a goal directed therapy  approach where a patient’s 
treatment regimen should be re -assessed if they  fail to reach certain clinical or therapeutic
targets in a certain time frame may  be the best approach for patients with PAH (10)as certain 
therapeutic targets such as WHO FC demonstrated to have prognostic implications (11,12,13). 
In the 2015 ESC/ERS guideline for treatment of PAH, it is stated that the overall treatment goal 
in patients with PAH is achieving a low risk status as defi ned by  determinants of prognosis such 
as WHO FC, 6MWD, and biomarkers (NT -proBNP, imaging) reflecting right heart function.

6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 16of 118
The RESPI TE study  was conducted t o investigate whether it is safe, feasible ,and beneficial to 
replace PDE -5i therapy  with riociguat in PAH patients demonstrating insufficient response to 
PDE -5 inhibition. Thefinal data of this h ypothesis -generating single arm study  showed that
patients failing to respond to PDE -5i could benefit from replacing a PDE -5i with riociguat b y 
improving 6MWD, WHO FC ,and NT -proBNP. The data indicate that transition of PDE -5i to 
riociguat may  serve as atreatment strategy  for PAH patients.
The rationale of the study  is to confirm the potential clinical benefit of switch within the NO 
sGC-cGMP pathway  in a randomized controlled study .
Benefit -risk assessment
Riociguat wasoverall considered to be safe and well tolerated in previous clinical studies at 
multiple doses between 1 and 2.5 mg 3times dail y (TID ) in patients with PAH and other 
indications , e.g., chronic thromboembolic pulmonary  hypertension (CTEPH) and pulmonary  
hypertension due to left ventricular dy sfunction (PH -LVD).
Beneficial effects of riociguat with regard to exercise capacity , cardiopulmonary  
hemody namics, and s ymptoms while being overall safe and well tolerated have been 
demonstrated recentl y in PAH as well as CTEPH in two independent clinical Phase 3studies, 
the PATENT -1 and CHEST -1, as well as the long -term extension studies thereof.
The safet y analysis of the clinical studies showed that most adverse drug effects were 
non-serious in nature, mainly  linked to the mechanisms of action of riociguat, and with a low
number of permanent treatment discontinuation.
Epistaxis and hemopty sis are known events for the underly ing disease with a high proportion 
of patients taking anti -coagulants. However, the observation of few serious and 
life-threatening/fatal cases of hemopty sis and pulmonary  hemorrhage poses a potential risk 
since these events may  also occur under riociguat treatment.
Recently , results of a study  on efficacy  and safet y of riociguat in patients with pulmonary  
hypertension associated with idiopathic inte rstitial pneumonias (PH -IIP) showed an increased 
risk of mortality  and serious adverse events among patients who received riociguat compared 
to those who received placebo, and an absence of apparent clinical benefit. Thestudy  was 
terminated early  upon the advice of its data monitoring committee (DMC).  I t was concluded 
that the benefit risk balance of riociguat in patients with PH -IIP is negative.  Riociguat is 
contraindicated in patients with PH -IIP.
The REPL ACE study (18588) will only  include patients w ith subty pes of Pulmonary  Arterial 
Hypertension (PAH), Dana Point Group 1 (14). Patients with all other ty pes of PH/ Dana 
Point Groups are excluded , also comprising patients with PH -IIP, according to the protocol.
The overall benefit -risk balance of riociguat is considered positive if used in adherence to this 
clinical study protocol and in accordance with the recommendations and guidance given in th e 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

Primary hypothesis
Replacement of PDE -5i by riociguat in patients who are not at treatment goal but on a stable 
dose of PDE -5i +/-ERA will lead to a significantl y higher rate of satisfactory  clinical response 
compared to patients who remain on PDE-5i +/-ERA because of the optimiz ation of the
NO-sGC-cGMP pathway provided by riociguat and its NO-independent mechanism of action .
Stable is defined as no change in the t ype of the PDE -5i and the dail y dose of PDE -5i and 
ERA during the 6 -week period prior to and at randomization.
Secondary hypothesis
In the group comparison ,transition to riociguat will significantl y improve 6MWD, 
NT-proBNP, WHO FC, and will have a reduction in clinical worsening at Week 24 compare d 
to continu ation of PDE -5i +/-ERA therap y.
4. Study objectives
The primary  objective is to assess the proportion of patients in each treatment arm with a 
satisfactory  clinical response as defined by  a composite primary  endpoint at Week 24.
The secondary  objective is t o demonstrate safet y and clinical effect at Week 24 indicated b y 
change in 6MWD, NT -proBNP, WHO FC andclinical worsening from baseline in each 
treatment arm .
5. Study design -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.4 .
Design overview
This is a prospective, randomi zed, international , multicenter, double -arm, 24 -week, 
controlled, open -label study  of rio ciguat in patients with PAH who are on a stable dose of
PDE -5i +/-ERA , but not at treatment goal .The decision for a randomized but not blinded 
study  design was made in agreement with the advisory  committee for feasibility  reasons. As 
riociguat is available as an approved treatment in the majority  of countrie s, recruitment was 
not considered feasible into a blinded Phase 4study . Moreover, the open -label, randomized 
design with a fixed duration of 24 weeks and the composite endpoint of satisfactory  clinical 
response is considered a pragmatic alternative to all ow for meaningful results with reasonable 
effort and within a reasonable time frame.
A mandatory  screening period of 2weeks before randomization will be performed for all 
patients to ensure stability and similar starting conditions at baseline .
Eligible PAH patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to remain on their current 
PAH -specific treatment (the control arm) or to replace the PDE -5itreatment with riociguat
(the riociguat arm) .
Patients on specific combination therap y with PDE -5i and ERA need to continue taking ERA 
at a stable dose in both treatment arms.
At Week 24,a composite endpoint of satisfactory  clinical response will be assessed.

Patients in both treatment arms follow the same visit schedule (see also Section 16.1). 
At the discretion of the investigators and if applicable (e.g., short distance to study  center) the 
home visits may  also be performed at the study  center.
For riociguat the initial home vi sits (H1 -3) and V2 include the dose titration period, followed 
by the maintenance period with the established individual dose.
Treatment period (Duration: 24 weeks)
Patients randomized to the control arm at the baseline visit (Week 0) will continue on thei r 
current PAH -specific treatment for 24 weeks. 
Patients randomized to the riociguat arm , will have a wash -out period before starting the 
titration period of riociguat:
Riociguat treatment willbe started after a wash -out period of 24 hours with previous 
sildenafil therap y (daily dose at least 60mg) and 48 hours after previous tadalafil 
therap y (daily dose 20 to 40mg).
Titration period (Riociguat arm, d uration: 8 weeks)
The dose titration will be performed with the aid of an interactive voice response system 
(IXRS).The investigator decision regarding stud y medication must be clearly  documented in 
the source documents prior to contacting IXRS.
The starting dose will be 1 mg riociguat TID. The individual riocigua t dose will be titrated 
every  2weeks according to the patient’s well -being and peripheral s ystolic blood pressure 
(SBP) measured at trough ,preferabl y before intake of the next morning dose. At each titration 
visit for the riociguat arm (Weeks 2, 4, and 6),the investigator needs to decide, based on the 
patient’s SBP, whether the study  medication dose should be modified.
The respective decision (increase, maintain ,or decrease dose) must be entered in the IXRS
thatwill automatically  allocate the right dose in accordance with the respective individual 
titration scheme. Afterwards, the investigator will be informed b y the s ystem which dosage 
needs to be dispensed to the patient for the next titration period (starts p referably  with the 
morning dose). Blood pressure measurements and communication with the center for dose 
decision will be facilitated by  experienced study  nurses.
The investigators will apply  the following blood pressure ( BP)based titration rules for thei r 
dose decision and should follow the local riociguat label for detailed information as follows :
Dosage should be increased in 2 -week intervals b y 0.5 mg increments to a maximum of 
2.5mg three times daily , if SBP is ≥95mmHg and the patient has no signs o r symptoms 
of hy potension. If SBP falls below 95 mmHg, dosage should be maintained provided 
the patient does not show any  signs or s ymptoms of hy potension. If at any  time during 
the up -titration phase s ystolic blood pressure decreases below 95 mmHg, and th e patient 
shows signs or s ymptoms of hy potension, the current dose should be decreased by  
0.5mgtid.

6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 20of 118
General Note: While dose up -titration can onl y occur at the scheduled visits, a dose decrease 
can be performed at an y time based on the patient’s SBP and well -being. In case of intended 
dose decrease which can be done independently  from any  planned study  visit, the inv estigator 
will contact the IXRS and request a dose adjustment. This visit is to be declared as an 
unscheduled visit.
In general, if the investigator requests an increase or decrease in the riociguat dose via the 
IXRS , the subsequent dose modification will not exceed plus/minus 0.5 mg.
It is allowed in case of riociguat side effects to suspend a foreseen up -titration step and to 
maintain the dose ( this should be entered into the IXRS ).
During the titration period, a request of an increase of riociguat dose i s only  possible at the 
planned titration visit s at Week s2,4, and 6.The dose reached at the end of the titration period
at Week 8 is considered the patient’s optimal dose based on SBP and well-being. 
Maintenance period (Riociguat arm, d uration: 16 weeks )
Riociguat should be continued at the optimal dose as determined at the end of the titration 
period (Week 8) throughout the maintenance period . 
Visits (for both arms) will take place at Week 16 and Week 24. The IXRS will automatically  
allocate the right riociguat dose at each visit. 
Dose reductions or discontinuation of riociguat for safet y reasons are allowed at an y time. 
Increases or re -increases in 0.5 mg steps (maximum dose 2.5 mg) are possible at the 
investigator’s discretion weighing the benefit wi th potential risks implied, e.g., hypotension.
Smoking status is assessed regularl y during the study as plasma concentrations of riociguat in 
smokers are reduced compared to non -smokers, and dose adjustment may  be necessary  in 
patients who start or stop s moking during treatment with riociguat.
General Note : In case of intended dose adjustments, the investigator will contact the IXRS , 
which can be done independently  from any  planned study  visit, and request a dose 
adjustment. This visit is to be declared as an unscheduled visit.
Premature discontinuation of study  treatment
In case of premature discontinuation of study  treatment, the process detailed in Section 6.3.1.1
should be followed.
Visit 4 / End of Treatment (EOT) (Week 24 ± 4 days)
All patients randomized to either treatment arm should perform Visit 4 / EOT .  This is the last 
visit of the maintenance period , when all relevant efficacy  and safet y measurements will be 
performed.

Safety  Follow -Up (FU) visit (30 day s ± 5 day s after last intake of study  treatment)
A safet y FU visit istobe performed 30 days (± 5 days) after the planned end of study  
treatment OR 30 day s (± 5 day s) after premature disco ntinuation of study  treatment.
Primary endpoint (at Week 24)
The primary  composite endpoint is to assess the proportion of patients in each treatment arm 
with a satisfactory  clinical response at Week 24 defined as improvement in “2 of 3” (see 
Section 10.3.2.1 ).
Justification of the design
Riociguat was considered safe and well tolerated in previous clinical studies at multiple doses 
between 1.0 and 2 .5mg TID in patients with PAH. This study  will be conducted to assess the 
effectiveness of replacing PDE -5i therapy  with riociguat compared with maintaining PDE -5i 
therapy  in PAH patients who are on a stable dose of PDE -5i +/-ERA, but not at treatment go al.
While it may  appear inappropriate to randomize patients who are not “at treatment goal” to 
the control arm, where their current PAH -specific treatment regimen will just be continued, 
inthe absence of a clear definition of treatment response, the defin ition forthis study  is 
inspired by  the ESC/ ERS table for risk assessment (15)and based on 6MWD and WHO FC 
only.Other parameters of prognostic relevance including pulmonary  hemody namics may  well 
be in the range of low risk/ at treatment goal according to guidelines . It can be assumed that a 
large number of patients on mono -or combination therap y with PAH -targeted drugs are in a 
stable clinical situation, but do not reach WHO FC I /II or a 6MWD > 440 m. Clinical stability  
at randomization will be ensured b y requirements such as stable doses of PAH -therapy  and 
diuretics, and the mandatory  14-day screening period. By  this, the study  design intends to
represent the real -life clinical situation of PAH patients, in which close follow -up of 
prognostically  relevant parameters i s required for the decision on a next step of treatment 
escalation. As there will be rater -blinded assessments and central adjudication, but no 
blinding of the stud y treatment arms, the investigator will at any time be able to decide about 
any necessary  treatment escalation. Thus, even treatment of a patient randomized to the 
control or maintenance arm will stringently  follow treatment guidelines.      
End of Study
The end of the stud y as a whole will be reached as soon as the last safet y FU visit of the last 
patient according to the above definition has been reached in all participating countries 
(European Union [EU] and non -EU).
Primary completion
Primary  completion will be upon reaching the primary  endpoint at 24 weeks of treatment.

6. Study population
The patient population that best reflects the clinical situation for transition is patients on 
ERA -combination therapy , as for most patients on PDE -5i monotherap y combination therapy 
may be the next appropriate step of treatment escalation. There may  however be clinical 
conditions where a transition to riociguat from PDE -5i monotherap y appears to be appropriate 
at the discretion of the treating ph ysician.

Withdraw al of patients from study 6.3
6.3.1 Withdraw al–amended
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.7 .
Discontinuation of study treatment -amended 6.3.1.1
Study treatment (riociguat or control) discontinuation for any  reason does not represent 
withdrawal from the study  and should not result in withd rawal of the patient from the study .
Please see definitions for premature discontinuation from the study  in Section 6.3.1.2.
Patients who prematurel y discontinue from the study treatment will still be followed up for 
collection of safety  and efficacy  data at Visit 4 / EOT at Week 24 (± 4 day s) and should also 
perform the safet yFU visit at 30 day s (± 5 day s) after the last intake of st udy drug.  Note that 
the safet yFU visit may  occur before Visit 4 / EOT if premature discontinuation from 
treatment occurs early  during the study .
In all cases, the reason for study  treatment discontinuation must be recorded in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) and in the patient’s medical records.
Patients may  decide to withdraw their consent to participate in the study  and to no longer 
attend study  visits and take the study  treatment (if not already  discontinued); they  may  object 
to generation and processing of post -study  treatment discontinuation data. Patient decision
will be recorded in the eCRF. Patients who withdraw from the study  will have the vital status
(alive or dead) reported in the eCRF at Visit 4 / EOT . The contact can be by  visit, phone or e -
mail, and also by  family  members. Every  effort should be made to c ontact the patient by  
telephone at the times the study  visits were scheduled for the remaining duration of the study , 
to determine if an y of the primary , secondary , or other endpoints have been reached. All 
attempts to retrieve information about the patien ts should be documented in the patient ’s 
records. In addition to withdrawing their consent for attending the study  visits, patients may  
also object to releasing any  other information regarding their health status. For this, the 
patient must sign a correspo nding declaration of objection; alternativel y, the patient’s oral 
objection may  be documented in the source data. In such cases, every  effort should be made 
to obtain vital status (alive or dead) information through consultation of public databases, 
wherev er allowed b y local regulations.
Criteria for withdrawal from study treatment
Patients must be withdrawn from study treatment if any  of the following occurs:
At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative. At 
any time during the study and without giving reasons, a patient may  decline to 
participate further. The patient will not suffer any  disadvantage as a result.
If, in the investigator ’s opinion, continuation of the study treatment would be 
harmful to the patient ’s well-being .
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 63 -2521 / 18588
6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 27of 118
Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) or intercurrent diseases which the investigator 
judges unacceptable for continuation of participation in the study .
Occurrence of adverse drug reactions, which have from the investigator’s point of 
view, a negat ive impact on the patient’s individual risk -benefit ratio. (Investigators 
are obliged to reassess the patient’s individual risk -benefit ratio on a continuous 
basis. Factors like anticipated treatment effect, progression of underl ying disease, 
occurrence of side effects and alternative treatment options have to be considered) .
In case a patient is diagnosed with pulmonary  veno -occlusive disease (PVOD) 
while on treatment with study  drug, the administration of riociguat has to be 
stopped immediately
Pertinent non -compliance with the conditions for the study or instructions by  the 
investigator
In case of pregnancy  or breast feeding
Participation in another clinical study
Patient does not tolerate the lowest possible riociguat dose (0 .5mg TID)
Patients may be withdrawn from the stud y treatment if any of the following occurs:
At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator ( e.g.,
obvious non -compliance, safet y concerns).
Although not preferred, patients may  interrupt their int ake of stud y treatment due to 
reasonable circumstances/reasons at an y time (e.g. ,hospitalization in a remote hospital 
without study  treatment access, safet y reasons, side effects). If an interruption lasts longer 
than 14 days in a row, it is at the discre tion of the investigator to discontinue the study  
participation, and the eCRF of the early termination visit must be completed.
In case of treatment interruptions for 3 days or more ,treatment should be restarted at 1mg 
TID for 2 weeks, and continue dwith the dose titration regimen as shown in Figure 7–1.
Discontinuation of study -amended 6.3.1.2
Depending on the time point of withdrawal, a withdrawn pati ent is referred to as either 
“screening failure” or “dropout” as specified below:
Screening failure
A patient who, for an y reason ( e.g.,failure to satisfy  the selection criteria), terminates the 
study  before the time point used for the definition of “drop out” (see below) is regarded a 
“screening failure”.
Re-screening of a “screening failure” is allowed ;thus, participation of an initial “ screening
failure” patient at a later time point ,provided he/she meets all selection criteria upon 
re-screening ,is acceptable. Re-screening should be limited to situations preventing the patient 
from safel y completing the study  procedures (e.g., acute infections or diseases affecting the 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 63 -2521 / 18588
6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 28of 118
patient`s ability  to complete the 6MWD test, acute dy sregulations of blood pre ssure). 
Re-screening due to fluctuating data around the upper or lower limit of reference, in order to 
achieve a value within the normal range, is not allowed.
Theinvestigator has to ensure that the repeated screening procedures do not expose the patient 
to an unjustifiable health risk. Also, for re -screening , the patient has to re -sign the informed 
consent form (ICF) , even if it was not changed after the patient’s previous screening .
Dropout
A patient who discontinues study  participation prematurely  for a ny reason after randomization
is defined as a “dropout” .  If a patient prematurel y discontinues study  treatment anddoes 
notwish to continue with the remaining scheduled visits, t he investigator should take 
allpossible effort to complete a final evaluation, and the patient should be asked for his 
agreement to schedule an earl y termination visit as soon as possible, a t which time point 
allassessments scheduled for Visit 4 / EOT are to be performed.
General procedures
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF and in the patient’s 
medical records. 
The patient may  object to the generation and processing of post -withdrawal data as specified 
in Section 13.4.
Any patient removed from the study will remain under medical supervision until discharge or 
transfer is medically  acceptable.
Details for the premature termination of the study  as a whol e (or components thereof) are 
provided in Section 12).
6.3.2 Replacement
Patients who discontinue the study  during the mandatory  screening period may  be replaced.
There will be no replacement of dropouts during this study .
Patient identification 6.4
After a patient has signed the ICF, the patient identification number that has been assigned to 
the patient will be provided to the investigator b y IXRS .
The pati ent number is a 9 -digit number consisting of:
first 2 digits = country  code
next 3 digits = center number within the country
last 4 digits = current patient number within the center .

7. Treatments
Treatments to be administered -amended 7.1
This section was chang ed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.10 .
Riociguat/BAY 63 -2521 film -coated tablets will be used in this study  at a dosage of 0.5mg, 
1.0mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg and 2.5 mg.
Tablets will be administered orall y.
Note that patients randomi zed to the riociguat arm will have a washout period before starting 
titration period of riociguat (see “ wash -out period ” in Section 5for details). The starting dose 
is 1mg TID; the intervals between drug intakes should be 6 to 8hours. The dosage should be 
increased b y 0.5 mg increments in 2 week intervals t o 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, and 2.5 mg TID 
(maximal total daily  dose). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are 
not tolerated (minimal dose of 0.5 mg TID). After the titration period ( i.e.,during the 
maintenance period) riociguat should be continued at the optimal individual dose as 
determined at the end of the titration period (Week 8; see Figure 7–1). Dose reductions or 
discontinuation of riociguat for safet y reasons are allowed at an y time, as well as dose 
increases in 0.5 mg increments (up to 2.5 mg) at the discretion of the investigator (see
Section 5).
Patients randomized to the control arm will continue to receive stable doses of tadalafil (daily  
dose 20 to 40 mg) or sildenafil (dail y dose at least 60mg) as well as other supportive 
treatments at the discretion of the investigator.
Concomitant treatment with ERA is not subject of the research ofthis study ; therefore, ERA 
are not considered study  drug. However, a s these are effective specific PAH drugs ,their dose s
need to remain stable in combination with PDE -5i within 6weeks prior to randomization and 
throughout the stud y. Any change in dose or application of ERA needs to be documented.
Identity of study treatment -amended 7.2
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.11 .
All study  drugs (investigational medicinal products [I MP]) will be labeled according to the 
requirements of local law and legislation. Label text will be approved according to the 
sponsor’s agreed procedures, and a cop y of the labels will be made available to the study site 
upon request.
Asystem of numbering in accordance with all requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice 
will be used, ensuring that each dose of riociguat can be traced back to the respective bulk 
batch of the ingredients. Lists linking all numbering levels will be maintained by  the 
sponsor’s clinical supplies Quality  Assurance group. 
Acomplete record of riociguat batch numbers and expiry  dates as well as the labels will be 
maintained in the sponsor’s study  file.

Treatment assignment -amended 7.3
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.12 .
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to remain on current PAH -specific treatment (the control arm) 
or to replace the PDE -5i treatment with riociguat (the riociguat arm). Central randomization
(by IXRS) is planned ,stratified by  etiology  of PAH by :
• Idiopathic (I)PAH/ heritable ( H)PAH/ PAH drug and toxin induced
• PAH -CHD, PA H-portopulmonary  PAH ( PoPH )
• PAH -CTD
Following washout (see “ wash -out period ” in Section 5for details), a ll eligible patients 
randomized to the riociguat arm will receive a starting dose of riociguat of 1mgTIDin this 
open -label study .Thestarting dose of 1 mg may  be down -titrated to 0.5 mg at the discretion 
of the investigator and at any  point during the8-week titration period .
Patients randomized to the control arm will remain on their current PAH -specific treatment .
Patients on combination therap y with ERA need to continue at a stable dose in both treatment 
arms.
Dosage and administration 7.4
Riociguat will be administered TID as film -coated immediate -release tablets with or without 
food. The starting dose will be 1 mg TID, followed by  a dose adjustment period of 8 weeks 
(titration period), and an overall treatment duration of 24 weeks .
Dose increase or decrease criteria are described in Section 5and the titrati on scheme is

Treatment compliance 7.7
Any discrepancies between actual and expected amount of returned study  treatment must be 
discussed with the patient at the time o f the visit, and any  explanation must be documented in 
the source records.
The packages of the investigational drug have to be brought back to the investigational site, 
and tablets will be counted for a compliance check. 
The respective compliance should b e between 80% and 120% of the calculated dose , based on 
the information on tablet count and exposure for the entire period of stud y participation .
8. Non-study therapy
Prior and concomitant therapy -amended 8.1
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.13 .
The intake of the following concomitant medication is not allowed at any time while a 
patient is on riociguat:
PDE -5i (e.g.,sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil) must not be co -administered with 
riociguat
Non-specific PDE -inhibitors ( e.g.,dipyridamole, theophy lline)
NO donors (e.g.,nitrates, amy l nitrite)
The intake of the following concomitant medication is not allowed within 30days prior 
to and at randomization :
PCA and PRA by any administration route within 30 days before randomization
(except for vasoreactivity testing).
Patients, who require respective medications (except for PCA) need to be withdrawn from the 
study  drug (refer to Se ction 6.3.1 ).
Specific PAH medication:
Dose c hanges in PAH -specific medication (i.e.,PDE -5i orERA) should be avoided during the 
study .Dose changes considered clinicall y necessary b y the investigator need to be 
documented. Notabl yhospitalization for initiation of intravenous or subcutaneous prostanoid 
therap y fulfills the criterion of clinical worsening , as may  disease progression with a need for 
any additional specific PAH targeted medication (see also Section 10.3.2.1 for Definition of 
Clinical Worsening) .The patient may remain in the study  even if escalation of PAH therapy  
is required to maintain or improve the clinical status of the patient. The decision to keep the 
patient in the study  is at the discretion of the investigator.
Other concomitant medication:
The concomitant use of riociguat with strong multi -pathway  cytochrome P450 
(CYP) and P -glycoprotein 1 (P -gp)/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
inhibitors such as azole antimy cotics ( e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) or human 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 63 -2521 / 18588
6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 34of 118
immunodeficiency  virus ( HIV)protease inhibitors ( e.g., ritonavir) is not 
recommended, due to the pronounced increase in riociguat exposure (see also 
‘Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction’ in 
Section 4.5of the current Company  Core Data Sheet ).
The concomita nt use of riociguat with strong CYP1A1 (CYP family  1, subfamily  
A,polypeptide 1) inhibitors, such as the t yrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, and 
strong P -gp/BCRP inhibitors, such as the immunosuppressive agent cy closporine 
A, may  increase riociguat expos ure (see Section ‘Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction’ in Section 4.5of the current Company  
Core Data Sheet ). These drugs should be used with caution. B Pshould be 
monitored and dose reduction of riociguat considered.
Other medications considerations (detailed information can be found in the current IB):
Pre-and co medication with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg once 
daily ) reduced riociguat mean area under the curve (AUC) by  26% and mean 
maximum observed co ncentration ( Cmax)by 35%. This is not considered clinically  
relevant. 
Co-administration of the antacid aluminum hy droxide/magnesium hy droxide 
reduced riociguat mean AUC by  34% and mean C max by 56%. Antacids should be 
taken at least 1 hour after riociguat .
Other treatments considerations:
Supportive treatments which may  also be used for the treatment of PAH such as 
oral anticoagulants, diuretics, digitalis, calcium channel blockers or oxy gen 
supplementation are permitted. However, treatment with diuretics should be stable 
for at least 30 days before randomization . 
Patients with supplemental long -term oxy gen therapy  may  be included.
Concomitant treatment in case of clinical deterioration:
In case of a clinically  relevant deterioration of the patient’s signs or s ymptoms of 
PAH, it is at the discretion of the investigator toperform additional invasive 
hemody namic measurements according to practice guidelines; this needs to be 
documented in t he eCRF.
Post-study therapy -amended 8.2
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.14 .
Further medical treatment of patients atthe end of the study  will be decided by  the 
investigator at Visit 4 / EOT .  In case riociguat is indicated for further treatment, patients will 
be prescribed riociguat / Adempas .The sponsor is going to ensure that patients will receive 
riociguat treatment after completion of the study  in countries where riociguat is not 
reimbursed/commercially available. Based on the local regulations ,the sponsor is going to 
identify  and take appropriate measure s, in agreement with the center/ treating phy sician, such

Patients randomized to the riociguat arm
Riociguat will be dispensed (note the dose titration scheme for riociguat arm, see Figure 7–1).
Date and time of the last PDE -5i dose will be documented by  the investigator. Patients will 
have the following wash -out period s:
Patients pretreated with a stable dose of sildenafil ( dose at least 60mg/day) will be
switched to riociguat after a wash -out period of 24hours following the last dose of 
sildenafil
Patients pretreated with a stable dose of tadalafil (dose range 20to 40mg/day) will be 
switched to riociguat after a wash -out p eriod of 48hours following the last dose of 
tadalafil .
Riociguat dosing start
Based on the time of the last PDE -5i dose, date and time of the first dose of riociguat after the 
wash -out period will be determined by  the investigator and communicated to the patient. 
Before the first dose of riociguat ,BPmeasurement sneed to be performed to ensure that SBP 
is ≥95mmHg. If the BP is below this value, riociguat must not be administered (BP 
measurement may be repeated within the next 24 hours) .Measurement of BPand 
application of first riociguat dose may  be performed at the study  center or by an experienced 
nurse at home (see Section 9.6.3.2 ).
Date and time of intake of the first dose of riociguat need to be documented by  the investigator.
The nurse will contact the center for this purpose via phone. The dosage will then be 
individually  adjusted during the titration period (H 1 to V 2). 
Home Visits 1, 2, 3 (Week s2, 4, 6 ±2 days )
Home visits may  be facilitated by  experienced nurses, measuring BPand agreeing on the next 
dose in phone contact with the treating investigator at the center. Prior to start of an y 
study -related activities, the experienced nurse needs to be trained on the Study  Protocol. The 
training needs to be documented in the investigator site file. The nurse will follow the 
instructions given b y the treating investigator.
The experienced nurse is responsible for the Drug Accountability , and dispensing riociguat 
medication. When performing home visits, the experienced nurse will collect the following 
information and report to treating inv estigator at the site.
The following procedures will be performed:
Dispense of stud y medication (see Section 7.4)

Change from baseline in mRRS and mRRS category  (see Section 16.4).
Approach to the analysis
Oral monotherap y or upfront combination therap y is recommended b y the ERS/ESC 
guidelines for treatment of PAH patients with a low or intermediate risk according to their 
prognostic evaluation. There is increasing evidence that the concept of combining diff erent 
signaling pathway s in PAH -specific combination therapy  may  provide additional benefit to 
patients. 
The general treatment goal is to achieve a low risk status for the individual PAH patient as 
defined b y determinants of prognosis such as WHO FC, 6MWD , or NT -proBNP.
Interim result sfrom the uncontrolled open -label RESPI TE study  showed that transition of 
PDE -5i to riociguat in patients not reaching treatment goals results in improvements in these 
clinically  and prognostic relevant parameters. To the wid ely accepted concept of combination 
therap y, this adds the concept of optimizing a pathway  by transition to a more effective drug. 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 42of 118
It has been agreed b y key experts that a randomized study  would be needed to confirm the 
concept. The stud y design of REPL ACE comes as close as possible in matching the real 
clinical situation in which a patient in on stable PDE -5i andERA –combination therapy , or on 
PDE -5i monotherap y and does not reach treatment goals. Treatment escalation may not be 
imminent but would be the n ext step. Patients will be randomized to remain on their stable 
treatment or to transition their PDE -5i treatment component to riociguat.
Recent studies in P AH as AMBITION applied an event -driven design with a clinical 
worsening endpoint. Due to the low ev ent rate on active treatment these studies would require 
large patient numbers and length ystudies until result sare available. In recent expert 
discussions moving away from the rather defensive strategy  of counting deterioration to a 
composite endpoint of clinical improvement has been discussed as a pragmatic necessity . This 
is supported by  the fact that mortality  never made a difference between treatment groups in 
these studies. The REPLACE composite endpoint reflects the concept of clinical 
improvement i n the absence of events of clinical worsening. This reflects what the clinician 
and the treatment guidelines define as treatment goals: improvement in parameters relevant 
clinically  and for prognosis and thus reducing the risk of deterioration in the indiv idual 
patient.
Similar endpoints were applied successfull y in the AI R-study  with inhaled iloprost and as 
secondary  endpoint in AMBITION. The criteria when applied to our data from PATENT1/2 
or RESPI TE showed that improvement with riociguat treatment can ni cely be demonstrated.
This also holds true when the component of NT -proBNP improvement was added to the 
composite endpoint . This has been recommended by  the Study  Core Advisory  Committee 
considering the more objective nature of this parameter in an unbl inded randomized study .
Baseline Demographics
Aprevalent patient population similar to the one in RESPI TE is expected, with the difference 
that also PAH associated with CTD will be included, and expected to form up to 20% of the 
overall study  population. Mea n age: 54 years, slight female predominance of 60%; 75% 
IPAH/ HPAH; mean time on PDE -5i treatment 2 years; 80% on ERA -PDE -5i combina tion at 
baseline ; mean 6MWD at baseline 370m; all patients WHO FC III.

Safety 9.6
9.6.1 Adverse events
Definitions 9.6.1.1
Definition of adverse event
In a clinical stud y, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e.,any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical in vestigation patient after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study .Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporally  or causally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.
A surgical procedure that was planned p rior to the start of the study  by any physician treating 
the patient should not be recorded as an AE (however, the condition for which the surgery  is 
required may  be an AE).
In the following differentiation between medical history  and AEs, the term “condit ion” may  
include abnormal e.g., physical examination findings, s ymptoms, diseases, laboratory .
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no 
symptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded 
as medical history (e.g., seasonal allergy  without acute complaints).
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which 
symptoms or treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged 
intensity , are recorded as medical history (e.g., allergic pollinosis) .
Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as AEs.This includes intercurrent illnesses.
Definition of serious adverse event 
Aserious adverse event (SAE )is classified as an y untoward medical occurrence that, at an y 
dose, meets an y of the following criteria (a –f):
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was 
at risk of deat h at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalizat ion will not be regarded as an SAE if 
at least one of the following exceptions is met:
The admission results in a hospital stay  of less than 12 hours
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 63 -2521 / 18588
6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 44of 118
The admission is preplanned (e.g., elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to 
the start of the stud y;admission is part of the study  procedures as described in 
Section 9.2)
The admission is not associated with an AE ( e.g., social hospitalization for
purposes of respite care).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospitalization may  
fulfill the criterion of ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where local r egulatory  authorities 
specificall y require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity .
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
f.Is another serious or important medical event as judged b y the investigator .
Classifications for adverse event assessment 9.6.1.2
All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the ca tegories 
detailed below.
9.6.1.2.1 Seriousness
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section 9.6.1.1 .
9.6.1.2.2 Intensity
The intensity  of an AE is classified according to the following categories:
Mild
Moderate
Severe .
9.6.1.2.3 Causal relationship
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of study  
treatment is a decision to be made b y the investig ator, who is a qualified phy sician, based on 
all information available at the time of the completion of the case report form ( CRF ).
Causality  should be assessed separatel y for each study treatment as detailed in the CRF. If the 
investigator feels that the event cannot be firml y attributed to one of the study treatments 
(e.g., owing to a suspected underly ing interaction), the same assessment will be documented 
for each study  treatment.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 45of 118
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable c ausal relationship” 
to the study  treatment in question.
Possible answers are “y es” or “no” .
An assessment of “no” would include:
1.The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g., mechanical bleeding at surgical 
site.
or
2.Non-plausibility , e.g., the patient is struck by  an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug caused disorientation that may  have caused the event; cancer 
developing a few day s after the first drug administration.
An assessment of “y es” indicates that the AE is reason ably associated with the use of the 
study  treatment.
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study  treatment 
include:
The temporal sequ ence from drug administration: The event should occur after the 
drug is given. The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated 
in the clinical context of the event.
Recovery  on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug 
re-introduction (re -challenge): Patient’s response after de -challenge or re -
challenge s hould be considered in view of the usual clinical course of the event in 
question.
Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history  and course of 
the disease being treated and an y other d isease the patient may  have.
Concomitant medication or treatment: 
The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whether an y of them might have caused the event in 
question.
The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the study  treatment: 
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism ,and 
excretion) of the stud y treatment, coupled with the individual patient’s 
pharmacod ynamics should be considered.
Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to 
protocol -required procedure(s).
Possible answ ers are “y es” or “no” .

The predicted forced expiratory  volume in one second (FEV 1) is a calculated value. For the 
calculation the following formulas need to be applied:
Predicted forced expiratory  volume (FEV) (women) = 3.95 * height [m] –0.025 * 
age [y ears] –2.60.
Predicted FEV (man) = 4.30 * height [m] –0.029 * age [years] –2.49.
The p redicted TL C is a calculated value. For the calculation the following formulas need to be 
applied:
Predicted TLC (women) = 6.60 * height [m] -5.79.
Predicted TLC (man) = 7.99 * height [m] –7.08.

DLCO predicted will be newly  determined by  the single breat h technique according to the 
standards recommended by  the American Thoracic Society  (and the European Respiratory  
Society ) (16).
9.7.3 6MWD test -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.28 .
The 6MWD test will be performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Societ y 
Guideline without assessing Borg -Dyspnoea -Index (17). Test results will be recorded on the 
eCRF. 
To ensure a bl inded assessment from the randomization visit (baseline ),adequate measures 
need to be taken at the study  center when performing the 6MWD :
The test has to be performed by  a phy sician or study  nurse who is blinded to the 
study  treatment of the patient.
The person performing the test must not be involved in the process of study  drug 
administration .
The person performing the test should record the results on a separate work sheet 
and, where possible, a different person (could be the person who is involved in the 
study  treatment administration) should enter them into the eCRF.
For details on time points refer to Section 16.1, for further details on assessment refe r to 
Section 16.2.
9.7.4 Determination of WHO FC -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.29 .
The patient s’ WHO FCwill be determined according to the WHO classification. Test results 
will be recorded on the eCRF. 
The person assessing the WHO FC must be suitably  trained (referred to as “assessor” below) .  
Toensure blinded assessment of the WHO FCfrom the randomization visit (baseline ), the 
following adequate measures also need to be taken at the study  center:
Theassessor must be blinded to the study  treatment of the patient
Theassessor must not be involved in the process of study  drug administration.
The assessor should record the test results on a separate work sheet and, where 
possible, a different person (could be the same person who is involved in the 
treatment administratio n) should enter them into the eCRF.
Ideally, the WHO FCassessment should alway s be performed by  the same person.
For details on time points refer to Section 16.1, for further details on the assessment refer to

9.7.5 cMRI
cMRI  will be performed on a subset of patients participating in t his study . A separate manual 
will be produced and provided to the site.
Objective measurements of pulmonary  hemod ynamics assessed b y RHC have been applied in 
PAH studies using primary  endpoints ,in which parameters of subjective nature were the main 
compon ents(e.g., 6MWD or WHO FC) . For the feasibility  of this Phase 4study ,RHC 
investigation was not considered. Instead, a s an alternative ,cMRI was recommended because 
it is well standardized and provides an accurate and objective assessment of parameters of 
right ventricular function with established prognostic relevance. Based on the characteristics 
of thismethod, assessment will even be possible if a subset of patien ts from centers with 
expertise and technical requirements isto be included. The assessment of cMRI  parameters is 
considered an important element of th isstudy asit will provide essential complementary  
information on right ventricular function and remodel ing; both of which are closely  related to
the major study  objectives and will therefore be relevant for supporting the interpretation of 
the clinical endpoints.
Appropriateness of procedures/measurements 9.8
All procedures and measurements are standard variabl es/methods in clinical stud ies and/ or 
clinical practice. They  are widel y used and generally  recognized as reliable, accurate and 
relevant.
10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size
General considerations 10.1
All variables will be analyzed descriptiv ely with appropriate statistical methods: categorical 
variables b y frequency  tables and continuous variables by  sample statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, median, quartiles, and maximum). I f not mentioned otherwise, all 
statistical tests will be performed with a t ype I two -sided error rate of 5%.
Statistical analy ses will be performed using Statistical Anal ysis Sy stem (SAS) version 9.2 or 
later.
Analysis sets 10.2
Analy ses will be performed for three analy sis sets: full analy sis set (FAS), per protocol set 
(PPS) and safet y analysis set. The FAS will be the primary  anal ysis set. 
All patients randomized and treated (at least one treatment after randomization ) will be valid 
for the FAS, hence the number of patients in the safet y and FAS will be id entical. 
A patient is valid for the per protocol anal ysis, if the patient is valid for the safet y analy sis 
set/FAS, has an adequate investigation of all primary  variable components at baseline and 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

6 JAN 2017 Version no. 2.0 Page: 54of 118
shows no major protocol deviations (refer to the SAP for d etails on m ajor protocol 
deviations ).
Primary  endpoint components are: assessments of clinical worsening (as defined in
Section 10.3.2.1 ), 6MWD, WHO FC,andNT-proBNP .
Final decisions regarding validity  will be made during the Validity  Review Meeting and 
documented in the Validity  Review Report.
Variables and planned statistical analyses 10.3
10.3.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics
All demographic variables and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all analysis 
sets. Medical history  findings and AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) codes and medications by  Anatomical Thera peutic 
Chemical class according to the WHO -Drug Dictionary  (WHO -DD).
10.3.2 Efficacy endpoints
An efficacy  anal ysis will be performed in patients valid for FAS (primary  analy sis) and PPS. 
Both groups (riociguat vs. active control) will be compared using a stratif ied Mantel -Haenzel 
test with a two -sided alpha level of 5%. Stratum is the disease class (definition see 
Section 7.3). 
The null hy pothesis tested fo r the primary  endpoint of efficacy  is that there is no difference in 
the satisfactory  clinical response rates (OR) when treated with riociguat compared to patients 
that remain on their previous therap y (i.e.,H0: OR = 1). The two -sided alternative is that there 
is a difference ( i.e.,H1: OR ≠1). 
For statistical anal ysis of the primary  endpoint with missing endpoint data, the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) will be utilized. The reason for LOCF is given in the 
following: the primary  endpoint measur es improvements, thus, using LOCF will ( a) not y ield 
favorable results in the riociguat arm and (b) yield favorable results in the active control arm. 
Because of the inclusion criterion “stable on PDE 5-i oneexpect sthe first case (a) to be much 
more frequent . Thus, LOCF is not in favor for the whole study . For composite endpoints each 
single component is independently  replaced with the last available observation , respectivel y.
To assess the influence of missing data ,a supportive anal ysis without L OCF will be 
performed with a generalized estimating equations approach (binomial distribution) utilizing 
all adequate investigations of all primary  variable components at any  time from including 
baseline up to Week 24.

Both methods above cover missing values of ty pe ‘mis sing completel y at random’. In this 
open -label study  there might also be missing values of ty pe ‘missing not at random’. To 
assess the influence of these missing values a sensitivity  anal ysis is planned. A m ultiple 
imputation with penalty  will be performed where the penalt y is given b y crossed 
improvement rates in both arms .
Riociguat arm: imputation with a clinical improvement rate observed in active 
control arm
Control arm: imputation with a clinical improv ement rate observed in riociguat
arm
Thus, the highest sensible rate of clinical improvement is the rate in the riociguat armand this 
is applied to the control arm in the imputation process. Further, the lowest sensible rate of 
clinical improvement is the rate in the control arm and this is applied to the riociguat arm in 
the imputation process.
Additionally , a tipping point analy sis is performed (a detailed definition will be given in the 
SAP) .
A multiplicity  correction is not necessary  for the primary  endpoint because only  one primary  
endpoint is defined. Secondary  endpoints are tested hierarchical ly.An alpha level of 5% is 
used for secondary  endpoints (each) as well as for exploratory  endpoint s.
The null hy pothes is tested for the secondary  efficacy  endpoints is that there is no difference 
when treated with riociguat compared to patients who remain on their previous therapy . The 
two-sided alternative is that there is a difference, respectivel y(details are given in the SAP) .
Primary efficacy endpoint -amended 10.3.2.1
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.30 .
The primary  efficacy  endpoint ‘satisfactory  clinical response ’ is defined as the composite 
endpoint comprising the following components (independent central adjudication) :
2 of 3 must be fulfilled
6MWD increase b y ≥10% or ≥30m from baseline to Week 24
WHO FCI or II at Week 24
NT-proBNP reduction ≥30% from baseline to Week 24(NT-proBNP ratio 
Week 24/baseline ≤0.7), AND
No clinical worsening (for definition ,see below)
‘Satisfactory  clinical response ’ is defined as ‘YES ’only if the 2 major composites (‘2 of3’ 
and ‘No clinical worsening’) are both ’YES ’. The component ‘2 of3’ is ‘YES ’if at least 2 of 
its3 sub -components are ‘YES ’. In all other cases ‘ satisfactory  clinical response ’ is defined as 
‘NO’.The biomarker is given the same importance as the clinical parameters to introduce 
more objectivity  to the endpoint and reduce possible open -label bias.

10.3.3 Safety endpoints
Adverse events
The safet y analysis will be performed in the population of patients valid for FAS. All 
tabulations will be descriptive only .
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated overall. AEs are considered to be 
treatment -emergent if they  have started or worsened after the first treatment administration up 
to 2 day s after end of tr eatment. Further tables will be produced for serious and/or 
drug-related treatment -emergent AEs. The incidence of AEs during pre -treatment and during 
follow -up (i.e., AEs occurring more than 2 day s after the end of treatment) will be tabulated 
separately .
Other safety parameters
Mortality  in the study  will be summarized descriptively . Any deaths in the study  period will 
be listed, with day  of death relative to start and stop of study  drug and cause of death.
The safet y evaluation of laboratory  data will include:
Incidence rates of treatment -emergent laboratory  values outside of normal range
Incidence rates of pre -specified laboratory  data abnormalities
Descriptive anal ysis of continuous laboratory  parameters, and their changes from 
baseline b y visit .
Desc riptive anal ysis of vital signs, and their changes from baseline, will be performed by  visit .
10.3.4 Subgroups
Subgroup anal yses will be performed for following subgroups:
PAH class as defined in randomization strata
Pre-treatment with combination therap y with ER As and PDE -5i versus 
pre-treatment with PDE -5i monotherapy
Gender 
6MWD at baseline
Pre-treatment with tadalafil or sildenafil .
Subgroup analyses will be applied on primary  and secondary  endpoints. Further details (e.g. ,
thresholds) will be defined in the SAP.

Determination of sample size 10.4
Sample size is determined based on results of Studies 12934/12935/16719 ( PATENT -1/2, 
RESPI TE) for riociguat. The estimate for the ‘satisfactory  clinical response’ rate at Week 24 
is 40% for the riociguat arm. Assuming a treatment effect of 50% (relative reduction, see next 
subsections) to the active control the estimate for a ‘satisfactory  clinical response’ in the active 
control arm is 20%. The sample size of 218 patients is calculated using SAS Version 9.2(proc 
power, two -sample -frequency , χ2-test, two -sided alpha = 5%, power = 90%). 
Thescreening failure rate is estimated at 15% and therefore a screening number of 
257patients is required. As it is planned to use LOCF for the primary  analy sis, no adjustment 
for dropouts is needed.
Estimate riociguat arm
The estimate for the ‘ satisfactory  clinical response ’ rate at Week 24 is 40% for the riociguat 
arm. 
Table 10–1presents the patient level anal yses of Bay er’s PATENT -1/2 and RESPI TE studies 
for Week 24. A satisfactory  clinical outcome of 48.1% was observed on 231 patients of the 
individual titra tion ar m. For the subset of pre treated patients with WHO FCIII at baseline ,the 
satisfactory  clinical outcome was 41.6%. The latter subset wasthe closest PATENT -1/2 
subset to REPLACE. The RESPI TE data, closest set to RE PLACE , are in the same range with 
a focus in NT -proBNP ;however ,the number of patients is low. Given the fact that a slightly  
lower net effect due to the more effective treatment than in PATENT -1/2 is expected and a 
lower NT-proBNP reduction due to another baseline definition in RESPI TEis expect ed, an 
assumption of 40% satisfactory  clinical response is reasonable.

Estimate active control arm
For the active control arm, no reliable patient -level data for Week 24 exist, but endpoint -
related anal yses for Week 12 are available based on PATENT -1(Table 10–2). The 
satisfactory  clinical response rates for the placebo patients in Week 12 are 8.3% for the total 
number (109 patients ) and 3.3% ( 30 patients ) for the subgroup, whereas the rates of the 
treatment arm are comparable to the Week 24 results. The pla cebo arm rates of the single 
endpoints are in the range of 15% to 30%.Thus, the low numbers of the satisfactory  clinical 
response are due to a poor association of the single endpoints. Whether thi s low association is 
observed just b y chance or is a systematical feature cannot be judged b y this data solely. From 
a medical point of view a complete missing of association seems to be unrealistic. Therefore ,
a conservative 20% satisfactory  clinical resp onse for the active control arm is assumed , 
postulating a higher association of the sub -endpoints in the REPL ACE study . The high -level 
data given in AMBITION, GRI PHON, SERAPHIN and COMPASS -2 indicate a reasonable 
similarity  to PATENT -1/2 data. The 50% redu ction (100% improvement) assumed in this 
study  (40% to >20%) is at the upper range of the observed effects in these studies, most of 
which anal ysed clinical worsening.

addition to the data specified above:
All information related to the SAE such as: 
The SAE itself
Concomitant medication
Medical history
Other information needed for SAE complementary  page .
Monitoring 11.2
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s/CRO’s procedures, monitors 
will contact the site prior to the start of the study to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethical, and sponsor’s 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include 
identification and documenta tion of source data items.
Thesponsor /designee will monitor the site activity  to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate and complete.
Supporting data may  be requested (example: blood glucose readings to su pport a 
diagnosis of diabetes)
Safety  and rights of patients are being protected
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol 
(including stud y treatment being used in accordance with the protocol)
Any other study  agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory  requirements are 
met.
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
Data processing 11.3
Data will be collected as described in Section 11.1. Clinical data management will be 
performed in accordance with applicable sponsor’s/CRO’s standards and data cleaning 
procedures. This is applicable for data recorded in the e CRF as well as for data from other 
sources ( e.g.,IXRS , laboratory , ECG, adjudication committees).
For data coding (e.g., AEs, medication), internationally  recognized and accepted dictionaries 
will be used.

Miss ing data -amended 11.4
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Section 15.1.2.31 .
Due to the short period of the study , it is expected that the amount of missing data will only  
be minor. Every  effort will be made to collect data until the EOTvisit for all patients unless a 
patient withdraws consent and collection of further information is not allowed.
Audit and inspection 11.5
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory  requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a 
designated CRO’s) quality  assurance unit may  arrange to conduct an audit to assess the 
performance of the study at the study  site and of the study  documents originating there. The 
investigator/instit ution will be informed of the audit outcome.
In addition, inspections by regulatory  health authority  representatives and IECs/I RBs are 
possible. The investigator should notify  the sponsor immediately  of any  such inspection.
The investigator/institution agr ees to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant 
documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to 
discuss findings and an y issues. Audits and inspections may  occur at an y time during or after 
completion of the study .
Archiving 11.6
Essential documents shall be archived safel y and securel y in such a way that ensures that they  
are readil y available upon authorities’ request.
Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with 
the maximum period of time permitted by  the hospital, institution or private practice. Where 
the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required b y the sponsor, 
alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availabi lity of the source documents for 
the required period.
The investigator/institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change 
(e.g., relocation or transfer of ownership).
The investigator site file is not to be destroy ed without the sponsor’s approval.
The contract with the investigator/institution will contain all regulations relevant for the stud y 
center.

12. Premature termination of the study
The sponsor has the right to close this study  (or, if applicable, individual segments thereof 
[e.g., treatment arms; dose steps; centers]) at any  time, which may  be due but not limited to 
the following reasons: 
If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,
Safety  findings from this study  (e.g., SAEs)
Results of parallel clinical studies
Results of parallel animal studies 
(on e.g., toxicity , teratogenicity , carcinogenicit y or reproduction toxicity ).
If the stud y conduct ( e.g., recruitment rate; drop out rate; data qualit y; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the study within a reasonable 
time frame.
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at an y time.
For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consultation between involved parties. Final 
decision on the closure must be in writing.
All affected institutions ( e.g.,IECs/I RBs; competent authority (ies); study  center; 
head of stud y center) must be informed as applicable according to local law.
All study  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) mu st 
be returned to the sponsor. The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification is given b y the sponsor for destruction.
In the event of a partial study  closure, ongoing patients must be taken care of in an 
ethical manner.
Details for individual patient ’s withdrawal can be found in Section 6.3.1 .

will also be carried out in keeping with applicable local law(s) and regulation(s).
Documented approval from appropriate IECs/IRBs will be obtained for all participating 
centers/countries before start of the study , according to GCP, local laws, regulations and 
organizations. When necessary , an extension, amendment or renewal of the I EC/IRB approval 
must be obtained and also forwarded to the sponsor. The responsible unit ( e.g., IEC/I RB, head 
of the study  center/medical institution) must supply  to the sponsor, upon request, a list of the 
IEC/IRB members involved in the vote and a statement to confirm that the I EC/IRB is 
organized and operates according to GCP and applicable laws and regulations.
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of 
study  conduct; the investigator may  not modify  or alte r the procedures described in this 
protocol.
Modifications to the study  protocol will not be implemented by  either the sponsor or the 
investigator without agreement by  both parties. However, the investigator or the sponsor may  
implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
to the patients without prior I EC/IRB/sponsor approval/favorable opinion. As soon as 
possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the 
proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the I EC/IRB/head of medical 
institution/sponsor. Any deviations from the protocol must be explained and documented by  
the investigator.

Each patient will be inform ed about the following aspects of premature withdrawal:
Each patient has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time without any  
disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.
The patient’s consent covers EOT assessments as spe cified in the visit description 
described in Section 9.2.7 to be conducted after withdrawal of consent.
The patient’s data that have been collected until the time of withdrawal will be retained 
and statistically  analy zed in accordance with the SAP. 
Patient -specific data on the basis of material obtained before withdrawal may be generated 
after withdrawal ( e.g., image reading, anal ysis of biological specimen such as blood, urine 
or tissues); these data would also be retained and statistically  anal yzed in accordance with 
the SAP.The patient has the right to object to the generation and processing of this post -
withdrawal data. The patient’s oral objection may  be documented in the patient’s source 
data.
Each patient will have ample time and opportunity  to ask questions.
Only  if the patient voluntarily  agrees to sign the ICFand has done so, may he/she enter the 
study .Additionally , the investigator will personally  sign and date the form. The patient/legal 
representative or prox y consenter will receive a copy  of the signed and dated form.
The signed ICFis to remain in the investigator site file or, if locally  required, in the patient’s 
note/file of the medical institution.
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that screening study  procedures are 
performed, the study  record or patient ’s clinical record must clearl y show that informed 
consent was obtained prior to these procedures. 
If the patient is not capable of providing a signature, a verbal statement of consent can also be 
given in the presence of an impartial witness (independent of the sponsor and the 
investigator). This is to be documented b y a signature from the informing phy sician as well as 
by a signature from the witness.
The ICFand an y other written information provided to the patients will be revised whenever 
important new information becomes available that may  be relevant to the patient’s consent, or 
there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the patient 
information and/or the wri tten ICF.The investigator will inform the patient/legal 
representative or prox y consenter of changes in a timely  manner and will ask the patient to 
confirm his/her participation in the study  by signing the revised informed consent form. Any 
revised writte n informed consent form and written information must receive the IEC/I RB’s 
approval /favorable opinion in advance of use.

15. Protocol amendments
Amendment 4 15.1
Amendment 4is the first global amendment dated 6 JAN 201 7. The following is an overview 
of the changes made to the original Protocol Version 1.0 .
15.1.1 Overview of changes
The original protocol was amended for the following reasons :
1).Administrative changes ( e.g.addition of sponsor for US territory  [Bayer HealthCare 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. ], which is and has been sponsor for US territory  for this study  as set 
forth in FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) form 1571; the reference on the protocol 
was incomplete in this regard )
2).To reiterate that the benefit -risk balance for the population in this study  (i.e. pulmonary  
arterial h ypertension [PAH], Dana Point Group 1) is positive, despite the potential safet y 
issue in Study 13605 in patients with PH -IIP (Dana Point Group 3) which had led to its 
early termination
3).To add the requirement for adequate use of effective contraceptive methods during this 
study
4).To include other   biomarkers (in addition to NT -proBNP )at the request of the advisory  
committee , to further elucidate the value of selected NO -pathway  related biomarkers for 
treatment decision in this controlled study  and in comparison with biomarker results from 
the previous, uncon trolled RESPI TE study
5).To include details for consistency  with the Company  Core Data Sheet (e.g. titration rules) 
andother studies using riociguat (e.g. extending the time for collecting AE information) 
6).To improve clarit y and correct t ypographical errors, inconsistencies and unintended 
omissions.

The RESPI TE study  was conducted to investigate whether it is safe, feasib le, and beneficial to 
replace PDE -5i therapy  with riociguat in PAH patients demonstrating insufficient response to 
PDE -5 inhibition. Interim analy sisdata of this hypothesis -generating single arm study  showed 
thatpatients failing to respond to PDE -5i coul d benefit from replacing a PDE -5i with 
riociguat by  improving 6MWD, WHO FC, and NT -proBNP. The data indicate that transition 
of PDE -5i to riociguat may  serve as a treatment strategy  for PAH patients.
However, a randomized controlled study  is required to confirm the potential clinical benefit of 
transition .

The RESPI TE study  was conducted to investigate whether it is safe, feasible, and beneficial to 
replace PDE -5i therapy  with riociguat in PAH patients demonstrating insufficient response to
PDE -5 inhibition. The final data of this hy pothesis -generating single arm study  showed that
patients failing to respond to PDE -5i could benefit from replacing a PDE -5i with riociguat by  
improving 6MWD, WHO FC, and NT -proBNP. The data indicate that transit ion of PDE -5i to 
riociguat may  serve as a treatment strategy  for PAH patients.
The rationale of the study  is to confirm the potential clinical benefit of switch within the 
NO-sGC-cGMP pathway in a randomized controlled study .
Benefit -risk assessment
[…]
Recently , results of a study  on efficacy  and safet y of riociguat in patients with pulmonary  
hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH -IIP) showed an increased 
risk of mortality  and serious adverse events among patients who received riociguat compared 
to those who received placebo, and an absence of apparent clinical benefit.  The study  was 
terminated early  upon the advice of its data monitoring committee (DMC).  I t was concluded 
that the benefit risk balance of riociguat in patients with PH -IIP is negative.  Riociguat is 
contraindicated in patients with PH -IIP.

The investigators will apply  the following blood pressure (BP) based titration rules for their 
dose decision:
The individual riociguat dose will be titrated under consideration of the following algorithm 
(= individual dose titration scheme):
If trough SBP 95mmHg, increase dose (+ 0.5 mg TID)
If trough SBP 90 to 94 mmHg, maintain dose
If trough SBP < 90mmHg without s ymptoms of hy potension, reduce dose ( -0.5mg

Titration period (Riociguat arm, duration: 8 weeks)
[…]
The investigators will apply  the following blood pressure (BP) based titration rules for their 
dose decision:
Dosage should be increased in 2 -week intervals b y 0.5 mg increments to a 
maxim umof 2.5 mg three times daily, if SBP is ≥95mmHg and the patient has 
nosigns or s ymptoms of hy potension. If SBP falls below 95 mmHg, dosage should be 
maintained provided the patient does not show any  signs or sy mptoms of hy potension. 
If at an y time duri ng the up -titration phase s ystolic blood pressure decreases below 
95mmHg, and the patient shows signs or s ymptoms of hy potension, the current dose 
should be decreased b y 0.5 mgtid.

Premature discontinuation of study  treatment
In case of premature discontinuation of study  treatment, the process detailed in Section 6.3.1.1
should be followed.
Visit 4 / End of Treatment (EOT) (Week 24 ± 4 days)
All patients randomized to either treatment arm should perform Visit 4/ EOT .  This is the last 
visit of the maintenance period, when all relevant efficacy  and safet y measurements will be 
performed.
Safety  Follow -Up(FU) visit (30 day s ± 5 day s after last intake of stud y treatment )
A safet y FU visit is to be performed 30 day s (± 5 day s)after the planned end of study  
treatment OR 30 day s (± 5 day s) after premature discontinuation of study treatment .
Justification of the design
[…]
While it may  appear inappropriate to randomize patients who are not “at treatment goal” to 
the control arm, where their current PAH -specific treatment regimen will just be continued, 
inthe absence of a clear definition of treatment response, the definition for this study  is 
inspired by  the ESC/ ERS table for assessment ( 15) and based on 6MWD and WHO FC only .  
Other parameters of prognostic relevance including pulmonary  hemody namics may  well be in 
the range of low risk/ at treatment goal according to guidelines. It can be assumed that a large 
number of patients on mono -or combination th erapy  with PAH -targeted drugs are in a stable 
clinical situation, but do not reach WHO FC I/II or a 6MWD > 440 m. Clinical stability  at 
randomization will be ensured b y requirements such as stable doses of PAH -therap y and

diuretics, and the mandatory  14-day screening period. By  this, the study  design intends to 
represent the real -life clinical situation of PAH patients, in which close follow -up of 
prognostically  relevant parameters is required for the decision on a next step of treatment 
escalation. As the re will be rater -blinded assessments and central adjudication, but no 
blinding of the stud y treatment arms, the investigator will at any time be able to decide about 
any necessary  treatment escalation. Thus, even treatment of a patient randomized to the 
control or maintenance arm will stringently  follow treatment guidelines.       
End of Study
The end of the stud y as a whole will be reached as soon as the last safet y FU visit of the last 
patient according to the above definition has been reached in all part icipating countries 
(European Union [EU] and non -EU).

Before the first dose of riociguat, BP measurements need to be performed to ensure that SBP 
is ≥95mmHg . If the BP is below this value, riociguat must not be administered (BP 
measurement may be repeated within the next 24 hours). Measurement of BP and

Riociguat dosing start
Based on the time of the last PDE -5i dose, date and time of the first dose of riociguat after the 
wash -out period will be determined by  the investigator and communicated to the patient. 
Before the first dose of riociguat, BP measurements need to be perform ed to ensure that SBP 
is ≥95mmHg. If the BP is below this value, riociguat must not be administered (BP 
measurement may be repeated within the next 24 hours). Measurement of BP and 
application of first riociguat dose may  be performed at the study  center or by  an experienced 
nurse at home (see Section 9.6.3.2 ).

In the riociguat arm , the investigator will decide about the dose adjustment of riociguat based 
on the vital signs and wellbeing of the patient, enter it into theIXRS and retrieve a new dose 
box number (initial dose adjustment period, see Section 7.4).

aRiociguat wash -out, first dose and dose titration : 
Patients in the riociguat arm will have a wash -out period between discontinuation of PDE -5i and the first dose of riociguat : 24-hour 
wash -out following last dose of sildenafil and 48 -hour wash -out following last dose of tadalafil.
Based o n the time of the last PDE -5i dose, date and time of the first dose of riociguat after the wash -out period will be determined by the 
investigator and communicated to the pa tient. Before the first dose of riociguat a blood pressure measurement needs to be p erformed to 
ensure that systolic blood pressure is ≥95mmHg. If the blood pressure is below this value, it can be measured again within 24 hours and if 
still below 95mmHg, riociguat must not be administered. Measurement of blood pressure and application of first riociguat dose may  be 
performed at the study center, or by an experienced nurse in the outpatient setting. Date and time of intake of the first dos e of riociguat need 
to be documented by the investigator. The nurse will contact the center for this purpose via phone.
Patients in the control arm will continue their current specific PAH treatment (PDE -5i +/-ERA).
bHome Visits (H1, H2, H3):
These visits will be conducted by an e xperienced nurse at the patient’ s (both treatment arms) home. At the disc retion of the investigators and 
if applicable (e.g. ,short distance to study center) these visits may  also be performed at the study center.
For the riociguat arm ,these visit sare part of the titration period that will be performed according to the titration scheme (until Week8, Visit2). 
While in the titration period dose increase can only occur at the scheduled visits, a dose decrease ( -0.5mg) can be performed at any time 
based on the patient’s systolic blood pressure and well -being. In both arms blood pressure will be measured; in the riociguat arm the next 
riociguat dose will be decided in phone contact with the center according to the titration scheme.
cVisit 2, W eek8:This is the first regular visit at the center after randomization. For the rioci guat arm it will also be the last visit of the titration 
period. Following the titration period, patients will continue to receive riociguat TID at the optimal dose achieved at Week8 (start of 
maintenance period). 
dPatients will be contac ted via telepho ne ever y 4weeks, if there is no scheduled visit to the study center.
eSafety FUvisitat 30 days (±5days) after last dose of study drug.   Note that although the safety FU visit is depicted above as occurring after 
Visit 4 / EOT, the safety FU visit may  be performed befor e Visit 4 / EOT if a patient prematurely discontinue sstudy  treatment early  in the 
study. If a patient prematurely discontinues study treatment and does not wish to continue with the remaining scheduled visits, an e arly 
termination visit should be agreed upon as soon as possible, and all activities scheduled for Visit 4 / EOT should be performed during this 
visit.
fOnly women of childbearing potential will have a urine or serum test, depending on local routine at each study site. If the test is performed 
>48hours before randomization, the test will need to be repeated.
gFor the riociguat arm IXRS consultation will be performed at ever y visit that involves dispense of study medication (V1, H1, H2, H3, V2 and V3) .
  For the control arm ,IXRS consultation will only be performed by sites which source the comparator centrally at V1, V2 and V3 .
hForms part of the clinical worsening assessment.
iBlinded assessment starts at randomization .
jAn ECG can be done at any time during the study, at the discretion of the investigator. It should be reported in the unschedu led procedure page.

6 Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) Test -amended 16.2
This section was changed in Amendment 4, see Se ction 15.1.2.36 .
The 6MWD test must be performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Societ y
Guideline without assessing Borg -Dyspnoea -Index (17).
To ensure a blinded assessment, it has to be performed by  a second person who is not 
involved in the process of study  drug dispensation or is not aware of the treatment arm . Test 
results should be recorded on a separate work sheet and, where possible, should be entered b y 
a different person into the eCRF. 
According to the guideline, the 6MWD test should be carried out indoors, along a long, flat ,
straight, enclosed corridor with hard surface that is seldom traveled. The walking course
should be preferabl y 30 m in length, but not less than 25 m (longer walking courses should be
shortened to 30 m). The length of the corridor and turnaround points s hould be marked.
Patients will be instructed to walk alone, not run, from one end to the other end of the walking
course, at their own pace, while attempting to cover as much ground as possible in 6 min utes.
During the walk, patients are allowed to stop, l ean against the wall and rest, but should
resume walking as soon as they  feel able to do so.
A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed. The patients should sit at rest in
a chair, located near the starting position, for at least 10 min utesbefore the test starts.
Investigators should not walk with the patients. Moreover, onl y standardized phrases for
encouragement must be used during the test. To allow reproducibility , standardized phrases
should be used every  minute according to the follow ing pattern:
After the first minute, tell the patient the following (in even tones): “You are doing
well. You have 5 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep 
upthe good work. You have 4 minutes to go. ”
When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “You 
aredoing well. You are halfway  done.”
When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep 
upthe good work. You have onl y 2 minutes left.”
When the timer shows only  1 minute remaining, tell the patient: “You are doing 
well. You have onl y 1 minute to go.”
To reduce the variability  of the 6MWD tests, it is of utmost importance that the eligibility test,
the baseline -test and all following tests are performed under the same conditions:
If a supplemental ox ygen therap y was implemented alread y at baseline , all 
subsequent 6MWD tests have to be performed under the same “ baseline ”

conditions (same flow of oxygen, same application route, and same way  of 
carrying the ox ygen bottle).
Even if a supplemental ox ygen therap y is implemented or modified during the 
study (e.g., increase of oxy gen flow), it is not permitted to perform the subsequent 
6MWD tests under conditions other than the baseline conditions.
Patients, who used walking aids alread y at the eligibility -test and the baseline -test 
(e.g., cane, walker), need to use the same walking aids at every  subsequent 6MWD 
test.
For qualit y reasons, the inhalation of supplemental ox ygen and the use of walking a ids during
the 6MWD tests must be documented in the eCRF.
In case a patient has never performed a 6MWD test, a familiarization test should be
performed during the pretreatment phase. To avoid any  interactions, it is not permitted to
perform the familiariza tion test on the same day  as the eligibility  6MWD test.
WHO FC 16.3
The patient’s functional class will be determined by  using the WHO classification (Class I to 
IV)(18):
I: Patients with PH but without resulting limitation of phy sical activit y. Ordinary 
physical activity  does not cause undue dy spnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near 
syncope.
II: Patients with PH resulting in slight limitation of phy sical activit y. The y are 
comfortable at rest. Ordinary  physical activity  causes undue dy spnea or fatigue, 
chest pain, or near s yncope.
III: Patients with PH resulting in marked limitation of phy sical activit y. They are 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary  activity causes undue dy spnea or fatigue, 
chest pain, or near s yncope.
IV: Patients with PH with inability  to carry  out any  physical activity  without 
symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right -heart failure. Dy spnea and/or 
fatigue may  even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by  any physical 
activity .

Living w ith Pulmonary Hypertension questionnaire (LPH [ QoL ]) 16.5
The L PH questionnaire is designed to measure the effects of PH and PH specific treatments 
on an individual’s quality  of life. The LPH is a self -report questionnaire and needs to be 
completed b y the patient (questionnaires will be provided in local language). However, if the 
patient has problems completing the questionnaire, an attempt should be made to explain the 
questions in a neutral and unpersuasive manner.
After the patient has filled in the questionnai re, the questionnaire is transferred to the study  
personnel, who will enter the content into the eCRF.
To measure the effects of sy mptoms, functional limitations, psy chological distress on an 
individual’s quality  of life, the L PH asks patients to indicate using a 6 -point, zero to five, 
Likert scale how much each of 21 facets prevented them from living as they  desired.
LIVING WITH PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
The following questions ask how much your pulmonary  hypertension affected y our life 
during the past 7 day s. After each question, circle the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 to show how much

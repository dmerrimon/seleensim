Title: Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes among Patients Receiving Palbociclib
Combinations for HR+/HER2 -Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer in Real World Settings.
Rationale and background: Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer -related death in females 
worldwide.  Hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2negative (HER2 -) breast cancer is the most commonly  diagnosed subt ype accounting for 
around 73% of all diagnosed breast cancers.  Palbociclib is a first in class CDK4/6 inhibitor 
that has been approved for use in HR+/HER - advanced/metastatic breast cancer (ABC/MBC) 
patients in a number of indications on the basis of efficacy demonstrated in three pivotal 
clinical trials; PAL OMA -1 and PALOMA -2 (initial endocrine -based therapy ) and 
PAL OMA -3 (after progression following endocrine therapy ). As a result of the recent 
approvals there is a need to understand the real world usage and clinical outcomes of patients 
receiving palbociclib in order to inform future treatment decisions. This study  has been 
previously  conducted in the US and Argentina with an additional ‘interim’ chart review 
conducted in German y whereb y no long term clinical outcomes were collected.
Research question and objectives: The primary  objectives of this study  are to describe t he 
patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of 
adult female patients who have received palbociclib combination treatments in line with 
locally licensed indications in real world settings across multiple coun tries.
Study design: This retrospective ph ysician based medical record review will collect data from 
medical records of patients, who have received palbociclib combination in line with locally  
approved indications in 13countries globally (data collection in four countries, US ,
Argentina and “interim” German data in 2018 and Canada and Germany  “core” data in 2019
have alread
y been conducted) . In countries where palbociclib has been on the market for a 
sufficient period of time and therefore sufficient follow-up data are available, a one- time 
review of patient’s medical records will be conducted. The study  composed of two data 
collection phases, a core medical record review and an interim medical record review. The 
core stud y will be conducted across all markets whereb y all variables collected, including 
sections relating to clinical outcomes (progression free rates, survival rates, best response 
etc.). The interim study  will collect all data except the clinical outcomes due to lack of 
follow up time (ie, time since palbociclib approval was not long enough ago in some markets 
for sufficient follow up time to collect clinical outcomes data). The interim study  was 
conducted in German y in 2018 and is not planned fo r additional markets .
Population: Data will be collected from France, Italy, UK, Switzerland, Belgium , Spain, 
Netherlands, Portugal and Japan, with approximately  15-60 oncologists or gy necologists 
recruited per country .  To be eligible to participate phy sicians must have treated or be 
treating a minimum of 
2or more (dependent on country ) HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC patients 
who meet the eligibility  criteria for this study .  Each phy sician will complete between 
3-14electronic case report forms (eCRFs).  Previously , data has been collected in the US

Page 9of 28(65oncologists providing 652 eCRFs), Argentina (41/162), Canada (33/259) and German y 
core (35/251) .  In addition, an interim data collection was completed in Germany  (whereby  
clinical outcomes were not collected due to la ck of follow up data) with 42 physicians 
providing 257 e CRFs.  Including previous data collection in the US, Argentina ,German yand 
Canada , it is expected that approximately  476- 486 phy sicians will be recruited, this will 
enable data to be collected for approximately 3131 patients overall.
Recruited ph ysicians must go back in their records to the specific index date and select the 
next n number of eligible patient records from patients who have been treated with a 
palbocicib combination .  The ‘index date’ will be defined as 60 days after the phy
sician first 
prescribed palbociclib + partner therap y following the availability of specific indication in 
the market.  To be eligible, patients must be female, aged 18 or over, have been diagnosed 
with HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC and must have received palbociclib combination in line with 
locally  approved indications.  For the core study , patients must have initiated palbociclib 
with fulvestrant a minimum of three months, or palbociclib with letrozole/aromatase inhibitor 
a minimum of six months prior to data collection.
Variables: The variables assessed in this study  will be patient demographics at the time of 
data collection, clinical characteristics, comorbid conditions, earl y and advanced breast 
cancer treatment history , palbociclib treatment patterns including dose changes, clinical 
outcomes (core medical record review onl y) andtime since deceased (no. of day s)if 
applicable.
Data sources: Patient medical records will be used as the data source.
Study size: For the core st udy up to approximately 476-486 physicians will be recruited, this 
will enable data to be collected for approximately  3131 patients.  Approximately  
30- 40 physicians will be recruited collecting 240-250 eCRFs each in I taly, France , Spain,
and the UK.  For Belgium and Netherlands , 15physicians will be recruited collecting 
150and60 eCRFs per country respectivel y.  Approximately  20 phy sicians will be recruited 
in Switzerland collecting 100 eCRFs and 50 ph ysicians recruited in Japan to comp lete 
approximate ly 150 eCRFs .Approximately  20 physicians will be recruited in Portugal 
collecting 100 eCRFs. For the US study  652 eCRFs were collected from 65 physicians, 
whilst in Argentina 162 eCRFs were collected from 41 physicians. For the German i nterim 
review 42 ph ysicians were recruited with 257 eCRFs completed and for the German core 
study  35 phy sicias were recruited completing 251 eCRFs. In Canada, 33 phy sicians 
comp
leted 259 eCRFs.
Data analysis: All analy ses will be descriptive in nature. Categorical variables will be 
described using the number of observations, number and percent (%) in each category , and 
number of missing observations . Numeric variables will be described using the number of 
observations, mean and standard deviation, and minimum, maximum, median ,interquartile 
range , and number of missing observations . Time to event will be described using a 
Kaplan -Meier chart or the median.

Page 12of 286.RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Breast cancer is the most common diagnosed cancer and the most common cause of 
cancer -related death in females worldwide.  There were 1.67 million new cases of breast 
cancer diagnosed globally in 2012, which equated to 12% of all diagnosed cancers. Out of 
these new cases 522,000 females died of the disease, which represented 15% of female 
deaths from cancer in 2012 .1There is a huge worldwide variation in breast cancer survival 
rates, ranging from 80% or more in North America, Sweden and Japan to 60% in 
middle -income countries and as low as 40% in low -income countries .2Breast cancer 
survival rates have increased over the last 50 years, as relative survival increased from 
75.2% in 1975 to 90.6% in 2008.3The 5 y ear survival rate for females with stage 0/ I breast 
cancer is near to 100%, compared to that of Stage II and III, which are 93% and 72% 
respectivel y. Females who are diagnosed with metastatic or sta ge IV breast cancer have a 
much lower 5 year survival rate of 22%.4
An increased understanding of breast cancer has enabled enhanced profiling of diff erent 
disease subt ypes. Subty pe classification is essential in order to decide on the appropriate 
treatment regime. Breast tumors are grouped according to the expression of hormone 
receptors (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Over all HR status is 
the most important biomarker for breast cancer classification, as around 75% of all breast 
cancer tumors are HR positive (HR+). Tumors that are HR+ grow in response to increased 
levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. HR+ breas t tumors are the most 
favorable, as they  respond well to hormone therapies. In contrast HR -breast tumors do not 
respond well to hormone therapies. These tumors are known to be the most aggressive 
cancers, in regards to tumor size, grade, stage and patient outcome. HER2 positive (HER2+) 
breast tumors represent around 15% of all breast tumors. These tumors tend to be more 
aggressive and faster growing than HER2 negative (HER2- ) tumors. HR+/HER2 -breast 
cancer is the mo st common subty pe diagnosed in the US. This subty pe accounted for around 
73% of diagnosed breast cancer cases in 2010. Around 15- 20% of breast tumors do not 
contain HR or HER2; these are known as triple negative breast cancers .5
Over the past few decades, hormonal therapies such as letrozole and fulvestrant have 
emerged as the preferred treatment for HR+ breast cancers. Following the success of the 
Phase II PALOMA - 1 trial, the FDA granted accelerated approval of the CDK4/CDK6 
inhibitor palbociclib that causes cell cy cle arrest to be used in combination with letrozole to 
treat advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2 -post-menopausal breast cancer. The PALOMA -1 trial 
demonstrated median progression -free survival of 20.2 months for post -menopausal patients 
with advanced/metastatic HR+/HER- breast cancer receiving letrozole in combination with 
palbociclib vs. 10.2 months in patients receiving letrozole and placebo .6The follow up 
Phase III PALOMA -2 trial demonstrated median progression free survival of 24.8 months for 
post-menopausal patients with advanced/metasta tic HR+/HER -breast cancer receiving 
letrozole in combination with palbociclib vs. 14.5 months in patients receiving letrozole and 
placebo.7The label has since been expanded to include an y aromatase inhibitor in this 
indication .8

Palbociclib
A5481 090NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Final, 25 November 2019
 
 
Pfizer Confidential
Page 13of 28In October 2016, palbociclib was granted approval to be used in combination with 
fulvestrant. This was following the success of the P hase III PALOMA -3 trial, conducted in 
patients with advanced/metastatic HR+/HER - breast cancer that had relapsed or progressed 
during endocrine therap y. The PALOMA -3 trial demonstrated a median progression- free 
survival of 10.8 months in those receiving fulvestrant in co mbination with palbociclib 
vs.4.8months in patients receiving fulvestrant with placebo .8
As a result of the recent approval of palbociclib, there is scarce information regarding how 
and when palbociclib combination is prescribed in routine clinical practice, and the outcomes 
associated with palbociclib use. Therefore, real world data on the characteristics, treatment 
patterns and clinical outcomes amo ng patients receiving palbociclib combinations to treat 
HR+/HER - advanced/metastactic breast cancer (ABC/MBC) will provide valuable insight to 
help inform treatment decisions.
7.RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
The primary  objective of this real world study  is to describe patient demographics, clinical 
characteristics, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of adult female patients who have 
received palbociclib combination treatments in line with locally licensed indications in real 
world settings across multiple countries:
Canada/Argentina:
Palbociclib in combination with letrozole as earl yendocrine therapy to treat
advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2- post-menopausal breast cancer (CAN: May 2016,
ARG: December 2015).
Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of females with
HR+/HER2
-ABC/MBC with disease progression following endocrine therapy
(CAN: May 2017, ARG: August 2016). In pre -or perimenopausal females, the 
endocrine therap y should be combined with a luteinizing hormone -
releasing hormone 
(LHRH) agonist.
Across the EU , Switzerland , US 
andJapan:
Palbociclib in combination with aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine based therap y 
for the treatment of females with HR+/HER2- locally  ABC/MBC (EMA: November 
2016, Switz: October 2017, US: Feb 2015, updated Mar 2017) .
Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of females with 
HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC who have received prior endocrine therap y 
(EMA: November 2016 Switz: March 2017 ).In pre-or perimenopausal females, the 
endo crine therap y should be combined with a luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone 
(LHRH) agonist.

8.1.Study Design
This study  will be conducted as a retrospective physician based medical record review of 
patients who have received palbociclib combination in line with locally  approved indications.
In some countries data may  be collected from patients receiving palbocic lib combinations 
before the local reimbursement date, however patients must still be receiving palbociclib 
combinations in line with the approved indication. The study  will comprise of a medical 
record review conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Italy, UK, France, Germany, 
Belgium, Switzerland
, Spain , Netherlands, Portugal and Japan . The study design is 
outlined in Figure 1. The study  has been previously  conducted in the US ,Argentina , Canada
with an additional ‘interim’ record review conducted in German y (with a minimum of 
3month follow up) whereby  no long term clinical outcomes were collected. The core 
German stud y is now completed with clini cal outcome data. 
Data collection will be online via electronic data capture using electronic case report form 
(eCRF).  Eligible ph ysicians will be invited to complete an eCRF for up to between 
3-14 patients that meet the study  criteria.  Each eCRF will take a minimum of 25minutes to 
complete.  Patient eligibility  will be confirmed by  treating ph ysicians.  In order to allow for a 
sufficiently long observational window, tr eating phy sicians will be asked to go back to a 
specific point in time, the index date, and sequentially  select the medical records of the next 
‘n’ patients who meet the inclusion criteria.  The ‘index date’ will be defined as 60 days after 
the phy sician f irst prescribed palbociclib + partner therapy  following the availability  of 
specific indication in the market (eg, If palbociclib + letrozole was available Feb 1, 2015 in 
the US and the ph ysician initiated a patient on palbociclib+ letrozole the next day , the index 
date will be April 2, 2015).  The index date will differ for the specific 
indications/combination partners if approved on different dates.
Study  materials (ie, the CRF) will be subject to pilot testing with phy sicians followed by  
interviews to di scuss the length, feasibility , ease of understanding and use, and the relevance 
to the objectives.
The advantage to a retrospective medical record review approach over a database anal ysis is 
that of being designed specificall y to collect data that fulfils the study  objectives.  Thus, it 
readil y collects and informs on all key drug related clinical outcome measures of critical 
importance to this study , in a consistent manner, across countries.  The resulting data set 
enables direct comparisons across markets
, delivering in turn greater confidence in the 
reliability  of conclusions drawn from the research.  An additional advantage of this approach 
lies in the ability  to obtain information that only  the treating phy sician may  be aware of, such 
as the reasons for treatment switches or discontinuations or more perceptive questions that 
rely on the phy sicians professional opinion.

Page 16of 288.1.1. Core Medical Record Review
The core medical record review will capture data from approximately  3131 patients on 
demographics, clinical characteristics, disease history , treatment history , palbociclib dosing, 
clinical outcomes and post
-palbociclib combination therap y treatment data.  The study will 
be descriptive in nature therefore no control or compara tor groups will be included.
The core medical record review has alread y been conducted in the US and Argentina in 2017
and for Germany (core) and Canada in Q3 2019 .  Palbociclib has only  been recentl y 
approved for use in the EU, t herefore, additional Europ ean data collection in Belgium, Italy 
and the UK for the core medical record review will commence in Q4 2019 and for Spain, 
Netherlands, Portugal and France in Q1 2020 . Similarly , data collection for Switzerland and 
Japan will commence Q4 2019, depend ingon the date of approval of palbociclib in each 
individual country .In some countries data may  be collected from patients receiving 
palbociclib combinations before the local reimbursement date, however patients must still be 
receiving palbociclib combinations in line with the approved indication. In France patients 
must have initiated palbociclib combinations post- 01 Jan 2018 to avoid capturing an y patient 
data for those receiving palbociclib combinations via an early access program. 
8.1.2. German Interim Medic al Record Review
A German interim medical record review was conducted in German y in October 2017 .  This 
interim medical record review allowed for the collection of a number of baseline 
characteristics data.  This study  had the same methodology  as the core study and an almost 
identical eCRF, capturing demographics, clinical characteristics, disease history , treatment 
history  and palbociclib dosing for patients receiving palbociclib combination treatment in 
line with the approved indications.  However, approp riate sections from the CRF relating to 
clinical outcomes associated with palbociclib combination were omitted from the interim 
eCRF (ie, ORR, CRF, progression free rates and survival rates).  A further full core medical 
review will be conducted in German yin April 2019 in line with the methodology  outline in
Section 8.1.1.

15-60 physicians (oncologists/ gynecologists )1recruited per country . Each phy sician will 
complete between 3 -14eCRFs (country  and sample size dependent) .Data will be coll ected 
retrospectivel y at a single point in time from patient medical records.
Initial screening questions/recruitment criteria will ensure the relevant ph ysicians are selected 
and all other non -qualify ing phy sicians will be excluded. In addition during ph ysician 
recruitment a representative geographical split and private/public practice split will be sought 
where possible to ensure a representative sample.

Page 18of 28To be eligible, ph ysicians must have treated or be treating two or more
HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC patients who meet the eligibility  criteria for the study . This will 
ensure that recruited ph ysicians will be able to complete the minimum number of eCRFs 
required to participate in the study . Physicians are recruited by  local fieldwork agencies in 
each market. The recruitment process occurs either via custom lists or a panel approach via 
telephone or email. In keeping with compliance, phy sicians must have previously  stated 
their willingness to be contacted to participate in such research. Once ph ysicians have been 
recruited, they  must go back to a specific index date, define din 8.1, and select the next n 
number of eligible patient records from patients who have been treated with a palbociclib 
combination. 
The consecutive approach to recruitment will be stressed to each participating 
physician to limit selection bias. Physicians will confirm patient eligibility .
Patient records must meet the following criteria to be eligible for the medical record reviews.
They  must be female, aged 18 or older and they  must have been diagnosed with 
HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC. Patients must have received palbociclib combination in line with 
country /locally  approved indications. For the core record review, palbociclib and 
letrozole/aromatase inhibitor must have been initiated a minimum of 6 months prior to date 
of medical record review, and palbociclib and fulvestrant must have been initiated a 
minimum of 3 months prior to date of m edical record review. This will permit the capture of 
meaningful clinical outcomes data. For the German interim record review, palbociclib was 
required to have been initiated a minimum of 3 months prior to data collection regardless of 
partner therap y.
Afull list of the eligibility  criteria can be found in 8.2.1.
In order to ensure that sufficient data is captured for each indication, indication quotas will be 
enforced. This will be determined on a country  by country  basis.

The sample size above should be considered flexible, with scope to increase the sample size 
if feasible.  This will be assessed on a country  by country  basis.
The objectives do not state any hypotheses and therefore, do not require any statistical 
testing.  All the anal yses will be descriptive and so sample size calculations are not required.
8.6.Data Management
Physician reported data from the eCRF will be transferred to a single electronic database.  All 
data will be de -identified and anony mized.  I ncomplete data may  be excluded from analy sis 
following discussion with Pfizer.
De-identified raw data files will be transferred to Pfizer by  a secure file transfer protocol 
(FTP)site.

Page 22of 288.7.Data Analysis
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of data collected in this stu dy will 
be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP), which will be dated, filed and 
maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; any  
major modifications of primary  endpoint definitions or their anal yses would be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
All analy ses are to be descriptive and so all methods to be used will reflect this descriptive 
nature. The specific method that will be used depends on ty pe of variable being anal ysed and 
those methods are:
Categorical variables – will be described using:
Number of observations (n);
Number and percent (%) within each category ;
Number of missing observations .
Numeric variables –will be described using:
Number of observations (n) ;
Mean andStandard deviation ;
Minimum, Max imum, Median and 1stand3rdQuartiles
;
Number of missing observations.
Time to event –willbe described using:
A Kaplan -Meier chart that will visually  estimate the distribution of times to some 
events, eg ,progression, and will take into account those pa tients for which the 
event has not as yet occurred ;
1-yr and 2 -yr rates, median or some more appropriate percentiles if the median 
time is not reached in the sample.
The anal yses will be conducted (using the methods above) in a number of phases, as already
detailed in the study  design section.

3.EU countries - all variables will be described .
Missing data will be excluded on a case by case basis and will not be imputed. This will 
mean that each table will not necessaril y be based on the same number of patients.
Subgroup Analysis
Exploratory  stratifications will be conducted to explore differences between line of therapy , 
demographics, treatments, clinical characteristics, baseline co -morbidities or ‘responders’ 
and ‘non- responders’ to treatment, however these wil l be only  descriptive in nature. 
Responders and non -responders will be defined according to the best recorded response to 
palbociclib treatment.
Sample size permitting, additional stratifications may  include:
Insurance ty pe.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) Performance status.
Age.
Menopausal status.
Denovo vs. recurrent disease.
Bone only disease.
Visceral vs. non- visceral metastases.
Byprimary site, eg,liver, lung .
Burden ofmetastases (eg,visceral involvement, multiple liver lesions, bilateral vs 
single lung involvement, presence of pleural effusion) .
Duration ofdisease free interval (DFI) .
Specific comorbidities .
Comorbidity index .
Prior endocrine treatment .

8.8.Quality Control
To maximize data quality  the following will be undertaken:
Provision of standardized instructions on study  design, methodology  and procedures:
Physicians will be contacted via email or telephone andanoverview of the study
will be provided (detailing study objectives, patient inclusion criteria, correct
completion of eCRF andinterview andanyother logistical aspects ofthe study );
Follow -up with the phy sicians to ensure queries are resolved quickl y.
The electronic materials will be tested thoroughl y to ensure that all questions appear 
correctly  on screen, allow eas y interpretation/completion and that all routing and 
logic checks are working correctly
. As such, there should be no missing data (given 
the online nature of the study , the ph ysician will have to complete a question before 
he/she is able to move on the next) however, ‘don’t know or unknown’ will be valid 
responses.
There will be no monitoring visits or source data verification in this study .
8.9.Limitations ofthe Research Methods
A key  limitation of a study  of this nature is the reliance on accurate, complete eCRFs; which 
is dependent on the correct completion of the study materials and the availability  of a 
detailed, complete patient records. We have outlined a number of importan t quality  control 
steps to be taken as part of the study procedures to minimize the impact of this. Notably , to 
reduce the administrative burden on all ph ysicians, the materials will be as short and 
user-friendly  as possible.
The representativeness of the sample is limited to the consulting population for participation, 
who has been previousl y prescribed palbociclib combination in line with locally  approved 
indications. We will not collect data from patients from non- participating phy sicians, thus 
introducing a potential selection bias. To minimize this multiple phy sicians will be recruited 
in each country  from a diverse geographical spread and mixed private/public practice where 
possible. To eliminate any  patient identification bias during data collecti on a sy stematic 
patient selection criteria will be included and stressed to each participating phy sician. This 
will be further defined in the eCRFs, but will take into account the date of palbociclib 
approval for each indication. Patients who received palbociclib prior to approval or off -label 
are not represented in this study .
Due to the observational design of the study , treatments received by  patients may  be subject 
to a channeling bias and thus must be interpreted with caution.

9.PROTECTION OFHUMAN SUBJECTS
9.1.Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws.  In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of 
confidentiality  and protection of patient personal data.
This study  will involve secondary  data collection which will include human review of 
unstructured data. No protected h ealth information (PHI) will be collected and all data will 
be de -identified. The research poses a minimal risk to patients, will not affect the rights or 
welfare of the patient and the study  would not be feasible should informed consent be 
required. As a result, informed consent will not be sought for this study .
9.2.Patient Withdrawal
Not applicable .
9.3.Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
The study  will be submitted to a centralized independent I RB board in Europe for 
methodolog ical review. In addition, a Western IRB exemption will be sought on the basis 
that the study  will collect only  secondary  data, no protected health information (PHI) will be 
collected and all data will be de- identified.
9.4.Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generall y accepted research practices 
described in Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology  Practices (GPP) issued by  the 
International Societ y for Pharmacoepidemiology  (ISPE)
(https://www.pharmacoepi.org/resources/guidelines_08027.cfm )
.Compliant with the 
regulatory  details outlines in the external guidance document CT24- WI_GL02 -RF04 1.0.
10.MANAGEMENT AND REPOR TING OF ADVE RSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS REQUIREMENTS
This study  protocol requires human review of patient- level unstructured data; unstructured 
data refer to verbatim medical data, including text- based descriptions and visual depictions of 
medical information, such as medical records, images of ph ysician notes, neurological scans, 
X-rays, or narrative fields in a database.  The reviewer is obligated to report adverse events 
(AEs) with explicit attribution to any  Pfizer drug that appear in the reviewed information 
(defined per the patient population and study  period specified in the protocol).  Explicit 

Palbociclib
A5481 090NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Final, 25 November 2019
 
 
Pfizer Confidential
Page 26of 28attribution is not inferred by  a temporal relationship between drug administration and an AE,
but must be based on a definite statement of causality  by a healthcare provider linking drug 
administration to the AE.
The requirements for reporting safet y events on the non -interventional study  (NIS) adverse 
event monitoring (AEM) Report Form to Pfizer Safet y are as follows:
All serious and non- serious AEs with explicit attrib ution to any Pfizer drug that 
appear in the reviewed information must be recorded on the eCRF and reported, 
within 24 hours of awareness, to Pfizer Safety  using the NI S AEM Report Form.
Scenarios involving drug exposure, including exposure during pregnancy , exposure 
during breast feeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, extravasation, lack of 
efficacy , and occupational exposure associated with the use of a Pfizer product must 
be reported, within 24 hours of awareness, to Pfizer Safet y using the NI S AEM 
Report Form.
Forthese AEs with an explicit attribution or scenarios involving exposure to a Pfizer product, 
the safet y information identified in the unstructured data reviewed is captured in the Event 
Narrative section of the report form, and constitutes all clinical information known regarding 
these AEs.  No follow -up on related AEs will be conducted.
All the demographic fields on the NI S AEM Report Form may  not necessarily  be completed, 
as the form designates, since not all elements will be available due to privacy  concerns with 
the use of secondary  data sources.  While not all demographic fields will be completed, at the 
very least, at least one patient identifier (eg, gender, age as captured in the narrative field of 
the form) will be reported on the NI S AEM Report Form, thus allowing the report to be 
considered a valid one in accordance with pharmacovigilance legislation.  All identifiers will 
be limited to generalities, such as the statement “A 35- year-old female...” or “An elderl y 
male...”  Other iden tifiers will have been removed. 
Additionally , the onset/start dates and stop dates for “Illness”, “Study  Drug”, and “Drug 
Name” may  be documented in month/y ear (mmm/yyyy ) format rather than identify ing the 
actual date of occurrence within the month /y ear of occurrence in the day /month /year 
(DD/MMM/YYYY) format.
All research staff members must complete the following Pfizer training requirements:   
“YRR Training for Vendors W orking on Pfizer Studies (excluding interventional 
clinical studies and non- interventional primary data collection studies with 
sites/investigators) ”. 

Palbociclib
A5481 090NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Final, 25 November 2019
 
 
Pfizer Confidential
Page 27of 28These trainings must be completed by  research staff members prior to the start of data 
collection.  All trainings include a “Confirmation of Training Certificate” (for signature b y 
the trainee) as a record of completion of the training, which must be kept in a retrievable 
format.  Copies of all signed training certificates must be prov ided to Pfizer. 
Re-training must be completed on an annual basis using the most current Your Reporting 
Responsibilities training materials .
11.PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
A global report will be provided on completion of the entire stud y with additional country 
specific reports provided in PowerPoint format as and when data collection is included in 
each market.  These reports will incorporate methodology, sample , tables of results and 
summaries. All documents used throughout the study  will be contained within the report as 
appendices.
In addition to the two study  reports, the following slide decks will be produced.
Country  specific slide decks on completion of each market.
Final reports and publications per market requirement.
Aglobal slide deck when theentire study is completed.
Additional country  specific slide decks will be developed as needed. Results of this study  
may be submitted to conferences and journals for publication. As per Pfizer’s requirements, 
the project w ill only  be considered complete upon delivery  of the full study report and close 
of all study  publications.
Communication of Issues
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of a Pfizer 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately  of any urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study patients against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this NI  study  protocol that the investigator becomes aware of.

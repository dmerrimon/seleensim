2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 36 
 Session  A. The µ-Cor device and ZOE monitor will be applied during 
Session A.  
2. Patients will be randomly allocated to Study Arm  1 or Study Arm 2 , with 
randomization stratified by CHF status (CHF or non -CHF) . A 
randomization schedule will be provided to the clinical sites.  
3. Weight, blood pressure, and heart rate will be recorded before the 
dialysis session.  
4. During the  hemodialysis session , the patient will wear 1 µ -Cor device  
and will be connected simultaneously to 1 ZOE monitor  (via 2 ZOE 
electrodes)  for comparative measurements and UFV  correlation, from at 
least 15 minutes before the start of dialysis to at least  15 minutes after 
the end of the dialysis session.  
5. The thoracic area of the patient will be cleaned and  treated per  the 
protocol procedures . The µ -Cor will b e placed  in accordance with 
instructions provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
6. The ZOE electrodes will be placed according to the manufacturer's 
instructions for use (IFU) . 
7. The µ-Cor will record measurements during  the dialysis session, 
including at least  the 15  minutes before and 15 minutes after the session.  
8. ZOE ( Z0) values will be measured every 6 minutes  (± 1 minute ) during 
the dial ysis session . ZOE ( Z0) values also will be  measured  every 
3 minutes  (± 1 minute)  before and after the session , for a minimum of 
5 measurements .  
9. The UFV  during the course of hemodialysis will be measured by 
automated readings provided by the dialysis machine  every 6 minutes  
(± 1 minut e). 
10. Any IV infusions administered during the course of hemodialysis will be 
recorded.  
11. Any oral fluid  or solid  intake during the hemodialysis session  will be 
recorded .

rate will be recorded.  
15. Adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment t hrough the 
end of the Session  A. 
16. The patient’s involvement in the study ends after the completion of all 
procedures planned for Session  A. Study duration for each patient is 
expected to  last 1 day : a patient will undergo  1 session of hemodialysis 
in the clinic.  
Estimated 
Enrollment Period : Up to 4 months  
Study Duration for 
Each Subject : One (1) day  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 36 
 Proposed Study 
Duration:  Approximately 6 months  
Endpoints : The p rimary  endpoint is a c omparison of correlation s of thoracic impedance  
made with the -Cor System  and UFV , with those of the ZOE  and UFV . The 
non-inferiority assessment will be between each location (side and front)  of 
the -Cor System/UFV correlation to the  ZOE/UFV correlation . 
The secondary endpoints are:  
 Comparison of correlations of thoracic impedance made with the 
-Cor System and UFV, to those of the ZOE and UFV using all 
values from the -Cor System, regardless of location  
 Comparison of the precision of the ZOE and the -Cor System  
Statistical Methods : Since previous published studies have reported that bio impedance  
measurements have been more reliably used before  and after  the dialysis  
treatment ( 5) (6) (7), data from these time points  will be compared separately 
from data collected during dialysis.  In general, summaries will be provided 
for all study patients and by study arm. 
Correlation between -Cor and UFV changes during the dialysis session will 
be summarized using average Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Correlation 
between ZOE and UFV changes will be summarized in the same manner. 
The non -inferiority assessment will be between each location (side and front) 
of the µ -Cor S ystem/UFV corre lation to the  ZOE/UFV correlation.  The 
µ-Cor System will be considered as substantially equivalent with respect to 
clinical performance of the ZOE monitor  if the correlation between the 
µ-Cor thoracic impedance measurements and UFV (r_ µ -Cor) is non -inferior 
to the correlation between ZOE bioimpedance  measurements and UFV 
(r_ ZOE). Non -inferior is defined as r_ µ -Cor within the range [(r_ ZOE - 
0.05), 0.9999].  
The precision of each device will be compared using a Mann Whitney test.

 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
A significant number of patients suffering from pathologies related to fluid management  have 
frequent recurrence of acute epi sodes. Among these patients are those with congestive heart 
failure (CHF). Lung congestion is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission among 
patients with CHF ( 1). To date , there is no effective method for direct measurement and 
monitoring of l ung congestion, making physicians rely on non -specific, patient -dependent 
measurements such as a patient’s weight and blood pressure. A tool that provide s direct and 
accurate measurement of thoracic impedance  has the potential to shorten the hospitalization 
period by enabling effective drug balance; it also may provide early edema detection in order to 
prevent hospital readmission.  
Similarly, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis a lso require 
fluid management strategies. It has been documented that patients diagnosed with CKD 
undergoing maintenance hemodialysis have a high prevalence of heart failure (HF) and poor 
prognosis ( 2) (3). Congestive heart failure is a frequent clinical ma nifestation in patients 
undergoing dialysis (4). 
For these reason s, body fluid assessment is important for managing CKD and HF. Bioimpedance 
technology has remained underutilized due to the lack of noninvasive, ambulatory measurement 
devices. In this study , we will evaluate the performance of the µ-Cor System, a noninvasive, 
wearable monitoring system for accurately assessing thoracic impedance by monitoring fluid 
changes during hemodialysis.  
Fluid changes evaluated with the  µ-Cor will be compared with tho se of an FDA -cleared fluid 
measurement device, the ZOE® Fluid Status Monitor ( Noninvasive  Medical Technologies)  to 
establish significant equivalence . Qualified healthcare practitioners currently use the ZOE  for 
monitoring patients who are living with fluid  management problems, taking diuretic medication, 
living with heart failure, living with end stage renal disease , or suffering from recurrent 
dehydration.  
During a typical  hemodialysis session, approximately 2  to 4 L of fluid are removed. Using the 
common variable of fluid removed during a hemodialysis session will aid investigators in 
assessing the efficacy of the µ -Cor ability to detect fluid, as well as correlation to measurements 
taken with an FDA -cleared fluid m easurement device.  
2 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The µ -Cor noninvasively monitors a patient’s clinical parameters ( thoracic impedance , ECG, 
heart rate, respiration rate, activity, and posture). Measurements are acquired via a patient -worn 
device and the raw data are  transmitted wirelessly to a remote server with dedicated software to 
process the raw data. The µ -Cor is designed for use in outpatient clinics and home settings.  
2.1 Device Components  
The components of the µ -Cor can be found in Table  2.

Components and Description  Illustration  
Patch  – A single -use, disposable , adhesive piece adhered to the 
patient’s body that allows for Cartridge attachment.  The Patch is 
made of non -woven fabric with adhesive on one side, a 
polypropylene frame for housing the Cartridge (see below), 2 ECG 
electrodes covered with hydrogel on one end and a connection wire 
on the other end, and 2 polypropylene ECG covers.  
  
 
Cartridge  – A patient -worn device for signal acquisition.  
 
Charger – The Charger charges the Cartridge (re -charging is 
needed typically after 5 days of wear) and houses the gateway that 
wirelessly transmits the data to the server.  
 
Server – The server refers to the hardware and the processing 
software and resides in a cyber -secure location. The software 
analyzes the raw data received from the Cartridge and processes the 
data into clinical values for eventual presentation to the end -users 
(such as physicians and caregivers ).

5 STUDY PROCEDURE  
The following sections outli ne the details of the clinical investigation procedures.  
5.1 Informed Consent  
To protect the rights and welfare of subjects, this clinical investigation will be conducted  in 
conformance to ICH -GCP . 
Prior to admission to the clinical investigation, an informed  consent document will be given to 
each prospective patient , including an explanation of the clinical investigation, duration, 
expected benefits and risks, explanation of alternatives, medical record access, and patient  
anonymity, and if data are to be use d for publications or submission for reimbursement support. 
The informed consent form (ICF) will contain language that is non -technical and is 
understandable to the patient . The Investigator must inform patients  that they are in a clinical 
study, inform th em of their rights as set forth in the informed consent document, and provide 
written documentation that such a discussion took place. A patient  will be provided ample time 
and opportunity to inquire a bout the details of the study and decide whether  to par ticipate. A 
consent document will be provided that contains non -technical language that is understood by 
the patient .  Informed consent shall be documented by a patient ’s dated signature on the consent 
form. The original, signed document will be kept with the patient ’s file, and a copy must be 
provided to the patient . Enrollment is defined as the patient  agreement with and documentation 
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 36 
 of written informed consent and the application of the µ-Cor device  plus 2 ZOE electrodes on the 
patient ’s body.    
If the  Investigator fails to obtain a signed  informed consent before enrol lment, the Investigator 
must submit a report to the Sponsor indicating the circumstances of the occurrence. Post -dated 
informed consent documents are not permissible. Failure to obtain inf ormed consent prior to 
enrolment is considered a major protocol deviation. The Sponsor must  be notified and a Protocol 
Deviation Form must  be completed.  
A sample of the ICF is provided in Appendix B. 
5.2 Screening and Enrollment  
The Investigator at the site sh ould screen all eligible patients  for initial study eligibility. A Site 
Screening Log will be provided to the site to capture all patients  screened for the study. All 
patients  will be assigned a unique screening ID and documented on the Site Screening Log.  
Patients  must sign an ICF prior to any study -related procedures. If, for any reason, a patien t is 
excluded from the study (screen failure), the reason for exclusion should be captured on the Site 
Screening Log.  
Patients  will be considered enrolled in the study when they have signed the IRB-approved 
informed consent documents, met all inclusion  and exclusion criteria , and the µ-Cor device  and 
2 ZOE electrodes are applied to their body. Once enrollment is confirmed, the patient  will be 
assigned a unique patient identification number. The patient may be consented from 21 days 
before (ie, A  -21d to A -1d) Session  A, or they may be consented prior to the start of any study 
procedures on the day of Session  A. 
5.3 Baseline Information  
When the patient  is enrolled i nto the study, the following baseline  information will be collected:   
 medical history  
 physical examination  
 current illness  
All information will be recorded on the appropriate case report form  (CRF) . 
5.4 Session A Procedure s 
The following clinical proced ures will take place:  
1. During the  hemodialysis session (Session A) the patient will wear one µ-Cor device  on 
the side location, below the left armpit  (Study Arm 1 ) or one µ -Cor device  on the front 
location , upper left chest  (Study Arm 2 ) and 2 ZOE electrodes  simultaneously for 
comparative measurements and UFV  correlation, for at least  15 minutes befo re the start 
of dialysis and for at least  15 minutes after the end of the dialysis session.  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 36 
 2. Patients will be randomly assigned to Study Arm 1 or Study Arm 2, with randomization 
stratified by CHF status (CHF or non -CHF) . A randomization schedule will be provided 
to the clinical sites.  
3. Patients should be positioned in their dialysis chair per standard of care.  
4. Preparation of the devices and patients  will be as follows:  
ZOE monitor  (model Z2 -100 and ZOE electrodes model Z2 -711):  
The p atient ’s skin where the electrodes have to be placed should be clean and dry; all hair 
should be removed  from the site where the electrodes will be placed to assure a good 
connectio n to the skin. The AC adapter is connected to the back of the ZOE, and the 
device plugged into an outlet (or insert batteries). Two new ZOE electrodes are to be 
snapped on the ZOE cable. Electrodes are to be place d on the skin: electrode 1 goes 
above the t op of the breastbone with the arrow tip pointing down; electrode 2 goes below 
the bottom of the breastbone with the arrow tip pointing up.  
After an information for user manual ( IFU)-required  5-minute  wait period to allow for 
the electrodes to seed,  measur ements can start  by pressing the start button. During the 
time of the readings, the patient  must remain still for about 30 seconds without  moving or 
drinking until the Z 0 value displays on the screen. The Z0 values turn off automatically 
within 30 seconds. The Z0 values must be recorded manually on a Z 0 Tracking log . 
An illustrated user manual will be provided to the site as a part of the site training for 
additional guidance.  
µ-Cor System :  
The patient’s  skin where the patch will be placed should be clean and dry; all hair should 
be trimmed  from the site where the patch will be placed to assure a good connection to 
the skin. T he charger (and gateway placed inside the charger ) is connected to an outlet 
using the power cord supplied by ZOLL . When a green LED light appears  on the 
cartridge (not on charger) , it is an indication that the unit is ready for use. The cartridge is 
to be placed on the charger for  up to  60 minutes . The cart ridge is then removed from the 
charger  and placed on the adhesive patch: lower positioning tabs of the cartridge will go 
on the lower part of the adhesive patch; then the rest of the cartridge is pressed onto the 
patch. The cartridge should be firmly attac hed. The patch liner is to be peeled off and 
placed on the skin. The patch should be completely adhered to the skin. For Study Arm 1 , 
the patch should be positioned  below the left arm pit,  with the word “Kyma” right side 
up, with the nipple aligned anywher e between the top and middle of the cartridge.  For 
Study Arm 2 , the patch should be placed  on the upper left  chest, just below the collarbone 
and the device should be angled as shown in the IB.   
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 36 
  
In order to remove the patch -cartridge from the skin, first, the cartridge must be removed 
from the adhesive patch by pressing the upper snap -in clip; then the cartridge should be 
tilted and removed from the patch. The cartridge should then be placed on the charger . 
In order to detach the adhesive patch from the skin, it is necessary to hold the skin with 
one hand while peeling off gently with the other hand. A wet wipe can be used to assist 
with this process. Patches must be discarded and cannot be reused.  
An illustrated IB will be provided to the site as par t of the site training for additional 
guidance  (Appendix C) 
5. Weight , blood pressure , and heart rate will be recorded before the hemo dialysis session.   
6. The -Cor will be programmed to record  measurements  every 3 minutes during the 
hemo dialysis session , including at least 15 minutes before and after the hemodialysis 
session. However, only every alternate -Cor recording taken during the dialysis session 
will be used for analysis ( ie, the reading taken every 6th minute). This will be done in 
order to syn chronize -Cor measurements with the ZOE (Z0) measurements that also will 
be recorded every 6  minutes  (±1 minute ) during the hemodialysis session  along with the 
UFV measurements.  
7. ZOE ( Z0) values will be measured every  3 minute s (± 1 minute)  before and after the 
hemodialysis session , for a minimum of 5 measurements  (synchronized with the -Cor 
before and after dialysis measurements) . 
8. The UFV  during the course of hemodialysis  will b e measured by automated  readings 
provided by the dialysis mach ine every 6 minutes  (± 1 minute)  (synchronized with the 
-Cor and ZOE during dialysis measurements)  as shown in Table 3.

9. Any IV infusions administered during the course of hemodialysis session will be 
recorded.  
10. Any oral  fluid  and/or solid  intake during the hemodialysis session  will be recorded . 
11. Any urine output during the hemodialysis session will be recorded.  
12. At the end of  the hemodialysis session, the patients  will be asked to remain in a position 
similar to the position they were in for the majority of the session ( ie, if a patient was in a 
reclined position throughout the dialysis session, they should remain in this posi tion 
while the  dialysis needles are removed from the access site and for the subsequent  
15 minutes ).  
13. Both the -Cor device and ZOE electrodes will be removed from the patient’s body.  
14. At the end of the hemodialysis session, weight, blood pressure , and heart rate will be 
recorded .  
15. Adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment through the end of the 
Session  A. 
16. The patient’s involvement in the study ends after the completion of all procedures 
planned for Session  A. Study duration for e ach patient is 1 day : a patient will undergo  
through 1 session  of hemodialysis in the clinic.  
17. Gateways , chargers , cartridges , and patches  will remain at the clinic at all times . 
18. Neither the investigator nor the patient will be informed  of the µ -Cor readings and data . 
All patient medical care will be subjected to the medical teams/ investigator’s decision 
and standard of care.  
5.5 Complete Schedule  
The complete study schedule of assessments to take place during the clinical investigation is 
provided in Table  1. 
5.6 Subject Withdrawal  
Participation in this clinical investigation is voluntary and patients  may withdraw at any time.  
In the event the patient chooses to withdra w, he/she will be instructed to contact the Investigator 
immediately. The patient  also may be terminated from the clinical investigation at any time if 
his/her primary physician and/or the Investigator consider it to be in his/her best medical interest. 
Withdrawal from the investigation will not affect patient ’s follow -up care. Patients  will be 
informed of any significant information regarding new findings that may develop during the 
course of the research study that may relate to his/her willingness to continue participation as a 
clinical investigation patient . 
Patients will either sati sfactorily complete all requirements set forth in the clinical investigation 
plan or their participation in the clinical investigation will be prematurely terminated. The 
completion of a patient’s participation in the clinical investigation or early depart ure from the 
clinical investigation must be fully documented in the patient’s progress notes as well as on the 
appropriate CRF.  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 36 
 Should a patient choose to withdraw from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal will be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF and in  the patient’s medical record.  
An Investigator may remove a patient from the study for the following reasons:  
 In the judgment of the Investigator, continuation in the study can adversely affect the 
safety of the patient  
 Subject non -compliance with the clinical investigational plan  
5.7 Return of Study Product  
At the end of the patient  enrollment period, patients  will leave  all devices at the clinic. The 
clinical site will return all systems to ZOLL . 
5.8 Protocol Deviation  
A protocol deviation is defined as not adhe ring to the clinical investigation plan . Protocol 
deviations can be major or minor. A major deviation  is defined as an event that resulted in an 
increased risk to a patient  or others; affected the right s, safety , or welfare of a patient ; or affected 
the in tegrity of the clinical investigation. Major protocol deviations include (but are not limited 
to): failure to obtain informed consent prior to patient  enrol lment, an enrolled patient  did not 
meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria , or unauthorized use of the devices.  
Prior approval by the Sponsor is expected in situations where the Investigator anticipates, 
contemplates, or makes a conscious decision to deviate. Prior approval is not expected in 
situations where unforeseen circumst ances are beyond the Investigator’s control ( eg, inadvertent 
errors, product failure, or inability to perform required procedures due to patient  illness).   
All major deviations will be documented on a Protocol Deviation CRF.  
6 RISK ANALYSIS  
ZOLL  has conduc ted an analysis of the benefits and risks of the μ -Cor System. ZOLL  has 
determined that this clinical investigation is justified as the overall potential benefit to the 
population outweighs its intended risks. This is a non -significant clinical study  (the non-
significant risk declaration is presented  in Appendix D). 
6.1 Benefits  
Specific potential benefits with the use of the μ -Cor System may not be known at this time. 
However, participation in this clinical investigation may help further develop the technology  
such that it could be a potential benefit  to others.  
6.2 Risks  
The μ -Cor System is a non -significant risk and noninvasive medical monitoring device.  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 36 
 The potential risks from wearing the patch are minimal and may include mild discomfort, skin 
irritation, redness, itching, rash, contact dermatitis, or breaching of the skin if the patch is 
removed too quickly. The μ -Cor System has not been tested for compatibility with magnetic 
resonance imag ing (MRI ) machines or external defibrillator s. Re-use of the patch may result in 
patient cross -contamination and inaccurate measurements.  
6.2.1 Minimization of Risks  
Patients  with known allergies to adhesives or hypersensitivity to the patch ma terials or hydrogel 
will be excluded from the study  
Only qualified clinical Investigators who have training to conduct those procedures will 
participate in this study.   
7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND D EVICE DEFICIENCIES  
An adverse event  (AE) is any undesirable exper ience (sign, symptom, illness, or other medical 
event) occurring to a patient , whether or not associated with the investigational product or related 
procedures that is considered a change from baseline, or pre -study status during the course of the 
study.   
7.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events  shall be assessed and documented and should include the following:  
 The time of onset of any new AE or worsening of a previously observed AE  
 A description of the event  
 The duration of the event (start and stop dates, or ongoing)  
 The severity of the event (mild/moderate/severe)  
 Assessment of the relation of the AE to the study device and index procedure  
 Description of action taken to treat the event  
 Event outcome  
Event severity will be categorized as follows:  
 Mild  - Easily tolerated by the patient , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering 
with everyday activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
 Moderate  - Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities. 
These events are us ually relieved by simple therapeutic measures.  
 Severe  - Prevents normal, everyday activities. These events may require systemic drug 
therapy or other medical treatment.  
The relationship between the AE, the study device , and the interventional procedure wil l be 
categorized as follows  
 None  - An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the device; the AE is readily explained by the patient’s  clinical state or other 
therapies.   
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 36 
  Possible  - The AE follows a known o r expected response pattern to the device, but could 
readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
 Probable  - The AE follows a known or expected response pattern to the device.  
 Definite  - The AE follows a known or expected response pattern to the device and the 
physician confirms the relationship through further testing or evidence.  
Regardless of whether or not the AE is considered related to the device and/or interventional 
procedure, the AE mus t be reported on the appropriate AE CRF.  
7.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that result s in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse experience, in -patient hospitalization or 
prolongation of an existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
permanent impairment of a body function or perma nent damage to a body structure, or 
necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.   
In the event of an SAE, the Sponsor should be notified within 24 hours after i dentification of an 
SAE, followed by a written summary submitted within 2 days.   
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the IRB according to local requirements.  
7.3 Anticipated  Adverse Events  
Anticipated adverse events include the following:  
 Skin irritation,  redness, itching, or rash  
 Contact dermatitis  
 Tearing of skin  
 Allergic reaction to hydrogel  
The following are  common symptoms or signs in patients undergoing hemodialysis. These 
events are not necessarily related to the study device:  
 nausea  
 vomiting  
 heartburn  
 constipation/diarrhea  
 headaches  
 back pain sitting in dialysis chair  
 chest pain (heart)  
 shortness of breath  
 sensation of heart racing

7.4 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (U ADE) is an AE related to the use of an 
investigational medical device, which  by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been 
previously identified in the risk management files.  
In the event of an UADE, the Sponsor should be notified within 24 hours after ide ntification.   
7.5 Device Deficiencies  
Device deficiencies are defined as inadequacies of a medical device with respect to its identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety , or performance. Device deficiencies (also referred to as 
device performance issue s) also include malfunctions, use er rors, and inadequate labeling.   
All µ-Cor device deficiencies will be documented in the patient’s  medical record and on the 
appropriate CRF . 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
8.1 Outcome Measures  
The p rimary  endpoint is the compar ison of correlation s of thoracic impedance made with the -
Cor System and UFV  with those of the ZOE  monitor  and UFV . The non -inferiority assessment 
will be between each location (side and front) of the -Cor System /UFV correlation and 
ZOE/UFV correlation.  
The secondary endpoints are:  
 Comparison of correlations of thoracic impedance made with the -Cor System 
and UFV with those of the ZOE and UFV using all values from the -Cor 
System, regardless of location  
 Comparison of the precision of the ZOE and the -Cor System

 The primary endpoint assessment depicted in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1: Primary Endpoint Assessment  
8.2 General Statistical Considerations  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be created by ZOLL  or a designee, and will be finalized 
prior to database lock.  
For statistical analyses, d ata will be summarized by investigational site and by pooled sites.  
All tests of differences will be conduct ed at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05, unless otherwise stated.  
Any p -values produced for this study will be considered as exploratory due to the small sample 
size. 
Data summaries will be provided  for all patients  combined  and by each study arm , wherever 
appropriate. For continuous variables, summary statistics will include number of patients, mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Categorical endpoints will be summarized 
using number of patients, frequency, and percentages.  
Additional explor atory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.  
8.3 Patient Disposition  
Patients  who complete the study and those who prematurely discontinue from the study, will be 
summarized overall  and by study arm. In addition, for patients who prematurely discontinue 
from the study, the reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.  

2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 36 
 8.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographic s and baseline characteristics will be presented for all 
patients and by each study arm. 
8.5 Analyses  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on  all per -protocol enrolled patients that meet 
all selection criteria . Supportive analyses may be conducted on a subset of subjects, as defined in 
the statistical analysis plan.  
8.5.1 Comparison of Correlations  
The primary endpoint is the comparison of correlation s of thoracic impedance made with the µ-
Cor System and UFV  with those of the ZOE monitor and UFV. Correlation between -Cor and 
UFV changes during the dialysis session will be summarized using average Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient. Correlation between ZOE and UFV changes will be summarized in the same manner. 
The non -inferiority assessment will be between each location  (side and front) of the µ-Cor 
System/UFV  correlation and ZOE/UFV correlation. The µ-Cor System will be considered as 
substantially equivalent with respect to clinical performance of the ZOE monitor if the 
correlation between the µ-Cor thoracic impedance measurem ents and UFV (r_  µ-Cor) is non -
inferior to the correlation between ZOE bioimpedance measurements and UFV (r_ZOE). Non -
inferior is defined as r_  µ-Cor within the range [(r_ZOE – 0.05), 0.9999 ]. 
A similar, supporting comparison will be made using all values from the µ-Cor System, 
regardless of location. This comparison will be considered as a secondary comparison.  
8.5.2 Precision Comparison of µ -Cor and ZOE  
A Mann -Whitney test will be employed to compare the precision of the Zoe and the µ -Cor. The 
precision of each device will be calculated, using values obtained before dialysis, as:  
Precision = standard  deviation  of measurements  before  dialysis
median  measurement  before  dialysis 
8.5.3 Safety Analyses  
Safety summaries will be based on all enrolled patients . 
All AEs will be summarized and listed. The incidence of AEs will be presented by severity and 
by relationship with the device and the interventional procedure,  as perceived by the 
Investigator. Adverse e vents  reported to occur prior to enrollment will be distinguished from 
those reported as new or increased in severity after enrollment . 
In addition, vital sign  measuremen ts will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive 
statistics.   
Additional analys es will be performed , if warranted , upon review of the data.  
8.5.4 Interim Analyses  
There is no planned interim analysis in this study.

site qualific ation visit may be conducted  at the Investigator’s institution, remotely , or contact 
also may occur vi a telephone and will be documented by ZOLL .   
9.3.3 Site Initiation  
Site initiation  will be conducted by the ZOLL  clinical team to train the Investigator and 
supporting clinical investigation staff on the CIP objectives, patient  timelines, device operation, 
CRF  completion, informed consent procedures, patient  screening and enrollment, study 
documentation and administ ration, device accountability, record -keeping requirements, 
Investigator and ZOLL  responsibilities, role of the IRB, AE and protocol deviation reporting, 
monitoring requirements , and any applicable regulatory documents prior to enrolling the first 
patient .  The site initiation will occur after the clinical investigation site has received written IRB 
approval to conduct the CIP. The site may not enroll study patient  into the clinical investigation 
until all applicable IRB approval has been received by ZOLL  and the site initiation is completed. 
Site initiation  training will be documented and the documentation will be filed at the 
investigational site and at ZOLL . 
9.3.4 Site Monitoring  
Monitoring will be performed by ZOLL  (or ZOLL ’s designee) to assess the progress o f the 
clinical investigation and to ensure the Investigator adheres to the CIP and all applicable 
regulations. The monitor also will identify any concerns that result from device performance or 
review of the Investigato r’s study records, study management d ocuments , and patient  Informed 
Consent documentation.  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 36 
 To assure the integrity of key data collected in the clinical investigation, the study monitor will 
compare individual patient  medical records  and/or source documentation and reports prepared by 
the In vestigator or designee to the CRFs. The data captured on the CRFs will be compared to 
supporting site documents, and includes  eligibility criteria, AEs, protocol deviations, device 
accountability, device performance , and all study objectives.   
In some instances, site monitoring may be performed remotely as long as key data provided on 
CRFs are properly monitored against source documents.  
If a clinical site is found to be out of compliance  with the CIP and regulations, it will be 
terminated from  the clinical investigation and shall be required to return all unused devices 
and/or associated clinical investigation materials and procedure manuals to ZOLL .   
9.3.5 Site Close -out 
Site closeout will be conducted at the completion of the clinical study. Durin g the close -out visit, 
ZOLL  or ZOLL ’s designee will ensure that all CRFs and data queries are signed , dated , and have 
been transmitted to ZOLL ; the device accountability log has been reconciled ; and any remaining 
study devices have been shipped back to ZOL L. Additionally, ZOLL  will review the 
Investigator’s ongoing study responsibilities, including reporting of any unexpected or device 
related AEs, submission of a final study report , notification of study close to the IRB , and the 
maintenance of study files  per regulations. In some instances, the site closeouts may be 
conducted via tele phone.  
10 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
10.1 Conformance with Regulatory Standards  
The clinical investigation will be performed in accordance with ICH E6, the Declaration of 
Helsinki , and a pplicable local regulations. International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) and 
GCP will be used as guidance for the preparation and conduct of the clinical investigation.  
Prior to enrollment of the first patient , ZOLL  will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies and 
obtain approval as necessary to start the clinical investigation.  
10.1.1  Institutional Review Board  
Clinical investigations will not begin without documented approval of the clinical investigation  
by the  IRB affiliated with the study site . Additional approvals (by investigational site 
hospital/organizations ) may also be required.  The Investigator will submit and obtain approval 
for the clinical investigation from their IRB and hospital management . Prior to submission to the 
IRB, ZOLL  must review and approve the site-specific  ICF. It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that all aspects of the IRB and hospital management reviews  and approvals 
are obtained, maintained and renewed as necessary.  The Investigator will provide ZOLL  with a 
copy of all communication from the IRB and hospital management  including submission  
and/or approval of the CIP, and approval of the ICF prior to initiation of the clinical investigation. 
Amendments to the CIP and revisions to the ICF will be subject  to the same requirements. The 
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 36 
 clinical investigation will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their 
origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Copies of the IRB submissions  and/or approvals must be maintained in the site regulatory b inder.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to report any withdrawals of approval by the reviewing 
IRB to ZOLL  within 5 working days.  
10.1.2  Patient  Confidentiality  
Patient  confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study. For this purpose, a unique patient  
identification code (ID number and patient  name code) will be used th at allows identification of 
all data reported for each patient .   
Data relating to the study might be made available to third parties (for example in case of an 
audit performed by regulatory authorities) provided data are treated as confidential and that the 
patient’s privacy is guaranteed in accordance with HIPAA criter ia and/or other applicable 
requirements.    
10.1.3  Clinical Investigational Plan Compliance  
The Investigator will carefully review the procedures defined in the CIP and in the CRFs with 
his/her research staff prior to the time of site initiation to ensur e appropr iate interpretation and 
implementation. The Investigator should not plan to deviate from the CIP without obtaining prior 
consent from ZOLL . ZOLL  may approve minor protocol deviation on a case -by-case basis. All 
protocol deviations (from the CIP) will be re ported to ZOLL .   
Only ZOLL  is allowed to modify this CIP. Any changes to the CIP will originate from ZOLL  (in 
the form of an amendment) and must be re -submitted to each institution’s IRB and must be 
approved. Any modification that potentially affects patients’ rights or safety also must be 
approved by the IRB and other regulatory agencies. In an emergency where action is necessary 
to protect the life or physical well -being of the patient , a deviation from the CIP for an individual 
patient  may be allowed on  a per -patient  basis. In such circumstances, the Investigator must notify 
their IRB and ZOLL  and must describe the conditions necessitating the deviation from the CIP 
and the outcome of the emergency intervention in a written report. ZOLL  will determine wh ether 
the patient  is to continue in the clinical investigation.  
10.1.4  Suspension or Termination of Clinical Study  
ZOLL  may suspend or prematurely terminate either a clinical investigation at an individual 
investigational site or the entire clinical investigation  for significant and documented reasons. An 
Investigator, IRB , or appropriate regulatory authority may suspend or prematurely terminate 
participation in a clinical investigation at the Investigational Site for which they are responsible.  
If suspension or p remature termination occurs : 
a) ZOLL  shall remain responsible for providing resources to fulfill the obligations 
from the CIP and existing agreements for following up the patients  enrolled in the 
clinical investigation, and  
b) The Principal Investigator or authorized designee shall promptly inform the 
enrolled patients  at his/her investigational site, if appropriate.  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 36 
 Although ZOLL  may terminate the clinical investigation or the Investigator at any time, 
scheduled patien t follow -up visits , if applicable,  will continue on all patients  treated prior to the 
termination of the clinical investigation.  
10.1.5  Emergency Situations  
ZOLL  accepts the right of the Investigator to initiate emergency medical intervention that may 
not be defined in th e CIP, when necessary, to safeguard the life or physical well -being of a 
clinical investigation patient . The Investigator must give notice of any emergency deviations and 
justification for the deviation to the study personnel responsible at ZOLL  and the IRB as quickly 
as possible after the emergency, and in any event, no later than 24 hours after the emergency .

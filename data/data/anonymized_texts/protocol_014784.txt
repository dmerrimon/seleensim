2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Bladder Cancer  
 
Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (MUC) patients have a median overall survival of approximately 
15 months, and accounted for an estimated 15,580 deaths in the United States in 2014 (Abida et al 
, 2015). The use of platinating agents in treating urothelial c arcinomas has been well -documented 
in the literature for over 30 years (Yagoda et al 1976). Previously, the combination methotrexate, 
vinblastine (Adriamycin) and cisplatin (MVAC) was the standard first -line treatment for MUC. 
More recently, combination gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) ha s become a standard first -line 
treatment for MUC, because it appears to have similar efficacy as MVAC and may be less 
myelosuppressiv e (Roberts et al 2006) . Some efforts have been made to build on GC through the 
addition of t argeted agents (e.g., cetuximab or bevacizumab)  (Grivas et al 2012; Hahn et al 2011) , 
but prospective evaluations have shown little benefit with those novel combination s. For patients 
“unfit” for cisplatin, there are data to support carboplatin -based regim ens as a first -line approac h. 
In all others, cisplatin with gemcitabine remains a mainstay of treatment (Roberts et al 2006).   
 
ATR and DNA Damage response  
The DNA -damage response (DDR) is a multicomplex network of signaling pathways involved in 
surveillance and repair of DNA damage and transient cell cycle arrest to ensure genomic stability 
and cell viability (Fokas et al. , 2014; Weber and Ryan, 2015; Zeman and Cimprich, 2014).  
Deficiencies in DDR mechanisms have been shown to contribute to tumor development.  The 
primary sensors of DNA damage and regulators of DDR are ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) 
and ataxia telangiectasia Rad3 -related (ATR) protein k inases.  They both contribute to maintaining 
genome integrity in response to various exogenous and endogenous genotoxic insults, e.g., 
NCI Protocol #:  9947

7 cytotoxic chemotherapy, ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation (IR), or hypoxia (Fokas et al. , 2014; 
Pitts et al. , 2014; Y an et al.,  2014).  Although ATR and ATM have broadly overlapping substrate 
specificities, they have non -redundant functions, which are well coordinated during DDR.  ATR 
appears to be primarily activated by single -strand DNA (ssDNA) breaks (SSB) during repl icative 
stress while ATM is a main sensor of double -strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks (DSB).  The key 
outcomes of ATR activation are inhibition of cell -cycle progression and suppression of late 
replicating origin firing (Zeman and Cimprich, 2014).  ATR not only he lps to stabilize but also 
restarts stalled replication forks, and suppresses recombination.  ATR is recruited to the sites of 
SSB at stalled replication forks resulting from replication stress (Fokas et al. , 2014; Pitts et al. , 
2014).  ATR phosphorylates/a ctivates checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) at serine 345 (CHK1pS345), 
which stabilizes stalled replication forks until replication stress is resolved and DNA damage is 
repaired.  Activated CHK1 phosphorylates and inhibits the cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) 
phos phatase, which ultimately results in cell cycle arrest in intra -S-phase and/or G2 -phase and 
blocks cells from entering mitosis until DNA is repaired and completely replicated 1,2.  The ATR 
function is not entirely restricted to CHK1 activation as it has been shown to be independently 
involved in replication of DNA and regulation of a DNA -damage protein network (Fokas et al. , 
2014).  Upon detecting DSBs, ATM activates CHK2, which c ontrols p53 -dependent G1 -phase 
arrest.  Unlike normal cells, cancer cells are often deficient in ATM signaling.  It has been 
hypothesized that loss of the G1 checkpoint renders tumor cells more reliant on the ATR -
controlled S/G2 checkpoints for repairing D NA damage and survival (Reaper et al. , 2011; Fokas 
et al. , 2014).  Therefore, in tumor cells with defective ATM signaling, ATR inhibition may 
exacerbate replication stress leading to accumulation of DSBs, collapse of stalled replication forks, 
and eventual ly to lethal mitotic catastrophe.  In contrast, normal cells which exhibit a low level of 
replicative stress and have functional ATM are expected to tolerate ATR inhibition.  Indeed, 
preclinical studies have shown that disruption of the ATR pathway can exa cerbate replication 
stress in oncogene -driven tumors and promotes cell killing.  In addition, tumor cells, which 
proliferate rapidly, are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation 
than slowly proliferating normal cells (Fokas et al. , 2014; Weber and Ryan, 2015).  However, the 
effectiveness of such DNA damage -inducing therapies in cancer treatment is attenuated by cells 
developing drug resistance, leading to tumor recurrence.  Acquired resistance to cytotoxic 
therapies in tumors  has been linked to the activation of DDR.  There is accumulating preclinical 
evidence that ATR inhibition can sensitize tumor cells to the effects of radiation or chemotherapy.   
 
2.2 CTEP IND Agent(s)  
 
2.2.1 M6620 (VX -970) 
 
Mechanism of Action  
 
M6620 (VX-970) (former names VET -0768079 or VE -822) is a highly potent and selective ATP -
competitive inhibitor of ATR, with an inhibition constant (Ki) <0.2 nmol/L (nM) (Fokas et al. , 
2012; Investigator’s Brochure 2015).  In comparison, M6620 (VX -970) was >100 -fold weaker 
inhibitor of ATM (Ki=34 nM) and >1000 -fold less effective against other closely related kinases, 
such as DNA -dependent protein kinase (DNA -PK) (Ki>4 mcM), mTOR (Ki>1mcM), and PI3K -
gamma (Ki=0.22 mcM) (Fokas et al., 2012).  Overall, among 291 kin ases tested, M6620 (VX -
970)’s Ki values were >500 -fold higher for 278 kinases (Ki>200 nM), >50 -fold higher for 12 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
8 kinases (Ki>15 nM), and >25 -fold higher for FLT4 (Ki=8 nM) than its Ki for ATR (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2015).  A cellular 50% inhibition of ATR was attained at a M6620 (VX -970) 
concentration (IC 50) of 0.019 mcM, demonstrating >100 -fold greater selectivity against ATR 
compared to ATM or DNA -PK (IC 50 of 2.6 mcM or 18.1 mcM, respectively) (Fokas et al. , 2012).  
 
Effect of M6620 (VX -970) on DDR signaling and DNA damage  
 
Concurrent treatment of cancer cell lines with M6620 (VX -970) and various DNA -damaging 
agents led to sustained M6620 (VX -970)-dose-dependent decreases in levels of chemotherapy -
induced CHK1pS345, a major substrate of ATR ( Fokas et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2014; Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2015).  In the presence of DNA damage, primarily DSBs, histone H2AX is 
phosphorylated at serine 139 to produce γH2AX (H2AXpS139).  Although all three DDR regulatory 
kinases, ATM, ATR, and DNA -PK phosphorylate H2AX to γH2AX, they are variably activated 
during different DNA -damage repair mechanisms ( e.g., HR repair, non -homologous end joining 
[NHEJ] repair, base excision repair due induced by stalled replication forks, etc.) (Kuo and Yang, 
2008).   In addition, for efficient DNA -damage repair, the DDR regulatory kinases must be able to 
access damaged sites in the chromatin environment.  ATM has been shown to phosphorylate the 
heterochromatin protein KAP1 at serine 824 (KAP1pS824) in response to DNA  damage (White et 
al., 2012).  Exposure of lung cancer cell lines as well as primary tumors to M6620 (VX -970) in 
combination with DNA -damaging agents enhanced levels of the DNA -damage markers, i.e., 
γH2AX and KAP1pS824, as compared to DNA -damaging agent al one (Hall et al ., 2014; 
Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  Sequential treatment of cells with DNA -damaging agent followed 
15 h later by M6620 (VX -970) resulted in an initial inhibition of phospho -CHK1 (for 1 to 2 h) 
(Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  However,  over time, phospho -CHK1 reappeared despite 
continued exposure to M6620 (VX -970).  The rebound of phospho -CHK1 has been attributed to 
non-specific phosphorylation by an undefined kinase.  However, despite the transient inhibition of 
phospho -CHK1, the susta ined accumulation of γH2AX and KAP1pS824 was observed.  Together 
these data suggest that disruption of ATR -mediated DDR signaling by M6620 (VX -970) leads to 
sustained accumulation of DNA damage in cancer cells exposed to DNA -damaging agents.  
Failure to re pair chemotherapy -induced DNA damage in the presence of M6620 (VX -970) has 
been hypothesized to drive enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells.  These data support using γH2AX 
and KAP1pS824 as pharmacodynamic markers of M6620 (VX -970) activity.   
 
M6620 (VX -970)-mediated radiosensitivity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells was 
associated with inhibition of HR repair (Fokas et al., 2012).  M6620 (VX -970) caused increased 
persistence of γH2AX levels both in vitro  and in vivo .  Adding M6620 (VX -970) to gemc itabine 
and ionizing radiation (IR) dramatically enhanced antitumor effects, with early and late apoptosis 
and abrogation of IR -induced G2 checkpoint in cell culture experiments.  It has been suggested 
that by promoting strong S -phase arrest, chemoradiatio n may further increase dependence of tumor 
cells on ATR -mediated homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double strand breaks 
(DSBs) and for survival.

9  
In the absence of exogenous DNA -damaging agents, M6620 (VX -970) demonstrated stronger 
antiproliferative effects against three cancer cell lines tested (HCT116, HT29, and NCI -H23 with 
IC50s of 35, 48, and 170 nM, respectively) compared to noncancerous fibro blast and epithelial cells 
(IC 50=110 -200 nM) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  However, among the three cancer cell lines, 
potent cytotoxicity by single -agent M6620 (VX -970) was seen only in a colorectal cancer [CRC] 
cell line HCT116: a 50% effect (death i n 50% of cells) was observed at a concentration of 61 nM 
M6620 (VX -970) (EC 50).  This suggests that certain cancer cells may be particularly reliant on 
ATR for survival even in the absence of an exogenous DNA -damaging agent.  
 
In the cell proliferation assa y with the HCT116 cell line, M6620 (VX -970) synergized with 
cisplatin (cross -linking agent), gemcitabine (anti -metabolite), irinotecan (topoisomerase I 
inhibitor), and etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  The most 
dramat ic response was observed in combination with cisplatin (a 20 -fold lower IC 50 compared to 
the IC 50 of cisplatin alone).  Preliminary data from cell proliferation studies with M6620 (VX -970) 
+ carboplatin suggests >10 -fold reduction in carboplatin IC 50 for two non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) cell lines (H23 and HT1299) tested.  
 
The impact of M6620 (VX -970) on chemotherapy -induced cytotoxicity was further examined 
against a panel of 37 lung cancer cell lines (including squamous NSCLC and small cell lung can cer 
[SCLC] histotypes) and 15 pancreatic cancer cell lines (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  Most lung 
cancer cell lines responded well to M6620 (VX -970) in combination with cisplatin (84% of cell 
lines) or gemcitabine (76% of cell lines), demonstrating ≥3 -fold reduction in the IC 50 compared to 
IC50 of the cytotoxic agent alone 3 and (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  Enhanced sensitivity was 
also observed with etoposide (53% of cell lines), irinotecan (49% of  cell lines) and oxaliplatin 
(39% of cell lines).  About 40% of cell lines were hypersensitized (>10 -fold reduction in IC 50 
observed) to cisplatin by M6620 (VX -970).  Marked synergy between the two agents was also 
seen against four of seven human NSCLC pri mary tumors tested in vitro  (Hall et al. , 2014).  The 
greatest antitumor synergistic effect was demonstrated by tumors with poor response to cisplatin 
alone.  Similarly, most pancreatic cancer lines responded well to combination of M6620 (VX -970) 
with cisplatin or gemcitabine: antitumor IC 50 was ≥3 -fold lower for the M6620 (VX -970) + 
cytotoxic agent in >70% of cell lines as compared to IC 50 of cytotoxic agent alone (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2015).  
 
In addition, significant radiosensitization effec ts by M6620 (VX -970) were observed against two 
human pancreatic cancer cell lines with mutant KRAS and mutant p53 (MiaPaCa -2 and PSN1) 
(P<0.05), but not against non -cancerous fibroblast cell lines (Fokas et al., 2012).  In addition, 
M6620 (VX -970) profound ly sensitized pancreatic tumor cells to gemcitabine -based 
chemoradiation.  
 
Impact of defective ATM signaling on sensitivity of cells to M6620 (VX -970) in combination with 
a cytotoxic agent (cisplatin, gemcitabine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or etoposide) was  examined in 
isogenic matched lung cancer cells (wild -type p53 A549 versus A549 transfected with p53 
shRNA), using a cell viability assay (Hall et al. , 2014; Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  Loss of 
p53 promoted sensitivity to ATR inhibition in combination  with all five cytotoxic agents in 
contrast with the effects in wild -type A549.  M6620 (VX -970) also synergized with cisplatin 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
10 resulting in cytotoxicity in ATM -null primary skin fibroblasts, but no cytotoxicity was observed 
against wild -type fibroblasts (I nvestigator’s Brochure, 2015).  This suggests that the functional 
status of the ATM pathway is a contributing factor in the cellular response to the inhibition of 
ATR.  
 
Of note, the response/p53 status relationship was unclear in the panel of heterogeneous  cancer 
cell lines exposed to M6620 (VX -970) + chemotherapy (Hall et al. , 2014).  Although not 
significant, there was a trend of causality between response and p53 status ( P=0.08) for M6620 
(VX-970) combined with cisplatin.  Furthermore, no clear relations hip between cellular response 
to M6620 (VX -970) + cisplatin and p53 status was observed in seven primary lung tumors.   
 
In vivo  antitumor activity  
 
The in vivo  activity of M6620 (VX -970) was tested in multiple mouse xenograft models derived 
from human hung cancer cell lines and primary human tumor cells (Hall et al. , 2014; Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2015).  M6620 (VX -970) potentiated antitumor effects of cisplatin, gemcitabine, 
irinotecan, and IR in a dose -dependent as well as dosing schedule -dependent manner.  Antitumor 
efficacy correlated with inhibition of phospho -CHK1 and an increase in DNA -damage markers.  
This supports ATR inhibition as a primary mechanism of action for M6620 (VX -970).  Single -
agent M6620 (VX -970) had no significant effect on tumor growth in the experimental models.  
M6620 (VX -970) was generally well tolerated at efficacious doses in combination with DNA -
damaging agents.  Some body weight loss and enhanced changes in sp ecific peripheral blood cell 
populations were observed with intensive and sustained dosing of M6620 (VX -970) in 
combination with cisplatin.  This effect could be attributed to an increased growth arrest, which 
was observed in vitro  in normal cells for comb inations of M6620 (VX -970) with DNA -damaging 
agents.  This effect was reversed when ATR activity was restored.  M6620 (VX -970) sensitized 
pancreatic tumor xenografts to the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine -based chemoradiation (Fokas 
et al., 2012).  The co mbination treatment was effective even at gemcitabine doses with no single -
agent activity.  M6620 (VX -970) administered in combination with gemcitabine + IR was well 
tolerated.  
 
In the dosing -schedule optimization studies, M6620 (VX -970) was administered i ntravenously 
(IV) at 20 mg/kg (either as a single injection or as two 10 mg/kg injections 3 days apart) before ( -
2 h) or after cytotoxic agent (+12, 24, or 48 h) in two human pancreatic cancer and NSCLC 
xenograft mouse models.  M6620 (VX -970) effectively e nhanced antitumor activity of 
gemcitabine or cisplatin when administered 12 to 24 h after a cytotoxic agent.  M6620 (VX -970) 
administered before cytotoxic drug or greater than 48 h after a DNA -damaging agent had no impact 
on tumor growth compared to the ef fect of cytotoxic agent alone.   
 
Therapeutic human dose has been estimated based on the efficacious exposure achieved at 20 
mg/kg/week of M6620 (VX -970) (given either as a single IV injection or as two IV injections of 
10 mg/kg per week) 12 -24 h after cyt otoxic agent (gemcitabine or cisplatin) in mice.  The target 
M6620 (VX -970) plasma exposure, which corresponded to this dose, was an area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC) of 4080 ng×h/mL/week.  Allometry predicts that a human dose 
of 2.5 mg/kg (100 mg/mg2) will be sufficient to achieve this exposure.

11 Nonclinical Pharma cokinetics  
 
In all non -clinical species (the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey), M6620 (VX -970) exhibited a high 
volume of distribution (V d); tissue exposure, including tumor, was high.  In rats, no accumulation 
or retention was observed in tissues and the elimi nation half -lives (t 1/2) were similar across all 
tissues and whole blood (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  The whole blood t 1/2 was 11.6 h in rats 
and 9.8 h in dogs.  M6620 (VX -970) was extensively bound to plasma proteins; the free fraction 
of M6620 (VX -970) was only 2.1% in human blood.  
 
M6620 (VX -970) is primarily eliminated by oxidative metabolism, with a cytochrome 450 (CYP) 
3A4 isoform being the principle  isoform responsible.  Strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 
may alter M6620 (VX -970) kinetics and blood levels.  Based on its minimal inhibition or induction 
effects on CYPs, M6620 (VX -970) is expected to have a low potential for drug -drug interactions.   
M6620 (VX -970) metabolites were excreted in the urine and bile.  All metabolites observed in 
human hepatocyte incubations were also observed in either rat or dog hepatocyte incubations and 
in the blood, bile, or urine from rats or dogs.  The systemic cle arance of M6620 (VX -970) 
following IV administration was 26 and 13 mL/min/kg in the rat and dog, respectively.  
 
Nonclinical Safety Pharmacology  
 
An in -house manual patch -clamp human ether -a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay demonstrated 
moderate inhibition of the hERG channel (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  However, a telemetry 
dog study did not demonstrate any cardiovascular (CV) effects at exposures greatly exceeding the 
target human exposure.   
 
Nonclinical Toxicology  
 
M6620 (VX -970) was administered PO  or IV for up to 28  days in rats and dogs.  The oral studies 
used an aggressive dosing regimen (every 2  days) to define the toxicity profile, while IV studies 
(dosed twice per week) were more representative of the planned clinical dosing schedule 
(Investig ator’s Brochure, 2015) .  In the rat, the severely toxic dose in 10% of animals (STD 10) was 
30 mg/kg/day IV.  The highest non -severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in dogs was 20 mg/kg/day IV.  
The target organs for M6620 (VX -970) toxicity in rats included testes and  peripheral blood cell 
populations (red cell mass, eosinophils, and platelets).  Target organs in the dog included the liver, 
testes, and peripheral blood cell populations (red cell mass and eosinophils); changes in these 
organs appeared to be reversible a fter discontinuing of M6620 (VX -970) in both rats and dogs.  
 
M6620 (VX -970) had no cardiovascular liabilities, was not genotoxic in mutagenicity assay, had 
no hemolytic potential in human blood or compatibility issues in human plasma, and was well 
tolerate d in an acute rabbit parenteral injection study.  M6620 (VX -970) does absorb in the 
ultraviolet (UV) spectrum and has high tissue distribution in rats.   
 
M6620 (VX -970) has yet not been assessed in developmental and reproductive toxicity studies.  
However , VX 970 inhibits DNA -damage repair and will be administered in conjunction with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, thus the potential for teratogenicity should be considered high.

Clinical Studies  
 
The suggested starting dose of M6620 (VX -970) in humans, 18 mg/m2 IV, was equivalent to 1/10 
of the rat STD 10 (30 mg/kg or 180 mg/m2) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  This dose represents 
a more conservative estimate than 37 mg/m2 IV which would an estimate corresponding to the 1/6 
of the dog HNSTD (20 mg/kg or 222 mg/m2).  
 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has sponsored the first -in-human M6620 (VX -970) phase 1 study 
withM6620 (VX -970) being administered in combination with DNA -damaging agents to patients 
with advanced solid malignancies (Study 001); th e study is ongoing (Investigator’s Brochure, 
2015).  This study evaluates M6620 (VX -970) in combination with either gemcitabine +/ - cisplatin 
or cisplatin +/ - etoposide.  M6620 (VX -970) is dose -escalated (18, 36, 60, 72 mg/m2 IV) following 
the standard 3+3  design.  To allow for the single -agent M6620 (VX -970) PK, a 7 -day lead -in 
treatment period of M6620 (VX -970) before cycle 1 has been included.  Combinations of M6620 
(VX-970) with gemcitabine or cisplatin are administered on a weekly schedule, with M6620 (VX-
970) being dosed 24 h after a DNA -damaging agent.  
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics   
 
Clinical PK have been evaluated both in whole blood and plasma (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  
Preliminary clinical PK data are available from the lead -in period for the first two cohorts ( M6620 
(VX-970) 18 mg/m2 and 36 mg/m2).  Mean exposure (AUC) profiles were similar in whole blood 
and plasma.  The terminal elimination t 1/2 was approximately 16 h across all doses.  Overall, the 
Cmax was 1.36x greater and AUC 0-∞ 1.43x gr eater in whole blood than in plasma. The results 
suggest that plasma is an appropriate matrix to characterize the M6620 (VX -970) PK.  M6620 
(VX-970) exposures were similar for the agent administered alone and in combination with 
gemcitabine, suggesting no apparent drug -drug interactions.  In the M6620 (VX -970) single dose 
studies, the plasma C max and AUC 0-∞ increase in  linear fashion with dose up to 480 mg/m2. 
 
Clinical Efficacy  
 
Preliminary efficacy data (cut off February 27, 2015) are available for 38 pat ients treated with 
M6620 (VX -970) in combination with gemcitabine or cisplatin (study 001) and for 11 patients 
treated with single -agent M6620 (VX -970) (study 002) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  Of 29 
evaluable patients (receiving M6620 (VX -970) + gemci tabine, 16 patients had stable disease (SD) 
(5/6, 4/9, and 7/13 patients with NSCLC, CRC, or other cancers, respectively) and 1 patient with 
EBV+ nasopharyngeal cancer demonstrated a 51% tumor reduction corresponding to a partial 
response (PR).  Four of seven evaluable patients receiving M6620 (VX -970) + cisplatin 
demonstrated SD.  Among 10 evaluable patients treated with M6620 (VX -970) monotherapy , there 
were 3 SD and 1 PR.  The CRC patient who achieved a PR (80% reduction of the lesion) on 
monotherapy continues on treatment after completing 11 cycles.  
 
Clinical Safety  
 
Preliminary safety data for 38 patients receiving M6620 (VX -970) in combinatio n with 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
13 gemcitabine or cisplatin (Study 001) and 11 patients receiving M6620 (VX -970) alone (Study 002) 
can be found in Investigator’s Brochure (2015).  No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed 
during either 7 -14-day or 21 -days lead -in period of M66 20 (VX -970) monotherapy in Study 001.  
There were no deaths attributable to treatment with M6620 (VX -970) alone.  There were no grade 
3+ AEs; serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced by 2 patients (palpitation, pyrexia, and dyspnea).  
In the combination phase e valuating M6620 (VX -970) + gemcitabine, M6620 (VX -970) was 
administered at 18 -140 mg/m2 IV and gemcitabine at 500 -875 mg/m2 IV.  Of 27 patients included 
in the DLT analysis, 4 patients (14.8%) experienced 7 DLTs (2 alanine aminotransferase [ALT], 
2 asparta te aminotransferase [AST], 1 alkaline phosphatase, 1 thrombocytopenia, 1 fatigue). A 
total of 16 patients (2 during the M6620 (VX -970) lead-in phase and 14 during the combination 
treatment) experienced serious SAEs; 9 of them were assessed as related to tr eatment.  The most 
common AEs regardless causality were nausea (65%), vomiting (55%), and fatigue (48%).  In the 
sub-study evaluating M6620 (VX -970) + cisplatin, six patients received M6620 (VX -970) (90-
140 mg/m2) with cisplatin 40 mg/m2.  There were no DL Ts and two SAEs (1 patient with 
metastases to CNS treated during the lead -in period and 1 patient with dyspnea), none of which 
were related to treatment.  The most common AEs, regardless of causality, were nausea and 
fatigue, both observed in 4/6 patients (67%).  
 
In the single -agent M6620 (VX -970) study (Study 002), M6620 (VX -970) was administered IV at 
doses ranging from 60 -480 mg/m2.  There were no DLTs among 11 patients evaluated for toxicities 
(cut-off February 10, 2015).  One SAE of grade 3 fatigue wa s classified as possibly related to 
M6620 (VX -970).  The most common AE was fatigue (5/11 patients [46%]); nausea, urinary 
infection, headache, and flushing were observed in 3 patients (28%).   
 
As of April 17, 2015, acute hypersensitivity, reported in 2/66 patients (3.0%) during administering 
M6620 (VX -970), has been identified as an adverse drug reaction for VX 970.  
 
Safety Summary and Guidance for Investigators (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015)  
 
• M6620 (VX -970) absorbs in the UV -visible radiation spectrum and is widely distributed 
including skin, so patients receiving M6620 (VX -970) should take protective measures to 
minimize sun exposure.   
 
• To minimize the possibility of phlebitis, M6620 (VX-970) should be administered through 
a large -bore catheter  or port  into a large -caliber peripheral vein.  The intravenous infusion 
site should be monitored closely for the development of erythema, induration, purulence, 
tenderness, or warmth.  
 
• Because the drug -interaction profile of M6620 (VX -970) has not been fully characterized, 
caution should be used when co -administering medications with VX 970.  Because M6620 
(VX-970) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, concomitant administration with stron g 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided.  
 
• Preclinical studies suggested that M6620 (VX -970) causes testicular changes with signs of 
reversibility after the drug discontinuation.  Developmental and reproductive toxicity 
studies have not been co nducted yet.  Therefore, patients should take stringent measures to

14 avoid fathering or bearing children while on study drug and for 6  months after 
discontinuation of M6620 (VX -970).   
 
2.3 Commercially Available Agents  
 
The current protocol will use the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine as a standard of care 
regimen, and patients will be treated with these drugs alone or in combination with M6620 (VX -
970) (as subsequently discussed).  Cisplatin is a platinating age nt which works through the 
formation of monoadducts with cellular DNA.  Cisplatin reacts preferentially with the N7 position 
of guanine.  Interstrand cross links formed by a multiple monoadducts ultimately result in 
cumulative DNA damage and cellular death .  Cisplatin is principally renally excreted.  In contrast 
to cisplatin, gemcitabine is an antimetabolite. Gemcitabine requires a nuclear transporter for 
intracellular accumulation.  Once in the cell, gemcitabine is phosphorylated to 2,2 -
difluorodeoxycytid ine-phosphate, and this moiety inhibits ribonucleotide reductase.  As a 
consequence, pools of deoxynucleotide triphosphates occur and subsequent cell death is 
encountered.  The combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine was established as a standard in 
advan ced bladder cancer through a randomized, phase III study comparing the regimen to the 
aforementioned 4 drug regimen, MVAC (Robert et al Ann Oncol 2006)  In total, the study included 
405 patients, with 203 randomized to cisplatin/gemcitabine and 202 randomi zed to MVAC.  
Overall survival was similar in both arms, with a median survival of 14.0 months with 
cisplatin/gemcitabine and 15.2 months in the MVAC arm (P=0.66).  Median PFS was 7.7 months 
with cisplatin/gemcitabine and 8.3 months with MVAC.  Several pro gnostic factors were noted in 
this study which correlated with overall survival.  These included performance status (>70), TNM 
stage (M0 v M1), low/normal alkaline phosphatase expression, number of sites of disease < 3, and 
the absence of visceral metastas es.  Ultimately, the toxicity profile of cisplatin/gemcitabine 
appeared to be more favorable, particularly from the standpoint of a lesser incidence of neutropenic 
fever and sepsis. Thus, most modern trials of first -line therapy for advanced urothelial can cer 
utilized cisplatin/gemcitabine as a base.   
 
2.4 Rationale  for the combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine with M6620 (VX -970) in 
advanced bladder cancer  
 
It is hypothesize d that M6620 (VX -970) may improve 
the ef ficac y of cisplatin and gemcitabine.  As previously 
described (see Section 2.1 ), cisplatin/gemcitabine 
represents a standard first -line regimen for metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma.   
 
Data supplied by Vertex Pharmaceutica ls suggests that 
M6620 (VX -970) appears to have in vivo synergy with 
cisplatin; Figure 1a outlines the activity of M6620 (VX -
970) with cisplatin in a cisplatin -resistant xenograft, 
while Figure 1b reflects the synergy  of cisplatin with 
M6620 (VX -970) in a non -small cell lung cancer PDX 
model.  In the context of bladder cancer, inhibition of 
Chk1 (a downstream mediator of ATR) may au gment the

15 activity of gemcitabine in the TCC -sup urothelial cancer cell line. (Wang et al 2014)   Notably, this 
synergy is optimal when M6620 (VX -970) is 
administered 24 hours after cisplatin or gemcitabine in 
cellular models (Vertex Pharmaceuticals; data o n file.)  
 
Furthermore, Vertex Pharmaceuticals evaluated the 
activity of M6620 (VX -970) in combination with 
carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine in a panel of 10 
bladder cancer cell lines.  Synergy o r antagonism was 
calculated using the sum of AUC difference for each 
combination in each cell line.  Synergy (AUC of greater 
than 7.5) was seen when M6620 (VX -970) was 
combined with carboplatin (in 5/10 lines), cisplatin (in 
7/10 lines), and gemcitabine (i n 3/10 lines). In the rest 
of the cell lines tested, additivity was observed. These 
results are summarized in Figure 2 . (data on file, Vertex 
Pharmaceuticals)  
 
Collectively, these data provide rationale to investigate 
cisplatin and gemcitabine in combinati on with M6620 
(VX-970) in metastatic urothelial carcinoma.  
This protocol proposes  a randomized, phase II study comparing cisplatin and gemcitabine with 
M6620 (VX -970) to cisplatin and gemcitabine alone.  A phase I trial is ev aluating the M6620 (VX-
970) monotherapy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   Integrated in this phase I experience is a dose escalation 
portion for the combination of M6620 (VX -970) with gemcitabine, and a further dose escalation 
of the combination of cisplatin, gemcitabine and M6620 (VX -970).  It has been hypothesize d that 
M6620 (VX -970) may optimally synergize with cytotoxic therapy if delivered in a latent fashion 
– therefore, this current study will evaluate  M6620 (VX -970) one day following cytotoxic 
treatment (i.e., on days 2 and 9 on a conventional 21 day cycle of cisplatin with gemcitabine).  
 
3. PATIENT SELECTION

3.1.5 At least 12 months have elapsed since platinum -based peri-operative treatment . 
 
3.1.6 Age ≥18 years.   
 
Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of M6620 (VX -
970) in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine  in patients <18 years of age, children 
are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials . 
 
3.1.7 Karnofsky ≥ 70% (ECOG performance status 0-1, see Appendix A ). 
 
3.1.8 Life expectancy of greater than  3 months  
 
3.1.9 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

− AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal  
− creatinine clearance  ≥50 mL/min  by either measured (using the Cockcroft -
Gault, MDRD or CKD -EPI formula) or calculated 
clearance  (i.e. GFR) (See Appendix C for formulas)  
 
3.1.10  The effects of M6620 (VX -970) on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this 
reason and because  DNA -damage response (DDR) inhibitors  as well as other therapeutic 
agents used in this trial may have  teratogenic potential, women of child -bearing potential 
and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth 
control; abstinence) prior to study en try and for the duration of study participation.  Should 
a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is 
participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  Men 
treated or enrolled on this prot ocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to 
the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620 
(VX-970) administration.  
 
3.1.11  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent do cument.  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
3.2.1 Radiotherapy within 4 weeks  of protocol therapy.   
 
3.2.2 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

17 3.2.3 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic 
composition to M6620 (VX -970), cisplatin, or gemcitabine.  
 
3.2.4 M6620 (VX -970) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant 
administration with strong inhibitors  or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided.  Because 
the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a 
frequently -updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid  or minimize use of.  
Appendix B  (Patient Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be provided to 
patients.  As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be 
counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications 
need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over -the-counter medicine or 
herbal product.  
 
3.2.5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, u nstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or 
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.6 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 (VX -970) as a DNA -
damage response (DDR) inhibitor may have  the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient 
effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants 
secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620 (VX -970), breastfeeding should be 
discontinued if the mother is t reated with M6620 (VX -970).  These potential risks may also 
apply to other agents used in this study.  
 
3.2.7 Patients with ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy .  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
NIH policy requires that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations be 
included in all NIH -supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving NIH -defined 
clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale and justific ation establishes to the 
satisfaction of the funding Institute & Center (IC) Director that inclusion is inappropriate with 
respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research.  Exclusion under other 
circumstances must be designated by the Director, NIH, upon the recommendation of an IC 
Director based on a compelling rationale and justification.  Cost is not an acceptable reason for 
exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources.  Women of childbearing 
potential shou ld not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research.  Please see

4.2 Site Registration  
 
This study is supported by the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
19 Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this 
protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office 
before they can be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site  registration status in the CTSU 
Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether a site 
has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to  the following : 
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization  
• A valid IRB approval  
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements  
 
In addition, the site -protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active r egistration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572  
 
An active status on a participating roster at the registering site.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by the CIRB for this study are not 
required to submit IRB approval documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office. For sites using 
the CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB an d applied to the RSS in an 
automated process.  Signatory Institutions must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local 
Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The 
CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then comm unicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for 
the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -
approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are participating in the study.

4.3 Patient Registration  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
21 4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment and randomization will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient 
Enrollment Network (OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users 
on a 24/7 basis.  It is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster 
data interchange and with the  Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for 
retrieval of patient registration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered 
by Registrars in OPEN / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data 
management system, Medidat a Rave.  
 
For trials with slot reservation requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment 
initiation to check slot availability.  Registration staff should ensure that a slot is available 
and secured for the patient before completing an enrollment.  
 
• Site staff with the appropriate roles will reserve slots using IWRS ( https://open.ctsu.org/ ).  
• City of Hope Cancer Center will receive notification via the IWRS when a slot has been 
reserved. An email will be sent from the City of Hope Can cer Center to the site requesting 
further information such as: the patient initials, tumor type and potential start date. The 
spot will show as ‘pending approval’ in the system until the site sends a REGISTRATION 
FORM/ELIGIBILITY CHECKLIST (see CTSU websit e) accompanied with the signed 
consent, baseline labs, pathology report, CT/x -ray reports to the City of Hope Cancer 
Center at ccc@coh.org  for review and confirmation of eligibility.  
• Once the Registration has been revi ewed, the City of Hope Cancer Center will either 
approve or disapprove the request depending on confirmation of patient eligibility. If 
approved, the City of Hope Cancer Centre will update the spot to ‘reserved’ in IWRS.  
• The site can now enroll the pati ent into the study in OPEN  
* At the time of registration the treatment arm will be randomly assigned  
 
The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and 
the randomly assigned treatment information.   Please print this confirmation for your 
records.   
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requirements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account ( i.e., CTEP username and password).  
• To enroll patients or request slot reservations:  Be on an ETCTN Correspon ding or 
Participating Organization roster with the role of Registrar.   Registrars must hold a 
minimum of an AP registration type.  If a DTL is required for the study, the 
registrar(s) must also be assigned the OPEN Registrar task on the DTL.   (Note: A 
DTL is NOT required for this study.)  
• To approve slot reservations or access cohort management:  Be identified to 
Theradex as the “Client Admin” for the study.  
• Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their site.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
22 Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS, site staff should verify the following:  
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes.  Site 
staff should use the  registration forms provided on the CTSU web site as a tool to 
verify eligibility.  
• If applic able, all patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form.

is available on the Theradex website:  
http://www.theradex.com/clinicalTechnologies/?National -Cancer -Institute -NCI-11.  This 
link to the Theradex website is also on the CTSU website OPEN tab. For questions about 
the use of IWRS for slot reservations, contact the Theradex Helpdesk: 609 -619-7862 or 
Theradex main number 609 -799-7580; CTMSSupport@theradex.com . 
 
4.4 General Guidelines  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 7 days.  Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient does not 
receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study may be 
canceled.  The Study Coordinator sh ould be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treat ment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks 
are described in Section  7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6 .  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be 
administered with the intent to treat the pat ient's malignancy.  
 
Eligible patients will be randomized on either on Arm A or Arm B in OPEN ;  in order for 
randomization to be completed, the following information will be required:  (1) KPS and (2) 
visceral metastases (present or absent).  
 
Arm A – Cisplat in/Gemcitabine with M6620 (VX -970) 
 
Arm B – Cisplatin and Gemcitabine  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
23 Please note that the dosing for the combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine with M6620 (VX -970) 
will utilized the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) from an ongoing phase I trial combining t hese 
agents ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The preferred dosing of cisplatin and gemcitabine are 60 mg/m2 and 875 
mg/m2 on day 1 and days 1/8, respectively, of a 21 day cycle.  This dosing regimen reflects other 
randomized, phase II studies employing a CG backbone (e.g., [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  M6620 (VX -970) 
at 90 mg/m2 will be administered on days 2 and 9 of the 21 day cycle intravenously, as follows:

NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
24 5.1.1 M6620 (VX -970) 
 
Prophylactic or supportive care regimens will be  administered in accordance with those 
established in [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. See Appendix E . 
 
M6620 (VX -970) should not come in contact with  0.9% Sodium Chloride due to 
incompatibility.  5% dextrose in water solution must be used for IV line priming and 
flushing.  Infuse using an infusion set containing low -sorption , or non -PVC, DEHP -free 
tubing and an in -line 0.2 micron filter.  
 
5.1.2 Cisplatin  
 
The antiemetic regimen is at the discretion of the treating physician and according to 
institutional standards.  Hydration before and after cisplatin should be rendered as per 
institutional standards (including use of mannitol and addition of sodium, potas sium or 
other electrolytes to intravenous fluids).   
 
5.1.3 Gemcitabine  
 
No pre -medications are required for gemcitabine therapy.  
 
 
5.1.4 Growth factor support  
 
Prophylactic  use of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim on day 9 of each cycle is encouraged but 
not mandated.  I f patients develop neutropenia or other neutropenic complications and 
remain on protocol -based treatment, then filgrastim or pegfilgrastim use beginning on day 
9 of each cycle is mandated. Dosing of these agents should follow institutional policies.  
 
5.2 Gene ral Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
M6620 (VX -970) is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4); 
exposure to M6620 (VX -970) may be affected by concomitantly administered drugs that are strong 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4.  Because of the potential for drug interactions through 
CYP3A4, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter 
medications , or alternative therapies.  The Principal Investigator should be alerted if the  patient is 
taking any agent known to affect or with the potential for drug interactions.  The study team should 
check a frequently -updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid  or minimize use of.  
Appendix B (Patient Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be provided to patients.  
 
M6620 (VX -970) is a moderate inhibitor of P -gp and BCRP. Use caution when administered with 
substrates of P -gp and BCRP.  
 
M6620 ( VX-970) absorbs in the UV -visible radiation spectrum and is widely distributed including 
skin, so patients receiving M6620 (VX -970) should take protective measures to minimize sun 
exposure.   
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
25 To minimize the possibility of phlebitis, M6620 (VX -970) should be administered through a large -
bore catheter or port into a large -caliber peripheral vein.  The intravenous infusion site should be 
monitored closely for the development of erythema, induration, purulence, tenderness, or warmth.  
 
In the event of i nfusion reaction, the investigator may use dexamethasone 8 mg (or equivalent) 
intravenous 30 minutes prior to infusion and/or diphenhydramine 25 mg intravenous or oral 30 
minutes prior to infusion.   
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays  due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 6 cycles  or 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to  withdraw from the study, or  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
• Pregnancy  
 
5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed for up to 36 months  after removal from protocol therapy  or until death, 
whichever occurs first.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event . 
 
For patients who have not progressed at the time that they are removed from treatment will be 
followed for progression;  for those who begin another treatment prior to progression, the  type of 
treatment will be recorded, as well as the time to 1st progression.  
 
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria  apply:  
• Follow -up for 36 months after removal from protocol therapy  
• Withdrawal of consent for further follow -up 
• Death   
 
The reason for protocol therapy termination and study removal and the date s the patient was 
removed must be documented in the Case Report Form.

reduced by 1 dose level. If gemcitabine has already been reduced by 1 dose level, 
discuss further dose reduction with principal investigator. Granulocyte colony 
stimulating factors m ay be used at the discretion of the treating physician; however, 
growth factors should be not used during cycle #1 or in lieu of recommended dose 
reductions . Treatment with M6620 (VX -970) will also be HELD until patients meet 
criteria to resume dosing with  gemcitabine and cisplatin.

*Treatment held on Day 8 should not be made up at a later date ; resume next cycle as 
scheduled with gemcitabine reduced by 1 dose level.  
 
There should be no dose re -escalation after a dose reduction.  
 
 Febrile neutropenia  
 
If febrile neutropenia develops in a given  cycle, hold gemcitabine, cisplatin, and M6620 
(VX-970) during febrile neutropenia.  
 
NOTE : Doses missed on Days 8 of therapy will not be made up.  
 
Resume gemcitabine and cisplatin at one dose lower than the dose administered in the last 
cycle. This dose should be used for all subsequent cycles. The dose of M6620 (VX -970) 
will be unchanged. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be used at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Other Treatment Related Non-Hematological Toxicity 
Secondary to Gemcitabine or Cisplatin  
 
Dose reductions for non -hematologic toxicities attributable to gemcitabine or cisplatin 
(with the exception of alopecia or nausea/vomiting not optimally managed with 
antiemetics) are outline d in the table below. Only the drugs felt to be contributing to the 
toxicity per the Treating Physician should be dose reduced. Patients with treatment -related 
nausea that is grade ≥ 2 despite optimal use of antiemetics will be dose reduced by 1 level.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
28 If nonhematologic toxicity occurs mid -cycle, and is attributed to gemcitabine, the Day  8 
gemcitabine dose should be held and resumed with the subsequent cycle as scheduled.

Dose re -escalation after a dose reduction for non -hematologic toxicity should not occur 
without discussion with the Study Investigator.  
 
If toxicity is specifically attributable to cisplatin and warrants discontinuation of cisplatin, 
patients may b e considered for continuation on treatment with gemcitabine and M6620 
(VX-970) but this must be discussed with the Study Investigator.  
 
Treatment may be delayed for up to 7 days.  If more than 7 days, this must be discussed 
with the Study Investigator.   
 
6.3 Dose Modifications for M6620 (VX -970) 
 
Dose reductions for toxicities attributable to M6620 (VX -970) (with the exception of 
alopecia or nausea/vomiting not optimally managed with antiemetics) are outlined in the

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following 
list of AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Secti on 7.2 ) will determine 
whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System 
(CTEP -AERS) in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
7.1 Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List(s) (CAEPRs)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by body system.  In addition to the comprehensive list,  a subset of AEs, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text.  The SPEER is a list of events that are protocol -specific 
exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI 
Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm  for furthe r clarification.  
 
NOTE :  The highest grade currently reported is noted in parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  
Report ONLY AEs higher than this grade expeditiously.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination 
protocol using multiple investigational agent s and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the 
lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
M6620 (VX -970) (NSC 780162)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comp rehensive list, a subset, the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is 
identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to  expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.canc er.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification  The CAEPR does not provide frequency data; refer to the Investigator's 
Brochure for this information.  Below is the CAEPR for M6620 (VX -970). 
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to 
the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple

7.1.2.2  Cisplatin  
 
Renal:  A dose -related cumulative renal tubular injury can occur.  Adequate hydration 
and diuresis usually minimize the risk.  Salt -wasting nephropathy and/or orthostatic  
hypotension with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism can occur in up to 10% of 
patients.  
 
Neurologic:   A dose -related ototoxicity, manifested by high -frequency hearing loss and 
tinnitus, occurs in about 30% of patients.  Paresthesias, decreased  vibratory, position, 
and touch sensations are less common, particularly  at cumulati ve doses < 400 mg/m2. 
 
Hematologic:   Mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occur in 25 -30% of patients but 
is rarely dose limiting. Anemia is less common.  A potentially fatal hemolytic uremic 
syndrome has been reported.  
 
Gastrointestinal:   Severe, dose -limiting nausea and vomiting occur in almost 100% of 
patients unless adequate antiemetic prophylaxis is given. Even with successful 
prophylaxis of acute nausea, a delayed (72 -96 hour) reaction may occur, requiring 
additional therapy.  Anorexia and taste chang es may also occur.  
 
Hypersensitivity:   Allergic reactions are reported in up to 20% of patients. Symptoms 
include: rash, facial edema, wheezing, hypotension, and tachycardia. Severe 
anaphylaxis is rare.  
 
Extravasation:  Extravasation can occur with cisplati n administration.  
Treatment should be per institutional policy on extravasation.  
 
Other:   Raynaud’s phenomena and digital ischemia has been described.  
 
Rare complications are alopecia, seizures, loss of taste, allergic reactions and loss of 
muscle or nerve function.  Tetany may occur due to hypomagnesinemia and/or 
hypocalcemia. Other electrolyte disturbances may occur.  
  
At high doses patients have experienced optic neuritis, papilledema, cerebral blindness, 
blurred vision and altered color perception.   Patients have experienced cardiac 
abnormalities, elevated SGOT and rash. Subsequent courses should not be given until 
serum creatinine returns to normal, if elevated.  Audiometric analyses should be 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
34 monitored and courses withheld until auditory acuity is  within normal limits.  The 
occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in patients treated with 
anthracycline/alkylator combination chemotherapy.  Cisplatin can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman.  In mice, cisp latin is terat ogenic and 
embryogenic. No information is available on the excretion of this drug in human milk.  
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for 
serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is recommended that nursing be  
discontinued.  
 
Please refer to the approved package labeling for complete toxicity information.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criter ia for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized until March 31, 2018 for AE reporting.  CTCAE version 5.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting beginning April 1, 2018 .  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE versi on 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can 
be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent  that are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1.1 ) should be reported through CTEP -AERS only if the 
grade is above the gr ade provided in the SPEER.  
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in 
section 7.3.4 . 
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the s tudy treatment.  
 
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.1 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site ( https://eapps -
ctep.n ci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the 
“NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD 
(CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web 
site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below ( Section 7.3.3 ). 
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
35 In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24 -hour notification is to be 
made to CTEP by telephone at 301 -897-7497.  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in m ust be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by the 
original submitter at the site.  
 
7.3.2 Distribution of Adverse Event Reports  
 
CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator and A dverse Event Coordinator(s) (if 
applicable) of the Corresponding Organization or Lead Organization, the local treating 
physician, and the Reporter and Submitter.  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for other 
e-mail recipients.  
 
7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelin es 
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting, regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease Progression ” 
under the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions .”  
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associa ted with a 
disease process) should be submitted.  
 
 
Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse 
Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Administration 
of the Investigational Agent/Interv ention 1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR 
Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse 
Events, whether or not they are considered related to the investigational 
agent(s)/int ervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalizatio n for ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
36 they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA,  21 CFR 
312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL  SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to 
the NCI via electronic submission within the timeframes detailed in the table below.  
Hospitalization Grade 1 and Grade 2 Timeframes  Grade 3 -5 
Timeframes  
Resulting in 
Hospitalization  
≥ 24 hrs  10 Calendar Days  
24-Hour 5 Calendar 
Days  Not resulting in 
Hospitalization  
≥ 24 hrs  Not required  
NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found 
in the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR.  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be submitted electronically within 
24 hours of learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 
calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submi tted 
electronically within 10 calendar days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of 
investigational agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite 
require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 
radioactive half -lives, rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was 
last administered.  Footnote “1” above applies after this rep orting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
 
7.3.4 Additional Protocol -Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions  
 
N/A 
 
7.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
expeditiously through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
37  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents.  AEs are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during 
the trial using Medidata Rave.  For this trial the Advers e Event CRF is used for routine AE 
reporting in Rave.  
 
7.5 Secondary Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., treatment 
with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is 
not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to describe  
the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE reporting 
unless otherwise specified.  
 
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational or commercial 
agents administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1 . 
 
8.1 CTEP IND Agent(s)  
 
8.1.1  VRT -0768079, MSC2527093A, VX -970NSC 780162  
 
Chemical Name:  5-(4-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl) -3-(3-(4-
((methylamino)methyl)phenyl)isoxazol -5-yl)pyrazin -2- amine  
 
Classification : ATR inhibitor     CAS Registry Number: 1232416 -25-9 
 
Molecular Formula: C24H25N5O3S                 M.W. : 463.55  Da 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
38  
Mode of Action : Ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3 -related (ATR) kinase is an apical regulator 
of checkpoint pathways triggered by DNA damage.  The DNA damage response (DDR) is regulated 
by ATR kinase and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which are recruite d to distinct DNA 
damage structures.  M6620 (VX -970) disrupts ATR -mediated DNA damage response signaling and 
leads to sustained accumulation of DNA damage in cancer cells co -treated with DNA -damaging 
agents.  
 
Description: The drug substance for M6620 (VX -970) is the free base.  
 
How Supplied: M6620 (VX -970) is supplied b y Merck KGaA/EMD Serono, Inc. and distributed by 
the Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI as single -use 200 mg vials containing 
a sterile solution ( 20 mg/mL).  M6620 ( VX-970) solut ion for injection  is a yellow liquid  
formulated in 20% betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium (w/v)  and 86 mM acetate buffer, 10 mL total 
volume, supplied in clear glass vials in cardboard boxes with foam inserts.  
 
Preparation:  M6620 ( VX-970) solution for injecti on must be diluted  with 5% dextrose  in water 
solution  prior to administration.  Do not use 0.9% Sodium Chloride due to incompatibility with 
M6620 ( VX-970).  To prepare the infusion  solutio n add the dose volume of M6620 (VX -970) to a 
non-polyvinyl chloride (non -PVC), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) -free EVA infusion bag 
containing  5% dextrose in water.  Gently invert the IV bag 5 -10 times to mix the solution.  Confirm 
the solution is clear and free of precipitates and/or particulates.   The final concentration must  be 
between 0.075  mg/mL to 1  mg/mL .  Place the IV bag into an opaque cover to protect from light.   
 
Storage: Store intact vials  protected from light  inside cardboard boxes at room temperature, 25°C 
(77°F), with excursions all owed between 15 and  30°C  (59 and  86°F) .   
 
If a storage temperature excursion is ide ntified, promptly return M6620 (VX -970) to between 
15 and  30°C  and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including 
documentation of temperat ure monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of suitability.  
 
Stability: Stability testing of the intact vials is on -going .  Prepared solutions must be protected from 
light and used within 4 hours from time of preparation if stored at room temperature or 24 hours if 
stored refrigerated (2 -8°C).  
 
Route  of Administration:  Intravenous ( IV) infusion.  
 
Method of Administration : Prior to administration the sol ution should be given one hour at ambient 
temperature to warm up if stored refrigerated following preparation. Infuse over 60 minutes using an 
infusion set  containing low -sorption or non -PVC, DEHP -free tubing and  an in -line 0.2  micron filter .  
5% dextrose in water  solution must be used for IV line priming and flushing.  M6620 ( VX-970) 
should not come in contact with 0.9% Sodium Chloride due to incompatibility.  The infusion time 
may be extended beyond 60 minutes (as tolerated) but no more than 90 minutes  if standard 
procedures to limit symptoms of an infusion reaction are insufficient or if the total volume of the 
infusion exceeds 600 mL.  To minimize the possibility of phlebitis, M6620 (VX -970) should be 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
39 administered through a large bore catheter into a larg e caliber peripheral vein or central venous 
access.  
 
Patient Care Implications: Monitor for infusion site reactions, irritation, and phlebitis.  M6620 
(VX 970 ) absorbs in the UV -visible radiation spectrum and is widely distributed including skin, 
so patients receiving M6620 ( VX-970) should take protective measures to minimize sun 
exposure.  
 
Women of childbearing potential and men should use appropriate contracep tion while on study 
drug and for 6 months after discontinuation of M6620 (VX -970).  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:  M6620 ( VX-970) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.  M6620 
(VX-970) has a low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, and a moderate 
potential to reversibly inhibit CYP2E1.  The potential for M6620 ( VX-970) to induce CYP450 
enzymes is low.  Concom itant administration with strong  inhibitors or inducers of CYP 3A4 should 
be avoided.  
 
M6620 (VX -970) is a weak/moderate inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A14, UGT1A9, UGT2B15, and 
UGT2B17.  UGT2B7, UGT1A3, and UGT1A6 were weakly or not inhibited.  M6620 (VX -970) 
is predicted to not inhibit significantly the metabolic clearanc e of SN -38 (active metabolite of 
irinotecan) at therapeutic exposures.   
 
M6620 (VX -970) is a moderate inhibitor of P -gp and BCRP.  Use caution when administered with 
substrates of P -gp and BCRP transporters.  
 
8.1.2 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
 
8.1.2.1  NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the eligible participating Investigator s (or 
their authorized designee) at each participating institution.  The CTEP -assigned 
protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents.  
The respon sible investigator at each participating institution must be registered with 
CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of 
Investigator), Biosketch, Agent Shipment Form , and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  
If there are several pa rticipating investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead 
investigator at that institution.  
 
In general, sites may order initial agent supplies when a subject is being scre ened for 
enrollment onto the study.   
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shipping designees 
and ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order 
Processing (OAOP) application.  Access to OAOP re quires the establishment of a 
CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an 
“active” account status and a “current” password , and active person registration status .  
For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or acco untability, call or email PMB 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
40 anytime.  Refer to the PMB’s website for specific policies and guidelines related to 
agent management.   
 
8.1.2.2  Agent Inventory Records – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the 
investigator, must maintain a caref ul record of the receipt, dispensing and final 
disposition of all agents received from the PMB using the appropriate NCI 
Investigational Agent (Drug) Accountability Record (DARF) available on the CTEP 
forms page.   Store and maintain separate NCI Investigat ional Agent Accountability 
Records for each agent, strength, formulation and ordering investigator on this 
protocol.  
 
8.1.2.3  Investigator Brochure Availability  
The current versions of the IBs for the agents will be accessible to site investigators 
and research staff through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) 
application.  Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and 
Access Management  (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” account 
status and a “current” password , and active person registration status .  Questions 
about IB access may be directed to the PMB IB coordinator via email.

Action:  Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly by nucleoside kinases to the active 
diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. The cytotoxic e ffect of 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
41 gemcitabine is attributed to a combination of 2 actions of the diphosphate and the 
triphosphate nucleosides, which leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. First, gemcitabine 
diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsible for cat alyzing the 
reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis. Inhibition of 
this enzyme by the diphosphate nucleoside causes a reduction in the concentrations of 
deoxynucleotides, including dCTP. Second, gemcitabine triphosphate competes with 
dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP 
(by the action of the diphosphate) enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate 
into DNA (self -potentiation). After the gemcitabine nucleotide  is incorporated into DNA, 
only 1 additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands. After this addition, there 
is inhibition of further DNA synthesis. DNA polymerase epsilon is unable to remove the 
gemcitabine nucleotide and repair the growing DNA  strands (masked chain termination).  
 
Availability:  Commercially available and FDA approved for pancreatic cancer. Also, 
recently approved for locally unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer in 
combination with cisplatin.  
  
Storage : Unopened vials of Gemzar are stable until the expiration date indicated on the 
package when stored at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). When 
prepared as directed, Gemzar solutions are stable for 24 hours at controlled room 
temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). Discard unused portion. Solutions of reconstituted 
Gemzar should not be refrigerated, as crystallization may occur.  
 
Reconstitution : The recommended diluent for reconstitution of Gemzar is 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection without p reservatives. Due to solubility considerations, the 
maximum concentration for Gemzar upon reconstitution is 40 mg/mL. Reconstitution at 
concentrations greater than 40 mg/mL may result in incomplete dissolution, and should be 
avoided.  
 
To reconstitute, add  5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to the 200 -mg vial or 25 mL 
of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to the 1 -g vial. Shake to dissolve. These dilutions each 
yield a gemcitabine concentration of 38 mg/mL which includes accounting for the 
displacement volu me of the lyophilized powder (0.26 mL for the 200 -mg vial or 1.3 mL 
for the 1 -g vial). The total volume upon reconstitution will be 5.26 mL or 26.3 mL, 
respectively. Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will provide 200 mg or 1 g of 
gemcitabine, respec tively. The appropriate amount of drug may be administered as 
prepared or further diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to concentrations as low 
as 0.1 mg/mL.  
 
Reconstituted Gemzar is a clear, colorless to light straw -colored solution. After 
reconst itution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, the pH of the resulting solution lies 
in the range of 2.7 to 3.3. The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
and discoloration, prior to administration, whenever solution or container permi t. If 
particulate matter or discoloration is found, do not administer. Gemzar should be 
administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 1000  or 875 mg/m2 (depending on  Arm) 
over 30 minutes.  
NCI Protocol #:  9947

Administration : Gemzar should be administered by intravenous in fusion over 30 
minutes.  
 
Product description and storage:  Gemcitabine will not be provided by the PMB and 
should be obtained from commercial sources. Gemcitabine is commercially available in 
vials containing either 200 mg or 1 g of gemcitabine HCl (expres sed as free base) 
formulated with mannitol (200 mg or 1 g, respectively) and sodium acetate (12.5 mg or 
62.5 mg, respectively) as a sterile lyophilized powder. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium 
hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The recommended  diluent for 
reconstitution of gemcitabine is 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection without preservatives. 
Due to solubility considerations, the maximum concentration for gemcitabine upon 
reconstitution is 40 mg/mL. Reconstitution at concentrations greater than 4 0 mg/mL may 
result in incomplete dissolution, and should be avoided. When prepared as directed, 
gemcitabine solutions are stable for 24 hours at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C 
(68° to 77°F). Solutions of reconstituted gemcitabine should not be ref rigerated, as 
crystallization may occur. Please refer to the commercial package insert for complete drug 
information.  
 
8.2.2 Cisplatin  
 
Drug Name:  Cisplatin  
Other: Platinol (NSC -119875); Cis -diamminedichloroplatinum  
 
Classification : Aklylating agent  
 
Action:  Cisplatin forms covalent bonds with nucleophilic sites on guanine present in all 
DNA. As cisplatin is a bifunctional agent, it is able to bind to 2 sites in a DNA strand. This 
results in the formation of inter - and intra - chain cross -linkings, whic h interferes with 
cellular transcription and replication. Regulatory mechanisms detect the abnormal DNA 
and so activate a chain of responses to try and correct it. This, ultimately, causes cell death 
(apoptosis).  
 
Availability:  Cisplatin is commercially av ailable.  
  
Storage : Cisplatin Injection is a sterile, multi -dose vial without preservatives. Store at 
15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F). Note: Do not refrigerate. Protect unopened container from light. 
The cisplatin remaining in the amber vial following initial en try is stable for 28 days 
protected from light or for 7 days under fluorescent room light.  
 
Reconstitution : The aqueous solution should be used intravenously only and should be 
administered by IV. Cisplatin is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. Appropriat e 
precautions for hazardous drug handling should be taken during handling, preparation, 
administration and disposal of this agent. As with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling the aqueous solution. Skin reactions assoc iated 
with accidental exposure to cisplatin may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
43 cisplatin contacts the skin or mucosa, immediately and thoroughly wash the skin with soap 
and water and flush the mucosa with water.  
 
Administration : Cisplatin will  be administered IV according to institutional guidelines.  
 
Hydration  
Hydration for cisplatin can be administered at the discretion of the treating physician and 
according to institutional standards.  
 
Product description and storage:  Cisplatin will not b e provided by the PMB and should 
be obtained from commercial sources.  Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (Platinol or 
cisplatin) is a heavy metal complex and is water soluble. It is a white lyphilized powder 
with a molecular weight of 300.1.  Cisplatin is avail able as 50mg/50ml and 100mg/100ml 
multi -dose vials. Each ml also contains 9mg sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or 
sodium hydroxide is added to adjust the pH.   The intact vials may be stored at room 
temperature ( 15° - 25°C ), protected from light, for  the lot life indicated on the package.  
Do not refrigerate. The solution may be further diluted in a chloride -containing vehicle 
such as D5NS, NS, or D5 -1/2NS (precipitate occurs in D5W)  and stored at room 
temperature for up to 24 hours.  Cisplatin should  be given immediately after preparation as 
slow intravenous infusion over 60 minutes.  Needles or intravenous sets containing 
aluminum parts that may come in contact with cisplatin (Platinol) should not be used for 
preparation or administration, as a black  precipitate is formed within 30 minutes.  Please 
refer to the approved package labeling for complete prescribing and toxicity information.  
 
9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
The proposed randomized phase II study offers ample opportunity to understand biomarkers of 
response to the combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine with M6620 (VX -970).  Alteration of p53 
will be investigated as a potential biomarker for response.  Cells deficient in p53 may potentially 
rely more heavily on ATR -mediated checkpoint signaling in the face of DNA damage (Reinhardt 
et al 2007).  Data from The Cancer Genome A tlas (TCGA) investigators suggest that p53 genomic 
alterations (either homozygous deletion or mutation) occur in roughly 52% of patients (TCGA 
Investigators 2014).  While previous prospective clinical studies have shown little predictive 
capability of p53 immunohistochemistry, there is preclinical data to suggest that inhibition of the 
ATR pathway may be more active in the setting of p53 mutation (Liu et al 2015).  The same studies 
identify even more potent inhibition in patients with mutations in both p53 and p21.   We therefore 
propose p53 mutation as a post -hoc stratification factor in our study, and we will retrospectively 
assess p21 as well.  ATM, a distinct mediator of double -stranded DNA break repair, and -H2AX, 
a surrogate for DNA damage, will also be explored as putative biomarkers of M6620 (VX -970) 
response (Wang et al Oncogene 2014).  We will develop patient -derived xenograft (PDX) models 
in collaboration with the UC Davis PDX Development and Trial Center (UM54CA233306, C -X 
Chong, PI).   To generat e these models, fresh tissue will be collected prior to initiation of therapy 
and at the time of resistance.  In this manner, detailed studies can be performed to better understand 
in vivo the development of ATR -inhibitor resistance.  
Given evidence suggest ing the role of ERCC2 mutation in modulating response to platinum -based 
therapies, this phenomenon will be assessed as well (Van Allen et al 2014).  
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
44 Finally, we will obtain limited pharmacokinetic samples in all patients to explore relationships 
between ex posure to M6620 (VX -970) (and gemcitabine), and toxicity or efficacy.  
 
9.1 Integrated Laboratory Studies  
 
9.1.1 Cytidine Deaminase (CDA) phenotype  
 
Cytidine Deaminase (CDA) phenotype will be correlated with gemcitabine PK parameters 
observed.  
 
9.1.1.1  Collection of Specimen s 
Blood samples to be obtained through a peripheral or central line blood draw. Samples should be 
drawn from the opposite arm if infusion is a peripheral infusion. Samples should NOT be drawn 
from the infusion line.  
 
A single serum tube will be collect ed prior to dosing (NO THU added !!!), (e.g. BD vacutainer 
367812 plastic 13x75 4.0 mL tube) . 
 
9.1.1.2  Handling of Specimens  
-Allow the blood to clot for 30 min at room temperature  
-Centrifuge at 1800 x g for 10 min  
-Freeze 2 serum aliquots at -80 C until shipment on dry -ice / analysis.  
 
9.1.1.3  Shipping of Specimens  
See Pharmacokinetics section below.  
 
9.1.2 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Gemcitabine PK (D1  and D 8, with baseline assessment ) will be correlated with toxicity 
observed, and response.  
 
M6620 (VX -970) PK (D 0, 2, 4, 9, 11 ) will be correlated with toxicity observed, and response  
performed, and  possibly to add to the present knowledge base of M6620 (VX -970) PK by means 
of incorporation into a population pharmacokinetic model to be developed across studies.  
 
9.1.1.4  Collection of Spec imens  
 
Blood samples to be obtained through a peripheral or central line blood draw. Samples should be 
drawn from the opposite arm if infusion is a peripheral infusion. Samples should NOT be drawn 
from the infusion line.  
 
EDTA Vacutainer tubes shall be pre pared by addition of THU solution to prevent ex vivo 
degradation of gemcitabine:  
 
Prepare a stock solution of tetrahydrouridine (THU) at 10 mg/mL (may be frozen  for up to a 
year).  THU can be added to Vacutainer tubes up to several days in advance without causing 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
45 significant loss of vacuum  (no more than 7 days, and keep in fridge) .  Using a 3/10 cc insulin 
syringe or  other similar sized syringe with a fine needle, draw up 10 μL of the THU solution for 
each 1 mL of blood to be drawn and transfer it to a Vacu tainer tube by piercing the stopper.  Do 
not draw up THU solution for more than one tube at a time.  You will not be able to control the 
volume of THU solution that leaves the needle, as it is sucked out by the vacuum.  Because of 
the fine needle, you will  not lose the vacuum (apart from the volume added) in the collection 
tube.

9.1.1.5  Handling of Specimens  
 
Document exact start and stop times of each infusion and exact times of blood draws.  
 
Vacutainer tubes shall be inverted several times to mix blood with EDTA anticoagulant and 
placed on ice. Processing should begin within 20 minutes of collection. Samples should be 
centrifuged for 10  min at approximately 1000 x g in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge so as to 
produce plasma.  
 
The resulting plasma should be aspirated from the tubes, placed into appropriately -labeled 
microcentrifuge tubes, and stored at -70 °C.

NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
48 9.2.2.2  Handlin g of Specimens: At least 24 hours prior to the biopsy, the research coordinator 
is to notify the institutional research team involved in this protocol, of the scheduled 
sample collections. A laboratory technician s hould prepare cryomolds prior to the 
biopsy, by labeling them, using the provided alcohol -proof marker, with the following 
information:  
 
Clinical protocol number  
Specimen ID  
Biopsy time and Date  
 
The laboratory technician should arrive at the biopsy co llection site at least 15 min 
ahead of the scheduled biopsy to allow sufficient time to set up laboratory supplies and 
ensure rapid transport of specimens to the laboratory after collection. He should also, 
immediately before the biopsy, fill the insulated  bucket with dry ice and isopentane.  
 
Immediately after the biopsy is performed, the freshly collected specimen should be 
placed in the cryomold. A single drop of Tissue Tek™ OCT should be placed on the 
specimen, and the sterile tweezers should be used to  gently hold one end of the freshly 
collected needle biopsy and to push the biopsy to the bottom of the cryomold cassette 
with forceps. Make sure biopsy is as flat as possible. The cryomold should then be 
filled with OCT, and the cryomold should be immedia tely placed in direct contact with 
the dry ice/isopentane cocktail until the bottom of the OCT freezes and turns white. 
Only the bottom of the cryomold should contact the dry ice/isopentane --none of the dry 
ice/isopentane should spill inside the cryomold i tself and contact the specimen.  
 
This process can be repeated using separate cryomold cassettes for separate biopsy 
samples.  
 
Once frozen, place cryomolds on dry ice for transport. The used isopentane should be 
poured back into its bottle using funnel.  
 
The cryopreserved biopsy should be stored at -80°C until shipment. After completion 
of each biopsy, the following information s hould be recorded:

Notes, inc luding any deviations from the standard operating procedure:  
 
PDX models will be generated using previously published methods (Lin T -Y et al 
2014).  Assessment of ATM P1981 and -H2AX will be performed via IHC using 
previously published methods (Wang et al  2014).   Importantly, these exploratory 
studies are being done on tissue derived from PDX models, not on primary patient 
derived tissues (where the persistence of labile phospho -moieties would be low).   
 
Shipping of Specimens: Specimens will be stored at UC Davis; if additional centers are 
chosen to participate in these correlative studies, these specimens will be shipped to 
UC Davis .  Ideally, shipment should occur on the same day as the biopsy, unless the 
biopsy occurs on a Friday, in which case the s pecimen should be preserved at -80°C 
until shipment on the following Monday.

first 6 months, and then every 12 weeks thereafter .  Response and progression will be evaluated in 
this study using the new international criteria proposed b y the revised Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the 
largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in 
the case of malignant l ymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with cisplatin/gemcitabine or cisplatin/gemcitabine with M6620 (VX -970).  
 
Evaluable for o bjective response.   Only those patients who have measurable disease present 
at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -
evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their 
respons e classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present a t baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based  on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm ( ≥2 cm) 
by chest x -ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  All 
tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated ar ea may be considered 
measurable.   
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 m m [0.5 cm]).  At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm [≥1 
to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
53 leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by C T 
or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple  cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend it self to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcu lated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in  the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter 
as assessed using cali pers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
54 by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for 
body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast,  spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and th e lesions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed 
as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT  PET-CT (or PET alone; e.g., 18FDG -PET) is not permitted in the cur rent study as 
a means of radiologic assessment .   
 
Ultrasound   Ultrasound is not permitted in the current study as a means of radiologic 
assessment.   
 
Tumor markers   As there are no reliable tumor markers for bladder cancer, tumor markers 
are not permitted as a means of disease assessment.  
 
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological l ymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (<1 
cm). 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
55 lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%,  the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm).  (Note:  the appearance 
of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increas e to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
11.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm [<1 
cm] short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target le sion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump ta rget lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status 
change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of 
the treating physician should prevail in such circumsta nces, and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until diseas e progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

accepted as disease progression.  
 
Note :  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease pro gression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from th e time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the tr eatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947

57 Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  (PFS)  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from randomization  to time of progression or death, 
whichever occurs first.   For patients who have not progressed at the time that they are removed 
from treatment  (for completion of 6 courses or reasons described in Section 5.3 ) will be followed 
for progression;  for those who begin anothe r treatment prior to progression, the  type of treatment 
will be recorded, as well as the time to 1st progression.  
 
11.1.7  Overall Survival  (OS)  
 
OS is defined as the duration of time from randomization  to death  from any cause.  Patients who 
have not died at the time of analysis, will be censored at the date of they were last documented to 
be alive.   
 
 
12. STUDY OVERSIGHT AND DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY 
REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7

12.2.2  Responsibility for Data Submission  
 
For ETCTN trials, it is the responsibility of the PI(s) at t he site to ensure that all 
investigators at the ETCTN Sites understand the procedures for data submission for each 
ETCTN protocol and that protocol specified data are submitted accurately and in a timely 
manner to the CTMS via the electronic data capture s ystem, Medidata Rave.   
 
Data are to be submitted via Medidata Rave to CTMS on a real -time basis, but no less than 
once every 2 weeks.  The timeliness of data submissions and timeliness in resolving data 
queries will be tracked by CTMS.  Metrics for timeliness will be followed and  assessed on 
a quarterly basis.  For the purpose of Institutional Performance Monitoring, data will be 
considered delinquent if it is greater than 4 weeks past due.  
 
Data from Medidata Rave and CTEP -AERS is reviewed by the CTMS on an ongoing basis 
as data is received.  Queries will be issued by CTMS directly within Rave.  The queries 
will appear on the Task Summary Tab within Rave for the CRA at the ETCTN to resolve.  
Monthly web -based reports are posted for review by the Drug Monitors in the IDB, CTEP.  
Onsite audits will be conducted by the CTMS to ensure compliance with regulatory 
requirements, GCP, and NCI policies and procedures with the overarching goal of ensuring 
the integrity of data generated from NCI -sponsored clinical trials, as described in the 
ETCTN Program Guidelines, which may be found on the CTEP 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
)  and CTSU  websites.  
 
An End of Study CRF is to be completed by the PI, and is to include a summary of study 
endpoints not otherwise captured in the database, such as (for phase 1 trials)  the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and a description of any dose -limiting to xicities 
(DLTs).  CTMS will utilize a core set of eCRFs that are Cancer Data Standards Registry 
and Repository (caDSR) compliant ( http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/biomedical -informatics -
resources/interoperability -and-semantics/metadata -and-models ).  Customized eCRFs will 
be included when appropriate to meet unique study requirements.  The PI is encouraged to 
review the eCRFs, workin g closely with CTMS to ensure prospectively that all required 
items are appropriately captured in the eCRFs prior to study activation.  CTMS will prepare 
the eCRFs with built -in edit checks to the extent possible to promote data integrity.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
13.1.1  Study Design: This study will employ a randomized, phase II design in which patients 
who have no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic bladder cancer will be 
randomized 1:1 to receive either cisplatin/gemcitabine alone or cisplatin/gemcitabine with 
M6620 (VX -970).  Prior to randomization, patients will be stratified according the Bajorin 
risk category:  0=KPS≥80  and no visceral metastases; 1=KPS <80 or visceral metastases 
(but not both); 2=both KPS<80 and presence of visceral metastases.  Randomization will 
be done us ing a (stratified ) permuted block design with randomly varying block sizes.  
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
62  
A total of 90 patients will be enrolled and randomized; a single interim analysis will occur 
when 60% of  the expected events have been observed; toxicity will be monitored monthly  
and reviewed formally twice a year.  
 
13.1.2  Primary Endpoint: Progression -free survival (PFS) as defined in Section 11.1.6 . 
 
13.1.3  Secondary Endpoints: Response rate  (RR)  as defined in Section 11.1 , overall survival 
(OS)  as defined in Section 11.1.7 , and toxicity  graded according the CTCAE v4 .  
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine if PFS is improved with the addition of M6620 
(VX-970) to the combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine as compared to cisplatin/gemcitabine alone.  
Based on a meta -analysis including multiple trials of cisplat in-based chemotherapy, we estimate a 
median PFS of 5.3 months with cisplatin/gemcitabine (Galsky et al Cancer 2013).  With 90 patients 
accrued and 80 evaluable for this primary endpoint, we will have 90% power to detect an 
improvement in median PFS from 5. 3 months with cisplatin/ gemcitabine  alone to a median PFS 
of 10.1 months with cisplatin, gemcitabine and M6620 (VX -970) (i.e. a hazard ratio of 0.52) .  This 
assumes a 1 -sided α of 0.1 , exponential failure, and uniform accrual over 2 years with 9  additional  
months of follow -up – with 66 events at the time of the final analysis .   
 
The number of patients required for this study will be a low of ≈7 1 (if the  hypothesis that M6620 
(VX-970) is not active is true and the  trial is stopped at the time  of the interim  analysis) to a 
maximum of 90 (if the trial continues to completion).  
 
13.3 Study Monitoring and Interim Analysis  
 
13.3.1   Toxicity and Safety Monitoring   
 
The DCC (Data Coordinating Center) will review cumulative toxicities on a monthly 
basis .  Twice a year, the CCC (California Cancer Consortium) will prepare reports for the 
independent DSMC.   At these semi -annual reviews,  the two arms will be compared in 
terms of toxicities (by any type of Grade 3+ toxicity).  Those toxicities resulting in a  2-
sided p -value of 0.10 or less will be flagged for examination.  While there are no formal 
rules for stopping because of toxicities, based on these reviews, the protocol may be 
modified or even closed, after  discussion with CTEP.  
 
All deaths within 30 da ys of last treatment will be reviewed; all deaths due to treatment 
will be reviewed and compared across arms.  
 
13.3.2  Interim Analys is 
 
 As described above, under the alternative hypothesis that the addition of M6620 (VX -970) 
nearly doubles the median PFS, we ex pect 66 events after 24 months of accrual and 9 
additional months of follow -up.  In this setting,  we plan a single interim analysis after 40 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
63 events have been observed – which should occur after about 19 months of accrual  (if the 
hypothesis that M6620 (VX -970) is not active is true) .   Accrual will not be paused to wait 
for 40 events.  At the time of the interim analysis , we will use two rules to guide our 
decision to continue or halt accrual.  
• Stopping for futility:  The two arms will be compared using the logrank test.  If overall 
the Cisplatin/Gemcitabine+ M6620 (VX -970) PFS is not nominally superior to the 
Cisplatin/Gemcitabine arm and the  corresponding one-sided p -value is less than or 
equal to 0.50, then consideration will be given to stopping for fu tility  (Wieand S et al 
Statistics in Medicine 1994) . 
• Stopping for success:   The two arms will be compared using the logrank test.  If overall 
the Cisplatin/Gemcitabine+ M6620 (VX -970) PFS is superior to the 
Cisplatin/Gemcitabine arm and the corresponding one -sided p -value is less than (but 
not equal to ) 0.005, then consideration will be given to stopping for success , using the 
Haybittle -Peto approach (Peto R et al British Journal of Me dicine 1976).

13.4 Stratification Factors  
 
Prior to randomization, patients will be stratified according to the Bajorin risk category :  
0=KPS≥80  and no visceral metastases; 1=KPS <80 or visceral metastases  (but not both); 2=both 
KPS<80 and presence of visceral metastases .

13.5 Analysis of Results  
 
The outcome status (in terms of toxicity,  number of course begun,  amount of each of the planned 
drugs received  (and percent of planned) , reason off treatment, tumor response,  and progression  
and survival status ) of all randomized patients, will be reported.  All eligible randomized patients 
will be included in the primary analysis of progression -free survival and response. All toxicities 
experienced by patients who begin treatment will be reported.   
 
Toxicity .  All observed toxicities will be summarized in term s of type (organ affected or laboratory 
determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by the CTCAE v 5.0), and time of onset 
(i.e. course of treatment).  Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and side effects, 
overall  by arm and  by course.   Proportions and associated 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated for each arm separately and if indicated, for the difference between the arms.  The two 
treatment arms will be compared using Fisher’s exact test when the presence of toxic ities is 
dichotomized and by the Cochran -Armitage test for trend if all grade s are considered.  
 
Clinical Outcome .  PFS will be measured from the  day of randomization, until progression, death, 
or the start of another treatment .  In the primary analysis, patients who have not progressed, but 
who begin another treatment, will be censored at that time, for the measure of PFS ; in the 
secondary analysis, all patients who begin another treatment prior to progression on this protocol, 
will be followed for the firs t progression on the subsequent treatment .   PFS for each arm will be 
summarized with a Kaplan -Meier plot and 95% confidence intervals (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) ; 
the one -sided 0.10 -level logrank test will be used to compare the two arms . 
 
Overall surviva l, in which all patients will be followed until death (due to any c ause) or for 36 
months, will be summarized in a manner similar to PFS.   The overall response rate will be 
calculated as the ratio of the number of eligible randomized patients who experienced a confirmed 
CR or PR (by RECIST  v1.1) divided by the total number of randomized eligible patients who 
began treatment ; 95% confidence in tervals will be constructed.   Pearson chi -square test will be 
used to compare the two arms in terms of the overall response rate.  
 
Analysis of Potential Predictors of Response .  Archival tumor tissue will be analyzed for the 
presence of p53, p21, and ERCC 2 mutations.  It is expected that the majority of patients will 
provide adequate specimens for analysis – conservatively we will assume that 75% (or 30/arm) of 
the evaluable patients will provide specimens.    For each gene, each tumor will be coded as 1 
(having a mutation) or 0 (having no mutation) for that gene.  For each treatment arm separately 
and for each of the 3 indicators (one each for the presence of p53, p21, and ERCC2 mutations), 
the hazard ratio will be used to quantify the overall association between that gene and PFS.   The 
Cox proportional hazards model (assuming that the assumption of proportional hazards is not 
unreasonable – which i t should not be for PFS over the 1st year) will be used to estimate the 
interactions between the genes and PF S as well as the interaction between the treatment arm and 
each of the genes.   Although associations will be tested, it is possib le that that resulting p -values 
are not less than 0.05 simply due to small numbers.  Based on the TCGA project (see the Figure  
below) we would expect about 50% of tumors to harbor p53 mutations, 14% to harbor p21 
mutations, and 12% to harbor ERCC2 mutations;  with 30 specimens per arm, that should yield 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
65 about 15, 4, and 3 -4 tumors with mutations, respectively.   Nonetheless, thes e analyses will guide 
the design of future studies.  To analyze the patterns further, the association between more frequent 
specific mutations for each gene and PFS (as well as objective response) will be quantified with 
an estimate of the hazard ratio and  displayed with Kaplan -Meier plots.   
 
 
 
For patients treated at UC Davis, every attempt will be made to obtain fresh tumor biopsies prior 
to start of treatment as well as at the time of progression.  The primary purpose of these biopsies 
is to develop PD X models.   While the goal is to obtain as many models as possible, even one new 
model will be useful for future studies.  Practically speaking we expect that 4 -6 patients  will 
provide matched specimens.  Tissue from these biopsies will also be analyzed fo r changes in ATM 
activation and γH2AX .    
 
13.6 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.6.1  Evaluation of Toxicity  
 
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment on their 
respective arm .  
 
13.6.2  Evaluation of Response  
 
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death 
from toxicity , 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note:  By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the e ligibility criteria (with the exception of those who received 
no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients 
in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a treatment failure (disease 
progression).  T hus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result 
in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 
will be protocol specific.   A secondary analysis will be undertaken which will include  all 
patients who are e valuable for objective response  (as defined in Section 11.1 ).  The 95% 
confidence intervals should also be provided.  
 
14. CCC POLICIES FOR MONITORING CONSORTIUM TRIALS  
 
This protocol is monitored at  several levels, as described in more detail below.   To 

NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
66 summarize:   The trial PI has access to the data at all times.   The CCC Data Coordinating Center 
reviews accrual and toxicities monthly.   An external, independent DSMC reviews the study 
progress twice yearly.   In addition,  for Phase I trials or the Phase I portion of a trial, the PI  will 
have monthly - and as needed - conference calls with study investigators to review accrual, 
progress, and any unforeseen issues.   Dose escalation/expansion/de -escalatio n decisions require 
sign-off by the PI  (or his designee) and the study statistician (or designee).   During the Phase II 
trial or a Phase II portion o f a trial, the PI  will have quarterly - and as needed - conference calls 
with study investigators to revie w accrual, progress, and any unforeseen issues.   Decisions to 
proceed to the second stage of the Phase II trial  will require sign -off by the study PI and the  trial 
statistician.  
 
The protocol principal investigator (PI) is responsible for monitoring the co nduct and progress of 
this Phase II trial, including the ongoing review of accrual, data and toxicities, as well as the 
accumulation of reported adverse events from other trials testing the same drug(s).  The 
participating clinicians and their designees ar e responsible for timely submission of adverse event 
reports (see Section 7 ) and case report forms.  The Data Coordinating Center for the CCC 
Consortium is responsible for providing the PI with access to the submitted case report form data 
in summary and detail in a timely fashion.   Although the PI is responsible for evaluating the 
cumulative reported adverse events and the impact that these have on the continued conduct of the 
trial, it is the Data Coordinating Center of the CCC that distributes all submitted SAE reports to 
the appropriate individuals, including the local protoc ol principal investigators, at each of the 
participating institutions.   
 
The Data Coordinating Center posts a summary (accrual, toxicities, and responses) of each CCC 
initiated trial on the CCC website.  In this way, each PI has access to up-to-date information on 
the status of his or her trial.  In consultation with the collaborating statistician, the PI is responsible 
for review of the toxicities and therapeutic endpoints referred to in the statistical plan.  
 
The Data Coordinating Committ ee meets monthly to review data management and data quality 
issues – completeness of data submissions as well as accuracy in terms of built -in, computerized 
logic checks.  Any issues identified and the corrective plans are presented to the Internal 
Committ ee and at the next CCC teleconference meeting for review and approval.  
 
14.1 Oversight  
 
Oversight of the conduct of CCC trials occurs at several levels:  
 
1. The Data Coordinating Center for the CCC flags all trials that are approaching a decision 
in terms of toxic ity (for both Phase I and Phase II trials) or responses (for Phase II trials).  
Decisions are made by the PI with input from the statistician and discussion with the 
principal investigator of the funding mechanism or his or her designee, and are 
communicat ed to the participating centers by the CCC Data Coordinating Center. At the 
monthly teleconferences, the accrual of each open protocol is reviewed.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9947  
Version Date:  August 25, 2020  
 
67 2. For CTEP sponsored Phase I trials, data are reported to the NCI -designated clinical trials 
monitoring servi ce (CTMS) which will audit patients’ records on each protocol – at each 
CCC institution; this audit is initiated by CTEP.   
 
3. An independent CCC DSMC will review CCC trials every 6 months. This DSMC will 
consist of 6 voting members (3 medical oncologists or  hematologists involved in Phase I/II 
cancer clinical trials but not participating in CCC studies, a patient representative and a 
statistician) and a non -voting CCC statistician.   
 
a. DSMC meetings will take place twice a year.  Additional meetings will be convened if 
necessary.  
 
b. This DSMC will review each CCC trial in terms of accrual, toxicity/safety, and 
adherence to trial design, audit results, and likelihood of successful completi on.   
 
c. The DSMC will report to the CCC leadership.

Please show this paper to all your healthcare providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse 
practitioners, pharmacists), and tell them you are taking part in a clinical trial sponsored by the  
National Cancer Institute.  
 
These are the things that your healthcare providers need to know:  
M6620 (VX -970) interacts with specific enzyme s in the liver or other tissues like the gut and 
certain transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of the cell. 
 
 Explanation  
CYP 
isoenzymes  The enzyme in question is CYP3A4 .  M6620 (VX -970) is metabolized by 
CYP3A4 and may be affected by other drugs that inhibit or induce this 
enzyme.   
Protein 
transporters  The proteins in questions are  P-gp and BCRP .  M6620 (VX -970) is a moderate 
inhibitor of these proteins and may affect drugs that are moved in and out of 
cells/organs by these transport proteins.  
 
These are the things that you need to know:  
The study drug  M6620 (VX -970),  may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. 
For this reason, it is very important to tell your doctors about all your medicines, including: (a) 
medicines you are taking before  this clinical trial, (b) medicines you start or stop taking duri ng 
this study , (c) medicines you buy without a prescription (over -the-counter remedy) , (d) herbals 
or supplements (e.g. St. John’s Wort) . It is helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated 
medication list with you.  
 
Before you enroll onto the cl inical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health 
care providers to review any medicines and herbal supplements that are considered strong 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and substrates of P -gp and BCRP.  
 
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may 
contain ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctors or 
pharmacist to determine if there could be any side effects.  
• Make sure your doctor kn ows to avoid certain prescription medications.  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or 
call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any 
medicine.

FOR PHII -135 (NCI# 9947)  
 
Title: A Randomized Phase 2 Trial of Cisplatin/Gemcitabine with or without M6620 (VX -970) 
in Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma  
 
Blood samples to be obtained through a peripheral or central line blood draw. Samples should be 
drawn from the opposite arm if infusion i s a peripheral infusion. Samples should NOT be drawn 
from the infusion line.  
EDTA Vacutainer tubes shall be prepared by addition of THU solution to prevent ex vivo 
degradation of gemcitabine:  
 
Prepare a stock solution of tetrahydrouridine (THU) at 10 mg/mL  (may be frozen). THU can be 
added to Vacutainer tubes up to several days in advance without causing significant loss of 
vacuum.  Using a 3/10 cc insulin syringe or other similar sized syringe with a fine needle, draw up 
10 μL of the THU solution for each 1 mL of blood to be drawn and transfer it to a Vacutainer tube 
by piercing the stopper.  Do not draw up THU solution for more than one tube at a time.  You will 
not be able to control the volume of THU solution that leaves the needle, as it is sucked out b y the 
vacuum.  Because of the fine needle, you will not lose the vacuum (apart from the volume added) 
in the collection tube.  
 
Day 1 and day 8 of cycle 1 (all patients)  
EDTA anti -coagulated blood samples will be obtained at the following timepoints:  
25 (±5 ) min after start of gemcitabine infusion = 5 min before end gemcitabine 
infusion  
 
Day 2 and day 9 of cycle 1 (ARM A patients only)  
EDTA anti -coagulated blood samples will be obtained at the following timepoints:  
55 min (±5 min) after start of M6620 (VX -970) infusion = 5 min before end M6620 
(VX-970) infusion  
 
Day 4 and day 11 of cycle 1 (ARM A patients only)  
EDTA anti -coagulated blood samples will be obtained at the following timepoints:  
47 h (±3 h) after end of M6620 (VX -970) infusion  
 
Handling of Specimen s 
 
Document exact start and stop times of each infusion and exact times of blood draws.  
 
Vacutainer tubes shall be inverted several times to mix blood with EDTA anticoagulant and placed 
on ice. Processing should begin within 20 minutes of collection. Samples should be centrifuged 
for 10 minutes at approximately 1000 x g in a refrigerated table top centrifuge so as to produce 
plasma.  
 
The resulting plasma should be aspirated from the tubes, placed into appropriately -labeled 
microcentrifuge tubes, and stored at -70 °C.

Preparing the shipment  
*Samples should be stored in cardboard boxes (5 1/8” x 5 1/8” x 2”, LxWxH).  
*Please organize the samples by Patient  and time point in the box.  
*Do not store in plastic bags (they break on dry -ice and labels will detach).  
*A copy of each of the pharmacokinetic sample collection forms for the respective patients or a 
sample list should be included with each shipment. To prevent problems with illegible writing on 
tubes, consider numbering them and numbering samples on the sample sheet.  
*Note the study number, PI, and the drugs used/to be measured.  
*A name, phone number and email address should be included with samples so t hat receipt can be 
acknowledged.  
*Please notify the lab by telephone (412 -623-3248) or fax (412 -623-1212) at least 24 hours prior 
to shipment.  
 
Shipping  
*All samples should be shipped via overnight express courier in insulated containers with enough 
dry ic e to maintain the samples in a frozen state (if samples are to be shipped frozen).  
All specimens are to be shipped on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday to:  
 
Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility

78 APPENDI X E SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES FOR M6620 (VX -970)  
 
To minimize the possibility of phlebitis, M6620 (VX -970) should be administered through a large 
bore catheter into a large caliber peripheral vein. The intravenous infusion site should be monitored 
closely  for the development of erythema, induration, purulence, tenderness, or warmth.  
 
If any subject develops phlebitis, or signs or symptoms of inflammation that may progress to 
phlebitis or that the patient cannot tolerate, standard measures should be employed to ameliorate 
these symptoms (including removal of the infusion catheter and resumption of infusion through a 
different vein).  
 
Based on the observation of acute hypersensitivity in 3 subjects at various doses of M6620 (VX -
970) and of pruritus in 2 subjects at 480 mg/m2 of M6620 (VX -970), pre -medication with a 
corticosteroid and an antihistamine may be considered for all subjects receiving M6620 (VX -970) 
(to prophylax against possible acute hypersensitivity), and is strongly recommended for subject s 
receiving doses of M6620 (VX -970) above 240 mg/m2 (to prophylax against pruritus). In addition, 
corticosteroids and antihistamine should be used for treatment of subjects that develop acute 
hypersensitivity or pruritus after M6620 (VX -970) infusion, and should be used prophylactically 
as pre -medication for all subjects who develop acute hypersensitivity or pruritus with M6620 (VX -
970) infusion and who continue to receive treatment with M6620 (VX -970). 
 
Corticosteroid and antihistamine combinations that ma y be used include: 100 mg to 200 mg 
hydrocortisone intravenously approximately 60 minutes (± 15 minutes) before M6620 (VX -970) 
infusion, and either 10 mg of chlorphenamine or 25 mg of diphenhydramine intravenously 
approximately 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) be fore M6620 (VX -970) infusion. Alternative 
antihistamine and steroid doses, timing, routes of administration, and agents may be considered, 
as long as not prohibited by protocol. In addition, treatment with an H2 -blocker (e.g., ranitidine) 
may be considered  for subjects not responsive to a regimen with an H1 blocker.  
 
If standard procedures to limit symptoms of injection site reaction, or pruritus or acute 
hypersensitivity are insufficient, then the infusion time may be extended beyond 60 minutes, but 
no mo re than 90 minutes.

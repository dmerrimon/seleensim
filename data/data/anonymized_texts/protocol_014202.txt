 1 INTRODUCTION 
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive, irreversible 
and largely asymptomatic vision loss caused by optic nerve damage, which is most commonly associated with elevated levels of intraocular pressure. Glaucoma is a chronic condition that progresses slowly over long periods of time and can have a devastating impact on a patient's vision and quality of life.  Reducing intraocular pressure currently is the only proven treatment for 
glaucoma.  
Treatment for open -angle glaucoma (OAG) traditionally has started with 
topical ocular hypotensive medical therapy.  Development of more effective medications has increased the popularity of this approach as initial treatment compared to more invasive incisional or drainage device surgery. Furthermore, the more benign medica tion treatments preserve the ocular 
tissues in the event that more invasive surgical approaches are eventually required. 
The various topical ocular medications available to reduce IOP include 
miotics, β -adrenergic receptor antagonists (β -blockers), carboni c anhydrase 
inhibitors (CAIs), α -adrenergic receptor agonists (α -agonists), and 
prostaglandin analogues (PGA s).  The PG As are a class of ocular hypotensive 
agents that have been proven effective in lowering IOP in subjects with OAG or OHT.  Other a dvantage s of this class of medications is that the systemic 
side effects associated with α -agonists (e.g., dry mouth, drowsiness) 
and  β - blockers (e.g., depression, fatigue, bradycardia) do not appear to be 
associated with PG As.  Furthermore, the ocular side effe cts typically 
associated with a-agonists (e.g., allergic reactions), and cholinergic agents (e.g.,  reduced  vision), do not seem to manifest with the use of PGA s. 
However , PGAs have been shown to be associated with side effects such as 
ocular hyperemia, iris hyperchromia, periorbital atrophy, increased eyelash 
growth, general ocular surface discomfort and headache.
1-5 These side effects 
and other factors including cost, compliance, and the difficulty of proper 
instillation , can sometimes  hinder the proper us e of topical medications.6,7 
Some patients may possess or develop an intolerance to topical medications  or 
the preservatives in their formulations . 
The Travoprost Intraocular Implant was developed to remove or minimize the issue of patient compliance with topical hypotensive medication.   This clinical 
protocol wi ll evaluate the second cycle of the Travoprost Intraocular Implant:   
Model G2TR- .  
This implant ha s the potential for providing important benefits to patients. The 
long duration of drug therapy provided by the implant avoids the problem of 
compliance with topical ocular hypotensive medications.  In addition, the 
small clear corneal incision required for  implantation and the minimally 

 CONFIDENTIAL   page 10 of 35 
 invasive implant size avoids some of the complications of more invasive 
surgical procedures for treating glaucoma.  
 Model G2TR -  has been investigated in clinical trials conducted in 
(Phase 1 /2) as well as the United States (Phase 2  and Phase 3 ).  The 
results from the U.S. Phase 2 trial have demonstrated that the Model G2TR-
 implant ha s long- term IOP-lowering effects and is also generally well -
tolerated by study subjects.  These results support the continued evaluation of 
the implant model in this clinical trial.   
2 OBJECTIVE  
The study objective is to evaluate the safety of the surgical exchange 
procedure of Travoprost Intraocular Implant in subjects with  a previously 
implanted Travoprost Intraocular Implant .   
3 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a prospective, non-randomized, open- label, multi- center, single arm, 
clinical trial of the safety of the exchange of the Travoprost Intraocular 
Implant in subjects who were previously implanted with the Travopros t 
Intraocular Implant in the GC-009 study (1st Cycle) .  Approximately  
 will be enrolled into thi s study and will be followed through 12 
months postoperative.   
  
Screening Procedure:  
After providing informed consent, prospective subjects will be evaluated 
against the S creening criteria.  At Visit 1 (Screening), all subjects must meet 
all entry criteria.  
Subjects who qualify at Visit 1 (S creening ) may be scheduled for Visit 2 
(Operative Exchange Day 0 ) on a separate day.   
The eye previously implanted with a Travoprost Intraocular Implant in the 
GC-009 study (study eye) will be  assessed at Visit 1 (S creening ).  The subject 
may then be scheduled for study treatment.   Subjects will be trea ted 
unilaterally, only the implanted eye (study eye) will go through the study 
treatment.  The fellow eye will be treated outside the parameters of the study 
per investigator discretion using their standard of care options.

6 Month 3 Post-Exchange (91 days ± 14)  
7 Month 6 Post-Exchange  (182 days ± 30)  
8 Month 12 Post-Exchange ( 365 days ± 3 0) 
 
At Visit 2 ( Operative Exchange Day 0) , subjects will have the first implant 
which was inserted in Study GC-009 exchanged with a second G2TR -  
implant.   
 
At Visit 1 (Screening) , IOP can be measured at any time.  At all other 
scheduled visits, Day 10 Post-Exchange, Week 4 Post- Exchange, Month 3 
Post-Exchange, Month 6 Post- Exchange, and Month 12 Post- Exchange) , IOP 
measurements will be taken once daily  at the same  time  as screening ± 60 
minutes .  Study follow- up will continue until Visit 8 (Month 12 Post-
Exchange ), after which subjects will be exit ed from  the study. 
 
3.1  Discussion of Study Design  
This prospective, non-randomized, open- label, multi- center, single arm, 
clinical trial intends to perform an exchange procedure on approximately

 6.2.3 CRITERIA FOR EARLY STUDY EXIT  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.  The 
investigator may elect to discontinue any subject for reasons unrelated to the study product.  Details of a subject’s exit from the study should be recorded in the subject’s clinical records.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study may be repla ced.  Subjects exited after signing the 
informed consent form and prior to study completion will be handled as 
follows: 
 
6.2.3.1 Prior to Implantation 
Subjects will be ineligible  for the study if they fail to meet eligibility 
criteria ( Section 6.2) , if they withdraw consent, or if study enrollment 
goals have been met.  
 
6.2.3.2 After 2
nd Cycle Implantation 
Subjects may be exited (discontinued) from the study in the event of a condition that may cause them harm if participation were to be continued.  Subjects may also withdraw voluntarily.    
6.2.3.3 Lost to Follow- up 
Subjects who miss postoperative study visits and cannot be contacted 
within a reasonable timeframe via letter or telephone, will be 
considered lost to follow-up.  The site will make at least three attempts to contact the subject via telephone.  If unsuccessful, the site will send a letter to the subject.  The letter will request the subject to  contact and 
return to the study site.  If the subject does not contact the site within a 
week after the letter was received, he/she will be considered lost to follow-up, and the site will send a second letter to notify the subject of study exit due to lac k of response to the telephone calls and first 
registered letter.  A Study Exit CRF may then be completed for the subject.  
 All attempts to contact the subject (including telephone call logs, copies of letters) must be documented and maintained with the subject’s study source documentation. 
 
6.2.4 STUDY TERMINATION 
The study may be terminated by Glaukos at any time following appropriate notification to the study site and subjects.

 8.5 Safety Analyses 
8.5.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events (AEs) in the study eye will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) nomenclature. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) are defined as those AEs that occur after the initial treatment at Visit 2 (Operative Exchange Day 0) .   
AEs that occur on the date of the procedure are classified as either intra -
operative or post- operative. Post-operative AEs are considered to be TEAEs. 
Intra-operative AE s and TEAEs will be summarized separately and presented  
in separate listings .  
A line listing of serious adverse events will be provided. 
 
8.5.2 OTHER SAFETY MEASURES  
Details of analyses for other saf
 ety measures (see Section 5.2) will be  provided
 
in the SAP.  
 
8.6 Inter
im Analyses 
N
o interim analyses are planned.  
 
9 ADVERSE EVENTS   
An Adverse Event ( AE) is defined as any untoward and unintended medical 
occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness) that 
occurs in a study subject, regardless of the suspected cause during the study. Adverse events will be clearly documented on the study source document and 
monitored throughout the course of the study.   
Events occurring after signing the informed consent but prior to the implant o 
procedure should be documented in the medical history.  Events observed during or after the initial implant or exchange procedure until the final study visit, are to be recorded as AEs if they are in the study eye and deemed related to the implant or procedure.  
Any clinically significant change in a subject's condition after receiving the 
study treatments , regardless of causality, is to be considered an adverse event, 
unless the change is determined to be a continuation of a pre- existing 
condition that is documented in the subject's medical history.  If an adverse 
event occurs,  an AE form must be completed.   
 CONFIDENTIAL   page 25 of 35 
 An AE includes any of the following:  
• An exacerbation or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a 
pre-existing condition, including intermittent or episodic conditions 
• New conditions or illnesses detected or diagnosed after the implant procedure 
• A suspected interaction with any  of the study treatments  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
any of the study treatments or a concomitant medication  
• Any clinically significant laboratory finding that was not present prior to 
receiving any of the st udy treatments  
An AE does NOT  include any of the following: 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of any pre -existing conditions, 
including the disease under study (OAG and OHT). 
• Medical or surgical procedure, (e.g., colonoscopy or hernia repair).  The condition that led to the procedure may be an AE, if not present in medical history. 
• Hospitalizations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social o r convenience admission to the hospital). 
• Pre-existing co nditions or diseases that were present before receiving any 
of the study treatments that do not worsen or that are chronic but stable 
• Changes in a chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural 
disease progression.  (These medical conditions should be adequately 
documented).   
• Lack of efficacy of the study treatment for the condition being investigated.   
 
AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported in detail as indicated on the CRF:  
Mild : easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with normal everyday activities  
Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL   page 26 of 35 
 The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be determined by the 
investigator using the following explanations: 
 
Definitely Unrelated : the event is clearly related to other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Unlikely Related : the event is most likely produced by other factors such as 
the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject ; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the study medication  
 
Possibly Related : the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication; but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Probably Related : the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and /or follows a known 
response pattern to the study medi cation; and is not likely 
to have been produced by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Definitely Related : the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence f rom 
the time of drug administration; and follows a known response pattern to the study medication; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
9.1 Serious Adverse Event  
Serious adverse events are defined as any findings that suggest a significant 
hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  Any adverse event is considered a serious adverse event if it results in any of the f ollowing outcomes: 
- Death  
- Life- or sight- threatening  
- Required admission to the hospital or prolongation of an existing hospitalization  (emergency room visits that do not result in admission 
to the hospital should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes) 
- A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 CONFIDENTIAL   page 27 of 35 
 The terms “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” are measures of intensity; thus a 
severe AE is not necessarily serious.   For example, nausea of several hours 
duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening,  or 
require admission to the hospital may be considered a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  A life -threatening event is any 
event that places the subject at substantial risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  A sight -threatening event is any event that 
places the subject at risk of permanently losing vision in either eye as a direct result of the event. 
 
Serious adverse events must be reported to Glaukos immediately (preferably within 24 hours of knowledge of the event ). 
Email:   
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is obtained, t
he investigator should inform Glaukos as soon as possible.  
Depending on the nature of the AE, Glaukos may request copies of the ophthalmic and medical record s of the subject.  If the subject was hospitalized  
for a study- treatment related serious adverse event, a copy of the discharge 
summary must be forwarded to Glaukos as soon as possible. 
 
9.2 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adve rse event is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed, or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or protocol.   
Unexpected adverse events must be reported to Glaukos immediately 
(preferably within 24 hours of knowledge of the event).    Email:   
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is 
obtained, t
he investigator should inform Glaukos as soon as possible.  
Depending on the nature of the AE, Glaukos may request copies of the ophthalmic and medical record s of the subject.  If the subject was hospitalized  
for a study- treatment related unexpected adverse event , a copy of the 
discharge summary must be forwarded to Glaukos as soon as possible.

 9.3 Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, Adverse Reaction  (SUSAR)  
A Suspected , Unexpected , Serious, Adverse Reaction  (SUSAR) is a ny AE for 
which there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
Travoprost Intraocular Implant and the AE, and which is assessed as both unexpected and serious.  An unexpected adverse reaction, i.e. any untoward and unintended response to any o f the study treatments , is one for which the 
nature and severity is inconsistent with the applicable reference safety 
information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure).  
 
9.4 Adverse Events  Follow- up 
Adverse events will be followed and documented until the time of c omplete 
resolution, or resolution with sequelae, or exit from the study with an assessment of the outcome.

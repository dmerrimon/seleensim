Chapter 1  INTRODUCTION  
 
 Background and Rationale  
As advancements in technology continue, we propose the  use of the inControl Diabetes 
Management Platform for this protocol. It remains a smartphone -based, artificial pancreas 
platform that automatically controls insulin delivery with an advisory system that generates real -
time recommendations for meals, basal rates, bolus calculations and exercise decisions.  This 
cloud based system provides real -time monitoring as well as retrospective analysis on data. The 
data generated are stored at an inControl Cloud permitting the research team and support 
networks to observe blood glucose values in real -time if needed. T he insulin dosing strategies 
used in this device are the same strategies currently used in DiAs. This system is identical to the system approved by the FDA in IDE G150221/S002.  
 In 2009 we initiated one of the first NIH studies dedicated to engineering and  clinical testing of 
closed -loop control (CLC) of type 1 diabetes. Since then, we have achieved key milestones and 
derived conclusions which enabled further research in this rapidly growing field. Notably, we proposed the idea that the artificial pancreas  is not a single all -in-one device but a network 
encompassing the patient in a digital treatment ecosystem that can offer and alter different treatment modalities in real time  depending on the patient’s clinical state.  
This new notion was reflected in: (1)  Our modular engineering design of CLC algorithms, which 
now allows various treatment modalities to be initiated and swapped without interruption; (2) The Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) – the first portable CLC hub using a smart phone to run control 
algorithms and specifically designed to be operated by the patient, which is now used in a 
number of  outpatient studies in the U.S. and in Europe, and (3) The Unified Safety System (USS 
Virginia) – the first CLC algorithm engineered to adapt its mode of operation during the course of 
every night , first mitigating after -dinner hyperglycemia and then sliding the patient to a target 
morning glucose of 120mg/dl, thereby resetting his/her metabolic state for a new day.  
 Using these technologies, we now propose to compare i n a randomized cross -over trial the long-
term efficacy of three treatment modalities –   
 SAP=sensor -augmented pump only  
 USS+SAP (d)=SAP during day and CLC starting at dinner and continuing overnight  
 USS+CLC (d)=24 -hour Day and Night Closed Loop Control  
 We plan to randomize up to 110 patients with type 1 diabetes into two different treatment 
sequences:  
Group A  following the sequence SAPUSS+SAP(d) USS+CLC(d) USS+SAP(d) , and  
Group B  following the sequence USS+SAP(d) USS+CLC(d) USS+SAP(d) SAP.  
These trea tment modality sequences are presented in the figure below, and are color coded to 
match the color -coding of active control modules relevant to each treatment modality presented 
in Figure 1:

 Figure 1: Design of One 11 -month Study Session   
Each treatment modality will continue for 8 weeks –  sufficient time to address the following 
specific aims:    
SA1: Dinner/Night CLC achieved by USS+SAP(d) will be superior to SAP alone in terms of: 
(1) Improved HbA1c without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia; (2) Reduced incidence 
and risk for hypoglycemia overnight, and (3) Reduced fear of hypoglycemia and improved 
diabetes quality of life scores.  
SA2: CLC during the day  achieved by  USS+CLC(d) will preserve the benefits of USS+SAP(d) 
and will be superior to USS+SAP(d) in terms of: (1) Increased time within target range of 70-180mg/dl during the day; (2) Reduced risk for hypogly cemia , particularly  during and 
after exercise, and (3) Reduced postprandial glucose variability.  
SA3: CLC system acceptance evaluated by  individual structured interviews and technology 
acceptance scores will be: (1) Superior, for USS+SAP(d) compared to SAP  alone, i.e. adding 
USS in the evening and overnight will increase patients’ acceptance of CLC, and (2) Marginally inferior, for USS+CLC(d) compared to USS+SAP(d); i.e. some patients would 
prefer SAP alone during the day due to perceived increased system c omplexity.  
 
 Preliminary Studies  
This protocol benefits from extensive study of the Artificial Pancreas system with over 184,000 
hours of clinical use with various component structures.  
Two recent trials present examples particularly relevant to the proposed clinical studies:  
Efficacy and Safety of Overnight CLC in Children and Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes (UVA and 
Stanford):  In 2013, we tested USS Virginia to determine its overnight safety and efficacy in a 
summer- camp setting: 20  subjects were randomized to CLC using DiAs or SAP (sensor -augmented 
pump), completing 54 CLC and 52 SAP nights. On nights when DiAs was active for at least 6h, the 
median time spent in range was 73% for CLC vs. 55% for SAP, p=0.012. Less time was spent below 
70mg/dl on CLC vs.  SAP, p<0.001; there were  no hypoglycemic episodes below 60mg/dl on CLC .  
Figure 2  presents the data distributions on CLC vs. SAP across several BG ra nges. The study 
concluded that USS Virginia is effective in improving time spent in range, as well as reducing nocturnal hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in a summer camp setting.

Overnight Control in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes (UVA and Univ. of Padova):  In this study, 10 
subjects spent 5 nights on USS Virginia vs. 5 nights on SAP, in random order. CLC resulted in over 
30mg/dl lower average BG and over 25% higher time within target range. The mean morning BG 
on CLC was 119.3mg/dl; thus the USS performed exactly to its design specification– reset BG t o 
120mg/dl by 7AM (Figure 3).

Overnight glucose correlated with glucose control on the next day, r=0.52, p<0.01; peak BG and BG variability during the day (USS inactive) were improved after CLC nights as well. Details are given in the table below.   
Main Outcomes of this Study  Sensor -Augmented Pump  Closed -Loop Control P-value

Percent time below 70mg/dl  1.56%  0.55%  0.06 
These results support the significant glycemic benefits of using USS Virginia overnight and indicate strongly 
that control during days following well -controlled nights is correspondingly improved. Thus, evaluation of 
this system is warranted in long- term clinical trials with outcomes gauged by accepted metrics of glucose 
control.  
 
 Study Objective  
Overall, we expect to establish that a distinct overnight CLC modality  (USS Virginia) combined 
with SAP therapy during the day is a viable precursor to future adaptable therapeutic schemes, 
achieving glycemic control that is superior to SAP alone and optimal balance between system complexity and perceived benefits.  
 
 Closed -Loop Control System 
A general description of the Artificial Pancreas Platform devices identified be low will be used in 
the Closed -Loop Control System .  New generations of CGMs and insulin pumps with embedded 
inControl- AP could become available for inclusion in this trial and could be used providing these 
new developments do not change the core functiona lity of the system.  
 For the inControl Platform,  (see Figure 4 -Panel A) : 
• inControl Diabetes Management Platform – a smart -phone Artificial Pancreas medical 
platform;  
• CGM  – study CGM  connected to the AP using low power Bluetooth communication 
protocols;   
• Insulin Pump – insulin pump connected to AP system  via wireless Bluetooth .   
• Remote Monitoring Server connected to inControl Cloud  via 3G or local Wi -Fi network, 
and 
• Modular Closed -Loop Control Algorithm Running on the AP system , which is of Control -
to-Range (CTR) class  
 
We have successfully completed a pilot study of the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control -IQ 
Technology. This pilot study included 5 adults  (mean HbA1c 6.5%) using the system between 36 -
48 hours , and  was successfully complete d with  86% mean time in target range of 70 -180 mg/dL  
and 2.8% median time below 70 mg/dL. The system maintained connectivity 98% of the intended

time in closed -loop. Given the positive results from this pilot study , we now plan to incorporate 
t:slim X2 with Control -IQ Technolog y in this protocol  as well. 
 
For the Tandem- G6 configuration,  (see Figure 4 -Panel B) : 
The Closed -Loop Control System contained in t -slim X2 with Control- IQ Technology is described in 
Master File MAF -2032/A003 and has been approved in G170255 and G170267 . Control -IQ 
Technology is derived from inControl previously described in IDE# G160097,  G160181, G150240 
and G140169/S010. The CLC is an “artificial pancreas” (AP) application that uses advanced closed 
loop control algorithms to automatically manage blood glucose levels for people with Type 1 Diabetes. The system modulates insulin to keep blood glucose in a targeted range. The system components include the t:slim X2 with Control -IQ Technology and the Dexcom CGM G6  (Fig. 4 -B).

 Protocol Overview  
 Sample Size  
Up to 110 adult subjects age ≥18 to <70 years old will be enrolled so that approximately 76 
subjects complete the entire study at University of Virginia, allowing for up to 31% attrition rate due to the duration of the study protocol) .  
 
 Protocol Summary  
For the proposed studies, the AP system will be deployed with different functionalities at different stages of the trial, resulting in variation in what the subject will be responsible for and what the system will drive. A trial outline is contained in Figure 1  and visits detailed in Figure 5 .

CGM Run -in Phase:   Study participants will begin with a maximum 2 week run -in period during 
which they will have a CGM (i.e. sensor- augmented pump therapy or CGM+CSII) but otherwise be 
on their usual diabetes management with re spect to BG monitoring, pump basal rates, insulin -to-
carbohydrate ratios and correction factors. This is necessary because some of the study 
participants will not have had experience with CGMs in the past.  
Study Pump Run- in Phase:  All subjects will have a  run-in period on the study pump of up to two 
week duration. Subjects who have had prior experience with the study pump may either skip this run-in phase or may require a shorter run -in period depending on their proficiency with the study 
pump.  
Sensor -Augm ented Pump (SAP) Therapy:  During this phase, the subject is on the study CGM and 
their personal insulin pump. There are no predictive or control algorithms. The subjects will administer basal and bolus insulin using their usual home insulin parameters.  
 Study Phases with the AP System  
AP system Run -In Phase : Subjects who have not had recent use of the system (more than 
approximately 2 weeks of use in the past 6 months or more than 2 months of use in the past year) will complete an up to 2 -week home use peri od with the full system in pump only (open 
loop) configuration where no closed loop algorithms are activated. Subjects who have had prior experience with the system as defined above will not be required to do Visit 5.  
 
USS+SAP (d):  USS Virginia plus SAP d uring the day (d). Subjects will be using the study pump and 
CGM with the AP system in Pump mode (open loop only, no closed loop algorithms running). The 
subject will activate the USS Virginia Closed -Loop Control as early as pre -dinner but is expected to 
activate CLC by bedtime.  The subject will continue in Closed -Loop Control until the time of 
awakening in the morning. The USS will monitor CGM and insulin -on-board data and predicts the 
patient’s risk of hypoglycemia and adjust insulin delivery accordingly .  
 
USS+CLC (d): USS Virginia and Closed Loop Control over 24 hours. This arm will test fully -
integrated closed- loop control (CLC) system.  When hypoglycemia is predicted, the USS reduces 
basal rate insulin to prevent hypoglycemia, or issues an alert that signals that carbohydrates are 
required to treat hypoglycemia. The USS also generates alerts about correction bolus requests that are considered potentially dangerous, or meal bolus requests that require user approval prior to delivery.

 Informed Consent, Eligibility Assessment and Baseline Data Collection  
The study will be discussed with the subject. The subject will be provided with the Informed Consent Form to read and will be given the opportunity to ask questions.  If the subject agrees to participate, the Informed Consent Form will be signed. A copy of the consent form will be provided to the subject and another copy will be added to the subject’s chart.  
Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to performing any study -
specific procedures that are not part of the subject’s routine care.  
Subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility through the elicitation of a medical history, 
documentation of a physical examination (by study personnel or local MD) and local laboratory 
testing if needed to screen for  exclusionary medical conditions.  Subject exclusion will be at the 
discretion of the investigator based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria and lab results.     
 
 Historical Information and Physical Exam  
A history will be elicited from the subject and extracted from available medical records with regard to the subject’s diabetes history, current diabetes management, other past and current medical problems, past and current medications, and drug allergies.  A standard physical exam 
(including vital signs and height and weight measurements) will be either performed by the study investigator/ designee (study staff) or a physical exam from the subject’s personal physician within 6 months will be reviewed.   
 
 HbA1c 
HbA1c level will be measured at baseline using the method utilized by the clinic as part of patient 
care: DCA2000 or equivalent NGSP -certified point -of-care method or local laboratory.  HbA1c 
measurements performed within 4 weeks of randomization may b e used.

target range at each concentration per manufacturer labeling.  The subject will be i nstructed 
to perform quality control testing of the BG meter at home per manufacturing guidelines, and 
to contact study staff for a replacement of the meter, test strips, and control solution if a meter fails the testing.   
• Subjects will be asked to perform SMBG measurements at least 4 times daily (before meals, 
and at bedtime) throughout the study.  Subjects will be reminded to use the same glucometer 
for all finger sticks and calibrations and to only use SMBG values (not CG M values) to guide 
treatment decisions.  Subjects will use their personal glucometer throughout the study  but 
will be provided with a study glucometer if needed.  
• Subjects will be provided with a study blood ketone meter and test strips. All study blood ketone meters will be QC tested at the start of the study with at least two different 
concentrations of control solution if available.  A tested meter will not be used in a study if it does not read within the target range at each concentration per manufactur er labeling.   
• Subjects will be asked to obtain a glucagon kit per usual care guidelines from their personal physician. If subject is unable to obtain, study physicians may provide a prescription for the subject to obtain at their local pharmacy.  
 
The total amount of blood to be withdrawn during this screening visit is ~9 cc. The visit will last 
approximately 2 -4 hours.  
 
3.1.1  Pilot Study  
Prior to implementation of inControl use at home, we will conduct a pilot study of up to 4 subjects using inControl under supervision. This may occur within this protocol or another protocol/ IDE 
(G150221). These subjects will have an approximately 48 hour visit to a research house/hotel. These 
subjects will be under closed loop control with continuous remote monitoring.  We will  have a 
technician and medical personnel (e.g. nurse, EMT) with the subjects at all time. The data will be reviewed by the DSMB and, i f no serious adverse events and approved by the DSMB, subjects will 
continue to be enrolled as described in this protocol.  
 
 Randomization  
A subject who meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. After completion of the eligibility criteria, the participant will be randomized to one of the two arms: Group 
A and Group B as described and illustrated in Figure 1 .   
 
Subjects who are randomized to Group A will start SAP within four weeks of completing Visit 2; Visit 3 and Visit 4 will occur following completion of SAP.  
 Subjects who are randomized to Group B will proceed directly to Visit 2, Visit 3 and 4.  
 All training and run -in visits were structured to accommodate subjects who are experienced with the 
system or system components a s well as subjects who have little to no experience with the system or 
system components. As a result, training/run -in visits may be combined as described in the protocol 
depending on the skill level of the individual subject.

 Visit 2 – CGM Training and R un-In 
Visit 2 may occur concurrently with Visit 1.  
• A urine pregnancy tests may need to be repeated in premenopausal women who are not 
surgically sterile if Visit 2 occurs more than 6 weeks after their Visit 1.  
• Current CGM use will be evaluated, data may be  downloaded for any CGM currently in use.  
• Eligible subjects will receive study CGM training including proper insertion, calibration and maintenance of the CGM sensor. Training will be tailored to their individual experiences.  
• Subjects will take one of three paths forward in the study based on prior CGM experience:  
o Dexcom CGM users with use in the past 12 weeks  
These subjects will not require any further CGM run- in. 
o Non -Dexcom CGM users (current or past users) or Dexcom CGM users with last use more 
than 12 weeks prior  
These subjects will be given study CGM supplies and move into an up to 1 -week home use 
period with the study CGM to confirm the ability to use the CGM successfully. Subjects may 
skip this CGM run -in period if subject demonstrates adequate CG M skills.  
o CGM non -users  
These subjects will be given study CGM supplies and move into an up to 2 -week home use 
period with the study CGM to confirm the ability to use the CGM successfully and to help establish baseline glycemic control during frequent CGM  use.  Subjects will be contacted 
weekly by study staff to review CGM use.  
• If the subject has not demonstrated adherence to use of CGM after any applicable run- in 
period, study staff may discontinue that subject at their discretion.  
• Subjects will be requir ed to set the CGM hypoglycemia threshold alarm to a value no less than 
60 mg/dl and the CGM hyperglycemia threshold alarm to a value no greater than 300 mg/dl.  
 
 Visit 3 - Study Pump Training and Run -In Period 
Visit 3 may occur concurrently with Visit 1 and  2. 
Subjects will have supervised training on the study pump as described below.  
Study staff will review subject’s pump parameters by manual review and/or download of personal insulin pump.  
 All subjects will have a run -in period on the study pump of up to two weeks duration. Subjects who 
have had prior experience with the study pump may skip or require a shorter run -in period.  
The pump run -in period may overlap with any required CGM run -in period.  
Pump training will include:  
• The subject will be fully instructed on the study insulin pump. A qualified  staff member or 
pump trainer will conduct the training and in particular discuss differences from their home pump in important aspects such as calculation of insulin on board and correction boluses. 
Additional  topics not be limited to but may include: infusion site initiation, cartridge/priming 
procedures, setting up the pump, changing batteries, navigation through menus, bolus 
procedures including stopping a bolus, etc.  
25
Clinical Protocol 
 
 
 Version Date:  03/29/18  Page  16 
 
• The study team will assist the subject in study pump infusion site initiation and will start the 
subject on the study pump. The study pump will be programmed with the subject’s usual basal rates and pump parameters. The subject’s personal pump will be removed.  
• The subject will be supervised with  the study pump during at least one meal or snack bolus to 
ensure subject understanding of the pump features.  
• The subject will be encouraged to review the literature provided with the pump, infusion sets, and other pump related supplies after the training is completed.  
 
 Visit 4 – Closed Loop Training Visit  
Visit 4 will occur just prior to starting the first session of Closed -Loop Control to ensure that the 
training is in close proximity to the initiation of the system in closed loop control (for Group B thi s will 
occur earlier than Group A).  
 Visit 3 and 4 may occur concurrently  for inControl users . For subjects starting on the Tandem -G6 
system, Visit 3 and 4 will be concurren t.  
 Visit 4 will consist of a ~5 -10 hour training session in a transitional setting at a research house, hotel or 
clinic during which the subject will be trained to use the system to control the study pump, including 
meal announcement, meal bolusing, exercise, and switching back and forth between Pump (open -
loop) mode and Stopped mode.   Subjects may be asked to view study materials at home (e.g. User 
Guides and/or study videos on the Use of the AP System) prior to coming to Visit 4. This visit may shorter than 5 -10 hours depending on the subject’s proficiency with the system as well as prior 
experience.  
 A serum or urine pregnancy test will be collected for all premenopausal women who are not surgically sterile.  
 Prior to initial use, the system will be initialized with each subject’s individual parameters, including carbohydrate ratio, correction factor, and basal rate pattern.    Study team members will train the subject in performing specific tasks including the following:  
• The study team will confirm the pump parameters entered in the system  with the subject. 
• How to switch the system between Pump mode (open- loop, preprogrammed basal insulin 
delivery) and Stopped mode depending on circumstances.  For the Tandem -G6 system, this 
will consist of turning Control -IQ off.  
• How to calibrate the CGM unit during the study.  
• How to access the CGM trace on the user interface.  
• How to  activate the meal screen of the system any time insulin will be given with a meal or 
any time additional correction insulin is desired.  
• How to  inform the system of hypoglycemia treatment on the user interface . 
• What to do in when engaging in strenuous exertion  
• How to perform blood ketone testing and perform rescue therapy actions with the glucagon 
kit

The subject must be able to complete system -related tasks independently to be eligible to continue in 
the study.   
 
 Visit 5 - AP System  Run-In phase: Home Use in Pump Only (Open Loop) Configuration  
Eligible subjects who have not had recent use of the system (more than ~2 weeks of use in the past 6 months or more than ~2 months of use in the past year) will complete up to 2 -week hom e use period 
with the full system in pump only (open loop) configuration where no closed loop algorithms are activated. Subject will be instructed not to start closed loop during this run -in phase.  Subjects who 
have had prior experience with the AP system  as defined above will not be required to do Visit 5. 
Subjects who are demonstrating proficiency, as determined by the study physician, may have a shorter open loop run -in phase with a minimum of 5 days duration Criteria for proficiency is listed in sectio n 
3.11.  For the inControl system, remote monitoring will be available during this period for the purposes of data collection and ad hoc assessment of system performance by study team.  The study team will be available for the subject to contact during this phase. Study staff will contact the subject and review data on the Remote Monitoring once daily. The subject may contact the study staff at any time.  
 For the Tan dem -G6 system, remote monitoring will not be available. Study staff will contact the 
subject daily  to assess difficulties with the use of the system. The subject may contact the study staff 
at any time. If the study team requires additional information, the subject may be asked to upload the 
pump at home so that the study can review data on the t:connect website.  
 
 Visit 6 + Visit 7 + Visit 8 Washout Following Completion of the Each Study Phase

At the completion of the final phase of the study, subjects will  complete their final visit. Subjects will 
resume their personal pump. Subjects will either come to the study site or complete the following locally: HgbA1c, questionnaires, and may participate in an individual structured interview.  
 Data will be download ed from study equipment, glucometer and personal pump (during SAP) by one 
of several methods: locally by the subject and sent to study staff, by study staff at time of a visit or equipment mailed to the study staff for downloading.   
 
 Study Procedures duri ng SAP  
• Study subjects will be using the study CGM (Dexcom G4) and either their home pump or study 
pump for 8 weeks.  Subjects using the Tandem -G6 system during AP phases will use their home 
pump during SAP.  
• Subjects will be following their usual home insulin parameters. There are no predictive 
algorithms running for insulin administration.  
• Subjects will be requested to use their personal glucometer or study glucometer for all 
fingersticks including CGM calibrations.  
• Subjects will perform their usual activi ties and manage their diabetic regimen per their usual 
routine.  
• Study staff will be available at any time for the study subject to contact.  
• Staff will contact the subject once a month after the first month.  
 
 Study Procedures during USS + SAP(d) and USS + CLC(d)  
The subject will be wearing the study CGM, the study pump and utilizing the AP system for 8 weeks. Subject will be doing fingerstick testing using their personal glucometer or study provided glucometer.  
 For USS + SAP(d): The subject will be instructed to activate closed -loop operation each evening any 
time between just before eating dinner and prior to bedtime.  The subject will be instructed to switch back to open- loop mode upon waking up in the morning.  
 
For USS +CLC(d): The subject will be inst ructed to remain in closed -loop operation for 24 hours.  
 
While using the closed loop system, the subject will be instructed to avoid deviating from his/her 
regular daily routine in regards to diet and exercise and to maintain his or her usual sleep schedul e 
during the course of the study.  The subject will specifically be asked to avoid consuming more than 3

 Version Date:  03/29/18  Page  19 
 
alcoholic drinks in any one day.  The subject will also be instructed to avoid use of closed -loop mode 
during periods of illness with an elevated temperature >101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, periods of 
significant illness, or during periods of use of medications such as epinephrine for the emergency treatment of a severe allergic reactions or asthma attack in addition to use of oral or injectable glucocorticoi ds. The subject will be asked to put the system in exercise mode when engaging in 
strenuous exertion.  
 The total duration during each of these phases will be 8 weeks of AP system use regardless of whether 
CLC was activated or not. If a subject was off the system entirely and unable to use the system (e.g. in 
Stopped Mode) on one or more days due to illness or other factors such as extended travel, the use period may be extended at investigator discretion to obtain 8 weeks of use.  
        
 Monitoring when the AP system  is in Use during Visit 5, USS + SAP(d) and USS + CLC(d)  
Throughout the study, the study subject will be given contact information for study team members and can contact the study team at any time.  
 During the first use of the system at visit 5 and following completion of Visit 5 (second phase for Group 
A and first phase for Group B), the following procedures will be in place:  
• The study team will contact the subject daily for the first week.  
• The study team will review the Remote Monitoring System once daily for the first week  (if 
using inControl) . 
• A subject will be assessed by the study team at the end of the first week on the following criteria:  
o The subject used the system appropriately including the following:  
 Responded to system alerts and treated hypo - and hyperglycemia appropriately  
 Avoided deviating from his/her regular daily routine in regard to diet and exercise and 
maintained his or her usual sleep schedule

inControl. Subjects using Tandem -G6 will be asked to upload their pump to the t:connect 
website at least one time during this timeframe for the study team to ensure adequate 
data capture.  
 
If the study subject did not meet these criteria, then an additional week of daily contact  (all subjects)  
and daily remote monitoring  (inControl subjects only)  will be performed provided that the subject did 
not trigger any of t he study stopping rules for individual subjects (as defined in Section 5.9). 
 
Subject will be reeducated as appropriate and reassessed again at the end of the second week. Study staff will continue this weekly assessment per the staff’s discretion in those subjects that are not 
meeting criteria.  
 When the subject meets all the criteria, then study staff will be contacting them  (all subjects)  and 
reviewing the remote monitoring data (inControl subjects only)  once a week until the subjects 
complete their first 8 week time period using the AP system.  
 
During the subsequent 8 week time periods of using the system, subjects will be contacted (all 
subjects)  and remote monitoring data  (inControl subjects only)  reviewed every other week by the 
study staff.  
 
Subjects using Tandem -G6 system will upload the study pump a minimum of once every 4 weeks and 
anytime the staff requests review of the data .

Chapter 4  CLOSED -LOOP CONTROL SYSTEM OPERATION AND SAFETY  
 
 Algorithm  Details  
The control system consists of several modes with different functions adapted to different activities:  
• Module 1 –Safety Supervision (SSM) responsible for prevention of hypoglycemia. This is a passive 
safety module that can only attenuate insulin delivery.  
• Module 2 -- Basal Rate (BRM) responsible for augmentation of basal rate up to a total of 3X basal, 
to compensate for changes in insulin sensitivity (e.g. dawn phenomenon).   
• Module 3 – Range Control (RCM) is responsible for postprandial correction insulin administered as 
needed.  
 
In addition, the system includes a sophisticated meal bolus calculator that takes into account the current glucose state of the subject and available insulin to make a recommendation for a pre -meal 
bolus. The recommendation must be confirmed before delivery; if not confirmed, pre -meal insulin is 
not delivered automatically. The bolus calculator is activated on demand by the user, prior to meals.  
 
 System Details   
The study system will function in different operational modes in the proposed study:  Stopped, Pump, and Closed -Loop.  Pump mode will be referred to throughout this protocol and consistently means the 
delivery of  preprogrammed basal rates  (Open -Loop)  regardless of the system being used. In Closed-
Loop mode, basal delivery can be attenuated or increased by the control algorithms.   
 For inControl system only: If the system malfunctions but the system can still communicate with the pump, the system will fail safe to Pump mode so that the user will continue to receive basal insulin under the direction of the system.  If there is a malfunction in which the system cannot communicate  
with the pump, the system will fail safe to Stopped mode.  If the system is in Stopped mode and the Roche pump is being used, the user will begin receiving basal insulin from the pump without any direction from the AP system within a short period of time.  
 The table below summarizes the system modes  for inControl  and some of the functionality available in 
each mode:

 Safety Measures  
 Safety Measures of Insulin Dosing  
In Closed -Loop mode, all dosing is supervised by a dedicated safety supervision system module and 
insulin correction for meal boluses must be manually confirmed.  In Pump and Closed -Loop mode:  
• Bolus size is checked by the algorithm to ensure it is smaller than the maximum bolus that the 
pump can handle;  
• For inControl, s witching to “Stopped” mode includes a ‘cancel all’ delivery message to the 
pump so that any active but incomplete bolus is cancelled  with the Roche Accu -Chek pump.  
• All insulin requests are made in the form of boluses or temporary basal rate changes; th is 
ensures that in case of a system crash or pump disconnection, no request has permanence;  
• Users will be able to monitor delivered insulin in the plots menu on the phone which is available from the main screen in any operating mode. The remote monitoring displays the 
delivered insulin and total insulin delivered during the past 4 hours via the web interface;  
• It is important to note that IOB constraint is an internal safety feature of the closed- loop 
system. It is not read from the pump or any other external source. The IOB in the system is computed by the system using a model of the transport and clearance of insulin from the subcutaneous infusion site to the circulation, and is intended to prevent insulin overdose.  
  
 Hypoglycemia Safety Guidelines  
If the subject receives a hypoglycemia alert from the study system, the subject will be instructed to perform a fingerstick test with the blood glucose meter.  The hypoglycemia alerts will be active in Pump and Closed -loop modes. If the subject’s BG result is ≤80 mg/dL, the subject will be instructed to 
treat with ~8 -16 grams of oral glucose and for inControl users indicate treatment was given on the 
system by activating the hypoglycemia treatment button.  Further details will be included in a Subject User Guide regarding retesting, retreatment, and criteria for glucagon treatment, stopping the system, contacting the study physician, and contacting emergency responders.  
 
 CGM Calibration  
Throughout the study, the subject will be instructed to calibrate the CGM at lea st twice a day  (Dexcom 
G4) and any time there is a calibration request from the CGM itself, provided that the fingerstick 
glucose is between 40 -400 mg/dL and the CGM arrow is flat (horizontal), indicating that the sensor 
glucose value is not changing rapidly.  
 
 Hyperglycemia Safety Guidelines  
If the subject receives a hyperglycemia alert from the study system, the subject will be instructed to perform a fingerstick test with the blood glucose meter.  The hyperglycemia alerts will be active in Pump and Closed -loop modes. If the subjec t’s BG result is ≥300 mg/dL for over 1 hour, or over ≥400 
mg/dL at any point, the subject will be instructed to perform a blood ketone measurement with the study ketone meter.  Further details will be included in a Subject User Guide regarding criteria for  
stopping the system, administering correction boluses, retesting, retreatment, infusion set replacement, contacting the study physician, and contacting emergency responders.

 Version Date:  03/29/18  Page  24 
 
 CGM Sensor Failure  
If the CGM signal becomes unavailable for an extended period of time during Closed -Loop mode, the 
system will revert to Pump mode.   
 
 Pump Failure  
For inControl, If the insulin pump stops communicating for >10 minutes, the system will generate an alert on the phone and will eventually switch to Stopped mode if the c ommunication problem persists.  
If loss of pump communication persists, the Roche pump will automatically revert to preprogrammed 
basal insulin delivery without any need for instruction from the controller (within 15 -45 minutes from 
time of failure of communication based on estimated glucose at the time of loss of communication).   
 
 Study System Failure  
For inControl, If the study system stops working, the Roche pump will automatically revert to 
preprogrammed basal insulin delivery without any need for inst ruction from the controller (within 15 -
45 minutes from time of failure of communication based on estimated glucose at the time of loss of communication).   
 For Tandem -G6 system, if the t:slim X2 detects a system error that does not allow the pump to 
operate, the Malfunction Alarm will display and the subject will be instructed to contact the study team.  
   
 Remote Monitoring  for inControl  
REMOTE MONITORING SERVER  – The TypeZero Technologies inControl -Cloud data collection and 
monitoring application is a cloud -based system that stores de -identified user data received from the 
inControl- AP artificial pancreas smartphone application over a secure SSL link.  Acces s to inControl -
Cloud is password protected and access is restricted by account to members of the study team and to TypeZero authorized personnel.  inControl Cloud may run on systems from one of a number of vendors such as Amazon Web Services.  The system of fers the possibility to track many patients at the 
same time, with automated alarms and alerts ( Figure 6 ).

Chapter 5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND PROTOCOL MONITORING  
 
 Definition  
A reportable adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or any unexpected medical 
occurrence in a study subject.     
 
Hypoglycemic events are recorded as Adverse Events if the event required assistance of another person due to altered consciousness to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.  This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat him or herself, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma.  These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma.  If plasma glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose  to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.   
 Hyperglycemic events are recorded as Adverse Events if evaluation or treatment was obtained 
from a health care provider or if the event involved diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as defined by the 
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), and had all of the following:  
• Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting;  
• Serum ketones or large/moderate urine ketones;  
• Either arterial b lood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15; and  
• Treatment provided in a health care facility  
 
 Recording of Adverse Events  
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to remain alert to possible adverse events or untoward findings.  The first concern will be the safety of the subject, and appropriate 
medical intervention will be made.  
 The investigator will elicit reports of adverse events from the subject at each visit and complete all adverse event forms online.   
 The in vestigator will assess the relationship of any adverse event to be related or unrelated by 
determining if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by the study device or study procedures.    
 The intensity of adverse ev ents will be rated on a three -point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several days may be rated  as severe, but 
may not be clinically serious.

Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study 
will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the condition is expected.   
 Definitions of relationship and intensity are listed on the website data entry form.   
 Documentation of adverse events will discontinue at the completion of Visit 9 Washout Period.   
 
 Reportable Device Issues  
All UADEs, ADEs, device complaints, and device malfunctions will be reported irrespective of whether an adverse event occurred, except in the following circumstances.   The following device issues are anticipated and will not be recorded  on a CRF  but will reported as 
an Adverse Event if the criteria for AE reporting described above are met:  
• Component disconnections  
• CGM sensors lasting fewer than manufacturer recommended use  
• CGM tape adherence issues  
• Pump infusion set occlusion not leading to ketosis  
• Battery lifespan deficiency due to inadequate charging or extensive wireless communication  
• Intermittent device component disconnections/communication failures not leading to 
system replacement  
• Device issues clearly addressed in the user guide manual that do not require additional 
troubleshoot ing  
• Skin reactions from CGM sensor placement or pump infusion set placement that do  not 
meet criteria for AE reporting  
 
 Definition of a Protocol Enrollment Exception  
No enrollment exceptions will be permitted in this trial.  
 
 Definition of a Data Breach  
A data breach is defined in the HITECH Act (43 USC 17932) as an unauthorized acquisition, access, 
or use of protected health information (PHI) that compromises the security or privacy of such information.  
 
 Data Collection

 Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any untoward occurrence that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (a non -life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might 
have become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
An unanticipated problem is any event, experience that meets ALL 3 criteria below:  
• Is unexpected in terms of the nature, severity or frequency given the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol – related documents AND in the charac teristics of the 
population under study.  
• Is related or possibly related to participation in research.   This means that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident may have been caused by the procedures involved 
in the research study.  
• The incident s uggests that the research places the subject or others at greater risk of harm 
(physical, psychological, economic or social) than was previously known or recognized OR 
results in actual harm of the subject or others.   An unanticipated problem generally 
required a change in policy or procedure, warrants consideration of substantive changes to 
the protocol/consent or other immediate corrective actions in order to reduce the risk or 
eliminate immediate hazard.  
 As noted in the table above, the study team will notify the FDA of any adverse event that is 
serious, unexpected, and related or possibly related .  Notification will be made within 15 days 
after the study team becomes aware of the event.   
 The principal investigator is responsible for informing his/her IRB of serious study -related adverse 
events and abiding by any other reporting requirements specific to their IRB.   
 Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated adverse device events that occur during the study and will review 
compiled safety data at periodic intervals.  
 
We will implement a system to oversee and monitor our randomized clinical trial to ensure the safety of participants, as well as the validity and integrity of the data. We will establish a data 
safety monitoring board, ensuring that the DSMB’s responsibilities are commensurate with the risks, complexity, and nature of our studies.  We will define the role of the DSMB prior to ini tiating 
the clinical trial and clearly delineate the operating procedures and policies of the board, including “stopping rules” for the study.  
 
41
Clinical Protocol 
 
 
 Version Date:  03/29/18  Page  32 
 
Membership : Our DSMB will be comprised of experts in diverse scientific disciplines to ensure 
participant safet y and help interpret the data in our studies.   
 
Meetings : Prior to implementation of the study, the DSMB will meet to review the consent and 
protocol, making recommendations for any needed changes.  For this meeting, study investigators 
will be on hand to  answer any specific questions.  After the initial meeting, the DSMB will plan to 
meet in -person or by conference call once yearly.  DSMB members will have the ability to request 
more frequent reviews or meetings at any time during the study if they determ ine such reviews 
could help ensure patient safety or data integrity.  The DSMB may meet in "closed session," and they may periodically ask study investigators to attend a meeting to provide additional details on the implementation or conduct of the trial o r other pertinent information.  After its initial meeting, 
the DSMB will review the implementation and progress of the study, evaluating study data in both individual and aggregate form to detect evidence of significant benefit or harm for participant whil e the trial is in progress.  This latter review, beyond that provided by the IRB, serves as a 
means of additional human subject protection.  It does not supplant the regulatory requirement for the principal investigator to report serious and unanticipated adverse events to the local IRB or relevant regulatory bodies.  
 
Summary of DSMB duties : The DSMB will perform the following activities: 1) Review of the 
research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring; 2) Evaluate the progress of the intervention trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that could 
potentially affect study outcome; 3) Protect the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring; and 4) Make recommendations to the investigators concerning continuation, modification, or termination of the trials.  The DSMB also has the right to make independent representation to the regulatory bodies (NIH, IRB) if there has been any failure in reporting by the principal investigator. The DSMB can also instruct the principal investigator to pause or terminate pursuance of research if there is a breach in regulatory guidelines or good clinical practices.  If the DSMB notes serious and unexpected adverse events, or unanticipated problems involving r isks to 
participants or others, which are related to the study, the PI will be notified immediately in writing.  
 To assist the DSMB in their duties, the investigators will prepare a report prior to each DSMB meeting, including issues related to participant recruitment (consent, enrollment, dropout), data collection (e.g., quality, timeliness, completeness, security),  outcome analyses, and all serious and 
unexpected adverse experiences. The investigators will also notify the DSMB of any significant 
study modifications, emphasizing any changes made in response to adverse events (see definition 
below)  
 After the DSMB mee ting, the DSMB will issue a report summarizing their findings.  More 
specifically, they will provide commentary on participant recruitment, consent, and drop out; the quality, timeliness, and completeness of data collection; outcome analyses that help dete rmine 
whether a study should continue; and all serious and unexpected adverse experiences.  In each area (e.g., participants consent), they will recommend any necessary changes in study policies or 
42

protocol and explain how the changes will help ensure participant safety or data integrity.  These 
reports will be kept by the PI, who will file them with the local IRB.   This application includes a trial that requires registration in ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 
 Potential Risks and Side Effects  
 Venipuncture Risks  
A hollow needle/plastic tube will be placed in the arm for taking blood samples. Blood draws can cause some common reactions like pain, bruising, or redness at the sampling site.  Less common reactions include bleeding from the sampling site, formation of a small blood clot or swelling of the vein and surrounding tissues, and fainting.  
 
 Fingerstick Risks  
About 1 drop of blood will be removed by finger stick for measuring blood sugars and sometimes HbA1c or other tests. This is a standard method used to obtain bl ood for routine hospital 
laboratory tests.  Pain is common at the time of lancing.  In about 1 in 10 cases, a small amount of bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise.  A small scar may persist for several weeks.  The risk 
of local infection is less t han 1 in 1000.  This should not be a significant contributor to risks in this 
study as finger pokes are part of the usual care for people with diabetes.  
 
 Subcutaneous Catheter Risks (Continuous Glucose Sensor)  
Subjects using the continuous glucose sensor w ill be at low risk for developing a local skin infection 
at the site of the sensor needle placement.  There may be bleeding where the catheter is put in 
and bleeding under the skin causing a bruise (1 in 10 risk).   
 Study staff should verbally alert the subject that on rare occasions, the continuous glucose sensor may break and leave a small portion of the sensor under the skin that may cause redness, swelling or pain at the insertion site.  The subject should be further instructed to notify the study coor dinator immediately if this occurs.  
 
 Risk of Hypoglycemia  
As with any person having insulin -dependent diabetes, there is always a risk of having a low blood 
sugar (hypoglycemia).  The frequency of hypoglycemia should be no more and possibly less than it 
would be as part of daily living.  Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include sweating, jitteriness, and 
not feeling well.  Just as at home, there is the possibility of fainting or seizures (convulsions) and that for a few days patients may not be as aware of symp toms of low blood sugar.   
 
 Risk of Hyperglycemia  
Hyperglycemia and ketonemia could occur if insulin delivery is attenuated or suspended for an extended period or if the pump or infusion set is not working properly.  A sensor which was functioning poorly a nd significantly under -reading glucose values could lead to inappropriate 
suspension of insulin delivery.     
 
43
Clinical Protocol 
 
 
 Version Date:  03/29/18  Page  34 
 
 Risk of Device Reuse  
The Dexcom CGM is labeled for single use only. The sensor (the component of the system that 
enters the skin) will be single use only. The transmitter and receiver will be reused after cleaning as described below. The transmitter is attached to the sensor but does not enter the skin and the receiver is a hand held device. The transmitter and receiver will be cleaned adhering to hospital 
protocol as described below. Subjects will be informed that the FDA has approved these devices for single use and that by using them among multiple patients, bloodborne pathogens (i.e. Hepatitis B) may be spread through the use of multiple users.  
 The Accu -Chek Combo System  and Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump are labeled for single -patient 
use. The Accu -Chek Combo system is comprised of the Accu- Chek Spirit Insulin Pump and the 
Aviva Combo Device. The Aviva Combo device when used as a glucometer will be single patient use at all times.  The Accu -Chek Spirit Insulin  Pump itself is handheld and is not a glucometer. The 
subject interactions are primarily with the AP system interface and the Aviva Combo device, not with the Accu- Chek Spirit Insulin Pump menu interface itself. The Accu- Chek Spirit Insulin Pump 
handheld device and the Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump will be reused after cleaning adhering to 
hospital protocol as described below. All infusion set equipment will be single patient use only (infusion set insertion kits, tubing, cartridges etc.)  
 Cleaning Procedure: Equipment that touches intact skin will be cleaned with ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (70 -90%), quaternary ammonium germicidal detergent (i.e. CaviCide) or household bleach. 
The contact time on the surface depends on the method used to clean the equipment.  CaviCide 
requires three minutes on the surface. Clorox Germicidal Bleach Wipes require two minutes on the equipment. The surface should remain wet (i.e. slightly damp) with the disinfectant to be considered effective though not wet enough to leave drops o f liquid. Equipment will be stored in a 
clean zipped bag.  
 Hb1Ac Risk: The  Unive rsity of Virgin ia central labs have College o f American Pathologist (CAP) and 
the Clinical Labora tory Imp rovement  Amendments ( CLIA) certifica tions. While  the central lab is not 
NGSP certified, the  calibrators for the HbA1c assay are traceable to N GSP. The  equipm ent (Tosoh 
G7) is NGSP certified. An NGSP Point of Care analyzer (i.e. DCA Vantage Analyzer) may also be 
utilized at the research site to obtain the subject’s HbA 1c level.  
 
 Other Risks  
Some subjects may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure the CGM, or to secure the insulin infusion sets for the CSII.  If these reactions occur, different 
adhesives or “under -taping” (such as w ith IV 3000, Tegaderm, etc.) will be tried, sites will be 
rotated frequently, and a mild topical steroid cream or other medication may be required.  
 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM and pump infusion sites are inserted under the skin.  It is possible that any part that is inserted under the skin may cause an infection.  These occur very infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral and/or topical antibiotics can be used .  The risk of skin problems could be greater if a sensor is used for 
44
Clinical Protocol 
 
 
 Version Date:  03/29/18  Page  35 
 
longer than manufacturer recommendations.  Therefore, participants will be carefully instructed 
about proper use of the sensor.  
 Data downloaded from the CGM, pump, and the home glucose and ketone meter will be collected for the study as measures of diabetes self -management behaviors.  Some people may be 
uncomfortable with the researchers' having such detailed information about their daily diabetes habits.  
 
Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk; however, data are handled to minimize this risk.   
 
 Study Stopping Criteria  
 Criteria for Individual Subjects  
Rules for stopping the study for an individual subject are as follows:  
1. System or controller malfunctions that impose on the safety of the subject, unless the 
problem can be clearly identified and the system definitively repaired  
2. Two distinct episodes of severe  hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia/DKA  (not associated with 
infusion set failure)  as defined in section 5.1 related to automated insulin delivery during 
closed loop use  
3. The subject requests the study be stopped  
4. Subject pregnancy  
5. Use of oral or injectable glucocorticoids during closed -loop system opera tion (subject may 
resume study procedures once effects of glucocorticoids are no longer present)  
6. Study staff are persistently unable to contact the subject in a timely manner during the course of the study  
7. Persistent subject non- adherence to safety -related  procedures such as frequency of 
fingersticks or hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and ketone treatment instructions  
8. Ketones  ≥ 3 mmol/L or with symptoms requiring action regardless of blood sugar or 
ketones ( i.e. abdominal pain, vomiting illness, unable to eat o r drink , fever ≥ 101.5, clinical 
need for Tylenol/acetaminophen, significant illness, use of epinephrine) . Subject  may 
resume study procedures once conditions or symptoms  are no longer present . 
 
 Criteria for Suspending/Stopping Overall Study  
In case of a recurring system malfunction or a severe hypoglycemia event or severe hyperglycemia 
event during closed loop control (as defined in Section 5.1) that is thought to be device -related 
(either due to excess insulin administration or suspension due to system malfunction) that occurs in more than two (2) subjects, the overall study will be suspended while the problem is diagnosed.  The study may resume if the underlying problem can be corrected by a protocol or system modification that will not invalidate the results obtained prior to suspension.  
 An instance of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia as defined in section 5.1  will result in DSMB 
review  of the data to determine whether the event was triggered by the system or not and 
whether it is safe to proceed.  The currently -enrolled subjects will continue use of the system 
during this time unless the DSMB determines it is unsafe for them to do so.

Chapter 6   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
  Analysis Plan  
 
Statistical Analysis:  The overall analysis will follow Intention -to-treat approach and will use 
Generalized Linear Mixed Models (e.g. those available i n IBM SPSS) including fixed factors 
following the factorial designs presented in study figure for the specific aims listed below, and 
random effects reflecting patients’ attrition rate.   
Metrics:  
(i) Five HbA1c determinations approximately 10 weeks apart;  
(ii) Eight -week sequences of CGM data accompanied by BG self -monitoring readings and 
recording of the timing of events such as meals and exercise through the GUI  
(iii) Psychometric questionnaires administered concurrently with HbA1c, and  
(iv) Individual structured interview  and qu alitative/quantitative technology acceptance 
assessments. CGM data will be used to compute established metrics of risk for hypoglycemia, e.g. the Low BG Index (LBGI), glucose variability, and BG dynamics, as presented in our review of statistical tools for  CGM data analysis.  
 
Primary Hypothesis by Specific Aims of the Study  
Specific Aim 1: Overnight CLC achieved by USS+SAP(d) will be superior to SAP alone in terms 
of: (1) Improved HbA1c without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia; (2) Reduced incidence and risk for hypoglycemia overnight, and (3) Reduced fear of hypoglycemia and improved diabetes quality of life scores.  
Specific Aim 2: CLC during the day  achieved by  USS+CLC(d) will preserve the benefits of 
USS+SAP(d) and will be superior to USS+SAP(d) in terms of: (1) Increased time within target range of 70 -180mg/dl during the day; (2) Reduced risk for hypoglycemia during and after 
exercise, and (3) Reduced postprandial glucose variability.  
Specific Aim 3: CLC system acceptance evaluated by an individual s tructured and technology 
acceptance scores will be: (1) Superior, for USS+SAP(d) compared to SAP alone, i.e. adding USS overnight will increase patients’ acceptance of CLC, and (2) Marginally inferior, for USS+CLC(d) compared to USS+SAP(d); i.e. some patie nts would prefer SAP alone during the 
day due to perceived increased system complexity.  
 
Primary Outcomes  
Specific Aim 1:  The primary outcome  is improvement in diabetes control on USS+SAP(d) vs. 
SAP alone as defined by reduced risk for hypoglycemia (Time < 70 mg/dL by CGM) without 
increase in HbA1c . Repeated Measures ANOVA with covariate will assess this effect. 
Inversely, comparing HbA1c with covariate overnight Time <70 mg/dL by CGM  will address 
SA1-2, while comparing the psychometric questionnaire scores pre-post treatment will 
address SA1 -3.  
Specific Aim 2:  The primary outcome  is improved time within the target range of 70 -
180mg/dl during the day on USS+ CLC(d) vs. USS+SAP(d). Repeated Measures ANOVA following the study design outlined will assess this e ffect. SA2 -2 will be addressed 
46
Clinical Protocol 
 
 
 Version Date:  03/29/18  Page  37 
 
comparing frequency of hypoglycemia within the post -exercise periods recorded by the 
system ; SA2 -3 will be addressed using Variability -Grid Analysis, and SA- 4 will be addressed 
by a sub- analysis limited to those who did not achieve HBA1c≤7.5% during the first 3 
months of the study.  
Specific Aim 3 : will be addressed by comparing structured interviews and technology 
acceptance scores along the two sequences of treatment modalities specified in the study design: treatment escalation for Group A and de -escalation for Group B. Analyzing the 
random effect of patient attrition will shed additional light on system acceptance.  
 
 Sample Size 
Sample Size Determination is based on our pilot studies of overnight CLC. We conservatively  
estimate that the effect size of USS+SAP(d) vs. SAP will be  f≥0.2. Power calculations (G*Power 3) 
assuming α=0.01, 90% power, correlation of 0. 4 between the repeated measures, and attrition of 
up to 31 % yield a sample size of N= 110 subjects to be randomized at baseline, with N= 76 subjects 
completing the study. For SA2 using USS+CLC(d), our pilot data with this same system during the day indicate a larger effect size f =0.3. For SA -3, the expected effect size is f= 0.35- 0.4 based on our 
previous interview s. Thus, a sample size that is adequate for SA -1 will have adequate power to 
address SA- 2 and SA -3 as well.

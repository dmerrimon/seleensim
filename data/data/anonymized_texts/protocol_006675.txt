 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHE MA 
 
Title: Local Therapies for Oligometastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC) harboring Sensitizing EGFR Mutations 
Objectives: Primary objective: 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of local treatment of 
oligometastatic disease comb ined with tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) therapy 
 

 To determine the feasibility of accruing eligible patients to 
undergo the proposed treatment plan 
 To collect preliminary data on the efficacy of the proposed 
treatment strategy: 
o Time to progress ion 
o Time to death 
o Local co ntrol at site of local therapy 
o Time on EGFR TKI before a new systemic therapy is 
required 
 
Correlative objectives: 
 To comp are the molecular alterations in the primary lung 
versus  metastatic sites by performing next-generation 
sequencing (IMPACT) on archived pr e-treatment and 
resected specimens. 
 To evaluate cell free plasma DNA (cfDNA) as a  tumor 
biomarker for recurrent disease. 
Patient Population: Patients with newly diagnosed, untreated stage IV oligometastatic 
(≤5 lesions of disease) lung adenocarcinomas harboring se nsitizing 
EGFR mutations: 
 all sites of disease (including CNS) must be amenable to 
definitive treatment with a local therapy (as per surgery, 
interventional radiology and radiation oncology) 
 all hilar and mediastinal nodal disease to be considered as 
part of the primary disease and n ot a metastatic site 
Design: Single-arm, prospective trial:  5 patients will be e nrolled at  our 
institu tion to demonstrate feasibility of both enrolling patients and 
having them complete all local therapies in a  2 year time frame. 
Treatment Plan: Patients will be p laced on EGFR-TKI for their metastatic EGFR- 
mutant stage IV oligometastatic disease.  All patients will undergo 
induction TKI for 12  weeks.  At the conclusion of 12 weeks on 
erlotinib, patients without disease progression [partial response 
(PR) or stable disease (SD)] will undergo definitive local treatment 
to all remaining sites of disease.  After local therapy, erlotinib will be 
resumed until progression of disease (POD) by RECIST criteria.

 Patients who ac hieve a complete response (CR) at a site of 
disease, will have the option to forgo local therapy at that site and  
just continue EGFR TKI. Patients with progress ive disease after 12 
weeks of erlotinib will be taken off study. 
 Definitive loc al therapies include surgical resection, 
stereotactic radiosurgery, ablation and conventional 
radiation therapy 
 After induction TKI (12 weeks), local therapies will be 
comp leted sequentially. The expectation is that all local 
therapies will be comp leted within 8 months of patient 
enrollment. 
 The treating MD will confirm if the patients TKI should be 
held for 2 days before and restarted within 14 days after 
each local therapy and otherwise con tinued. If the treating 
MD feels that it will be ok  for the patient to continue 
erlotinib during local treatment, this will be a llowed per  
protocol. 
 If initially symptomatic, a patient may receive a definitive 
local therapy prior to completion of induction TKI at the 
discretion of the treating physician. 
 Patients who have POD at any time will be taken off study 
and con tinue conventional systemic treatment and/or local 
therapies for palliative purposes as per their primary 
medical oncologist. 
Number  of Patients: 5 patients for feasibility

3.0 BACKGROU ND AND RATIONALE 
 
Lung Cancer 
Lung ca ncer is the most com mon cancer worldwide, and in the United States, there 
will be an estim ated 224,000 new  cases of lung cancer and 159,000  deaths in 201 4.1   Half of 
all patients with stage IB – IIIA non-small-cell lung cance rs (NSCLCs) who undergo curative 
therapy with surgery and peri-operative che motherapy die within five years of their initial 
diagnosis.2   The majority of patients with NSCLC present  with metastatic (stage IV) disease. 
The 5-year survival rate for patients with stage IV NSCLC is <5%.  However, a subs et of 
patients with stage IV NSCLC present  with oligometastatic disease, and appear to have a 
more favorable prognosis. 
 
Local Therapies  in Oligometast atic Disea se 
The limited extent of metastases  in the oligometastatic state raises the possibility of 
definitively treating all site of disease. Oligometastatic d isease may represent a separate 
intermediate disease state where cancers  have gained add itional genetic alterations that 
result in metastasis, but have not yet acquired the capa bility for widespread metastases. 
Local therapies such as radiation, radiofrequency ablation, and metastatectomy are routinely 
performed in other cancers such as  renal cell carcinoma, sarc oma, and colorectal cancer for 
oligometastatic disease with excellent disease free sur vival in a subset of cases. 
Oligometastatic disease is typically defined as fewer than 5 discrete sites of disease3-5 
although this can vary with different tumor types. The goal of treating oligometastatic 
disease with local therapies is to render the patient free of disease if the primary tumor is 
otherwise con trolled. 
 
Local Therapies  in Oligometast atic Lung Cancer 
While local therapies in metastatic lung canc er are typically reserved for palliative 
purposes, s ome studies suggest patients with oligometastatic disease treated with local 
therapies might have improved outcomes.6-9   Patients who undergo surgical resection and/or 
radiation therapy of a solitary brain metastasis have a median survival of approximately 40 
weeks10, and the 5-year survival rates range from 10-20%.11   Follow-up whole brain radiation 
and/or SRS12-1415,16 are additional treatment options.  In patients undergoing resection of 
brain metastases from NSCLC, comp lete resection of the primary lung disease prolongs 
survival.11   Local treatment for bra in metastases is currently considered standard of care.  In 
patients with an isolated a drenal metastasis (up to 33%  patients) and an otherwise cu rable 
lung cancer, local therapy of the adrenal lesion can result in long-term sur vival in up to 25% 
patients.17-19. There is some thought that ipisilateral adrenal metastases actually represent 
locoregional spread though retroperitoneal lymphatic chan nels.  Guidelines now recommend 
that in patients with a distant metastasis in a solitary site, such as a brain or adrenal lesion, 
metastastectomy should be co nsidered in add ition to systemic therapy20 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Page  9 of 33  
 A recent study by Parikh and colleagues prosp ectively enrolled 186 patients with 
oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer, defined as 5 or fewer distant metastatic lesions at 
diagnosis, and evaluated patient and disease characteristics associated with improved 
survival.  The number of metastatic lesions and radiologic size of the primary tumor were not 
associated with overall survival.  Eastern Cooperate Oncology Group performance status ≥2 
(hazard ratio [HR] 2.43), nodal status N2-3 (HR 2.16), squamous pathology, and metastases 
to multiple organs (HR 2.11) were associated with a greater hazard of death (all P<0.01). 
Importantly, patients who received aggressive local treatment to either the prima ry tumor 
only (HR 0.64; 9 5%CI 0.33-1.24; P=0.19) or to both primary tumor and metastatic sites (HR 
0.59; 9 5%CI 0.37-0.95; P=0.03) had improved survival (19 months [95%CI 13-34 months] vs 
16 months [95%CI 13-19 months]) comp ared to patients who received either aggressive 
treatment to the metastatic sites on ly or no aggressive treatment.21 
 
Rationale for Local Therapies  in EGFR-mutant Metastatic Lung Cancer 
Sensitizing EGFR mutations are found in approximately 10% of Caucasian patients 
with NSCLC a nd up to 50% Asian patients. The majority of patients with tumors harboring 
sensitizing EGFR mutations will respond to EGFR TKIs (>70% response rate) with a median 
progression-free survival of 12 months.22-27   Patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer  have a 
unique biology and are clinically characterized not only by improved outcomes with EGFR- 
TKIs, but also by better results from chemotherapy and surgery compared to their EGFR- 
wild-type co unterparts.22,28   Prospective studies evaluating EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib, 
erlotinib, and afatinib, all show a superi or radiographic response rate and  progression-free 
survival with TKI compared to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.22-26   Even with the 
development of acquired resistance to TKIs, patients with EGFR-mutant lung cance rs have a 
median survival of 16 months29 comp ared to 12 months from initial diagnosis of stage IV 
disease in unse lected  patients.30 
One of the favorable prognostic factors generally used in the selection of patients for 
metastasectomy includes prolonged progression-free survival, representing patients with 
slower growing disease.31-33   Given their relatively indolent clinical co urse, patients harboring 
sensitizing EGFR mutations are more likely to benefit from local treatment for oligometastatic 
disease sites  and thus present a unique opp ortunity to ach ieve increased long-term sur vival. 
Not only do EGFR-mutated patients have a superior prognosis with longer overall survival, 
but 60% of patients with metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs first 
develop disease progression in their initial sites of disease, lending credence to the concept 
that upfront local therapy to all sites may prolong progression-free survival. (unpublished 
data). 
In a published report, we identified 18 patients who received elective non-central 
nervous system local therapy (surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, or radiation), in 
conjunction with con tinued EGFR-TKIs.34   Local therapy was well tolerated with 85%  of 
patients restarting TKI therapy  within 1 month. The median time to progression after local 
therapy was 10  months (95%CI 2-27 months), and medial overall survival from local therapy 
was 41  months (95%CI 26-not reached). The median time until a subsequent change in 
systemic therapy was 22  months (95%CI 6-30 months). 
Another retrospective ana lysis by Weickhardt and colleagues described 25 patients, 
with either an EGFR mutation or an ALK rearrangement, who received a l ocal therapy 
(stereotactic body radiation therapy in most cases) to oligoprogressive metastases  after 
targeted therapy.  After local therapy, the median progress ion-free survival was 6.2 months 
with 19 of 25 patients progressing again.35

Page  10 of 33  
 These remarkable outcomes are likely a reflection of a multitude of factors including 
the natural h istory of this patient population, continued benefits of TKI therapy even af ter 
progression, and the potential benefits of local therapy.  Prospective evaluation of local 
therapy as part of a standard treatment paradigm is warranted to better define the patient 
population and  treatment parameters that could result in improved outcomes, possibly even 
prolonged disease-free survival. 
For locally advanced disease we often give induction ch emotherapy prior to surgical 
resection for a number of reasons including 1)  easier tolerability 2) to eliminate 
micrometastatic disease 3)  to ach ieve a pathologic response and  4) to improve surgical 
outcomes. This approach has  led to an improved median disease-free survival (27 vs 13 
months) and median overall survival (37 vs 26 months)  compared to surgery alone.36   We 
hope to apply this concept to patients with EGFR-mutant oligometastatic stage IV disease 
using TKI therapy as induction therapy to improve survival outcomes.  
 
Correlative Studies  
 
Intratumor heterogeneity 
Large-scale sequencing platforms have revealed extensive genetic heterogeneity 
between individual tumors that can contribute to treatment failure and drug resistance. 
Specifically, studies comparing mutational profiles of primary tumors and associated 
metastatic lesions or local recurrences have provided evidence of  intratumor 
heterogeneity.37-40   Intratumor  heterogeneity within primary tumors and associated metastatic 
sites has  not been systematically characterized by  next-generation sequencing in lung 
cancer. 
This study affords an opportunity to investigate intratumor heterogeneity by 
compari ng mutation profiles on matched  primary and metastatic resected tissue sp ecimens. 
We will use a  next generation sequencing based genotyping assay (MSK IMPACT) that 
performs massively parallel sequencing of all exons corresponding to 341 cancer genes. 
The sequencing data will be analyzed for base mutations, insertions, deletions, copy number 
alterations and genomic rearrangements in all target genes. 
 
Cell-free plasma DNA as a biomark er for recurrence 
Studies suggest that highly sensitive genotyping ass ays can d etect mutations in cell- 
free plasma  DNA (cfDNA) from patients with cancer, p otentially providing a non-invasive 
method  to identify and track intratumoral genetic alterations. 
 
Several s tudies ha ve demonstrated a prognostic value of the total level of tumor 
cfDNA, with high levels being associated with shorter survival.41,42   Quantitative chan ges in 
tumor cfDNA during a patient’s treatment course may be us ed as a marker to monitor 
response to therapy.43   Quantification of cfDNA could be used as a tumor marker that tracks 
with response to therapy, but also as a biomarker whose presence could predict recurrent 
disease prior to radiographic or clinical recurrence. To investigate this, we will obtain serial 
assessments of cfDNA during routine venipunctures as  per protocol to capture changes in 
cfDNA during treatment.

 4.0 OVERVI EW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVE NTION  
 
4.1 Design 
 
This is a single-arm, single institution trial evaluating a treatment plan consisting of local 
therapies and continued erlotinib in patients with stage IV oligometastatic lung 
adenocarcinoma harboring se nsitizing EGFR mutations.  At least five patients will be e nrolled 
at our institution to demonstrate feasibility  of accrual and succe ssful completion of treatment 
over a 2 year time period. After demonstrating feasibility of this approach, a multicenter 
efficacy study will be p lanned. Patients will be e nrolled at the start of TKI for their untreated 
EGFR-mutant stage IV oligometastatic disease. All patients will receive “induction” TKI for 
12 weeks.  Patients who respond (PR/SD) will undergo definitive local treatment to all 
remaining measurable  sites of disease.  After local therapy, TKI will be resumed  until 
progression of disease (POD) by RECIST criteria.  Patients who ac hieve a comp lete 
response (CR) will not be mandated to have local therapy performed, and TKI will be 
continued. Patients with progressive disease during these 12 weeks such that comp lete local 
therapy is no longer possible will be removed from the study. 
 
The start of the timeline of prtocol assessments begins when the patient starts erlotinib, 
regardless if that was before or after registration on the study. Patients would be required to 
follow the sch edule of assessme nts from the timepoint at which they were registered on 
study. Retroactive pill comp liance will not ned to be comp leted for these patients. Patient 
dosing comp liance will only be required once the patient is registered to the protocol. 
 
4.2 Inter vention 
 
All patients will receive erlotinib 150 mg daily as induction therapy, with dose reductions 
allowed based on p atient’s symptoms. If patients have a PR or SD, definitive local therapies 
will be p erformed on all remaining measurable sites of disease.  Definitive local therapies 
include surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, radiofrequency ablation and 
conventional radiation therapy a nd will be d etermined by respective dep artments (surgery, 
interventional radiology and radiation oncology). Specifically, whole brain radiation therapy 
(WBRT)  and hepatic artery embo lization will not be included as  definitive local treatment 
options.  Per the discretion of the treating MD, a patients erlotinib may be  held for 2 days 
before and up to 14 days after each local treatment, but otherwise will be co ntinued for the 
duration of the trial until progression of disease.

 5.2 Surgery 
 
Resectability of the primary lung lesion will be ass essed by  a thoracic surgeon, and resection 
of metastases will be ev aluated by  the appropriate surgical service, i.e. neurosu rgery for 
CNS lesions, surgical oncology for adrenal lesions, thoracic surgery for lung or intrathoracic 
lesions, etc.  A comp lete resection should be deemed ac hievable in ord er to cons ider 
surgical resection of a site of disease, and the appropri ate extent of resection (anatomic, 
limited resection, etc.) will be at the discretion of the su rgeon, so long as ideally an R0 
resection of the lesion can be obtained (with the exception of bone, where an R0 resection is 
difficult to confirm).  Either minimally invasive or o pen approach es may be uti lized at the 
discretion of the surgeon.  Resection of the lung primary should entail an anatomic resection 
if possible. 
 
5.3 Radiation Therapy 
 
The optimal radiotherapeutic dose  and technique will be d etermined by the radiation 
oncologist. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the preferred technique wherever 
technically feasible. However, conventionally fractionated radiation therapy will also be 
acceptable for lesions or sites de emed su boptimal  for SBRT. The minimum biologically 
effective dose  (BED) to all sites treated with RT is 48Gy10. 
 
5.3.1 SBRT 
 
In general, SBRT should be recommended, prescribed and de livered according to prevailing 
institu tional standards for that anatomic site. In the lung, SBRT should be utilized if there is 
no evidence of intrathoracic nodal metastasis. Preferred regimens include 50Gy in five 
fractions, 48Gy in four fractions, or 54Gy in three fractions, in order to achieve a BED of at 
least 100Gy10, but lower-BED regimens may be chosen in cases  of large tumor volume or 
proximity to critical structures such as  the esophagus. 
 
Brain metastases must be amenable to treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or to 
hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For SRS, treatment regimens will typically entail a 
dose of 16-22Gy in a single fraction. For tumors too large for SRS, hypofractionated 
stereotactic radiotherapy to a dose  of 30Gy in 5 fractions is acceptable. 
 
For other disease sit es, recommended SBRT regimens include 50Gy in five fractions 
(particularly for liver metastase s), 24Gy in one  fraction (primarily for bony metastases), and 
27Gy in 3 fractions. The minimum acceptable SBRT regimen is 30Gy in 5 fractions, 
corresponding to a BED of 48Gy10. 
 
With the exception of brain SRS which may be performed using a frame-based approac h, all 
SBRT should be performed with on-board CT guidance at  the time of each fraction. Where 
appropri ate, motion management techniques should be applied as p er prevailing institutional 
standards of care. Normal tissue co nstraints as per current institutional guidelines should be 
respected.

 5.3.2 Conventionally fractionated ra diotherapy 
 
Where SBRT is not d eemed feasible due  to the size or anatomic location, conventionally 
fractionated radiotherapy is acceptable. The recommended regimen is 45Gy in 15 fractions, 
with 40Gy in 10 fractions as an  acceptable alternative. 30Gy in 10 fractions would not  be 
acceptable, since this is not considered a definitive treatment dose and the BED of this 
regimen is <48Gy10. 3D-conformal radiation techniques, or intens ity-modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT) should be utilized, with the potential exception of  small bony metastases in 
the extremities where no significant advantage from conformal techniques would be 
expected. In general, the PTV should be a minimum of a 1.0cm e xpansion from the GTV, 
with add itional expansions to account for respiratory motion where appro priate. 
 
5.4 Radiofrequency ablation 
 
The optimal ablative therapy will be d etermined by the Interventional Radiologist.  A safe 
approach will be d etermined with the expectancy of completely (A0) ablating the targeted 
tumor.

7.0 REC RUITMENT P LAN 
 
A member of the patient’s treatment team, the protocol investigator or research team at Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center will identify potential research participants. If the investigator is a part 
of the treatment team, s/he will screen the patient as to eligibility, and will discuss the study and the 
possibility of enrollment in the research study with the patient. The preliminary screen of eligibility 
will be co nfirmation of the diagnosis of advanced, oligometastatic NSCLC and confirmation of the 
presence of a sensitizing EGFR mutation within the patient’s tumor.  Potential subjects that meet 
these bas ic criteria will be referred by  their treating physician to the investigator/research staff of the 
study. Minorities and women  are well represented in the thoracic oncology clinics, and we expect 
that they will well represented in the trial accrual. The principal investigator, Helena Yu,  MD , will be 
available to all patients for further questions and information through a contact number which will be 
provided on the consent form itself. 
 
During the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the patient 
may be asked to provide ce rtain hea lth information that is necessary to the recruitment and 
enrollment proce ss. The investigator/research staff may also review portions of their medical records 
at MSKCC in order to further ass ess eligibility. They will use the information pro vided by the patient 
and/or medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible and  to contact the patient regarding study 
enrollment. If the patient turns out to be ineligible for the research study, the research staff will 
destroy all information collected  on the patients during the initial conversation and medical records 
review, except for any information that must be maintained for screening log purposes or processes, 
for example advertisements, p ayments to participants, reimbursement plans, etc.

 8.0 PRETR EATMENT E VALUATION 
 
All aspects of the screening evaluation sh ould be comp leted within four weeks of starting treatment 
unless o therwise no ted. 
 
 Documented prese nce of lung adenocarcinoma harbori ng a sensitizing EGFR mutation 
(L858R, exon 19  deletion, G719A, L861Q, S768I, exon 19 insertions) within the patient’s 
tumor. This may be done at a ny time prior to starting treatment. 
 Medical h istory 
 Baseline tumor assessment with PET/CT and Brain MRI (or CT head with contrast) to assess 
full extent of disease. Other comparable radiologic studies (MRI) can be used as medically 
appropri ate. Radiographic assessments will be d one by  RECIST 1.1. 
 Physical examination, complete vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory 
rate) as well as weight and height.  Height may be docume nted at any time prior to starting 
treatment. 
 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) within 3 months prior to starting treatment 
 Performance status by KPS or ECOG 
 Serum pr egnancy test 
 Complete blood count with differential 
 Comprehensive metabolic panel (glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, 
potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, total protein, albumin, serum bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST) 
 Surgical, Interventional Radiology and /or Radiation Oncology consult to confirm all disease 
sites can  be treated definitively with a local therapy (surgery or radiation therapy).  Patients 
can be e nrolled and started on erlotinib prior to being seen by surgical and/or radiation 
oncology consults. The entire team will discuss each case  to review the most appropriate 
local therapies, and the patient will be se en by the necess ary services. 
 
9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
 
This is a single-arm trial evaluating the feasibility of enrollment and successful completion of a 
treatment plan co nsisting of local therapies and  continued TKI in patients with stage IV 
oligometastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations.  Patients will be 
enrolled at the start of erlotinib for their untreated EGFR-mutant stage IV oligometastatic 
disease. All patients will start with “induction” erlotinib for 12 weeks. If patients have already 
started erlotinib, they are still eligible for this protocol as l ong as they can articulate a clear 
erlotinib start date, have baseline sca ns to review and enrollment and consultations by 
surgical oncology and/or radiation onco logy are completed within 12 weeks of the patient first 
taking erlotinib. The start of the timeline of protocol assessments begins when the patient 
starts erlotinib, regardless if that was before or after registration on  the study. Patients would 
be required to follow the schedule of assessments from the timepoint at which they were 
registered on the study.  Patients who respond (PR/SD) will undergo definitive local 
treatment to all remaining sites  of disease with the goal of rendering the patient free of 
disease. Patients who ac hieve a comp lete response (CR) can continue TKI without any local

 therapy. Patients with progression of disease and are no longer candidates for local 
therapies will be taken off study. Erlotinib will be resumed after local therapies un til 
progression of disease (POD) by RECIST criteria. 
 
 
 
 Definitive local therapies include surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, ablation 
and con ventional radiation therapy 
 After induction TKI (12 weeks), local therapies will be completed sequentially with the 
expectation that all local therapies will be comp leted within 8 months of patient 
enrollment. 
 Per the discretion of the treating MD, a patients erlotinib may be held for 2 days before 
and restarted 2-14 days after each local therapy and otherwise con tinued in between 
therapies. 
 No local therapy will be mandated to any original disease site  that has completely 
regressed during induction erlotinib. Proceeding with local therapy in this situation is at 
the discretion of the treating physicians. 
 For symptomatic purposes, a patient may receive a definitive local therapy prior to 
comp letion of induction erlotinib per treating physician. 
 Patients who have POD during induction erlotinib will not receive local therapies un less 
otherwise necess ary for palliative purposes. 
 
After induction TKI, patients will be monitored for POD and safety/tolerability with repeat 
imaging, physical exam, a nd laboratory tests every 8 weeks for 1 year.  These e valuations 
must be performed at MSKCC sites to ensure consistency of results and facilitate the

 collection of specimens for correlative ana lyses. After 1 year, the patient will be monitored in 
the same manner every 12 weeks until POD. 
 
In order to better understand feasibility, on a monthly basis, we will obtain a list of all patients 
with pos itive EGFR mutant test results by routine molecular testing. We will cross reference 
this list with patients that are seen by thoracic medical oncology and identify the subset that 
has stage IV disease. 
 
We will proceed with enrollment without accrual limitations until 5 patients have succes sfully 
comp leted all intend ed local therapies. To be deemed feasible, at least 5 patients will need to 
be enrolled, comp lete local therapy within two years of the study opening to acc rual.

 11.2 Anti-diarrheal Therapies 
 
Antidiarrheal medications may be introduced if symptoms occur. Previous erlotinib studies 
have sho wn that the frequency and severity of diarrhea rarely hindered administration of 
erlotinib and cou ld be managed with loperamide. The recommended dose of loperamide is 
4mg at first onset, followed by  2mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea-free for 12 hours. 
 
11.3 Anti-rash Ther apies 
 
Rash or  dermatosis can occur within the first several d ays of treatment with erlotinib in many 
patients and has been noted to diminish in severity despite continued treatment. Patients 
should be informed that skin toxicity is expected during treatment with erlotinib. Skin toxicity 
can take the form of dry skin, rash, acneiform eruption, and hair and nail changes. 
Prophylactic treatment of the skin may prevent or reduce skin toxicity. Patients will be 
encouraged to use an  alcohol-free emollient cream or ointment to moisturize dry areas  of the 
body twice a day after therapy  with erlotinib is initiated. Patients will also be  encouraged to 
use a  titanium dioxide or  zinc ox ide based su nscreen product on sun exposed areas  daily. 
Patients with any  skin toxicity will be referred to dermatology for management. 
Recommended treatments may include topical therapy  such as  hydroco rtisone cream or 
clindamycin gel. If needed, oral minocycline or  oral doxycycline may be combined with 
topical therapy. For more severe cases, oral corticosteroids may be administered. Patients 
who fail to respond to these measures  may have erlotinib interrupted, dose reduced or 
discontinued. 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THE RAPEUTIC  RESPONS E/OUTCOME  ASSES SMENT 
 
12.1  Radiograph ic Response  by RECIST  
 
A PET-CT and brain MRI or head CT with contrast will be p erformed at baseline to 
demonstrate all known areas of measurable disease. The baseline study will occur no more 
than 4 weeks prior to erlotinib administration. An alternative imaging test, including MRI or 
CT, can  be us ed in patients with con traindications to the radiographic contrast media used.. 
All patients must have ≤ 5  discrete lesions of disease. 
 
Tumor response will be ass essed us ing RECIST 1.1. The same method (CT scan 
recommended) and the same technique (i.e. with or without contrast) should be used to 
characterize each i dentified and reported lesion at baseline and serially as per  protocol.  If an 
appropri ate imaging study is done early for any reason (i.e. hospitalization), it can be used  
for disease ass essment. A designated radiologist/physician will be responsible for 
interpretation of the study imaging according to RECIST 1.1. 
 
All measurab le lesions, up to a maximum of 5 lesions total, representative of all 
involved or gans should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured  at 
baseline. Definitions of response in target and non-target lesions are described in Table 12.1 
and 12.2 below. Table 12.3 provides overall responses for all possible combinations of tumor 
responses in target and nontarget lesions.

13.0 CRITERIA FOR R EMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time. All patients who receive at least one dose of 
treatment with erlotinib will be e valuable for toxicity and outcomes. Patients who discontinue early 
should return within 30 days of the last dose of the study drugs for a follow up e valuation. Any 
assessments listed for the final visit as per the study calendar will be p erformed at that time. 
 
Patients will be withdrawn from the study therapy should they experience any of the following: 
 Intolerable or persistent grade 3 or 4 toxicities with erlotinib 
 Disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) to an extent that makes local therapy 
impossible per the respective treating physician.  Pathological co nfirmation is not required 
unless cl inically indicated.  
 
Other reasons for study discontinuation include, but are not limited to: 
 Change in patient eligibility 
 Clinical deterioration or non-comp liance with the defined treatment plan leading to inability to 
comp lete all local therapies or co ntinue erlotinib 
 Protocol violation 
 Investigator’s d ecision based on patient’s best interest  
 Withdrawal of consent 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Death

 14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
14.1 Pri mary Objective 
 
The primary objective of this study will be to determine the feasibility of accrual and comp letion of 
the proposed treatment strategy of induction EGFR-directed  tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy 
followed by local therapies in a 2  year time frame in patients newly diagnosed with oligometastatic 
lung cancer. The treatment strategy will be d eemed feasible if at least five patients are enrolled, 
respond to induction TKI therapy, and successfully comp lete all protoco l-directed  local therapy within 
2 years. At least five patients will need to complete local therapy within 2 years of the study being 
open to accrual for the primary endpoint to be met. We are choos ing to initially perform a small 
feasibility study to ens ure that we will be a ble to identify sufficient eligible subjects to proceed with 
further investigation of this study concept. We will proceed  with enrollment without accrual  limitations 
until 5 pa tients have successfully comp leted all intend ed local therapies. We will assess accrual after 
the study is open for 2 years. We will be n oting the number of patients enrolled that are needed in 
order  to have 5 patients successfully comp lete local therapy within the 2 year time. 
 
 
 
14.2 Seconda ry Objective 
 
We will collect information on  the following efficacy measures and report them at the patient 
level 
 
- time to progression following enrollment 
- time to progression following completion of local therapy 
- time to death 
- local control at site of local therapy 
- time on TKI before a new systemic therapy is required 
 
Safety and Tolerability 
 
Toxicity grading will be p erformed in acc ordance with NCI CTCAE, version 4.0 during every 
clinical visit as per pr otocol.  Adverse events will be reported at the patient level. 
 
14.3 Correl ative Objective 
 
The objectives be low are exploratory in nature. We will perform the following statistical 
analyses, understanding that they are hypothesis-generating only. 
 
MSK-IMPACT testing on primary and metastatic tumor sp ecimens 
 
MSK IMPACT testing will be performed on matched metastatic tumors a nd primary 
lung tumors. The molecular aberrations detected will be compared  in a descriptive fashion. 
 
Cell free plasma DNA as biomarker for recurrent disease 
 
cfDNA will be measured during patients’ treatment course and plotted over time, both 
individually and as summary statistics  (median, range).

15.1 Research Participant Registration 
Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility. 
Obtain informed co nsent, by following proced ures defined in section entitled Informed 
Consent Procedures. 
 
During the registration process registering individuals will be required to complete a protocol 
specific Eligibility Checklist. 
 
All participants must be registered through the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) Office 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PPR is available Monday through Friday from 
8:30am  – 5:30pm at 646-735-8000. Registrations must be submitted via the PPR Electronic 
Registration System (http://ppr/). The completed signature page of the written co nsent/RA or 
verbal sc ript/RA, a comp leted Eligibility Checklist and other relevant documents must be 
uploaded via the PPR Electronic Registration System. 
 
15.2 Randomization 
 
This is a single-arm, non-randomized study. 
 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUE S 
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be ass igned to the study. The responsibilities of the RSA 
include project comp liance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory 
monitoring, problem resolution and p rioritization, and co ordinate the activities of the protocol study 
team. The data collected  for this study will be e ntered into a secure database (Clinical Research 
Database  (CRD B). Source doc umentation will be available to supp ort the compu terized patient 
record. The principal investigator will maintain ultimate responsibility for the clinical trial. 
 
16.1 Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accrua ls and comp leteness 
of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data 
and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and  extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will 
be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential prob lems will be bro ught 
to the attention of the study team for discuss ion and acti on. Random-sample data quality 
and protocol compliance audits will be co nducted by the study team, at a minimum of two 
times per year, more frequently if indicated.

 16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by  the National Cancer Institute in September 2001. The plans address  the 
new policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can  be found at: 
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/patientsafety/dsm-guidelines/page1 
 
 
The DSM Plans at MSKCC were estab lished and are monitored by  the Office of Clinical 
Research.  The MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC 
Intranet at: 
http://smskpsps9/dept/ocr/OCR%20Website%20Documents/Clinical%20Research%2 0Qualit 
y%20Assurance%2 0(CRQA)/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20 Safety%20Monitoring%20 Plan.p 
df 
 
 
There are several d ifferent mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for data safety 
and quality. There are institu tional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on  clinical research QA) and dep artmental proced ures for quality control, plus 
there are two institutional co mmittees that are responsible for monitoring the acti vities of our 
clinical trials programs. The Data and  Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reports to the 
Center’s R esearch Council and Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol  will be ass essed for its 
level or risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of  protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sp onsored, industry sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be addressed and 
the monitoring procedures will be estab lished at the time of protocol activation. 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Prior to the enrollment of each patient, the risks, benefits and objectives of the study will be reviewed 
with the participant, including a discuss ion of the possible toxicities and side effects. Alternative, 
non-protocol, treatment options will be d iscuss ed with the patient. It will be reviewed that 
participation in this clinical trial is voluntary and that the patient may withdraw consent at any time. 
The study is designed with careful safety monitoring for toxicity including physician visits. Specific 
guidelines for symptom management are in place to protect the study participant. 
 
Human  Subjects Involvement and Characteristics: All patients at MSKCC who meet the inclusion 
criteria will be e ligible. 5 patients will be e nrolled in this study. Patients eligible will be 18 years of 
age or older with a KPS of 70% or grea ter. Both men and women  and members of all ethn ic groups 
are eligible for this trial. Pregnant and breast-feeding women  are excluded from this study. This 
protocol does not include children because the number of children is expected to be limited for the 
patient population expected to be accrued onto this study. Also, the majority of children are already 
accessed by  a nationwide ped iatric cancer research ne twork. This statement is based on  exclusion

IRB #: 15-067 A(8) 
Approved: 19-APR-2017 
Page  27 of 33  
 4b of the NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research 
Involving Human  Subjects. 
 
Consent process: All patients at MSKCC who meet the inclusion criteria will be eligible. Participation 
in the trial is voluntary. All patients will be required to sign a statement of informed co nsent, which 
must conform to IRB guidelines. The informed consent procedure is described in Section 18.0. 
 
Possible Toxicities/Side-Effects: There are risks associated with treatment as des cribed in Section 
11.0; however, patients screened for enrollment will be d eemed  appropriate for treatment 
independent of this study. 
 
Benefits: The add ition of definitive local therapies has the potential to prolong pr ogress ion free 
survival and improve the overall survival compar ed to standard treatment with erlotinib. Patients who 
progress on treatment can still receive standard, second-line systemic therapies and/or can 
participate in an alternative clinical trial. 
 
Costs:  Patients will be ch arged for physician visits, routine laboratory tests and radiologic studies 
required for monitoring their condition. The patient/patient’s insurance will be billed for erlotinib and 
all local therapies as  a part of the patients standard treatment course. CLIA-certified mutation testing 
(i.e. EGFR mutation by fragment analysis, Sequenom or standard sequencing) will be b illed to the 
patient/patient’s insurance.  Research bloods and  any other mutation testing that is not required as 
part of the patient’s standard of care will not be billed to the patient/patient’s insurance. 
 
Alternatives: The alternative to this trial would be treatment with erlotinib monotherapy at the 
standard, FDA approved dose of 150mg orally daily, without local therapies. 
 
Confidentiality: Every effort will be made to maintain patient confidentiality. Research and  hospital 
records are confidential. Patients’ n ames and  any other identifying information will not be used in 
reports or publications resulting from this study. Other authorized agencies and appropriate internal 
personnel (e.g. qualified monitors from MSKCC ), the FDA, and/or other governmental agencies) 
may review patient records as  required. 
 
Patient safety: Patients are monitored by physicians and onco logy nurses who are  very familiar with 
clinical trials. In the case  of an adverse reaction, immediate medical attention is available. In the 
evenings and weekends, we have a 24-hour urgent care facility for outpatients. The PI or co-PI will 
also be  available at all times to organize any  necessary intervention. 
 
Monitoring of data to ensure safety: This study is to be monitored by the institu tional IRB. This 
incorporates an independent data and  safety monitoring committee estab lished by arrangement with 
the National Cancer Institute. The analysis of safety will include all patients. Adverse events, 
including all toxic effects of treatment, will be tabulated individually, and summarized by  severity and 
causality

 17.1 Privacy 
 
MSKCC’ s Privacy Office may allow the use  and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a comp leted and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research 
Authorization form. A Research Authorization form must be comp leted by  the Principal 
Investigator and approved by  the IRB and Privacy Bo ard (IRB/PB). 
 
17.2 Serious Adverse E vent (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse event 
 An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to cond uct 
normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in deat h, be life threatening, or 
require hosp italization may be co nsidered serious when, based u pon medical judgmen t, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or  surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
Note: Hospital admission for a planned procedure/disease treatment is not considered an 
SAE. 
 
 
SAE reporting is required as soon  as the participant signs consent.  SAE reporting is 
required for 30-days after the participant’s last investigational treatment or intervention. Any 
events that occur after the 30-day period and that are at least possibly related to protocol 
treatment must be reported. 
 
If an SAE requires submission to the IRB office per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events’, the SAE report must be sent to the IRB within 5 calendar days of the event. 
The IRB requires a Clinical Research Database (CRDB ) SAE report be submitted 
electronically to the SAE Office as  follows: 
 
For IND/IDE trials: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
saegrade 5@mskcc.org. All other reports should be sent to saemskind@mskcc.org. 
 
For all other trials: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
saegrade 5@mskcc.org. All other reports should be sent to sae@mskcc.org.

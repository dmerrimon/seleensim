This is a multi -institutional,  non-randomized,  open -label,  phase  II study  of 6 cycles  of 
rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  and prednisone  (R-CHOP)  
followed  by 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  a 90Y-labeled  anti-CD20  murine  antibody,  in 
patients  60 years  or older  with previously  untreated  high risk diffuse  large  B-cell 
lymphoma.  
 
In part I of the study,  patients  will receive  R-CHOP  chemotherapy  at standard  doses  
every  21 days for a total of 6 cycles  with pegfilgrastim  (or G-CSF)  and prophylactic  
Darbepoetin  alfa support.  
 
In part II of the study,  patients  will receive  a loading  dose of rituximab,  250 mg/m2, over 
3-5 hours  on Day 0. This is followed  by an imaging  dose of 111In ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  
Two or three  gamma  camera  images  will be taken  at 2-24 hours,  48-72 hours,  and, if 
needed,  90-120 hours  after injection  of 111In ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  On Day 7, a second  
loading  dose of rituximab  250 mg/m2 over 3-5 hours  will be given,  immediately  followed  
by 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  Patients  with baseline  platelet  counts  150,000  will receive  
a 0.4 mCi/kg  dose,  and patients  with platelet  counts  of 100,000 -149,000  will receive  a 0.3 
mCi/kg  dose.  The dose is given  via slow  IV push  over 10 minutes.

2.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
 
The primary  efficacy  endpoints  for this study  evaluating  the sequential  administration  of 
6 cycles  of R-CHOP  with pegfilgrastim  (or G-CSF)  and Prophylactic  Darbepoetin  alfa 
support  followed  by 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  for patients  60 years  of age or older  with 
previously  untreated  high-intermediate  or high risk by the age adjusted  International  
prognostic  index  (aaIPI  = 2 or 3, respectively)  diffuse large  B-cell lymphoma  are to 
determine:  
• progression  free survival  (PFS)  
• overall  survival  (OS)  
 
The primary  safety  endpoints  are to determine:  
• the incidence  of adverse  experiences  
• hematologic  toxicity  (white  blood  cell, hemoglobin,  and platelet  nadir;  transfusion  
requirements)  
• cardiac  toxicity  – the incidence  of LV dysfunction  and cardiomyopathy  as 
assessed  by echocardiography  
 
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of the study  are to determine:  
• the predictive  value  of detecting  minimal  residual  disease  by molecular  
techniques  for future  relapse/recurrence  
• the treatment  response  rate for R-CHOP  
• Event  free survival  (EFS)  
• The packed  red blood  cell transfusion  requirements,  change  in hemoglobin  (Hgb)  
from  baseline,  and incidence  of anemia  (CTC  grading)  with Prophylactic  
Darbepoetin  alfa support.  Hgb response  and correction  with darbepoetin  alfa is 
defined  as: an increase  of 2.0 gm/dl  from  baseline  and an Hgb 12.0 g/dl, 
respectively,  in the absence  of RBC  transfusion  in the preceding  21 days.  
• A comparison  of baseline  FACT -An QOL  scores  with subsequent  evaluations  will 
be performed  to correlate  the impact  of darbepoetin  alfa on this QOL  measure.  
• The conversion  rate to CR with 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  for patients  with a PR 
post R-CHOP  
• the effects  of sequential  R-CHOP  and 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  on hematopoietic  
progenitor  cells as determined  by stem  cell assays  performed  by Dr. Malcolm  
Moore’s  laboratory.

Diffuse  large  B-cell lymphoma  (DLBCL)  is a potentially  curable  subtype  of non- 
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  with an increasing  frequency  in elderly  patients.  In the 
International  NHL  Prognostic  Factors  Project,  age was found  to be an important  adverse  
prognostic  factor,  affecting  both relapse -free and overall  survival.  For elderly  patients  in 
that study,  5-year survival  rates  for low, low intermediate,  high-intermediate,  and high 
risk disease  were  56%,  44%,  37%,  and 21%,  respectively  (see table). 1 Other  smaller,  
earlier  studies  have  also confirmed  the poor prognosis  seen in elderly  patients. 2-5 The 
reasons  for the poor outcomes  in elderly  patients  are unclear.  DLBCL  may be inherently  
more  biologically  aggressive  in elderly  patients  than in younger  patients.  Co-morbid  
conditions  in the elderly  often  complicate  treatment,  leading  to poorer  outcomes. 6 
Increased  treatment -related  toxicities  are seen in the elderly,  and can be life-threatening  
(e.g.,  neutropenic  sepsis)  or can lead to dose reductions  which  result  in lower  dose 
intensity  and a higher  rate of treatment  failure. 7,8

Based  on the Shipp  data (1) for patients  >60 years  of age, CR rates  range  from  36-91% 
depending  on the aaIPI  group.  For patients  with High  Intermediate  and High  Risk 
disease,  only 56% and 36% respectively  will attain  a CR with CHOP  therapy.  Of these  
patients  attaining  a CR, between  59% and 63% will relapse  by 5 years  despite  obtaining  
an initial  CR. Attempts  to improving  this scenario  have  been the focus  of many  
subsequent  trials.  
 
Supportive  care advances  with CHOP  
 
Several  efforts  have  been  made  at improving  treatment  outcomes  in elderly  patients  with 
DLBCL.  The use of hematopoietic  growth  factors  with CHOP  chemotherapy  has shown  
promise  in the management  and prevention  of febrile  neutropenia.  The NCCN  
recommends  all patients  aged  70 years  or older  and treated  with CHOP  chemotherapy  
receive  prophylactic  pegfilgrastim  or G-CSF support.  In a retrospective  series  of 50 
consecutive  elderly  patients  with DLBCL  treated  with CHOP  and G-CSF,  Donnelly  et al 
reported  a high dose intensity  and response,  with overall  survival  rates  comparable  to the 
cohort  of patients  under  the age of 60 used to established  the age-adjusted  International  
Prognostic  Index  (IPI). 9 Improved  response  rates  and dose-intensity  were  also reported  in 
a recent  prospective  cohort  of 20 elderly  patients. 10

Less information  is available  on the impact  of anemia  following  chemotherapy.  
Traditional  cutoffs  for transfusion  have  included  hemoglobin  (Hgb)  <8g/dl  in the absence  
of coronary  artery  disease  and <10g/dl  in the presence  of coronary  artery  disease  to 
prevent  myocardial  ischemia.  More  recent  evidence  in non-hematologic  malignancies  
suggests  amelioration  of cancer  related  fatigue  and quality  of life declines  with 
maintenance  of Hgb levels  between  11-13 g/dl. 11. The NCCN  has recommended  elderly  
patients  receiving  chemotherapy  have  Hgb maintained  12g/dl.  Maintenance  of 
functionality  in the elderly  population  is paramount,  with deterioration  of ADLs  leading  to 
dependence,  inability  to receive  additional  therapy,  and potentially  requiring  
institutionalization.  
 
Erythropoietin  given  weekly  has been  shown  to significantly  increase  Hgb levels,  
decrease  transfusion  requirements,  and improve  functional  status  and fatigue.  14% and 
19% of patients  in the GELA  study  had grade  3 or 4 anemia  with R-CHOP  and CHOP  
therapy,  respectively. 12 Although  data for grade  I and II anemia  with CHOP  are largely  
unreported,  one study  of 174 patients  reported  a 49% incidence  of grade  I/II anemia  and 
17% grade  III 13. The maintenance  of adequate  Hgb levels  is desirable,  but 
erythropoietin  therapy  necessitates  weekly  injections.  Darbepoetin  Alfa (Aranesp)  is a 
biochemically  distinct  form  of recombinant  human  erythropoietin,  containing  additional  
sialic  acid residues  that prolong  the serum  half-life. 14 Darbepoetin  alfa has been  
demonstrated  to have  a dose dependent  relationship  and can feasibly  be administered  on a 
reduced  frequency  schedule  with combination  chemotherapy,  still retaining  efficacy  
benefits. 15 
 
D. Kotasek  et. Al. reported  updated  results  of a randomized,  double -blind,  placebo  
controlled,  phase  I/II dose finding  study  of Aranesp  administered  once  every  three  weeks  
in solid  tumor  patients.  16 259 patients  were  randomized  to receive  either  Aranesp  
(doses:  4.5-15 g/kg/q3wk)  or placebo.  Results  for the first four dosing  cohorts  were  
reported,  demonstrating  a 51% response  rate at the 4.5 g/kg/q3wk  dose,  with a mean  
change  in hemoglobin  of 0.6 gm/dl  and a 52% response  rate at the 6.75 g/kg/q3wk  dose,  
with a mean  change  in hemoglobin  of 1.2 gm/dl.  Increasing  the dose to 9.0 and 12 
g/kg/q3k  results  in a dose response  increase  in the response  rate and change  in 
hemoglobin  (61%/1.3  gm/dl  and 71%/2.6gm/dl  respectively).  The ability  to administer  
darbepoetin  alfa in concert  with R-CHOP  would  prove  both cost effective  regarding  
resource  allocation  and improve  patients  convenience  by deceasing  the number  of 
hospital  visits  (from  every  week  to every  three  weeks).  Subsequently,  Reardon  et. Al. 
(ASH  #3783,  Blood  102(11),  Nov 16,2003),  p20B)  reported  on 112 patients  effectively  
treated  with 300 micrograms  every  3 weeks.  We plan to investigate  the ability  of 
Aranesp,  delivered  at a more  convenient  dosing  schedule  q3 weeks  in conjunction  with 
R-CHOP,  to ameliorate  the anemia  associated  with chemotherapy  and 
radioimmunotherapy.  
 
Rituximab  monoclonal  antibody  therapy

Anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  therapy  has been  one of the most  important  advances  in 
the management  of B-cell lymphoid  malignancies  over the past few years.  Rituximab,  a 
chimeric  anti-C20 antibody,  exerts  its anti-tumor  effect  by directly  inducing  apoptosis,  by 
activating  complement,  and by antibody  dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity.  It has been  
shown  to produce  objective  responses  in approximately  50% of patients  with relapsed  or 
refractory  low-grade  or follicular  NHLs. 17 In patients  with relapsed  or refractory  
aggressive  lymphomas  (including  DLBCL),  Coiffier  and colleagues  found  a response  rate 
of 31% when  an 8-week  course  of rituximab  is used. 18 
 
Coiffier  et al recently  reported  24 month  median  follow -up of the GELA  study  which  
randomized  399 elderly  patients  with newly  diagnosed  DLBCL  to receive  either  8 cycles  
of CHOP  or CHOP  with rituximab  (R-CHOP).  Sixty  percent  of the patients  had age- 
adjusted  international  prognostic  index  (aaIPI)  high-intermediate  or high-risk disease.  
The complete  response  rates  in the R-CHOP  cohort  were  significantly  higher  (76%  vs. 
63%),  and at a median  followup  of 18 months  the event -free survival  (62%  vs. 43%)  and 
overall  survival  (73%  vs. 61%)  was also significantly  improved,  with statistical  
significance  continuing  at 24 months  12,19 . 
 
The GELA  data was updated  at ASH  2003  and continues  to hold true with 4 years  
median  followup  (Figure  below).  Event  free survival  for high-risk patients  by IPI is 
roughly  45% at 48 months.  Consequently,  the magnitude  of rituximab’s  benefit  appears  
to be less in the high-risk groups  compared  with the low risk groups..  These  results  are 
encouraging,  and represent  an important  advance  in the management  of elderly  patients  
with DLBCL.  However,  significant  room  for improvement  remains.

Toxicity  of R-CHOP  
 
The addition  of Rituximab  to CHOP  chemotherapy  was well tolerated  and not associated  
with significant  increases  in toxicity.  The grade  3 and 4 adverse  events  were  consistent  
with expected  toxic  effects  of CHOP,  occurring  with similar  frequency.  Hematologic  
toxicity  was not associated  with increased  neutropenic  infections  (12%  R-CHOP  vs 20% 
CHOP)  nor increased  grade  3 or 4 anemia  (14%  R-CHOP  vs 19% CHOP).  12. Increased  
cardiac  toxicity  (47%  for R-CHOP  vs. 35% for CHOP)  predominantly  reflected  increased  
grade  1 events  related  to rituximab  infusion  (24%  RCHOP  vs 13% CHOP)  with an 
equivalent  incidence  of grade  3 and 4 events  (8 %) in both groups. 12 
 
Anthracycline  induced  cardiomyopathy  remains  a rare but serious  dose related  
consequence  of therapy  with doxorubicin.  The risk of cardiomyopathy  has been  reported  
to be increased  in patients  > age 70, with hypertension,  with coronary  artery  disease,  and 
with combination  chemotherapy.  Elderly  patients  are likely  to experience  congestive  
heart  failure  at a lower  cumulative  dose. 20 Given  the unknown  cardiotoxicity  of 
sequential  R-CHOP  and RIT, we will prospectively  evaluate  echocardiographic  
determinations  of LV function.

Radioimmunotherapy  represents  an emerging  therapeutic  modality  that involves  the 
conjugation  of radionuclides  to monoclonal  antibodies  in an attempt  to enhance  tumor  
cell kill and treatment  outcomes.  The monoclonal  antibody  maintains  its anti-tumor  
efficac y and is augmented  by the addition  of a beam  of gamma  or beta radiation  directed  
at tumor  tissue  adjacent  to the target  binding  site. In the case of lymphoid  malignancies,  
the radionuclides  most  commonly  conjugated  to anti-CD20  antibodies  are iodine -131 
(131I) and yttrium -90 (90Y). Limitations  of I131 use include  hypothyroidism  and the 
inconvenience  of gamma  radiation,  which  necessitates  isolation  precautions  for several  
days following  its administration.  Potential  advantages  of 90Y include  ease of 
administration  since  it is a pure beta emitter,  which  facilitates  outpatient  administration,  
and a longer  path length  of 5-10 mm, which  results  in improved  cell kill in adjacent  tumor  
tissue.  While  90Y provides  therapeutic  advantages,  it cannot  be used for imaging.  The 
gamma  emitter  111In has been  successfully  used as an imaging  agent  prior  to the 90Y- 
labeled  antibody.  A dose of 5 mCi 111In-labeled  antibody  is one that balances  safety  and 
imaging  efficacy  21-24, allowing  for the determination  of expected  biodistribution  with 
the therapeutic  dose.  
 
Ibritumomab  tiuxetan  is a murine  immunoglobulin  G1 kappa  monoclonal  antibody  
(ibritumomab)  covalently  bound  to MX-DTPA  (tiuxetan)  that chelates  the radioisotope  
90Y. In a phase  I/II trial involving  patients  with relapsed  or refractory  low-grade  or 
transformed  low-grade  NHL,  the maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  was 0.4 mCi/kg  (or 0.3 
mCi/kg  for patients  with baseline  platelet  counts  of 100,000 -149,000).  The overall  
response  rate for the 51 patients  treated  at the MTD was  67% (26%  CR, 41% PR). For 
patients  who transformed  to intermediate -grade  disease  (n=14),  the overall  response  rate 
was 43%. 25 These  results  appear  superior  to immunotherapy  alone  when  used in a 
similar  patient  population.  The final results  of a phase  III study  were  presented  at the 
ASH  2000  meeting  which  randomized  143 patients  with relapsed  or refractory  low-grade  
or transformed  low grade  NHL  to receive  rituximab  or 90Y- ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  The 
overall  response  rate was 80% in the radioimmunotherapy  arm vs. 56% in the rituximab  
arm (p=0.002),  and the CR rate was significantly  improved  (30%  vs. 16%,  p=0.04).  
Response  durations  did not significantly  diffe r between  the two arms. 26 
 
The effect  of radioimmunotherapy  on stem  cell precursors  is currently  not known.  
Preliminary  reports  from  the Mayo  Clinic  have  demonstrated  the feasibility  of 
administering  additional  chemotherapy  for relapse  post Zevalin,  as well as reporting  5/6 
successful  peripheral  blood  stem  cell mobilizations  following  Zevalin  (all patients  
regaining  adequate  counts  post ASCT). 27 We plan to evaluate  stem  cell progenitor  
assays  before  and after radioimmunotherapy  in this group  of transplant  ineligible  patients  
(see Appendix  D). 
 
Hypothesis  
 
The number  of elderly  patients  and the incidence  of NHL  in this population  continue  to 
increase  annually.  Elderly  patients  (age >60)  have  a poorer  prognosis  with standard

CHOP  chemotherapy  compared  with younger  patients  and historically  have  been  under - 
represented  in clinical  trials.  The data from  the GELA  demonstrate  that the addition  of 
immunotherapy  (rituximab)  to CHOP  may improve  outcomes  in elderly  patients  with 
DLBCL.  Supportive  care measures  such as G-CSF and Prophylactic  Darbepoetin  help to 
maintain  dose intensity  and minimize  toxicity.  Elderly  patients  age >65 and many  aged  
60-65 are not candidates  for potentially  curative  second -line transplant  regimens  should  
they have  relapsed  or refractory  disease.  Therefore,  it is paramount  that new regimens  be 
designed  to improve  upon  the quality  and durability  of the upfront  treatment.  Preliminary  
data show  superior  response  rates  with radioimmunotherapy  over standard  immunotherapy  
when  used alone  in low-grade  and transformed  NHL,  raising  the possibility                   
that combinations  with chemotherapy  could  improve  results.  
 
In follicular  lymphoma,  wher e BCL -2 represents  a useful  marker  to assess  for minimal  
residual  disease,  patients  with PCR  positive  CRs (molecular  residual  disease)  who are 
were  treated  with rituximab  following  CHOP  and subsequently  achieved  PCR  negativity  
had superior  freedom  from  recurrence  compared  with those  patients  never  achieving  PCR  
negativity  (57%  vs 20%;  p<0.001).  28 This lends  credence  to the premise  that relapses  
result  from  residual  but clinically  undetectable  disease.  In a similar  vein,  the presence  of 
minimal  residual  disease  in intermediate  and high grade  lymphoma  patients  following  
ASCT,  as detected  by PCR  IgH gene  rearrangements,  was associated  with relapse  in 6/6 
cases,  while  13/13  PCR  negative  patients  remained  in CR 29 We plan to prospectively  
evaluate  the prognostic  significance  of minimally  residual  disease  present  after R-CHOP  
and RIT (See Appendix  C) and to give additional  therapy  in the form  of RIT to in hopes  
of targeting  minimal  residual  disease  and improving  durable  remissions.  
 
Consequently,  we hypothesize  that the addition  of targeted  consolidative  
radioimmunotherapy  following  R-CHOP  treatment  may decrease  future  relapses  and 
improve  survival.  We propose  a phase  II study  evaluating  the feasibility,  efficacy,  and 
safety  of a sequential  program  of R-CHOP  with pegfilgrastim  or G-CSF and Prophylactic  
Darbepoetin  alfa support  followed  by consolidation  with 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  We 
will prospectively  evaluate  for molecular  evidence  of minimally  residua l disease,  
correlating  this data with future  outcome,  and assess  the impact  of this regimen  on bone  
marrow  progenitor  cells.  The safety  of RIT following  R-CHOP  will also be investigated.  
 
 
4.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a multi -institution,  non-randomized,  open -label,  phase  II study  of 6 cycles  of 
rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  and prednisone  (R-CHOP)  
followed  by 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  a 90Y-labeled  anti-CD20  murine  antibody,  in 
patients  60 years  or older  with high risk (aaIPI  2 or 3), previously  untreated  diffuse  large  
B-cell lymphoma.  
 
In part I of the study,  patients  will receive  R-CHOP  chemotherapy  at standard  doses  
every  21 days for a total of 6 cycles  with G-CSF growth  factor  support.  In addition,  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#: 02 -090A(9)  
Amended:9/11/07  Page  12 of 54  
  
prophylactic  Darbepoetin  alfa will be administered  every  3 weeks  throughout  the duration  
of this study.  After  the 4th and 6th cycles,  patients  will be assessed  for treatment    
response.  Intrathecal  chemotherapy  prophylaxis  will be given  for patients  deemed  at risk. 
Bone  marrow  examinations  will also be performed  to assess  for minimal  residual  disease  
(See Appendix  C) and hematopoietic  progenitor  cell assays  (See Appendix  D). Patients  
with a confirmed  or unconfirmed  complete  response  and patie nts with a partial  response  
(who  continue  to be ineligible  for autologous  stem cell transplantation)  will proceed  to the 
radioimmunotherapy  (RIT)  part (part  II) of the study.  Pre-RIT, patients  will be re- staged  
and must  have  a bone  marrow  biopsy  with <25%  involvement  by lymphoma,         
adequate  cellularity,  and preserved  cardiac  function.  Earlier  work  has shown  that 
rituximab  levels  are not immediately  cleared  from  tumor  binding  sites.  30. Consequently,  
90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  therapy  will be delayed  6-9 weeks  after completion  of R- 
CHOP  in order  to expose  more  CD20  binding  sites.  Rituximab  and B-cell levels  will be 
measured  following  R-CHOP  and prior  to RIT.  
 
In part II of the study,  6-9 weeks  (42-63 days)  after D1 of the last R-CHOP  cycle,  
patients  will receive  a loading  dose of rituximab,  250 mg/m2, over 3-5 hours  on Day 0. 
This is followed  immediately  by a 10 minute  IV push infusion  of 1.6 mg of 111In 
ibritumomab  tiuxetan  (containing  5 mCi of 111In). Imaging  will be obtained  2-24 hours  
following  111In ibritumomab  tiuxetan  infusion.  Whole  body  anterior  and posterior  images  
will be acquired.  Imaging  will be repeated  at 48-72 hours.  The 111In imaging  will be done  
to ensure  expected  biodistribution,  rather  than tumor  dosimetry.  Additionally,  since  this 
study  is evaluating  the role of 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  following  chemotherapy  in 
patients  who may be in clinical  remission,  tumor  uptake  is not required  for patient  
eligibility  for 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  administration.  On Day 7, a second  loading  dose 
of rituximab  250 mg/m2 over 3-5 hours  will be given,  immediately  followed  by 90Y- 
ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  Patients  with baseline  platelet  counts  150,000  will receive  a 0.4 
mCi/kg  dose,  and patients  with platelet  counts  of 100,000 -149,999  will receive  a 0.3 
mCi/kg  dose.  The dose is given  via slow  IV push  over 10 minutes.  
 
Patients  will be followed  weekly  during  RIT. The nadir  with 90Y ibritumomab  tiuxetan  is 
expected  starting  week  6-8. Patients  will then be assessed  for treatment  response  at week  
12-13. Bone  marrow  examinations  to assess  for minimal  residual  disease  and 
hematopoietic  progenitor  cell assays  will be repeated.  
 
FACT -anemia  quality  of life (QOL)  evaluations  will be performed  at baseline,  at Part I 
restaging  (between  cycles  4&5),  post/chemotherapy/pre -RIT restaging,  and following  RIT 
(week  12-13). Correlation  of FACT -anemia  scores  with hematologic  parameters  and 
impact  of RIT will be assessed.  
 
The primary  efficacy  endpoints  for this study  are to determine  the progression  free 
survival  (PFS)  and overall  survival  (OS)  of the sequential  administration  of 6 cycles  of R- 
CHOP  with pegfilgrastim  (or G-CSF)  and Prophylactic  Darbepoetin  alfa support   
followed  by 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  for patients  60 years  of age or older  with 
previously  untreated  diffuse  large  B-cell lymphoma.

The secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of the study  are to determine  the predictive  value  of 
detecting  minimal  residual  disease  by molecular  techniques  for future  relapse/recurrence,  
the treatment  response  rate for R-CHOP,  the packed  red blood  cell transfusion  
requirements,  incidence  of anemia,  and change  in hemoglobin  (Hgb)  from  baseline  with 
Prophylactic  Darbepoetin  alfa support,  impact  of anemia  and darbepoetin  alfa use on 
QOL  measures,  impact  of RIT on QOL  measures,  cardiotoxicity  as assessed  by 
echocardiography,  the conversion  rate to CR with 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  for patients  
with a PR post R-CHOP,  the effects  of sequential  R-CHOP  and 90Y-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  on hematopoietic  progenitor  cells.  
 
The safety  endpoints  are to determine  the incidence  of adverse  experiences,  hematologic  
toxicity  (e.g.,  white  blood  cell, hemoglobin,  and platele t nadir)  anduse  of supportive  care.  
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC  AGENTS  
 
5.1 Cyclophosphamide  
5.1.1 Description,  Pharmacology,  Storage  and Preparation  
Cyclophosphamide,  a nitrogen  mustard  derivative,  is a polyfunctional  
agent.  The drug is a monohydrate,  white  crystalline  powder  and is soluble  
in water  and in alcohol.  Cyclophosphamide  is biotransformed  principally  in 
the liver to active  alkylating  metabolites  by a mixed  function      
microsomal  oxidase  system.  It is eliminated  primarily  in the form  of 
metabolites;  however,  5-25% of the dose is excreted  in urine  as unchanged  
drug.  The elimination  half-life after oral administration  is 3-12 hours.  The 
preparation  and storage  of cyclophosphamide  should  follow  the 
manufacturer’s  recommendations.  
5.1.2 Toxicities  
Toxicities  from  cyclophosphamide  consist  of nausea  and vomiting,  
anorexia,  diarrhea,  abdominal  discomfort,  alopecia,  skin rash,  leukopenia,  
thrombocytopenia,  anemia,  hemorrhagic  cystitis,  interstitial  pneumonitis,  
and urinary  bladder  fibrosis.  Cyclophosphamide  causes  dose-limiting  
myelosuppression  and hemorrhagic  cystitis.  Myelosuppression  consists  of 
leukopenia  and thrombocytopenia.  Leukopenia  nadir  and time of recovery  
usually  occur  at 8-14 days and 18-25 days,  respec tively.  Development  of 
hemorrhagic  cystitis  is dependent  on the dose of cyclophosphamide  and 
the duration  for therapy.  Prophylactic  measures,  including  forced  diuresis  
and hydration,  have  been  shown  to be effective  in preventing  bladder  
toxicity.  
 
Secondary  malignancies,  mostly  bladder  carcinomas  and acute  leukemias,  
have  been  shown  to be associated  in patients  treated  with 
cyclophosphamide  alone  or in conjunction  with other  agents  or modalities.  
Occurrence  of secondary  malignancies  may occur  several  years  after 
treatment.

Cyclophosphamide  decreases  serum  pseudocholinesterase  concentrations  
and may prolong  the neuromuscular  blocking  activity  of succinylcholine,  
especially  in very ill patients  receiving  large  intravenous  doses  of 
cyclophosphamide.  If a patient  is to receive  anesthesia,  the 
anesthesiologist  should  be notified  if the patient  has received  
cyclophosphamide  within  10 days of the procedure.  
 
Cyclophosphamide  is a know  teratogen  and impairs  oogenesis  and 
spermatogenesis.  Sterility  may occur  in both sexes  and may be 
irreversible.  
5.2 Doxorubicin  
5.2.1 Description,  Pharmacology,  Storage  and Preparation    
Doxorubicin  is a cytotoxic  anthracycline  antibiotic  isolated  from  cultures  
of Streptomyces  peucetius . It exerts  its action  by intercalating  between  
base pairs  of the DNA  double  helix  and by inhibition  of topoisomerase  II, 
causing  double  strand  DNA  breaks.  Free radical  formation  has been  
implicated  in doxorubicin  cardiotoxicity  by means of Cu (II) and Fe (III) 
reduction  at the cellular  level.  Rapid  plasma  uptake  occurs  after slow  
biliary  metabolism  and excretion.  The majority  of the drug is protein  
bound  and independent  of plasma  concentration.  Doxorubicin  has a 
terminal  half-life of 20-48 hours.  The preparation  and storage  of 
doxorubicin  should  follow  the manufacturer’s  recommendations.  
5.2.2 Toxicities  
The dose-limiting  toxicity  of doxorubicin  is irreversible  cardiotoxicity.  
Signs  and symptoms  of cardiotoxicity  are cardiac  arrhythmias,  decreased  
left ventricular  ejection  fraction,  congestive  heart  failure,  and 
cardiorespiratory  decompensation  such as dilatation  of the heart,  pleural  
effusion,  and venous  congestion.  Doxorubicin  administration  should  not 
exceed  cumulative  lifetime  doses  of 550 mg/m2. Myelosuppression  
consisting  of leukopenia  is common,  with a nadir  of 10-14 days.  Other  
adverse  effects  include  nausea,  mucositis,  stomatitis,  alopecia,  
extravasation,  hyperpigmentation  of nail beds,  red-orange  discoloration  of 
urine,  and erythematous  streaking  of veins.  
 
There  is inadequate  information  as to what  effect  doxorubicin  has on 
fertility  in males.  Doxorubicin  falls into U.S. Food  and Drug  
Administration  Pregnancy  Category  D 
5.3 Vincristine  
5.3.1 Description,  Pharmacology,  Storage  and Preparation   
Vincristine  is a naturally  occurring  vinca  alkaloid.  Vincristine  sulfate  is 
the salt of a dimeric  alkaloid  from  Catharanthus  roseus , the common  
periwinkle  plant.  Vincristine  sulfate  is a white,  off-white,  or slightly  
yellow  hygroscopic,  amorphous,  or crystalline  powder  that is freely  
soluble  in water  and slightly  soluble  in alcohol.  It is reconstituted  to a 
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#: 02 -090A(9)  
Amended:9/11/07  Page  15 of 54  
  
concentration  of 1 mg/mL.  Vincristine  exerts  its effects  by inhibiting  
mitosis,  causing  an arrest  of cell division  in the metaphase  stage.  
Vincristine  is metabolized  in the liver by the hepatic  cytochrome  P450  in 
the CYP3A  family.  Vincristine  has a triphasic  pattern  of elimination  
occurring  at 5 minutes,  2.3 hours,  and 85 hours.  The terminal  half-life of 
vincristine  ranges  between  19 and 155 hours.  About  80% of the injected  
dose appears  in the feces  and 10-20% is found  in the urine.  The 
preparation  and storage  of vincristine  should  follow  the manufacturer’s  
recommendations.  
5.3.2 Toxicities  
Patients  receiving  vincristine  commonly  experience  alopecia.  One dose- 
limiting  side effect  is peripheral  neurotoxicity,  as manifested  by neuritic  
pain,  paresthesias,  decrease  in deep  tendon  reflexes,  foot drop,  jaw pain,  
back  pain,  constipation,  and paralytic  ileus.  These  symptoms  may 
disappear  with a reduction  in dosage.  Vestibular  and auditory  damage  can 
also occur  and are usually  manifested  as dizziness,  nystagmus,  or loss of 
hearing.  
 
Vincristine  may result  in azoospermia  in males.  Vincristine  is a U.S. Food  
and Drug  Administration's  Pregnancy  Category  D 
 
5.4 Prednisone  
5.4.1 Description  and Pharmacology  
Prednisone  is a synthetic  glucocorticoid.  It is often  used to enhance  the 
effects  of other  cancer  agents  when  used in combination.  Given  in 
pharmacologic  doses,  prednisone  exerts  anti-inflammatory  and 
immunosuppressive  effects  on the blood  and lymphatic  system.  At the 
cellular  level,  prednisone  appears  to halt DNA  synthesis  by mediating  the 
inhibition  of glucose  transport  or phosphorylation.  In consequence,  this 
causes  a decrease  in available  intracellular  energy  and thereby  impedes  
mitotic  division.  Prednisone  is rapidly  absorbed  from  the gastrointestinal  
tract when  administered  orally  and has a short  duration  (3-4 hours)  of 
pharmacologic  effects.  Animal  studies  demonstrate  that it is rapidly  
distributed  to muscles,  liver,  skin,  intestine,  and kidneys  upon  ingestion.  
5.4.2 Toxicities  
Prednisone  exerts  numerous  effects  on the body:  euphoria,  mood  swings,  
fluid  retention,  adrenocortical  insufficiency,  muscle  pain or weakness,  
muscle  wasting,  increased  susceptibility  to infections,  hypokalemia,  
hypercortisolism,  amenorrhea,  glucose  intolerance,  hyperglycemia,  
nausea,  vomiting,  anorexia,  increased  appetite,  weight  gain,  gastric  
ulceration,  ulcerative  esophagitis,  insomnia,  headache,  restlessness,  
increased  motor  activity,  impaired  wound  healing,  osteopenia,  
osteoporosis,  avascular  necrosis,  skin atrophy  and thinning,  acne,  and 
increased  sweating.

Patients  must  be instructed  to use glucocorticoids  cautiously  if they have  
any infections,  impending  surgery,  hypothyroidism,  cirrhosis,  mental  
instability,  congestive  heart  failure,  peptic  ulcer  disease,  diverticulitis,  
nonspecific  ulcerative  colitis,  recent  intestinal  anastomoses,  seizures,

The murine  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  2B8.H11.G2.G9  
(ibritumomab  tiuxetan  ) is an IgG 1 kappa  antibody.  The selection  of the 
monoclonal  antibody  ibritumomab  tiuxetan  was based  upon  the 
observations  that: ibritumomab  tiuxetan  specifically  recognizes  and binds  
to human  B-cell lines  and normal  human  peripheral  blood  lymphocytes  in 
the same  relative  proportion  as the highly  characterized  and commercially  
available  anti-CD20  antibodies  anti-Leu16  and B1; anti-Leu16  and B1 
were  effectively  inhibited  by approximately  equal  concentrations  of 
ibritumomab  tiuxetan  ; Ibritumomab  tiuxetan  exhibited  no cross -reactivity  
with T-lymphocyte  populations.  
 
The ibritumomab  tiuxetan  antibody  was previously  expressed  by a murine  
hybridoma  cell line and produced  in hollow -fiber  bioreactors.  Currently,  
ibritumomab  tiuxetan  is produced  in Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells 
in suspension  culture.  The CHO -expressed  ibritumomab  tiuxetan  antibody  
differs  from  the murine  hybridoma  product  in that one amino  acid (at 
position  238 in the heavy  chain)  has been  changed  from  a lysine  to a 
methionine.  The CHO  master  Cell Bank  has been  fully  characterized  and 
found  to be negative  for mycoplasma,  infectious  virus,  and replicating  
viruses.  Types  A and C retroviral  particles  were  observed  by electron  
microscopy.

Hematologic  Toxicity:  The most  common  side effects  were  hematologic.  
Hematologic  toxicity  was transient  and reversible.  61% of patients  with a 
platelet  count  of at least 150,000  cells/  mm3 prior  to therapy  developed  
thrombocytopenia  with a platelet  count  less than 50,000  cells/  mm3; 
median  41,000  cells/  mm3; 57% of patients  developed  neutropenia  with an 
absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  of less than 1000  cells/  mm3 (median   
800 cells/  mm3). In patients  with mild thrombocytopenia  at baseline  
(platelet  count  of 100,000  to 149,000  cells/  mm3), 78% developed  severe  
thrombocytopenia  (median  platelet  count  24,000  cells/  mm3) and 74% 
developed  severe  neutropenia  (median  ANC  600 cells/  mm3). Median  time 
to platelet  nadir  was 53 days with a median  duration  of 35 days;  median  
ANC  nadir  was at 62 days with a median  duration  of 22 days.  Twenty -two 
percent  of patients  received  platelet  transfusions;  20% received  red blood  
cell transfusions;  13% received  filgrastim;  and 8% received  erythropoietin.  
Severe  cytopenia  extended  beyond  12 weeks  after administration               
of ibritumomab  tiuxetan  in less than 5% of patients.  
 
Ibritumomab  tiuxetan  should  not be administered  to patients  with 25% or 
greater  lymphoma  marrow  involvement  and/or  impaired  bone  marrow  
reserve  (prior  myeloablative  therapies);  platelet  count  less than 100,000  
cells/  mm3; neutrophil  count  less than 1500  cells/  mm3; bone  marrow  with 
15% or less cellularity  or marked  reduction  in bone  marrow  precursors;  or 
patients  with a history  of failed  stem  cell collection.  Ibritumomab  tiuxetan  
therapy  should  not be considered  in patients  with a platelet  count  of less 
than 100,000  cells/  mm3; dose reduction  is required  in patients  with 
platelet  counts  of 100,000  to 150,000  cells/  mm3. 
 
In a Phase  I/II study  of n=51  patients  25 median  nadirs  for the 0.4 mCi/kg  
dose group  were  50,000/mm3 platelets,  1100  /mm3 granulocytes  and 9.9 
g/dL  hemoglobin.  For patients  in the 0.4 mCi/kg  group  whose  nadirs  fell 
below  50,000/mm3 platelets,  1100/mm3 granulocytes  or 9.9 g/dL  
hemoglobin,  the median  time to recovery  for these  values  was 14 days,  
10.5 days,  and 9.5 days,  respectively.  Five patients  (10%)  developed  
platelet  nadirs  <10,000/mm3. Fourteen  patients  (27%)  developed  
granulocyte  nadirs  <500/mm3. Six patients  received  red blood  cell 
transfusions,  3 received  granulocyte  colony -stimulating  factor,  and 10

Nausea,  abdominal  pain,  and anorexia  have  been  described  by some  non- 
Hodgkin's  lymphoma  patients  (less than 10%)  during  or following  the 
radioimmunotherapy  protocol  25. Some  of these  effects  have  been  
reported  with rituximab  mono -immunotherapy,  and the contributing  role 
of rituximab  pretreatment  is unclear.  
Increases  in serum  bilirubin  have  been observed  occasionally  following  
the radioimmunotherapy  protocol  25. There  have  been  no reports  of 
clinical  hepatotoxicity.  
Respiratory  effects:  The following  respiratory  adverse  events  were  
reported  (% all grades,  % grade  3/4):  dyspnea  (14%,  2%),  increased  cough  
(10%,  0%),  rhinitis  (6%,  0%),  and bronchospasm  (5%,  0%)

Infectious  Complications:  In clinical  trials  (n=349),  29% of patients  
developed  infections  during  the first 3 months  after receiving  ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  therapy.  Serious  infections  developed  in 3% of patients  and life- 
threatening  infections  developed  in 2% of patients.  In long-term follow -up 
from  3 months  to 4 years  after ibritumomab  tiuxetan  therapy,  infections  
developed  in 6% of patients  with 2% serious  infections  and 1% life- 
threatening  infections. 31 
Musculoskeletal  effects:  The following  musculoskeletal  adverse  events  
were  reported  (% all grades,  % grade  3/4):  back  pain (8%,  1%),  arthralgia  
(7%,  1%),  myalgia  (7%,  less than 1%).  
Back  pain and arthralgia  have  been  described  by some  non- Hodgkin's  
lymphoma  patients  (less than 10%)  during  or following  the 
radioimmunotherapy  protocol  25. These  effects  have  been  reported  with 
rituximab  monoimmunotherapy,  and the contributing  role of rituximab  
pretreatment  is unclear.  
Infusion  Reactions:  Fatal  infusion -related  reactions  have  occurred  within  
24 hours  of rituximab  infusion;  80% of fatal reactions  were  associated  
with the first rituximab  infusion.  Fatal  reactions  were  associated  with a 
symptom  complex  that included  hypoxia,  pulmonary  infiltrates,  ARDS,  
myocardial  infarction,  ventricular  fibrillation,  or cardiogenic  shock.  
Severe  infusion  reactions  typica lly occur  within  30 to 120 minutes  after 
administration  of rituximab  and may include  symptoms  of hypotension,  
angioedema,  hypoxia,  and bronchospasm.  
Medications  for the treatment  of anaphylactic  and other  hypersensitivity  
reactions  should  be available.  Administration  of rituximab  and Indium - 
111 or Yttrium -90 ibritumomab  tiuxetan  should  be discontinued  and 
medical  treatment  should  be administered  to patients  who develop  severe  
infusion  reactions.  
In clinical  trials  (n=349),  allergic  reactions  occurred  in 2% of patients  and 
were  severe  or life threatening  in 1%, and severe  or life-threatening  apnea  
occurred  in 1% of patients.  Angioedema  occurred  in 5% of patients  and 
was severe  or life- threatening  angioedema  in less than 1% of patients;  
urticaria  occurred  in 4% of patients  and was severe  in less than 1% of 
patients.  
Decreases  in immunoglobulin  levels  (by at least 50%)  have  occurred  
rarely  after therapy  25. 
Geriatric  Patients:  In clinical  trials  (n=349),  there  were  no differences  in 
safety  or effectiveness  between  patients  65 years  of age and over (n=132),  
patients  75 years  of age and over (n=41),  and younger  patients;  greater

Dosimetry  data collected  from  56 patients  in a phase  I/II study  were  used 
to estimate  the radiation  dose to normal  organs  and bone  marrow  from  
90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  treatment.  Patients  received  111In-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  on Day 0, followed  by a therapeutic  dose of 90Y-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  on Day 7. Following  administration  of 111In-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  
periodic  whole  body  images  were  performed  acquiring  anterior  and 
posterior  images.  Time -activity  curves  for each organ  were  derived  by 
drawing  regions  of interest.  From  the area under  the curve,  residence  times  
were  determined  and entered  into the MIRDOSE3  computer  software  
program  to estimate  absorbed  radiation  dose of 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  
to each organ.  An additional  centralized  dosimetry  analysis  was performed  
subsequently  to provide  a consistent  analysis  of data collected  from  the 7 
clinical  sites where  the study  was performed.  In all patients,  normal  organ  
and red marrow  radiation  doses  were  estimated  to be well under  the 
protocol -defined  upper  limit  of 2000  cGy and 300 cGy,  respectively.  
Patients  with spleen  involvement  by lymphoma  were  allowed  to exceed  
the 2000  cGy upper  limit.  Estimated  median  tumor  absorbed  dose as 
determined  by data in 18 tumors  in 9 patients  was 1712  cGy (range  575- 
6710).  The estimated  absorbed  radiation  dose to organs,  by dosing  group,  
is shown  in the Table  below.

5.8.1 Other  Names:  
Aranesp™  
 
5.8.2 Description:  
Darbepoetin  alfa is an erythropoiesis  stimulating  protein  closely  related  to 
erythropoietin  that is produced  in Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells by 
recombinant  DNA  technology.  Darbepoetin  alfa is a 165-amino  acid 
protein  that differs  from  recombinant  human  erythropoietin  in containing   
5 N-linked  oligosaccharide  chains,  whereas  recombinant  human  
erythro poietin  contains  3. The 2 additional  N-glycosylation  sites result  
from  amino  acid substitutions  in the erythropoietin  peptide  backbone.  The 
additional  carbohydrate  chains  increase  the approximate  molecular  weight  
of the glycoprotein  from  30,000  to 37,000  daltons.  Because  of this 
increased  carbohydrate  content,  darbepoetin  alfa has a 3-fold longer  
circulating  mean  residence  time and 3- to 4-fold greater  biological  activity  
in animal  models  compared  with rHuEPO.  Details  of these  clinical  trials  
as well as the chemistry,  pre-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and 
toxicology  of darbepoetin  alfa are contained  in the darbepoetin  alfa 
investigator’s  brochure.  
 
5.8.3 Packaging  and Formulation:  
HSA -free (polysorbate)  darbepoetin  alfa will be manufactured  and 
packaged  by Amgen.  Darbepoetin  alfa will be provided  as a clear,  
colorless,  sterile  protein  solution  containing  x µg of darbepoetin  alfa per 
mL (to be defined  by Amgen)  and the following  excipients:  0.05 mg 
polysorbate  80, 2.12 mg sodium  phosphate  monobasic  monohydrate,  0.66 
mg sodium  phosphate  dibasic  anhydrous,  and 8.18 mg sodium  chloride  in 
Water  for Injection,  USP (per 1 mL) at pH 6.2 ± 0.2. The vials  supplied  
will contain  approximately  1.0 mL of study  medication  and are for single - 
dose use only.  
 
5.8.4 Labeling:  
Information  presented  on the label  for study  medication  will comply  with 
the local  regulatory  requirements.  
 
5.8.5 Storage  Conditions  and Stability:  
The supplied  darbepoetin  alfa must  be stored  in a refrigerator.  The 
stability  of darbepoetin  alfa has been  demonstrated  for at least 24 months  
when  stored  at a temperature  between  2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F).  Further  
stability  testing  is ongoing.  Exposure  to temperatures  above  or below  this 
range  and vigorous  shaking  should  be avoided  because  this may denature  
the protein.  Vials  of darbepoetin  alfa must  not be used if any particulate  
matter  or discoloration  is observed.

5.8.6 Expiration  Dating:  
As per standard  practice  for experimental  biologic  pharmaceuticals,  
Amgen  will conduct  periodic  stability  assays  to monitor  product  stability  
and determine  appropriate  expiration  dating  of the study  drug.  The 
appropriate  Amgen  representative  shall  communicate  this information  to 
the investigator.  
 
5.8.7 Darbepoe tin alfa (Aranesp®)  will be administered  at a dose of 300 
micrograms  (mcg)  every  3 weeks  for anemic  patients.  Anemia  will be 
defined  as Hgb<  11.0 g/dL.  Non-Anemic  patients  (Hgb  11.0gm/dL)  will 
be monitored  and initiate  Darbepoetin  alfa if they become  anemic.  
 
5.8.8 Dose  Adjustments:  
• Dose  escalation  is permitted  after 6 weeks  (2 doses).  The dose should  
be escalated  to 500mcg  q3w if the Hgb remains  below  10.0 g/dL  and 
the increase  in Hgb from  baseline  is less than 1.0 g/dL  after 6 weeks.  
Physician  discretion  regarding  dose escalation  should  be exercised  if 
the Hgb is above  10g/dL;  for example,  if after 6 weeks  of treatment  the 
Hgb is below  the baseline  value.  
• The dose should  should  be held if the Hgb is ≥ 11.5 g/dl. A target  
hemoglobin  of 11-11.5 g/dl is sought.  
• Any other  dose modifications  should  be made  in accordance  with the 
modified  Aranesp®  package  insert  as follows:  
o If Hgb increases  by more  than 1.0 g/dL  in a 2-week  period  (or 
1.5 g/dL  in a 3-week  period)  immediately  preceding  the next 
dose,  the dose should  be reduced  by approximately  40%.  
o If Hgb ≥ 11.5 g/dl at the time of the next dose,  the planned  
doses  should  be temporarily  withheld  until the Hgb falls to less 
than 11.0 g/dL.  At this point  Aranesp®  should  be reinitiated  at 
a dose approximately  40% below  the previous  dose.  
 
5.8.9 Overdose:  
There  is no clinical  experience  of overdose  with darbepoetin  alfa. 
 
5.8.10  Preparation  and Administration:  
Using  aseptic  techniques,  attach  a sterile  needle  to a sterile  syringe.  
Remove  the flip top from  the vial containing  darbepoetin  alfa and wipe  the 
septum  with a disinfectant.  Insert  the needle  into the vial, and withdraw  
the desired  volume  of solution  into the syringe.  
 
• Do not shake  darbepoetin  alfa. Vigorous  shaking  may denature  
darbepoetin  alfa, rendering  it biologically  inactive.

5.8.14  Potential  risks  and discomforts:  
Darbepoetin  alfa is generally  well tolerated.  Some  of the side effects  
reported  in clinical  studies  were  in subjects  with kidney  disease,  dialysis  
treatment,  or cancer  with and without  chemotherapy , and may not have  
been  not be due to darbepoetin  alfa treatment.  These  events  were  more  
common  in subjects  with chronic  kidney  disease  than in subjects  with 
cancer.  
 
Darbepoetin  alfa injections  can be associated  with stinging  at the injection  
site, and rare allergic  reactions  (e.g.,  skin rash,  itching  and hives  or more  
serious  allergic  reactions).  There  is a possibility  that darbepoetin  alfa may 
be associated  with an increased  risk of cardiac  events  (e.g. heart  attack),  
circulatory  events  (worsening  of blood  pressure,  stroke,  or blood  clots)  
and seizure  or even  death.  The higher  risk of cardiac  events  may be 
associated  with higher  hemoglobin  and/or  higher  rates  of rise of 
hemoglobin.  In one Epoetin  alfa study  in subjects  with chronic  kidney  
disease  receiving  dialysis,  who also suffered  from  heart  disease,  there  was 
a higher  risk of death  and thrombosis  associated  for those  subjects  who 
were  assigned  to maintain  hemoglobin  levels  of 14.0 ± 1.0 g/dL.  The 
reason  for the increased  death  rate is not understood.  Despite  the overall  
outcome  of the study,  within  each group,  higher  hemoglobin  values  were  
associated  with better  survival.  
 
5.8.15  Allergic  responses:  
There  may be a risk of developing  an allergic  reaction  to darbepoetin  alfa. 
Rare  allergic  symptoms  following  darbepoetin  alfa treatment  (eg, skin 
rash,  itching  and hives)  have  been  reported,  primarily  in chronic  renal  
failure  patients.  It is possible  for more  serious  allergic  reactions  to occur.  
These  possible  reactions  include  a whole  body  rash,  shortness  of breath,  
wheezing,  sudden  drop in blood  pressure,  swelling  around  the mouth  or 
eyes,  rapid  pulse  or sweating.  
 
5.8.16  Pregnancy  and lactation:  
There  are no adequate  and well-controlled  studies  in pregnant  women  
(pregnancy  category  C), therefore,  darbepoetin  alfa should  not be used 
during  pregnancy.  In addition,  it is not known  if darbepoetin  alfa is 
excreted  in human  milk,  therefore,  lactating  mothers  should  stop lactating  
in order  to take part in this study.  
 
5.8.17  Drug  Interactions:  
No formal  drug interaction  studies  of darbepoetin  alfa with other  
medications  commonly  used in CRF  patients  have  been  performed.  
 
5.8.18  Geriatric  Use: 
Of the 1598  CRF  patients  in clinical  studies  of darbepoetin  alfa, 42% were

age 65 and over,  while  15% were  75 and over.  No overall  differences  in 
safety  or efficacy  were  observed  between  these  patients  and younger  
patients,  but greater  sensitivity  of some  older  individuals  cannot  be ruled  
out.

9 TREATMENT PLAN  
9.1. Chemotherapy  Phase  
9.1.1 R-CHOP  Chemotherapy  
 
R-CHOP  will be given  at the following  doses:  
• Rituximab  375 mg/m2 IVPB  with premedications  (see below)  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#: 02 -090A(9)  
Amended:9/11/07  Page  30 of 54  
  
• Cyclophosphamide  750 mg/m2 IVPB  
• Doxorubicin  50 mg/m2 IV push  
• Vincristine  1.4 mg/m2 IV push  (not to exceed  2 mg per cycle)  
• Prednisone  100 mg po qd, either  from  Days  1-5 or 2-6 
 
The first Rituximab  dose will be given  over 3-5 hours  to minimize  
the risk of infusion -related  reactions.  Subsequent  doses  may be 
given  over a minimum  of 2 hours  as tolerated.  
 
Premedications  for Rituximab  include  acetaminophen  650 mg po 
and diphenhydramine  50 mg IVPB  given  at least 30 minutes  prior  
to infusion.  Chlorpheniramine  4 mg po may be substituted  for 
diphenhydramine.  
 
R-C HOP  will be repeated  every  21 days for a total of 6 cycles.  The 
next cycle  of R-CHOP  can be given  when  the absolute  neutrophil  
count  is at least 1000/mm3 and the platelet  is at least 75,000/mm3. 
 
Tumor  lysis prophylaxis:  During  cycle  one only,  prophylactic  
Allopurinol  is recommended  to prevent  tumor  lysis syndrome  in 
patients  with high tumor  burden  (bone  marrow  involvement  or 
LDH>500).  Patients  should  receive  600mg  PO 24 hrs. prior  to the 
first rituximab,  and continue  300 mg po daily  for at least 7 days 
after cycle  #1 of R-CHOP.  Additional  measures  such as IV 
hydration  or urinary  alkalinization  may be implemented  as 
clinically  necessary.  
 
Anti-emetic  medications,  including  dexamethasone,  will be given  
as per hospital  guidelines  on Day 1 of each cycle.  
 
Patients  with B12 or Folate  deficiency  should  be commenced  on 
appropriate  repletion  therapy  (B12  1000  mcg SQ q month,  folic 
acid 1 mg po qd). Patients  with iron deficiency  (eg. Ferritin  <10 
mcg/L;  TSAT<15%,  low iron, and high TIBC)  should  commence  
FeSO4  supplementation.  Dosing  and route  as per treating  
physician.  
 
For patients  requiring  therapeutic  anticoagulation  with coumadin  
while  on study,  PT/PTT/INR  studies  should  be followed  closely  
with appropriate  adjustments  made  by the treating  physician.  
Patients  should  be considered  for low-molecular  heparin  when  
appropriate,  given  the potential  for fewer  drug interactions.  
 
Granulocyte  colony -stimulating  factor  will be given  with each 
cycle.  Neulasta  6mg SQ 24 hours  after chemotherapy  is preferred  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center

Amended:9/11/07  Page  31 of 54  
  
(at MSKCC),  although  GCSF  at 300 g for patients  <70kg  and 480 
g for patients  70 kg SQ starting  at day 5 and continuing  to day 
12 remains  acceptable.  Doses  may be adjusted  at the discretion  of 
the treating  physician  and should  follow  institutional  procedure.  
 
Darbepoetin  alfa (Aranesp®)  will be administered  at a dose of 300 
micrograms  (mcg)  every  3 weeks  for anemic  patients.  Anemia  
will be defined  as Hgb<  11.0 g/dL.  Non-Anemic  patients  (Hgb  
11.0gm/dL)  will be monitored  and initiate  Darbepoetin  alfa if they 
become  anemic.  
 
Dose  Adjustments:  
• Dose  escalation  is permitted  after 6 weeks  (2 doses).  The 
dose should  be escalated  to 500mcg  q3w if the Hgb 
remains  below  10.0 g/dL  and the increase  in Hgb from  
baseline  is less than 1.0 g/dL  after 6 weeks.  Physician  
discretion  regarding  dose escalation  should  be exercised  if 
the Hgb is above  10g/dL;  for example,  if after 6 weeks  of 
treatment  the Hgb is below  the baseline  value.  
• The dose should  not be escalated  if the Hgb is within  the 
Hgb target  range  of 11-11.5 g/dL.  
• Any other  dose modifications  should  be made  in 
accordance  with the Aranesp®  package  insert  as follows:  
o If Hgb increases  by more  than 1.0 g/dL  in a 2-week  
period  (or 1.5 g/dL  in a 3-week  period)  immediately  
preceding  the next dose,  the dose should  be reduced  
by approximately  40%.  
• If Hgb ≥ 11.5 g/dl at the time of the next dose,  the planned  
doses  should  be temporarily  withheld  until the Hgb falls to 
less than 11.0 g/dL.  At this point  Aranesp®  should  be 
reinitiated  at a dose approximately  40% below  the previous  
dose.  
• The following  events  should  prompt  discontinuation  of 
darbepoetin  alfa: 
o Uncontrolled  hypertension  
o Deep  vein thrombosis  
 
Central  Nervous  System  prophylaxis  is recommended  for all 
individuals  with 1) evidence  of bone  marrow  involvement  with 
large  cells on blind  bone  marrow  biopsy,  2) radiographic  evidence  
of more  than one site of lytic bone  involvement,  or evidence  of 
bone  marrow  involvement,  3) testicular  involvement,  4) two or 
more  sites of non-contiguous  extranodal  involvement.  Either  of 
the following  two regimens,  or a combination  thereof,  is 
recommended:

• Methotrexate,  12 mg administered  intrathecally  weekly  for 
6 treatments  during  the R-CHOP  course,  
• Cytasine  Arabinoside,  60 mg administered  intrathecally  
weekly  for 6 treatments  during  the R-CHOP  course.  
 
9.1.2 R-CHOP  Schedule/Dose  Modifications  
• If a patient  has an absolute  neutrophil  count  <1000/mm3 or platelet  
count  of <100,000/mm3 on a scheduled  treatment  day, or if the 
patient  develops  febrile  neutropenia,  the next cycle  of R-CHOP  
may be delayed  up to 14 days as indicated.  The retreatment  platelet  
count  should  be consistent  with each individual  institutional  
guidelines  (with  a minimum  cut-off of at least >75,000/mm3. ) 
 
• Vincristine  doses  may be reduced  by 50% for Grade  2 
neurotoxicity  and may be discontinued  for Grade  3 or 4 
neurotoxicity  
 
• Dose  reductions  to R-CHOP  chemotherapy  for comorbidity  or 
potential  toxicity  should  be made  at the discretion  of the treating  
physician  and may occur  with Cycle  #1 if necessary.  Vincristine  
may be omitted  in entirety  from  cycle  1 if potential  GI toxicity  
outweighs  potential  benefit  in the opinion  of the treating  MD. 
Prednisone  may be given  for control  of symptoms  prior  to the start 
of chemotherapy  (maximum  14 consecutive  days).  
 
9.2. Radioimmunotherapy  Phase  
9.2.1 Criteria  to Proceed  to Radioimmunotherapy  Phase  of Study  
• Patients  must  have  < 25% intratrabecular  space  bone  marrow  
involvement  on a post-R-CHOP  bilateral  bone  marrow  biopsy,  to be 
performed  4-6 weeks  post R-CHOP  and within  4 weeks  of starting  the 
radioimmunotherapy  phase.  
• Patients  must  have  greater  than 15% cellularity  of bone  marrow  as 
determined  by MSKCC  hematopathologists  
• Patients  must  have  baseline  cytogenetics  that is not consistent  with 
myelodysplasia  (performed  on a bone  marrow  aspiration  prior  to the 
initiation  of Radioimmunotherapy).  FISH  abnormalities  associated  
with MDS,  whether  or not morphologic  or cytogenetic  evidence  of 
MDS  is present,  will also preclude  Phase  II treatment  with RIT. These  
patients  will remain  on study  to be followed  for outcome.  
• Patients  must  have  post-R-CHOP  restaging  studies  within  4-5 weeks  
of completing  R-CHOP  showing  that their disease  has not progressed  
from  the time of study  entry.  Patients  with confirmed  or unconfirmed  
complete  response  and patients  with partial  responses  who are not 
transplant  eligible  are allowed  to proceed.

o Darbepoetin  Alfa may be administered  during  the 
radioimmunotherapy  phase  of treatment  starting  week  #3 at the 
discretion  of the treating  physician.  Drug  will be supplied  by 
Amgen  for this purpose.  The protocol  does not mandate  
colony  stimulating  factors  during  the RIT phase.  
• Patients  must  have  acceptable  hematologic  function  within  2 weeks  of 
receiving  the first loading  dose of rituximab.  Acceptable  hematologic  
function  is defined  as an absolute  neutrophil  count  1500/mm3, 
hemoglobin  8.0 g/dL,  and platelets  100,000/mm3 in the absence  of 
hematopoietic  growth  factors  for at least 14 days.  
• Patients  must  have  no evidence  of clinically  significant  pleural  
effusions  prior  to receiving  the first loading  dose of rituximab.  
9.2.2 Rituximab  and 111In -ibritumomab  tiuxetan/90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  
• Day 0 of the Radioimmunotherapy  Phase  must  begin  between  6 and 9 
weeks  (42-63 days)  after Day 1 of the last cycle  of R-CHOP.  
• Rituximab  administration:  
See Rituxan  Package  Insert  (Appendix  A). 
• The CBC  drawn  on Day 0 will serve  as the reference  CBC  for the 
dosing  of the 90Y ibritumomab  tiuxetan  on Day 7. An additional  CBC  
should  not be drawn  on day 7. 
• On Day 0 of the Radioimmunotherapy  Phase,  patients  will be 
premedicated  with acetaminophen  650 mg po, diphenhydramine  50  
mg po or chlorpheniramine  4 mg po, and Ativan  0.5 mg IV 30 minutes  
prior  to beginning  of Rituximab  infusion.  (Patients  need  not receive  
any of the above  premedications  if there  is a prior  history  of an adverse  
reaction  to any of them.)  Following  this, rituximab  250 mg/m2         
will be infused.  
• On Day 0, immediately  following  the infusion  of rituximab,  patients  
will receive  a fixed  dose of 1.6 mg (5.0 mCi)  of 111In-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan,  given  by slow  IV push  over 10 minutes.  
• On Day 0-1, 2-24 hours  after infusion  of 111In-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  
whole  body  gamma  camera  images  will be taken.  
• On Day 2-3, 48-72 hours  after infusion  of 111In-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  
whole  body  gamma  camera  images  will be taken.  
• On Day 5-7, 90-120 hours  after infusion  on 111In-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan,  whole  body  gamma  camera  images  will be taken,  if deemed  
necessary.  
• On Day 7 of the Radioimmunotherapy  Phase,  a second  rituximab  
infusion  at a dose of 250 mg/m2  will be given,  using  the same  pre-

medications.  The Day 7 rituximab  dose may be delayed  up to Day 14 
if necessary.  
• Dose  calibration  settings  will be determined  by the Division  of 
Nuclear  Medicine  according  to the methods  described  in Appendix  F. 
• 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  will be administered  immediately  following  
the Day 7 rituximab  infusion.  Each  patient  will receive  one therapeutic  
dose of 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  For patients  weighing  >80 kg, a 
maximum  dose of 32 mCi will be given.  For patients  weighing  ≤80 kg 
with platelet  counts  ≥150,000/mm3, a dose of 0.4 mCi 90Y/kg  will be 
given.  For patients  weighing  ≤80 kg with platelet  counts  <150,000/  
mm3, a dose of 0.3 mCi/kg  will be given.  
• 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  will be administered  intravenously  as a slow  
IV push  over 10 minutes.  The drug may be directly  infused  by  
stopping  the flow from  the IV bag and injecting  the radiolabeled  
antibody  directly  into the infusion  port. A 0.22 micron  filter  must  be  
on line between  the syringe  and the infusion  port. (The  0.22 micron  
filter  is not provided  by Biogen  Idec,  Inc.. Pharmaceuticals).  Flush  the 
line with at least 10 mL of normal  saline  after 90Y-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  has been  infused.  See Appendix  G for radio  incorporation  
methods.

10.3. Radioimmunotherapy  Phase  and Post-Radioimmunotherapy  Monitoring  
10.3.1  Days  0-7 
10.3.2  The purpose  of 111In-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  imaging  is to evaluate  the 
biodistribution  of whole  body  gamma  camera  images  and to assess  whether  
biodistribution  is acceptable  to proceed  with 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  
administration.  
10.3.3  The biodistribution  of 111In Zevalin  should  be assessed  by a visual  
evaluation  of whole  body  planar  view  anterior  and posterior  gamma  images.  
A set of images  at 48-72 hours  after injection  is required.  To resolve  
ambiguities,  optional  images  at other  time points  may be necessary.  If the 
patient  has an altered  biodistribution,  he/she  will not receive  90Y 
Ibritumomab  tiuxetan  and will be taken  off study.  
10.3.4  Expected  biodistribution  
• Easily  detectable  uptake  in the blood  pool areas  (including  but not 
limited  to the heart,  major  abdominal  blood  vessels,  vascular  areas  of 
the head,  lungs  and pelvis)  on the first day image,  with less activity  in 
the blood  pool areas  on the second  or third  day image.  
• Moderately  high to high uptake  in normal  liver and spleen  during  the 
first day and the second  or third  day images.  
• Moderately  low or very low uptake  in normal  kidneys,  urinary  bladder,  
and normal  bowel  on the first day image  and the second  or third  day 
image.  
• Tumor  uptake  may be visualized  in soft tissue  as areas  of increased  
intensity,  and tumor  bearing  areas  in normal  organs  may be seen as 
areas  of increased  or decreased  intensity.  Those  patients  in CR or CRu 
would  not be expected  to have  any tumor  visualized.  
10.3.5  Altered  biodistribution  
• Diffuse  uptake  in normal  lung more  intense  than the cardiac  blood  
pool on the first day image,  or more  intense  than the liver on the 
second  or third  day image.  
• Kidneys  with greater  intensity  than the liver on the posterior  view  of 
the second  or third  day image.  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#: 02 -090A(9)  
Amended:9/11/07  Page  37 of 54  
  
• Intense  areas  of uptake  throughout  the normal  bowel  comparable  to the 
liver on the second  or third  day images.  
10.3.6  Weeks  3-12 
• History  and physical  examination,  including  performance  status,  will be 
performed  at monthly  intervals  for 3 months  following  90Y-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  as indicated  in the radioimmunotherapy  calendar.  
• CBC  with differential  and platelet  will be obtained  weekly  for 12 weeks  
following  administration  of 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  or until the WBC,  
absolute  neutrophil  count,  hemoglobin  and platelet  count  have  
normalized.  Transfusion  requirements  will be recorded  at each 
evaluation.  
• Comprehensive  profile  and LDH  will be obtained  at monthly  intervals  
for three  months  following  administration  of 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  
• In the event  that a Grade  3 or 4 hematologic  toxicity  occurs  at any time,  
blood  samplings  for followup  evaluations  should  be performed  as 
clinically  indicated  until the abnormality  is resolved.  Twice  or thrice  
weekly  platelet  counts,  or more  if clinically  appropriate,  should  be 
utilized  when  platelets  are below  50K.  
10.3.7  Three  (3) month  evaluation  (Week  12 or 13) 
• History  and physical  examination  
• Assessment  of Karnofsky  Performance  Status  
• CBC,  Comprehensive  profile  and LDH  
• FACT -an evaluation  
• CT scan of the chest,  abdomen,  and pelvis,  and PET scan (if previously  
positive)  
• Repeat  Echocardiogram  to be performed  between  weeks  12-13. 
• Peripheral  blood  (MSKCC  Only)  – nine 2-mL purple  top tubes:  2 for 
minimal  residual  disease  studies  (to Dr. Zelenetz’  lab, K1011,  see 
Appendix  C), 7 tubes  for progenitor  cell studies  (to Dr. Moore’s  lab, 
RRL717,  see Appendix  D) 
• Bone  marrow  aspirate  studies  (MSKCC  Only)  - five 2-mL pulls  of bone  
marrow  aspirate  in purple  top tubes  will be drawn.  Two tubes  will be 
sent to Dr. Zelenetz’  lab in K1011  (see Appendix  C). Two tubes  will be 
sent to Dr. Moore’s  lab in RRL  717 for progenitor  cell studies  (see 
Appendix  D) and one tube will be sent to the flow cytometry  lab for 
CD34+  count.  
• Bilateral  bone  marrow  biopsy,  if pre-RIT bone  marrow  biopsy  was 
positive.  
10.3.8  Long  term post-Radioimmunotherapy  followup  
• The same  studies  listed  in Section  10.3.7  are performed  at 6 months  
post-radioimmunotherapy,  12 months,  and every  12 months  thereafter  
for 2 years  for patients  in continued  CR or CRu.  
• Echocardiograms  are not required  after week12 -13; PET is repeated  only 
if previous  study  was positive  and no evidence  of progressive  disease.

Dr. Zelenetz’  lab in K1011  (see Appendix  C), and peripheral  blood  for 
MRD  will be performed  for up to 5 years.  
• Peripheral  blood  or bone  marrow  aspirate  for progenitor  cell studies  need  
not be performed.  
• A bone  marrow  biopsy  need only be repeated  if the previous  biopsy  was 
positive.  
• CT scans  will be preformed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48 and 60 months

11 ADVERSE  EXPERIENCES  
 
The toxicities  of rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  prednisone,  and 
90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  are listed  in Section  5 of the protocol.  
 
11.1. An objective  of this study  is to obtain  information  on the safety  of the 
sequential  administration  of R-CHOP  followed  by 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  for 
elderly  patients  with previously  untreated  DLBCL.  It is the Investigator’s  
obligation  to report  all adverse  experiences  (AE’s),  regardless  of association  with 
study  drugs.  
11.2. Definitions  of AE’s  
11.2.1  Adverse  Experience : An AE is defined  as any untoward  medical  
occurrence  in a patient  administered  a pharmaceutical  product  and does not 
necessarily  have  to have  a causal  relationship  or association  with the 
treatment.  An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign,  
symptom,  or significant  worsening  of a pre-existing  sign or symptom,  or 
disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a medicinal  product,  whether  
or not it is considered  to be related  to the medicinal  product.  Laboratory  
abnormalities  should  only be recorded  as AE’s  if they are associated  with 
clinical  sequelae  and/or  require  an intervention.  
11.2.2  Serious  Adverse  Experience  (SAE):  An SAE  is considered  to be any 
experience  occurring  at any dose that results  in any of the following  
outcomes:  death,  a life-threatening  AE (at immediate  risk of death  from  the 
experience  as it occurred),  in-patient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of 
existing  hospitalization,  a persistent  of significant  disability/incapacity,  or a 
congenital  anomaly/birth  defect.  Important  medical  events  that may not 
result  in death  may be considered  SAE’s  when,  based  upon  appropriate  
medical  judgment,  they may jeopardize  the patient  and may require  medical  
or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this 
definition.  
11.2.3  Expected  Adverse  Experience:  Any AE that is identified  in Section  5 is 
considered  an expected  AE. 
11.2.4  Unexpected  Adverse  Experience:  Any AE, the specificity  of severity  of 
which  is not consistent  with those  listed  in Section  5, is considered  to be 
unexpected.  
11.3. Reporting  AE’s  
11.3.1  During  the chemotherapy  phase  of treatment,  only grade  3 and 4 toxicities  
will be recorded.  During  the RIT phase  of treatment,  all toxicities  regardless  
of grade  will be recorded.  All AE’s  (serious  and non-serious),  regardless  of 
relationship  to study  drug,  are to be recorded  on the AE Form  (grade  3/4 
toxicities)  and Toxicity  Form  (grades  0-4) from  the time of enrollment  to 3 
months  after the administration  of radioimmunotherapy,  or until the 
administration  of alternative  therapy  for the patient’s  disease,  whichever  
comes  first. Subsequent  to this timeframe,  only AE’s  that are considered  by 
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#: 02 -090A(9)  
Amended:9/11/07  Page  41 of 54  
  
the Investigator  to be possibly  related  or probably  associated  with the 
administration  of R-CHOP  or 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  are to be reported.  
The severity  of AE’s  will be recorded  on the case report  form  using  the NCI 
Common  Toxicity  Criteria  (version  2.0). These  are found  in Appendix  E 
and on the internet  at http://ctep.info.nih.gov . Laboratory  abnormalities  
should  be recorded  as AE’s  only if they are associated  with clinical  sequelae  
and/or  require  intervention.  Patient  deaths  at any time are to be recorded  , 
with immediate  notification  to the lead investigator  at MSKCC  (death  
certificate  or Death  Notice  to be sent)  
11.4. Reporting  SAE’s  
11.4.1  The Investigator  is required  to report  all SAE’s,  regardless  of cause  or 
relationship  to study  drug,  that come  to the attention  of the investigative  site 
from  the time of enrollment  to 3 months  after the administration  of 
radioimmunotherapy,  or until the administration  of alternative  therapy  for  
the patient’s  disease,  whichever  comes  first. Subsequent  to this timeframe,  
only SAE’s  that are considered  by the Investigator  to be possibly  related  or 
probably  associated  with the administration  of R-CHOP  or 90Y-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  are to be reported.  Any SAE  will be reported  to the local  institutions  
IRB.  In addition,  it will need to be sent to the other  participating  centers  to 
report  to their institution’s  IRB,  Biogen  Idec,  Inc.. Pharmacovigilance  and

11.4.2  The Investigator  will maintain  documentation  of each SAE  in the 
Investigator’s  Brochure/Safety  Report  Binder  (Biogen  Idec,  Inc..)  at the site 
and should  notify  the IRB of the event  in a timely  manner.  Information  
regarding  resolution  of an SAE,  therapies,  or procedures  administered  to 
treat the SAE  and copies  of the medical  records,  laboratory  results,  or the 
test results  may be requested  by Biogen  Idec,  Inc.. Pharmaceuticals.  
11.4.3  Reporting  Procedures  for All Adverse  Events  (Amgen):  
All fatal or life-threatening  events  considered  related  to study  drug by the

The investigator  should  notify  their Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  of serious  
adverse  events  occurring  at the site and other  adverse  event  reports  received  from  
Amgen,  in accordance  with local  procedures.  It will be left to the investigator’s  
clinical  judgment  whether  or not an adverse  event  is of sufficient  severity  to 
require  that the subject  should  be removed  from  treatment.  A subject  may also 
voluntarily  withdraw  from  treatment  due to what  he or she perceives  as an 
intolerable  adverse  event.  If either  of these  occurs  the subject  must  undergo  an 
end-of-study  assessment  and be given  appropriate  care under  medical  supervision  
until symptoms  cease  or the condition  becomes  stable.  
 
12 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
12.1. Definitions  
Response  and progression  of disease  will be evaluated  in this study  using  a 
modification  of the international  criteria  proposed  by the Cheson  et al.34 Note:  
Lesions  are either  measurable  or non-measurable  using  the criteria  provided  
below.  The term “evaluable”  in reference  to measurability  will not be used 
because  it does not provide  additional  meaning  or accuracy.  
 
12.1.1  Measurable  disease:  Measurable  lesions  are defined  as those  that can be 
accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be 
recorded)  as >20 mm with conventional  techniques  (PET,  CT, MRI,  x-ray) . 
All tumor  measurements  must  be recorded  in millimeters  (or decimal  
fractions  of centimeters).  
 
12.1.2  Non-measurable  disease : All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including  
small  lesions  (longest  diameter  <20 mm with conventional),  are considered  
non-measurable  disease.  Bone  lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonis,  inflammatory  
breast  disease,  abdominal  masses  (not followed  by CT or MRI),  and cystic  
lesions  are all non-measurable.  
 
 
12.2. Response  Criteria  
 
Response  criteria  will be assessed  based  on the post R-CHOP  and Post 90Y- 
ibritumomab  tiuxetan  evaluations.  The criteria  are as follows  (GTD  = Greatest  
Transverse  Diameter;  SPD = Sum of the Products  of the Greatest  Diameter):  
 
12.2.1  Complete  Remission  (CR):  
• No clinical,  radiographic  or diagnostic  evidence  of disease.  
• No disease  related  symptoms.  
• Abnormal  biochemical  values  (eg. LDH)  clearly  attributable  to 
lymphoma  must  have  normalized.  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#: 02 -090A(9)  
Amended:9/11/07  Page  44 of 54  
  
• Lymph  nodes,  nodal  masses  regressed  to “normal”  size: 
• If >1.5 cm before  treatment,  regressed  to ≤ 1.5 cm in GTD.  
• If 1.1 to 1.5 cm before  treatment,  regressed  to ≤ 1 cm in GTD  (or >75%  
in SPD).  
• Spleen  and all previously  enlarged  organs  decreased  in size. Spleen  
must  not be palpable  on exam  
• Bone  marrow  free of disease  on repeat  aspirate  and biopsy  if initially  
positive.  
• Normalization  of PET scans.  
12.2.2  Complete  Remission/unconfirmed  (CRU):  
Patients  meeting  the above  criteria  for CR with the following  
exceptions:  
• Residual  node  mass  of >1.5 cm in GTD  regressed  by > 75% in SPD 
• Individual  nodes  previously  confluent  regressed  by >75%  in SPD 
• Indeterminate  bone  marrow  (increased  number  or size of lymphoid  
aggregates  without  cytologic  or architectural  atypia.)  
12.2.3  Partial  Remission  (PR)  
• ≥ 50% decrease  in SPD of the six largest  dominant  nodes/nodal  masses.  
• No increase  in size of other  nodes,  liver or spleen.  
• Splenic  and hepatic  nodes  regressed  at least 50% in SPD 
• No new sites of disease.  
• Bone  marrow  and organs  other  than the spleen  and liver cannot  be 
considered  for evaluation  for PR because  involvement  at these  sites is 
considered  evaluable  but not measurable.  
12.2.4  Relapsed  Disease  (RD)  
• In patients  previously  CR or CRU:  
• New  node  
• Size of previously  involved  site has increase  ≥ 50% in SPD.  
• ≥ 50% increase  in either:  GTD  of any previously  identified  node  that was 
>1 cm in its short  axis, or 
-SPD of more  than one node.  
12.2.5  Stable  Disease  (SD)  
• Patients  who have  achieved  less than a partial  remission  but who have  
not developed  findings  consistent  with progressive  disease.  
12.2.6  Progressive  Disease  (PD)  
• In patients  previously  PR or SD. 
• ≥ 50% increase  from  nadir  in SPD of any previously  identified  abnormal  
node.  
• Appearance  of any new lesion  during  or at the end of therapy.  
Note:  
• Patients  with a global  deterioration  of their health  status  requiring  
discontinuation  of treatment  without  objective  evidence  of disease  
progression  at that time should  be classified  as having  “symptomatic  
deterioration.”  Every  effort  should  be made  to document  the objective  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center

Amended:9/11/07  Page  45 of 54  
  
progression,  even  after discontinuation  of treatment.  
• In some  circumstances,  it may be difficult  to distinguish  residual  disease  
from  normal  tissue.  When  the evaluation  of complete  response  depends  
on this determination,  it is recommended  that the residual  lesion  be 
investigated  (fine  needle  aspirate/biopsy)  before  confirming  the complete  
response  status.  
 
12.3. Duration  of Response  
 
• 
12.3.1  Progression -Free Survival  
• Time  to progression  is defined  as the time of enrollment  to the first 
documented  progression  or death.  Time -to-progression  analyses  will 
treat patient  withdrawals  and interventions  for reasons  other  than 
progression  or death  as independent  censoring.  
12.3.2  Overall  Survival  
• Overall  survival  is defined  as the time of enrollment  to the time of death  or 
time of last followup.  
12.3.3  Event  Free Survival  
• Event  free survival  is defined  as the time of enrollment  to the first 
documented  event,  with events  defined  as: death,  relapse,  progressive  
disease,  secondary  malignancy,  or toxicity  attributed  to therapy  and 
requiring  removal  from  study  
 
12.4. Response  Review  
• Review  of response  will be confirmed  and validated  by a selected  team  
of investigators  from  the Department  of Medicine  with expertise  in 
running  Phase  II clinical  trials,  and will be available  for independent  
review  as requested  by Biogen  Idec,  Inc.. Pharmaceuticals.

14 BIOSTATISTICS  
14.1. Study  Design  
This is a phase  II study.  The main  goal is to observe  the clinical  efficacy  in 
elderly  patients  (60 years  or older)  with previously  untreated  high risk (aaIPI  2 or 
3) diffuse  large  B cell lymphoma  by assessing  the induction  regimen  R-CHOP  
followed  by 90Y-ibritumomab -tiuxetan  (Zevalin).  65 patients  will be enrolled  in 
this study.  
 
Part I of this study  is essentially  standard  chemotherapy  in the elderly,  
recapitulating  the R-CHOP  GELA  study.  Approximately  2/3 of patients  will 
achieve  complete  remission  (CR)  or partial  remission  (PR).  Therefore,  43 
patients  are expected  to be eligible  for part II of this study.  During  Part II, 
Zevalin  will be administered  to those  patients  in CR/PR  with adequate  
hematologic  parameters.  
 
Overall  survival  rates in the Shipp  et al. IPI database  1 for age greater  than 60 
patients  at 2 years  were  48% for high-intermediate  risk patients  and 31% for high 
risk patients.  70% and 30% of patients  had high-intermediate  risk and high-risk 
disease,  respectively.  Thus,  overall  the survival  rate at two years  for high- 
intermediate  and high risk groups  combined  in the Shipp  et at. study  is 43%.  This 
overall  survival  rate represents  all patients  treated  – OS data for patients  
achieving  a CR/PR  are not reported.  The 43 patients  in the second  part of this 
study  allow  us to detect  a 20% difference  in overall  survival  at two years  with 
type I error  0.1 and 0.90 power.  An improvement  in PFS/OS  >20%  will be 
deemed  a positive  study.  PFS was not calculated  in the Shipp  et al. study,  but a 
relapse  free survival  rate at 2 years  for high-intermediae  and high-risk groups  
combined  is 55.8%  and will be used as an estimate  for PFS.  
 
At the end of the study,  Kaplan -Meier  curves  will be generated  for overall  
survival,  progression  free survival  and event  free survival.  As a second  endpoint,  
the conversion  rate to CR with 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  for patients  with a PR 
post R-CHOP  can be estimated.  The response  rate by R-CHOP  can be estimated  
within  +/- 12%.  Finally,  the predictive  value  of minimal  residual  disease  for 
overall  and progression  free survival,  as detected  by molecular  techniques  for 
disease  relapse/recurrence,  will be evaluated  utilizing  a log-ranked  analysis.  
 
In Part I, endpoints  related  to anemia  will be evaluated  in the setting  of 
darbepoetin  support.  Descriptive  statistics  will report  the incidence  and severity  
of anemia,  days of anemia,  time to anemia,  and change  in hemoglobin  from  
baseline.  Hgb response  and correction  will be defined  as: an increase  of 2.0 
gm/dl  from  baseline  and an Hgb 12.0 g/dl, respectively,  in the absence  of RBC  
transfusion  in the preceding  21 days.

QOL  analysis  will be performed  utilizing  the self-administered  FACT -anemia  
questionnaire,  a well-validated  instrument  in cancer  studies  11,35,36  that 
incorporates  the FACT -G general  assessment  with symptom  specific  scales  for 
fatigue  and anemia  (FACT -an). Scoring  will be performed  according  to the 
FACT -anemia  scoring  schema  in Appendix  K. The compliance  rate at each 
assessment  will be estimated  by the ratio of completed  questionnaires  actually  
completed  to the number  of patients  alive  at each assessment.  Summary  statistics  
will be presented  for each time point  and correlation  with baseline  hemoglobin  
levels  and change  in hemoglobin  levels  with darbepoetin  evaluated.  The nature   
of missing  data will be evaluated  and an appropriate  longitudinal  analysis  method  
will be used to analyze  the quality  of life scores.  
 
14.2. Stopping  Rule  
14.2.1  The trial will be stopped  early  if there  is a 15% incidence  of prolonged  
hematologic  toxicity  at the 3 month  evaluation  post phase  II RIT. Prolonged  
hematologic  toxicity  will be defined  as a absolute  neutrophil  count  <1.5 
K/l, Hgb 8 gm/dl,  or platelets  100,000  for patients  without  evidence  of 
recurrent  disease.  If >10 patients  have prolonged  hematologic  toxicity  at the 
3 month  evaluation  post RIT, there  will be 95% confidence  that a 15% 
incidence  of prolonged  hematologic  toxicity  has been reached,  necessitating  
early  stopping  of the protocol.  
14.2.2  The trial will be stopped  early  and re-evaluated  if the first five consecutive  
patients  experience  prolonged  hematologic  toxicity  as defined  above.  If the 
first three  consecutive  patients  experience  prolonged  hematologic  toxicity,  a 
decrease  in dose to 0.3 mCi/Kg may be considered.  
14.2.3  Additionally,  the trial will be suspended  and continued  accrual  will be re- 
evaluated  if there  are 4 or more  patients  among  the first 20 patients  who 
require  hospitalization  because  of the administration  of Zevalin.  
14.2.4  To receive  90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  patients  must  meet  the criteria  
described  in Section  9.1.4.  The results  of this study  may not be applicable  
generally  if a sizable  fraction  of patients  does not go on to receive  90Y- 
ibritumomab  tiuxetan.  If any 11 of the first 33 patients  do not proceed  to 
receive  90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan,  the appropriateness  of the sample  size 
will be reviewed  with the biostatics  department  at the time of the 11th 
patient.  If necessary,  the sample  size will be adjusted  and addressed  in a 
protocol  amendment.  
14.3. Sample  Size and Accrual  Rate 
Approximately  25-35 patients  will be accrued  per year.  It is expected  that the 
duration  of the entire  study  should  be approximately  3 years.  MDACC  may 
enroll  a maximum  of 20 patients.

16 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
16.1. A Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The 
responsibilities  of the RSA  include  project  compliance,  data collection,  
abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  
and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of the protocol  study  team.  The 
data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database.  Source  
documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
16.2. Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  
and completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be 
generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates,  extent  and 
accuracy  of evaluations  and followup  will be monitored  periodically  throughout  
the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the 
study  team  for discussion  and action.  Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  
compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the study  team,  at a minimum  of two 
times  of year,  or more  frequently  if indicated.  All documentation  of AE’s,  
records  of study  drug receipt  and dispensation,  and all IRB correspondence  will 
be retained  for at least 2 years  after the investigation  is completed.  
16.3. The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secured  database  
(Clinical  Research  Database,  CRDB)  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  
16.4. For patients  treated  at participating  institutions,  the institution  will be 
responsible  for filling  out MSKCC  Case  Report  forms  (CRFs)  and submitting  
them  to MSKCC  (via fax) bimonthly.  Blank  case report  forms  will be sent to the 
data managers  at each site (for photocopying  and use).  When  a patient  is off- 
study,  MSKCC  should  be alerted  within  14 days,  and all forms  need  to be sent no 
later than 4 weeks  after the off-study  date.  Participating  centers  must  fax CRFs  
to (212)  557-0787  to the attention  of Brett  Wegner.  Forms  can also be mailed  to 
the following:  Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center,  Clinical  Trials  Office,  
Brett  Wegner,  633 Third  Ave – 15th Floor,  New York,  NY 10017  
 
17 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
17.1. Privacy  
It is the responsibility of the Research Staff to ensure  that Memorial Sloan - 
Kettering Cancer  Center  has on file a written  acknowledgment of receipt  by the 
subject of the Center’s Notice  of Privacy Practices.   If the subject has not already  
done so, he/she must sign such an acknowledgment  before participating in this  
study.  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  
information  pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.   
The use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  will be limited  to the 
individuals  described  in the Research  Authorization  form.  A Research  
Authorization  form  must  be completed  by the Principal  Investigator  and approved  
by the IRB and Privacy  Board.  
17.2. Potential  Risks  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#: 02 -090A(9)

Potential  risks  and adverse  experiences  associated  with the drugs  in this study  
program  are described  in Section  5. 
17.3. Potential  Benefits  
CHOP  or R-CHOP  is the treatment  of choice  for elderly  patients  with DLBCL.  
However,  many  patients  who obtain  a complete  or partial  response  to therapy  will 
relapse  from  their disease.  While  some  older  patients  can be salvaged  with high- 
dose chemotherapy  and an autologous  stem  cell transplant,  others  are too 
advanced  in age to tolerate  this procedure.  In such cases,  salvage  treatment  is 
palliative.  It is hoped  that by treating  patients  in CR or PR following  R-CHOP,  
the administration  of 90Y-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  will increase  the cure rate by 
eliminating  minimal  residual  disease,  with minimal  additional  toxicity.  
17.4. Provisions  for Preventing  and Treating  AE’s  
Treatment  of febrile  neutropenia  and cytopenia  will be in accordance  with 
MSKCC  guidelines.  Rituximab  administration  will be premedicated  with 
acetaminophen  and diphenhydramine  (or chlorpheniramine),  as well as Ativan  to 
prevent  infusion -related  AE’s.  Infusion  will be titrated  as described  in the Rituxan  
Package  Insert  (See Appendix  A). In the event  of an adverse  reaction,  the infusion  
will be stopped,  the patient  will be assessed,  and treatment  will be administered    
in accordance  with standard  medical  practice.  Patients  will also receive      
standard  anti-emetics  as prophylaxis  against  nausea  and vomiting  with R-     
CHOP  therapy.  
17.5. Alternatives/Options  for Treatment  
Patients  who refuse  to participate  in this study  will be offered  standard  therapy,  
which  includes  CHOP  or R-CHOP.  Alternative  chem otherapy  regimens  such as 
CEPP  may be considered  for patients  in whom  CHOP  or R-CHOP  would  not be 
considered  safe. 
17.6. Costs  
The patient  will be responsible  for all costs  related  to treatment  and complications  
associated  with R-CHOP  chemotherapy.  Biogen  Idec,  inc. Pharmaceuticals  will 
provide  Rituximab  given  during  the Radioimmunotherapy  Phase  of the study.  
Biogen  Idec,  Inc.. Pharmaceuticals  will provide  the cost of 90Y-ibritumomab  
tiuxetan  and 111In-ibritumomab  tiuxetan  , its preparation,  and administration.  
Testing  for minimal  residual  disease  studies  and progenitor  cell studies  will also 
be provided  by Biogen  Idec,  Inc. The patient  will be responsible  for the costs  of 
all scans,  standard  laboratory  tests,  and hospitalizations  during  the course  of this 
study.  
17.7. Privacy  and Confidentiality  
Confidentiality  will be maintained  within  the limits  of the law. Only  qualified  
individuals  from  MSKCC,  the FDA,  and Biogen  Idec,  Inc.. Pharmaceuticals  will 
be able to review  patient  medical  records.  Neither  the patients’  names  nor other  
identifying  information  will be used in reports  or publications  arising  from  this 
study.

Procedures  for obtaining  Research  Authorization:  Before  any protocol -specific  
procedures  are carried  out, investigators  and/or  designated  staff will fully explain  the 
details  of the protocol,  study  procedures,  and the aspects  of patient  privacy  
concerning  research  specific  information.  In addition  to signing  the IRB Informed  
Consent,  all patients  must  sign the Research  Authorization  component  of the 
informed  consent  form.  The Research  Authorization  requires  a separate  signature  
from  the patient.  The original  signed  documents  will become  part of the patient’s  
medical  record,  and each patient  will receive  a copy  of the signed  documents.  
 
Patients  potentially  eligible  for this trial will be informed  about  the nature  of their 
disease  and the standard  treatment  options  will be discussed.  Enrollment  in this trial 
will be offered  and the expected  benefits  and potential  risks  involved  with this 
treatment  program,  including  risks associated  with the various  agents  and procedures,  
will be explained.  A written  informed  consent  form  reiterating  these  points  will be 
provided  for review.  Patients  wishing  to enroll  will be required  to sign three  copies  of 
the consent  form;  one will be returned  to the patient,  one will be filed in the patient’s  
chart,  and one copy  will be filed with the Clinical  Trials  Office.  Individuals  authorized  
to obtain  written  consent  include  Attending  Physicians  from  the Lymphoma       
Service  listed  in Section  15.

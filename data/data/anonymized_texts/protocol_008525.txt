  2. Protoc ol Synopsis  
A Randomized Trial comparing the Drug -Eluting Stent (DES ) Below -the-Knee ( BTK ) 
Vascula r Stent System  (DES BTK Vascular Stent System)  vs Percutaneous 
Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) treating Infrapopliteal Lesions in Subjects with 
Critical Limb Ischemia   
The SAVAL  Pivotal Trial  
Trial 
Objective(s)  Primary objective:  To de monstrate a superior patency rate and 
acceptable safety rates in be low the knee arteries with lesions treated 
with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent System vs percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty (PTA).  
Secondary objective:  To collect additional information on l imb salvage 
and overa ll quality of life in this patient population.  
Planned 
Indication(s) for 
Use  The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System is intended to improve luminal 
diameter in critical limb ischemia (CLI) subjects with lesions of the 
infrapopliteal arteri es with reference ves sel diameters (RVD) ranging 
from 2.5 – 3.75mm and total lesion lengths up to 140mm. 
Test Device and 
Sizes  The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System for treatment of lesions in the 
infrapopliteal a rteries .

Control Device  Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)  balloon catheter.  
Trial Design  The trial will be conducted in 2 phases.  
Phase A is a global, pivot al, prospective, multice nter, 2:1 randomized 
controlled trial (RCT)  evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the DES 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
    Confidential SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 8 of 98  
  BTK  Vascular Stent System compared to PTA for the treatment  of 
lesions located in the arteries below the knee in subjects with CLI.  
In phase B  of the trial the DES BTK  Vascular Stent  will be implanted 
into an additional 100 subjects to collect ongoing safety and 
effectiveness data.  
Planned 
Number of 
Subjects  1. Phase A  randomized controlled trial ( RCT ): Approximately  201 
subjects are expected to be enrolled to support a 2:1 randomization. 
2. Phase B  non- randomized: A pproximately 100 additional subjects are 
expected to be enrolled in phase B , which is structured as a non -
randomized singl e arm study, in which all subjects will be treated 
with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent S ystem.  
Planned 
Number of Investigational Centers / 
Countries  The trial will be conducted in the United States, Europe, Japan  and 
potentially Singapore, Taiwan and/or Hong K ong, at up to 50 
investigational centers, with up to 35 centers located in the US. Enrollment is expected to be distributed approximately equally across 
regions. 
Phase A  RCT  
Primary 
Effectiveness Endpoint  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint ( Phase A  RCT)  
The primary effectiveness endpoint assesses primary patency at 12 
months post -procedure . This effectiveness endpoint is designed to 
demonstrate that the 12- month primary patency for the DES BTK  
treatment group is superior to the PTA treatment group at an overall one-sided significance level of 2.5%.   
Primary vessel patency is defined as a b inary endpoint to be determined 
via duplex ultrasound (DUS) measuring flow or no flow at t he 12- month 
follow -up visit in the absence of clinically -driven target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) or bypass of the target lesion. All DUS readings 
will be assesse d by an independent core laboratory. 
Primary Safety 
Endpoint(s)  Primary Safety Endpoint ( Phase A  RCT)  
The primary safety endpoint assesses major adverse events (MAE) at  12 
months post -procedure. This safety endpoint is designed to demonstrate 
that the 12- month MAE -free rate for the DES BTK treatment group is 
non-inferior to the PTA  treatment group at an overall one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.  
A major adverse event is defined as:  
• Above ankle amputation of the index limb 
• Major re -intervention (new bypass graft,  jump/interposition 
graft , or thrombectomy/thrombolysis)  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
    Confidential SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 9 of 98  
  • Perioperati ve (30 day) mortality  
Additional 
Endpoints  • Primary and assisted -primary patency at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 
months post -procedure  
• Clinically -driven t arget lesion revascularization  (TLR) rate at 
each time point  
• Hemodynamic outcomes (changes in Ankle -Brachial Index 
[ABI] and /or Toe-Brachial Index [TBI] ) at 6 and 12 months post 
procedure  
• Wound asse ssment (changes in wound characteristics)  
• Major amputation rate  
• Change in Rutherford clas sification at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 
months post procedure

procedure  
• Adverse events (AEs) at each time point  (to be classified as 
major, serious, non- serious, unanticipated, procedure -related and 
device- related)  
• 30-day unplanned hospital readmission rate1 
• Survival rate at 4 years and 5 years post -procedure  
Method of 
Assigning 
Subjects to 
Treatment  Phase A RCT: Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 f ashion (2 
DES BTK  to 1 PTA). 
Phase B  Non-Randomized  
Primary Safety 
Endpoint  Primary safety endpoint ( Phase B  non-randomized)  
The primary safety endpoint assesses MAE s at 12 months post -
procedure. This safety endpoint is designed to demonstrate that the 12-month MAE -free rate in subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular 
Stent System exceeds a performance goal of  71% at an overall one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.

RCT have completed the 12-month foll ow-up visit, are withdrawn prior 
to the 12- month follow -up visit, have died or, the last 12- month follow -
up visit window has closed.  Phase B  non- randomized will be considered complete for the primary 
safety endpoint after all subjects in phase B have completed the 12 -
month follow -up visit , are withdrawn prior to the 12- month follow -up 
visit, have died or, the last 12 -month follow -up visit window has closed.  
The entire trial will be considered complete with regard to all follow -up, 
after all subjects have completed the 60- month follow -up visit, are 
withdrawn prior to the  60-month follow -up visit, have died or, the last 
60-month follow -up visit window has closed.  
Trial Duration  Phase A  RCT  
Enrollment in phase A  RCT is expected to take approximately two years  
to enroll the approximately 201 subjects , and 5 years of follow -up is 
planned.  
Phase B  non-randomized:  
Enrollment in  phase B  non- randomized is planned to start after 
enrollment in  phase A  RCT is complete.  The timing for beginning phase 
B enrollment will be communicated by the Boston Scientific clinical 
trial team.  
Enrollment of the approximately 100 additi onal subjects into phase B  
non-randomized is expected to take approximately 1 year , and  5 years of 
follow -up is planned.  
The total duration from the enrollment of the first subject in phase A  
RCT to the last follow -up in phase B  non- randomized cohort is expected 
to be approximately 11 years.

5. Guidewire has  successfully crossed the target lesion (s) 
Intra -procedure 
Exclusion 
Criteria  1. Angiographic evidence of intra -arterial acute/subacute thrombus or 
presence of atheroembolism  
2. Treatment required in > 2 target vessels  (Note: a target lesion 
originating in one vessel and extending into another vessel is considered 1 target vessel)  
3. Treatment requires the u se of alternate therapy in the target  
vessel(s)/lesion(s), (eg, atherectomy, cutting balloon, re -entry 
devices, laser, radiation therapy)  
4. Aneurysm is present in the target vessel(s)  
5. Extremely calcified lesions  
Multiple 
Interventions / Index Procedure  Multiple interventions in the target limb are permitted during the index 
procedure for the treatment of above the knee inflo w lesion s (lesions 
located in the iliac artery, superficial femoral artery and/or popliteal artery) . Inflow lesions may be treated a ccording to the investigator’s 
standard procedures  using commercially  available devices. If 
atherectomy is performed, the us e of an embolic protection device is 
strongly recommended.  
The inflow interventions must be deemed successful  (eg, absence of 
dista l embolization, optimal restoration of inflow, etc) prior to the 
randomization and/or treatment of the target lesion(s) . 
Drug-coated  balloons are not permitted for treatment of the target 
lesion(s) in the trial.  
Treatment of outflow lesion(s) (lesions loc ated in the segment of the 
target vessel distal to the target lesion) is not permitted.  
Successful guidewire crossing of all  target lesion(s) is required prior to 
randomization/enrollment into the trial.  
Statistical Methods in Phase  A RCT  
Primary 
Effectiveness 
Statistical Hypothesis and The primary effectiveness hypothesis to be teste d is that the 12-month 
primary patency in subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular St ent 
System is superior to subjects treated with PTA at an overall one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.

    Confidential SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 15 of 98  
  Test Method  
 
Phase A  RCT  A Wald z -test for the difference in 12-month pr imary patency will be 
used to assess the e ffectiveness hypothesis . 
H0: Pt -  Pc ≤   0 
H1: Pt -  Pc > 0  
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month primary patency for the DES BTK  
stent and PTA, respectively. 
Primary Safety 
Statistical 
Hypothesis and Test Method  
Phase A RCT The primary safety hypothesis to be t ested is that the 12-month MAE -
free rate in subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent System is 
non-inferior to  subjects treated with PTA at an overall one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.  
A Wald z- test for the difference in 12- month MAE -free rate will be used 
to assess the safety hypothesis . 
H0: Pt -  Pc  ≤  ∆ 
H1: Pt -  Pc > ∆  
where Pt and Pc are th e 12-month MAE -free rate for DES BTK  stent 
and PTA, respectively, and Δ (delta) is the non- inferiority margin of -
10%.3 4  
Success  Criteria 
for Phase A  
RCT  The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded to be superior 
to PTA for device effectiveness if the one -sided lower bound of 97.5 % 
confidence interval on the difference between treatment groups ( DES 
BTK  – PTA) in 12- month pr imary patency is greater than zero.  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded t o have no 
safety concerns if the one -sided lower bound of 97.5% confidence 
interval on the difference between treatment groups ( DES BTK  – PTA) 
in 12- month MAE -free is greater than - 0.1. 
The trial  will be concluded a  success  if both the primary effectiveness 
endpoint and the primary safety endpoint are met . 
Sample Size 
Parameters  
 
Phase A  RCT  The overall sample size is driven by the primary effectiveness endpoint. 
Approximately 201 subjects are planned to be enrolled in phase A  RCT. 
The sample size justification for phase A RCT is based on the following assumptions. 
• Power ≥ 84%  
• One-sided overa ll significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• Expected PTA 12- month primary patency = 40%  
• DES BTK  to demonstrate 25% treatment effect  
• Allocation ( DES BTK  vs PTA) = 2:1 
• A minimum of 1 50 evaluable subjects are required at 12 months 
(ideally  100 in DES BTK  arm and 50 in PTA  arm) 
• Attrition rate in 12 months ≤25% 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
    Confidential SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 16 of 98  
  • Approximately  201 subjects are planned to be randomized in 2:1 
fashion prior to the procedure  
Analysis Sets  
 
Phase A  RCT 
 The intention -to-treat (ITT) population will be the primary a nalysis set 
for assessing the pr imary hypotheses. Both per -protocol (PP) and a s-
treated (AT) populations will be the secondary analyses sets for 
reference.  
• ITT: all randomized subjects will be included in the ITT analysis 
set, regardless of whether the sub jects receive the assigned 
treatment. The DES BTK  and PTA arms wil l be compared as 
randomized .  
• PP: only randomized subjects who receive the assigned index 
treatment will be included in the PP analysis set. The DES BTK  
and PTA arms will be compared as rand omized and correctly 
received in dex treatment.  
• AT: all subjects wh o receive either the DES BTK  stent or PTA at 
the index procedure will be included in the A T analysis set. DES 
BTK  and PTA arms will be compared as treated, excluding 
subjects who do not rece ive the DES BTK stent or PTA. 
Statistical Methods in Phase B  Non-randomized  
Testing 
Hypotheses Strategy  
Phase B Non-
randomized  The primary safety hypothesis will be tested at 12 months post index procedure for all evaluable subjects from phase A  RCT and the 
additional 100 phase B subje cts. 
Primary Safety 
Statistical Hypothesis and 
Test Method  
 
Phase B Non-
randomized  The primary s afety hypothesis to be tested is that the 12-month MAE -
free rate in subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent System 
exceeds a performance goal (PG) of 71%1 at one -sided significance lev el 
of 2.5%.  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the  safety  hypothesis of meeting the 
PG in the 12- month MAE -free rate .  
H0: Pt ≤  PG (not met)  
H1: Pt > PG (met)  
where Pt is the 12 -month MAE -free rate for th e subjects treated with the 
DES BT K Vascular Stent System and the PG is the performance goal . 
Success Criteria  
Phase B Non-
randomized  The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System  will be concluded as meeting the 
PG for device safety if the one- sided lower bound of 97.5% confidence 
interval on the observed 12- month MAE -free rate is greater than 0.71.  
Sample Size 
Parameters  The sample size is  driven by the safety PG.  
• Power ≥ 80%  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
    Confidential SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 17 of 98  
   
Phase B Non-
randomized  • One-sided significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• Safety PG = 71%2 in the 12- month MAE -free rate  
• Expected 12- month MAE -free rate = 80%  
• A minimum of 186 ( DES BTK ) evaluable subjects are required 
at 12 months  
• Attrition rate at 12 months ≤  20%  
• Up to  234 ( DES BTK ) subjects are planned to be enrolled, 
including 134 DES BTK  subjects from phase A  RCT and an 
additional 100 DES BTK  subjects to be enrolled in phase B  non-
randomized.  
Analysis Set  
Phase B Non-
randomized  All subjects who receive the DES BTK  Vascu lar Stent System will be 
assessed against the pre- specified safety PG.  
Medications  Anti-coagulation and antiplatelet therapy is to be administered prior to 
and during the index procedure according to the investigator’s standard 
procedures . 
Dual antiplate let therapy is required post -procedure through the 6- month 
visit and is strongly recommended to continue t hrough the 12- month 
visit for subjects who receive the DES BTK  stent .* 
Subjects who are randomized to PTA in phase A RCT will receive antiplatelet the rapy according to the investigator’s standard of care.  
*A subject may be exempt from dual antiplatelet requirement when anticoagulation therapy is required for comorbidity treatment and when, in the judgement of the investigator, the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy would pose an unacceptable hemorrhage risk. 
DMC and CEC  The data monitoring committee (DMC) will review  overall trial conduct 
and safety . The DMC will review  approximately 46 randomized 
subjects ’ aggregate safety  data for the approval to use overlapping stents 
in the trial. The DMC charter will outline this process.  
The clinical events committee (CEC) will adjudicate the following 
endpoints and major adverse events reported by the trial investigators : 
• All deaths  
• Clinically -driven TLR  
• TVR  
• Target limb major amputations  
• Target Lesion stent thrombosis  
Core 
Laboratories  / 
Central The following core laboratories will be  established for the central 
assessment of key data collected during the trial:  
• Angiography:

diagnostic  
o To confirm stent fractures identified by the X -ray core lab  
• Ultrasound: to assess ultrasounds taken during the follow -up 
period for lesion and stent patency  
• X-ray: to assess high definition x- rays for stent integrity  
• Independent Wound Reviewer: to review wound assessment data 
and images.

  4. Introduction  and Background  
Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a progression of peripheral artery disease (PAD), 
characterized by severe obstructi on of arteries (especially in the lower limbs) which reduces 
blood flow to the extremities and places patient tissue viability at risk . 5  Patients with CLI 
experience severely debilitating clinical outcomes, inclu ding severe pain in the impacted 
limb even at rest, risk of open ulceration, gangrene and, if not treated properly, a mputation of 
limb(s). These outcomes reduce patient mobility and quality of life . 5 Patients with  CLI also  
experience increased risk of mortality, increasing further for those  undergoi ng limb 
amputations. Diabetics  with CLI are at particularly high risk for advanced complications; 
studies indicate that within one year of CLI diagnosis, 40% to 50% of diabetics will 
experience an amputation.  6   
The standa rd of care for CLI pa tients has historically utilized one of two methods for 
revascularization of dis eased infrapopliteal vessels , either by surgical bypass or percutaneous 
transluminal angioplasty (PTA). While surgical bypass has shown to be a potential a venue 
for revasculari zation of BTK arteries and was considered the frontline therapy for CLI 
patients, the surgery is invasive and technicall y challenging, espe cially considering the 
fragile health state of the affected population. Due to these challenges,  this procedure 
conti nues to experience significant variability in outcomes, patient healing, and costs. 7   
There are important limitations and risks associated  with bypass surgery, includi ng up to 
20% of patients experiencing significant postoperative morbidity and  10 to 20% of patients 
experiencing frequen t wound complicatio ns. Additionally, new stenosis within the vein graft 
conduit occurs in 30% to 40% of patients wi thin the first two ye ars after surgery . 
In recent years, the arrival of endovascular treatment of CLI has been driven by the continued evolut ion of catheter -based technologies due to the benefits of a less invasive approach in 
treating this fragile populat ion.
8  It is well established that recovery from PTA is significantly 
faster than open surgery. Patients treated with PTA do not experience common surgical complications associated with bypass, such as wound morbidity. PTA has been shown to have similar outcomes to that of surgical bypass.

Intra vascular stents were developed in response t o the inability  of PT A to prevent immediate 
or near -term loss of arterial patency due to dissection or lesion recoil. The scaffolding 
support provided by stent technology is  a primary  reason for their utilization . Drug -eluting 
stents were developed to reduce neointimal hyperpl asia to address  the impact of r estenosis 
rates associated  with PTA therapy . Infrapopliteal atherosclerotic lesion s characteri zed by 
longer calcified lesion s in smaller diameter vasculature do not respond well to PTA.  11 
The benefits of using short coronary drug- eluting stents has been well -studied in 
infrapopliteal le sions; randomized clinical trials have shown a benefit in terms of patency and 
re-intervention rates as compared to PTA  3,4,12 with long- term results reported out t o 5 years. 
13  However, none of these coronary drug- eluting stents have bee n appr oved in the United 
States for infrapopliteal use. T here are major limitations of using coronary drug- eluting stents 
below the knee, i ncluding the limited available lengths relative to the artery lengths to be 
treated, relative in flexibility, and risk of fracture given the unique conditions of infrapopliteal

treatment of the longer lesions associated with CLI below the knee.

4.2. Trial Rationale  
Critical limb ischemia is a debilitating disease, associated with poor clinical outcomes, a high 
rate of am putations, and overall decreased quality of life. Based on the significant clinical 
complications associated with bypass surgery, the prese nce of chronic tot al occlusions, the  
restenotic characteristics with PTA therapies, and the limitations of using coronary stents in BTK indications, the need for an alternative therapy exists . 
 The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System aims to address these treatm ent gaps and clinical 
outcomes not adequately addressed by sur gical bypass and/or PTA. The DES B TK Vascular 
Stent Sys tem was  designed for the unique considerations of infrapopliteal disease, including 
long, tortuous lesions and the need for a mechanism of providing an anti -proliferative ag ent 
to calcified vessels. The DES  BTK Vascular Stent System in corporates existing s uccessful 
peripheral drug- eluting stent technology to treat a similar disease state below the knee.  
5. Device Description  
The DES BTK  Vascular  Stent System or DES BTK (SAVAL) Drug -Eluting Vascular Stent 
System  is a medical device containi ng an ancillary medic inal substance, that provides a 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
    Confidential SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 28 of 98  
  mechanical scaffold for vascular lumen support (the stent component) and a pharmacological 
agent (paclitaxel) targeted towards reducing the injury response that leads to restenosis after 
stent implantation.  All references m ade herein to the DES BTK device and DES BTK 
Vascular Stent System are synonymous with the SAVAL device and SAVAL Drug- Eluting 
Vascular Stent System, re spectively.  
The DES BTK Vascular Stent System  is comprised of 3 main parts:  
• Stent component  
• Stent coati ng (primer layer and active layer with drug substance)  
• Delivery system  
5.1. The DES BTK Vascular Stent System  
The DES BTK  stent ( Figure 5.1- 1) is a laser cut self -expanding stent composed of a nick el 
titanium alloy (nitinol). Shape memory alloys exhibit special properties including super 
elasticity and shape memory. Nitinol can exist in two phases: a mart ensite phase and an 
austenite phase. Changing from the martensite phase to the austenite phase, or the reverse, is 
referred to as a phase transformation. During a phase transform ation, the atoms rearrange and 
allow the material to exhibit a different behav ior. Phase transformations can occur as a result 
of temperature or stress changes in the material.  
During manufactur e, the DES BTK  stent undergoes heat treatments that impart “memory” on 
the nitinol material, allowing it to expand to a specified diameter when exposed to certain 
conditions of stress or temperature. Then the stent is loaded into the delivery system, which constrains the stent until it is deployed at the target lesion. As the stent is exposed to body temperature, it expands to appose the vess el wall. The blood vessel restricts full expansion of 
the stent diameter; therefore, recommended  stent to vessel sizi ng is up to one to one fourth 
millimeter less than the stent nominal diameter . 
The DES BTK  Drug -Eluting Vascular Stent System is intended to improve luminal diameter 
in the treatment of symptomatic de novo or restenotic lesions in the native infrapopliteal  
arteries with reference vessel diameters (RVD) ranging from 2.5 – 3.75mm.  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System is designed to optimize  stent flexibility , 
radial/compressive strength, and fatigue properties  for performance below the knee. The stent 
has three tantalum markers on the proximal and distal ends of the stent, for a total of six 
markers on each stent .

5.2. DES BTK Delivery System  
The stent is constrained within a tapered delivery syst em which is 6F (2.1 mm maximum 
OD) at the proximal end and has a 5F (1.7 mm) crossing profile. The delivery system  is a 
triaxial design with a n outer shaft to stabilize the stent delive ry system, a middle shaft to 
protect and constrain the stent, and an inner shaft to provide a guidewire lumen. The delivery 
system is intended for use with 0.014 in (0.36 mm) guidewires. A radiopaque marker at the  
distal end of the delivery system aids in visibility during deployment. The DES BTK delivery system is offered in  a 130 cm working length ( Figure 5.2- 1). Additional delivery systems 
may be added upon regulatory approval to include them  in the trial. 
 
Figure 5.2- 1: DES BTK Delive ry System  
 
5.3. DES BTK Stent Coating  
The DES BTK  stent is a self -expanding stent with a drug/polymer coating. The coating 
comprises two layers, a n inner primer layer and an outer polymer matrix that contains an 
active pharmaceutical ingredient (paclitaxel).  (Figure 5.3- 1)

5.3.1. Primer Polymer and Drug Matrix Co -polymer Carrier  
The stent contains a primer polymer layer  poly(n- butyl methacr ylate) (PBMA) between the 
bare metal stent and drug matrix layer. The chemical structure of PBMA is provided in 
Figure 5.3- 2. 
Figure 5.3- 2: Poly( n-butyl methacrylate)  (PBMA)  
 
The drug matrix layer is comprised of a semi -crystalline random copolymer, poly(vinylidene 
fluoride -co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF -HFP), blended with paclitaxel. The chemical 
structure of PVDF -HFP is provided in Figure 5.3- 3.

5.3.2. Paclitaxel Drug  
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in the DES BTK  vascular stent  is paclitaxel (PTx). The 
chem ical name of paclitaxel is: Benzenepropanoic acid, ß - (benzoylamino) - α- hydroxy –
,6,12 b – bis (acetyloxy) - 12 - (benzoyloxy) -  2a,3,4,4a,5,6,9,10,11,12,12a,12b- dodecahydro-

b]oxet -9-yl ester, [2aR - [2aα,4ß,4aß,6ß,9α (αR*,ßS*),11α,12α,12aα,12bα]]. Paclitaxel is a 
diterpenoid with a characteristic taxane skeleton of 20 carbon atoms, a molecular weight of 
853.91 g/mol and a molecular formula of  C47H51NO14. It is highly lip ophilic, insoluble in 
water, but freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and dimethyl 
sulfoxide. 14,15  The chemical structure of paclitaxel is provided in Figure 5.3- 4. 
 
Figure 5.3- 4: Chemical Structure of Paclitaxel (PTx)  
 
 
Paclitaxel is an antiproliferative drug that induces irreversible polymerization of cell 
microtubules, thus inhibiting mitosis. It is widely used in antineoplastic chemotherapy of cancers; however, doses required in chemotherapeutic treatment are significantly higher per treatment cycle in cancer patients than in peripheral artery disease patients.  
15  Pacli taxel has 
been shown to inhibit proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, effectively 
suppressing neointimal hyperplasia after vessel injury. 15, 16, 17 The drug- to-polymer 
formulation ratio in DES BTK  stents is 1:9 with a resulting paclitaxel loading density (total 
weight of drug/unit of stent surface area) of 0.236 µg/mm2.

in the US. Enrollment is expected to b e distributed approxi mately equally across region s. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria w ill be the same for both phases of the trial , with the 
exception of the target lesion length (prior to DMC approval for stent overlap) and the 
reference vessel diameter ( RVD) .  
Phase A  RCT is  expected to take approximat ely 2 years  to enroll the  approximate ly 201 
subjects , and 5 years of follow -up is planned.  
Enrollment in phase B  non- randomized will begin after  enrollment into phase A RCT is 
complete. The timing for beginning phase B enrollme nt will be communicated by t he Boston 
Scientific clinical trial team.  
Phase B  non- randomized is expected to  take approximately 1 year  to enroll the additional 
100 subjects , and 5 years of follow -up is planned.  
Clinical follow -up will b e the same for both t rial phases , with required t rial visits at 1, 3, 6, 
12, 24 and 36 months post procedure. Telephone follow -up visits will be completed at 18 and

  7.4. Treatment Assignment  
7.4.1.   Phase A  RCT  
• Trial candidates must  satisfy all pre -procedure inclusion criteria and no pre -
procedure exclusion criteria pri or to the intervention, and 
• Subjects must satisfy all intra -procedure inclusion criteria and no intra -procedure 
exclusion criteria to be eligible for ra ndomization/enr ollment into the tria l.  
The 2:1 randomization for phase A  RCT will be stratified by inve stigational center  
and lesion length with 2 subjects receiving the DES BTK  stent for every 1 subject 
receiving treatment with standard PTA.  
For phase A RCT, the subjec t is considered ‘enrolled’ into the trial at the time of 
randomization (i.e. when a treat ment assignment is received by the study site). 
7.4.2. Phase B  non-randomized  
• Trial candidates must satisfy all pre -procedure inclusion criteria and no pre -
procedure exclusio n criteria prior to the intervention, and 
• Subjects must satisfy all intra -procedure inclusion criteria and no intra -procedure 
exclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the trial.  
For phase B  non- randomized, the subject is conside red ‘enrolled’ into the trial at the  
time the  DES BTK stent is introduced into the subject’s vasculature . 
7.5. Treatment and Control  
The DES BTK Vascular Stent System is the trial test device. Refer to Section 5, Device 
Description for product information. Comm ercially available PTA balloons are the control 
device for this trial.  
Drug coated balloons are not per mitted for treatment of the target lesion(s).  
7.6. Target and Non -Target Lesions  
Target Lesion(s)  
The target lesion (s) is defined as a stenotic, restenotic or occlusive seg ment located in the 
tibioperoneal trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peronea l artery(ies) with the 
following characteristics:  
• Target lesion (s) must be at least 4cm above the ankle joint

Non- Target Lesion(s)  
Multiple interventions in the target limb are permi tted during the index procedure for the 
treatment of above the knee inflow lesions  (lesions located i n the iliac artery, superficial 
femoral artery and/or popliteal artery) . Inflow lesions  may be treated according to the 
investigator’s standard procedures using commercially -available devices. If atherectomy is 
performed , the use of an embolic protection device is strongly recommended.  
The inflow interventions must be deemed successful (eg, absence of distal embolization, 
optimal restoration of inflow, etc .) prior to the randomization and/or treatment of the target 
lesion.  
Treatment of outflow lesion(s) ( lesions located in the segment of the target vessel distal to 
the target lesion) is not  permitted . 
7.7. Justification for the Trial Design  
The SAVAL  phase A  RCT  will compare the safety and effectiveness of the DES BTK  
Vascular Stent System vs PTA for the treatm ent of atherosclerotic lesion(s) i n the 
infrapopliteal arteries. Current r evascularizat ion options for infrapopliteal atherosclerotic 
disease include both endovascular and surgical approaches. The foundation of endovascular revascularization is PTA, and while advancements have been made in endovascular 
approaches for below the knee disease, patency rates remain suboptimal . 
2 
As described in section 4, drug- eluting stents have been used for coronary artery 
revascularizatio n since their introduction in 2003, and this  technology, used for the treatment 
in coronary vessels of similar diameters as those found in the infrapopliteal anatomy , 
supports the use of drug- eluting stents  below the knee.

  Phase A RCT will assess primary effectiveness and safety of the DES BTK Vascular Stent 
System when compared to PTA  at 12 months post procedure , and phase B non- randomized is 
designed to demonstrate additional safety and effectiveness for the DES B TK Vascular Stent 
System out to 12 months post procedure.

  9. Subject Accountability  
9.1. Point of Enrollment  
Subjects (or legal guardian, if applicable) must sign and date the institutional review board 
(IRB)/ ethics committee  (EC)-approved trial -specific informed consent form (ICF) prior to 
the completion of any trial -related procedure(s).  
The subject must satisfy all pre -procedure inclusion criteria and none of the pre -procedure 
exclusion criteria prior to the intervention.  
Subjects must satisfy all intra -procedure inclusion criteria and none of the intra -procedure 
exclusion criteria to be e nrolled into the trial.  
• The point of enrollment for phase A  RCT is at the time a subject is randomized for 
the trial (i.e. when a treatment assignment is received by the study site)  
• The point of enrollme nt for phase B  non- randomized is at the time the DES  BTK 
stent is introduced into the subject’s vasculature.  
 
Subjects who do not satisfy the pre -procedure eligibility criteria will receive care according 
to the investigational center’s standard procedures  and no further trial -related procedures will 
be com pleted. They will be considered a screen failure and followed according to the center’s 
standard procedures.  
 
Subjects who do not satisfy the intra -procedure eligibility criteria will not be 
randomized/en rolled into the trial, and will receive care accordi ng to the center’s standard 
procedures  and considered a sc reen failure.  
 
Subjects, who are enrolled/randomized into the DES BTK arm but do not have the DES BTK stent successfully implanted , will be follow ed for 30 days for safety, and be withdrawn from 
the trial afterwards . 
9.2. Withdrawal  
All subjects who are enrolle d into the trial will be accounted for and documented. If a subject 
withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) will be reported. If such withdrawal 
is due to problems related to invest igational device safety or performance, the investigator 
will ask for the subject’s permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical 
trial.   Subjects may withdraw from the trial at a ny time by notifying the trial investigator. The 
investigator may also terminate a subject’s participation in the trial ( ie, if the subject 
routinely fails to complete required trial procedures or if the investigator believes it is in the subject’s best in terest).  
 Examples of reasons for trial withdrawal i nclude, but are not limited to:  
• Failure to comply with the trial- required visit schedule  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
    Confidential SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 44 of 98  
  • Subject is lost to follow -up 
• Subject voluntarily withdraws from the trial  
• Adverse event such that continued trial participation would not be in the best interest 
of the subject  
• Withdrawal of the subject by the investigator  
• Subject death  
• Trial closure  
 
It is recommended that the reason for subject withdrawal is also documented in the subject’s 
medical record. If applica ble, t he investigator will complete an adverse event  and/or device 
deficiency assessment prior to the subje ct’s withdrawal from the trial. All applicable 
electronic case report forms (eCRFs) are to be completed for all subjects who are enrolled in 
the tria l and are then withdrawn from the trial for any reas on. 
Withdrawn subjects will not undergo any further tri al follow -up, nor will they be replaced 
because the justified sample size considers an estimated allowance for attrition. Data already 
collected will be retained and reported, however, no new data will  be collected after the 
withdrawal.   
Subjects voluntari ly withdrawing from the trial will be asked to participate in a limited 
capacity allowing their medical status to be followed by telephone contact, m edical chart 
review, or by other agreed upon method. If a subject  decides  not to continue participation in a 
limited capacity, the investigator  will not access their  medical record or other confidential 
records for new purposes related to the study; howeve r, study data collected prior to their  
withdrawal ma y be reviewed and publicly available records may be con sulted prior to or after 
their withdrawal.  Note: this applies to all withdrawn subjects (e.g. withdrawn by 
investigator ). 
Withdrawn subjects will be followed according to the investigational center’s s tandard 
procedures. Serious adverse device -effects that are still ongoing at the end of the subject’s 
participation in the trial will be followed up for resolution status  and this information will be  
provided to Boston Scientific  for the purpose of regulat ory agency reporting for the trial . 
9.3. Lost to Follow -Up 
Additional actions must be taken when a participant fails to attend a required study visit:  
The investigational  center  personnel will attempt to conta ct the study subject and reschedule 
the missed v isit (within the visit window if  possible) and counsel the subject on the 
importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule. 
Prior to withdrawing a subject as lost to follow -up, the investigational center ’s personnel 
must make at minimum 3 documented attempts (1 in writing and sent via a traceable method) 
to bring the subject in for a final trial visit. Other contacts ( ie, telephone calls, emails) must 
be documented in the subject’s records at the investigational center. If all attempts to contact that subj ect have failed, the investi gational center will withdraw the subject and follow the 
local procedures for notification.

  9.4. End-of-Study Definition  
Phase A  RCT will be considered complete for the primary eff ectiveness endpoint and the 
primary safety endpoint after all subjects in phase A  RCT have completed the 12- month 
follow -up visit, are withdrawn prior to the 12 -month follow -up visit, have died or, the last 
12-month follow -up visit window has closed.  
 
Phas e B non- randomized will be considered complete fo r the primary safety endpoint after 
all subjects in phase B non- randomized have completed the 12 -month follow -up visit , are 
withdrawn prior to the 12 -month follow -up visit, have died or, the last 12- month follow -up 
visit window has closed.  The entire tria l will be considered complete with regard to all follow -up, after all subjects 
have completed the 60- month follow -up visit, are withdrawn prior to the 60 -month follow -up 
visit, have died or, the last 60- mont h follow -up visit window has closed.

10.3. Trial  Candidate Screening  
A screening log will be maintained by each investigational center to document selected 
information about potential subjects who fail to meet the SAVAL  trial eligibility criteria , 
including the reason for screen failure . 
10.3.1. Strategies for Recruitment a nd Retention 
Subjects may be recruited through the investigator’s practice, referring phy sicians and/or the 
use of recruitment tools. Potential subjects may be identified through an investigational center’s database query (chart reviews) or as new or exist ing patients attend clinic visits. Any 
information disseminated to potential subjects ( eg, advertisements, pamphlets, posters) must 
be approved by the investigational center’s IRB/ EC prior to use.  
It is important that the investigational center personnel review the trial requirements  with the 
subjects to maximize compliance with the follow -up schedule and required medication 
regimen. A stipend may be provided to subjects to cover lodging or travel expenses incurred as a result of participation in the SAVAL  trial, in accordance with country laws  and 
regulations , and per the trial investigationa l center ’s regulations.

Page 48 of 98  
 
  Rescreening for the Trial  
When a subject fails the pre-  or intra -procedure inclusion or exclusion criteria, and it is the 
opinion of the investigator that the subject may be a suitable candidate for rescreening, the 
investigator w ill contact the Boston Scientific trial manager , or designee  to request 
permission  to rescreen the su bject . 
10.4. Informed Consent  
The subject (or legal guardian, if applicable) must sign and date the ICF prior to any trial -
required testing or procedures. For individuals less than 20 years of age enrolled at a Japan center, the subject’s legal representative, as well as the subject, must provide written 
informed consent.  
Prior to signing the ICF , the investigator, or qualified designee, will explain to each potential 
subject the purpose and nature of the trial, procedures, expected trial duration, available alternative therapies, and the benefits and risks involved with trial participation .  
Refer to Section 9 .1 Point of Enrollment and Section 20 Informed Consent.  
10.5. Medications  
Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication use will be collected for the trial  and report ed on 
the electronic case report forms from the time of the pre- procedure visit through the 36-  
month follow up. Medication data collection at each visit w ill include: a complete listing of 
the anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications the subject is taking, interruptions and 
cessation.  
Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Medication for the Trial  
• Anti-coagulation and antiplatelet therapy is to be administered pr ior to and during the 
index procedure according to the investigator’s standard procedures . 
• Dual antip latelet therapy is required post -procedure through the 6- month visit and is 
strongly recommended to continue through the 12- month visit for the trial subje cts who 
receive the DES BTK  stent. * 
• Subjects who are randomized to PTA in phase A RCT will receive antiplatelet therapy 
according to the investigator’s standard of care .  
*A subject may be exempt from dual antiplatelet requirement when anticoagulation ther apy 
is required for comorbidity treatment and when, in the judgement of the investigator, the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy would pose an unacceptable hemorrhage risk.  
10.6. Quality of Life  
The QOL instruments used for the trial will be the EQ -5D questi onnaire for general health 
and the VascuQol questionnaire for disease specific  data.  
The E Q-5D is a descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five 
dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) , each 
of which can take one of five responses. The responses re cord five levels of severity (no 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 49 of 98  
 
  problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a 
particular EQ -5D dimension. 
The VascuQol was developed to evalu ate disease- specific QOL measure for patients with 
chronic lower limb isch emia. The 25 -item questionnaire is subdivided into 5 domains: pain, 
symptoms, activities, social and emotional.  
10.7. Wound  Care and Data Collection  
For Rutherford 5 subjects with minor ti ssue loss, ischemic ulcer, or focal gangrene, these 
tissue changes must be  located only in the digit(s) and/or the forefoot, and these lesions must 
be able to be fully resected (if needed) by performing digit amputation(s) or complete trans metatarsal  ampu tation. Study subject’s wounds must not require mid foot or hind foot 
ampu tation. If the investigator plans to undertake digit amputation(s) or  transmetatarsal 
amputation , this plan should be indicated at the time of study enrollment. 
It is recommended investigators follow the Wound H ealing S ociety 2014 update on 
guidelines for arterial ulcers.  
18 
Target limb w ound characteristics data will be collected and documented on the eCRFs. ( ie, 
wound size, depth, presence of infection, and healing status) . Wound images will be 
collected for the trial. Instructions for collection and submission of images will be provided in the manual of operations. 
A review of the wound assessment data will be completed by an independent re viewer who 
will be blinded to the randomized therapy.  
10.8. Pre-procedure  
The subject (and/or the legal guardian as applicable) must sign and date the ICF prior to the 
completion of any trial -related procedures. Subjects will be assessed to confirm trial 
eligib ility requirements. T he data collection elements for pre -procedure  should be collected ≤ 
30 days prior to the procedure  or as specified below.  
When it is determined that a subject does not satisfy the pre -procedure trial eligibility 
requirements, the trial -related procedures will stop, and  the subject will be considered a 
screen failure and  receive care according to the center’s standard procedures.  
When a subject fails the pre- procedure eligibility criteria, and it is in the opinion of the 
investigator  that the subject may be a suitable candidate for rescreening, the investigator will 
contact the Boston Scientific trial manager , or designee  to request permission  to rescreen the 
subject .

10.9. Index Procedure  
Diagnostic angiography of the lower extremities will be performed using the investigational 
center’s standard procedures. The investigator will confirm the subject satisfies all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria prior to randomization/enrollment into the trial.  
Multiple interventions in the target limb are permitted during the index procedure for the treatment of above the knee inflow lesions  (lesions located in the iliac artery, superficial 
femoral artery and/or popliteal artery) . Inflow lesions may be treated according to the 
investigator’s standard procedures using commercially- available devices. If atherectomy is 
performed , the use of an embolic protection device is  strongly re commended.  
The inflow interventions must be deemed successful (eg, absence of distal embolization, optimal restoration of inflow , etc) prior to the randomization and/or treatment of the target 
lesion (s). 
Successful guidewire crossing of all ta rget lesion(s) is required prior to 
randomization/enrollment into the trial.  
Treatment of outflow lesions(s) (lesions located in the segment of the target vessel distal to the target lesion)  is not permitted.  
Drug -coated balloons are not permitted for the treatment of the target lesion(s) in the trial.  
The use of an adjunctive therapy is not permitted for the target  lesion(s) (ie , atherectomy, 
cutting balloon, re -entry devices, laser, radiation therapy).  
The DES BTK V ascular Stent System will be used in co mpliance with the directions for use.  
10.9.1. Target lesion requirements:  
Stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive target lesions(s) located in the tibi operoneal trunk, anterior 
tibial, posterior tribal and/or peroneal artery(ies).  
• Target lesion (s) must be below the kne e and at least 4cm above the ankle joint  
• A single target lesion per vessel, in up to 2 vessels, in a  single limb  
• Degree of stenosis ≥ 70% by visual angiographic assessment  
• RVD is between 2.5 – 3.25mm for phase A RCT

Page 51 of 98  
 
  • RVD is between 2.5 – 3.75mm for phase B non- randomized  (Note : RVD is 
dependent on stent size being used. Refer to DFU for specific requirements)  
• Total ta rget lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 70mm for 
phase A  RCT prior to DMC  approval for stent overlap  
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with one DES BTK stent, if 
randomized to stent)  
• Total target lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 140mm for 
phase A  RCT after DMC  approval for stent overla p 
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with up to two DES BTK stents, if randomized to stent)  
• Total target lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 140mm for 
phase B  non- randomized  
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with up to two DES BTK stents)  
 
A ruler or radiopaque marking tape must be used as the calibration source to determine the lesion length and location. When possible the zero mark  will be placed at the level of an 
anatomical landmark ( ie, tibial platea u, inferior edge of the patella, bifurcation). 
10.9.2. Randomization/Enrollment  
In phase A RCT the randomization assignment will be obtained only after all of the following are confirmed:  
• All p re- and intra -procedure inclusion criteria are met  
• No exclusion criteri a are met  
• Successful guidewire crossing of the target lesion(s)  is required  prior to 
randomization/enrollment 
 
The investigator (or delegate) will access  the R ave electronic data capture system , and a 
randomization custom function will be used to assign subjects to the test or control treatment group. Treatment of the target lesion(s) will be in compliance with the randomization assignment.  
For phase B non- randomized, the DES BTK stent may be implanted after the following are 
confirmed:  
• All pre - and intra -procedure inclusion criteria are met  
• No exclusion criteria are met  
• Successful guidewire crossing of the target lesion(s) is required prior to enrollment  
 
If a subject does not satisfy all inclu sion criteria and/or does meet one of the exclusion 
criteria, the investigator will not randomize/enroll the subject and will proceed with treatment according to the center’s standard procedures , and the subject wil l be considered a screen 
failure.

  Subjec ts, who are enrolled/ randomized in to the DES BTK arm but  do not have the DES BTK  
stent successfully implanted , will be followed for 30 days for safety, and be withdrawn from 
the trial afterwards . 
10.9.3. Guidelines for trea tment of flow -limiting dissection or othe r loss of target vessel 
patency at the completion of the target l esion pre- treatment and d efinition of 
bailout s tenting  
Subjects randomized to the PTA  arm, who receive index angioplasty and subsequently 
demonstrate flow -limiting dissection or  other loss of target vessel patency  (ie, recoil ), based 
on the operator visual assessment and clinical judgement (ie, presence of contrast in the sub-
intimal space) , must re ceive repeat  2 to 5 minute s balloon inflations  (up to 3 inflations)  using 
standard PTA balloons . If target vessel compromise persists and requires further i ntervention 
(eg, “bailout  stent”) a DES BTK Vascular Stent System will be used, and these subjects will 
be considered a study primary endpoint failure and continue to attend study follow -up visits. 
Investigators must submit angiography to support the  decision for bailout stenting to the 
angio core lab for review.  
Note: The DES BTK  Vascular Sten t System may not be used for bailout in non- target 
lesions.

11. Statistical Considerations  
The sample s ize justification and the power analyses for phase A  RCT and phase B  non-
randomized are described in separate subsections. The general statistical methods are 
applicable to both phases unless otherwise specified.  
The details for sample size justification and all statistical analyses  will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan.  
11.1. Primary Endpoints for Phase A  RCT  
The overall sample size in phase A  RCT is justified by hypothesis parameters and driven by 
the 12- month primary effectiveness endpoint , to preser ve adequate statistical testing power 
for both the primary effectiveness endpoint and safety endpoint. 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 56 of 98  
 
  The primary effectiveness and safety hypotheses will be tested simultaneously at the 
significanc e lev el of one -sided 2.5%  each without adjustment .  
11.1.1. Prima ry Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint in phase A  RCT  is the  12-month primary patency. The 
goal is set to demonstrate that the primary patency for the DES BTK  treatment group ( ie, 
Test) is superior to the PTA treatment group ( ie, Cont rol) through 12 months post -procedure.  
11.1.1.1. Effectiveness Hypothesis  
The primary effectiveness hypothesis to be tested is that the 12- month primary patency in 
subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent System is superior to subjects treated with  
PTA at an  overall one -sided signific ance level of 2.5%. 
The null hypothesis (H 0) states that there is no pre -specified treatment effect of the DES BTK  
Vascular Stent System vs PTA , as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H 1) which states 
that there is a pre- speci fied treatment  effect. The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt -  Pc ≤  0 
H1: Pt -  Pc > 0 (superior)  
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month primary patency for the DES BTK  stent and PTA, 
respectively.  
11.1.1.2. Effectiveness Sample Size  
The overall sample size i s driven by t he primary ef fectiveness endpoint. Approximately 201 
subjects are planned to be enrolled in phase A  RCT. The sample size justification for phase A  
RCT is based on the following assumptions. 
• Power ≥ 84%  
• One-sided overall significance level (alp ha) = 2.5%  
• Expected PTA 12- month primary patency = 40%  
• DES BTK  to demonstrate 25% t reatment effect  
• Allocation ( DES BTK  vs PTA) = 2:1 
• A minimum of 1 50 evaluable subjects are required at 12 months (ideally 100 in DES 
BTK  arm and 50 in PTA  arm) 
• Attrition rate in 12 months ≤ 25% 
• Approximately 201 subjects are planned to be randomized in 2:1 fashion prior to the 
procedure  
11.1.1.3. Effectiveness Statistical Methods  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the primary effectiveness hypothesis . The p -value and 
corresponding c onfidence interva l for the difference between DES BTK and PTA in 12-
month primary patency will be constructed.  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 57 of 98  
 
  A detailed definition of evaluable subjects for the primary effectiveness  endpoint  will be 
given in the statistical analysis plan.  
11.1.2. Primary Safe ty Endpoint  
The pr imary composite safety endpoint  in phase A RCT is the 12- month MAE -free rate. The 
safety goal is designed to demonstrate that the DES BTK Vascular Stent System is non-
inferior to  PTA in terms of MAE -free rate through 12 months post -procedure.   
11.1.2.1. Safety Hypot hesis  
The primary safety hypothesis to be tested is that the 12- month MAE -free rate in subjects 
treated with the DES BTK Vascular Stent System is non- inferior to  subjects treated with 
PTA at an overall one -sided significance level of 2.5%. 
The null hypothe sis (H 0) states that there is no marginal treatment effect of the  DES BTK  
Vascular Stent System vs PTA , as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H 1) which states 
that there is a marginal treatment effect. The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt - Pc ≤  ∆  
H1: Pt -  Pc > ∆ 
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month MAE -free rate for the DES BTK  stent and PTA, 
respectively, and Δ (delta) is the non- inferiority margin of - 10%.  
11.1.2.2. Safety Sample Size/Power Analysis  
The power analysis for the primary safety endpoin t is based on the following assumptions. 
• One-sided overall significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• The primary safety endpoint will be tested simultaneously with the primary 
effectiveness endpoint at the same significance level  
• Expected PTA 12- month MAE -free rat e = 75%  
• Expected DES BTK  12-month MAE -free rate = 85%  
• Non-inferiority margin (∆) = - 10% 
The sample size is driven by the primary effectiveness endpoint to provide approximately 
80% power to assess the primary safety endpoint . 
11.1.2.3. Safety Statistical Methods  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the  primary safety hypothesis . The p -value and 
corresponding confidence interval for the difference between DES BTK and PTA in  12-
month MAE -free rate will be constructed.  
A detailed definition of evaluable subjects for the primary safety endpoint  will be giv en in 
the statistical analysis plan.

  11.1.3. Success Criteria  
The following success criteria for phase A  RCT are defined as both the primary effectiveness 
and primary safety endpoint to be met simultaneously, therefore there will be no multiplicity 
issues for the two primary endpoi nts. 
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded to be superior to PTA for device 
effectiveness if the on e-sided lower bound of 97.5 % confidence interval on the difference 
between treatment groups ( DES BTK  – PTA) in 12- month primary patency is grea ter than 
zero.  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded to have  no safety concerns if the 
one-sided lower bound of 97.5% confidence interval on the difference between treatment 
groups ( DES BTK  – PTA) in 12- month MAE -free is greater than - 0.1. 
The trial will be concluded to be a success  if both the primary effectiveness en dpoint and the 
primary safety endpoint are met . 
11.2. Primary Endpoint for Phase B  Non -randomized  
The overall sample size in phase B  non- randomized is justified by hypothesis parameter s and 
driven by the 12- month primary safety endpoint , to preserve adequate statistical testing 
power. The 12 -month primary patency will be observed without testing hypotheses . 
11.2.1. Primary Safety Endpoint  
11.2.1.1. Safety Hypotheses  
The primary safety hypothesis to be te sted is that the 12- month MAE -free rate in subjects 
treated with the DES BTK Vascular Stent System exceeds a PG of 71% at one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.  
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H 1) hypot heses for the primary safety endpoint are as 
follows : 
H0: Pt ≤ PG (not met)  
H1: Pt > PG (met)  
where Pt is th e 12- month MAE -free rate for the subjects treated with the DES BTK Vascular 
Stent System and the PG is the performance goal.  
11.2.1.2. Safety Sample Size/Power Analysis  
The power analysis for the primary safety endpoint to justify an  additional 100 subjects in 
enrol lment is based on the following assumptions. 
• Power ≥ 80%  
• One-sided significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• Safety PG = 71% in the 12- month MAE -free rate  
• Expected 12- month MAE -free rate = 80%  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 59 of 98  
 
  • A minimum of 1 86 (DES BTK ) evaluable subjects are required at 12 months  
• Attrition rate at 12 months ≤  20%  
• Up to  234 ( DES BTK ) subjects are planned to be enrolled, including 134 DES BTK  
subjects from phase A  RCT and an additional 100 DES BTK  subjects to be enrolled 
in phase B  non- randomized 
11.2.1.3. Safety Statistical Methods  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the  primary  safety hypothesis . The p-value for testing 
will be generated and the corresponding confidence interval for the observed 12- month 
MAE -free rate will be constructed.  
11.2.2. Success Criteria  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded as meeting the PG for device safety 
if the one -sided  lower  bound of  97.5% confidence interval on the observed 12- month MAE -
free rate is greater than 0.71.  
11.3. General Statistics Methods  
11.3.1. Analysis Sets  
For phase A  RCT, t he intention- to-treat (ITT) population will be the primary analysis set for 
asses sing the primary hypotheses. Both per -protocol (PP) and as -treated (AT) populations 
will be the secondary analyses sets for reference . 
For phas e B non- randomized, all subjects who receive the DES BTK  stent  will be assessed  
against the pre -specified PG.  
11.3.1.1. Intention -to-treat (ITT)  
All subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized in phase A  RCT will be 
included in the ITT analysis s et, regardless of whether the subjects receive the assigned 
treatment. The DES BTK  and PTA arms will be compared as randomized.  The ITT analysis 
will be the primary analysis for phase A  RCT . 
11.3.1.2. Per-protocol (PP)  
For the PP analysis, only randomized subjects w ho meet the eligibility criteria and receive 
the assigned index treatment will be included in the PP analysis set. The DES BTK  and PTA 
arms will be compared as randomized and cor rectly received index treatment . Subjects who 
do not receive the randomized in dex treatment will be excluded from the PP analysis set. T he 
PP analysis , as well as a discussion regarding what protocol deviations excluded subjects 
from the PP analysis , will be described in the clinical study report . 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 60 of 98  
 
  11.3.1.3. As-treated (AT)  
For the AT analysis , all subjects who receive either the DES BTK  stent or PTA at the index 
procedure will be included in the AT analysis set. The DES BTK  and PTA arms will be 
compared as treated, excluding subjects who do not receiv e the DES BTK  stent or PTA.  
11.3.1.4. Bailout Subjec ts Considerations  
For phase A RCT , the bailout subjects in the PTA arm will be analyzed in ITT, PP, and AT 
analysis sets.  
• For the ITT analysis, a bailout subject from the PTA arm will stay in the PTA arm 
and will count as a failure on the 12- month primary patency.  
• For the PP analysis, a bailout subject from the PTA arm will be excl uded from the PP 
analysis since the bailout subjects actually receive a device (investigational or not) in addition to randomized PTA.  
• For the AT analysis, a bailout subject fr om the PTA arm will be analyzed in the DES 
BTK arm if the subject receives the DES BTK test device as a bailout and count as 
success/failure based on 12-month effectiveness assessment  
For phase B non- randomized , the AT analysis will be the primary analysis . That is, all 
subjects who receive the DES BTK stent will be assessed against the pre -specified PG. 
Therefore, bailout subjects from the RCT PTA arm (and/or even from test device) who receive the DES BTK stent  will be included in the phase B hypothesis. 
11.3.2. Randomization Scheme  
Randomization to treatment in phase A RCT will be stratifie d by investigational center  and 
lesion length. A computer -generated list of random treatment allocations ( ie, a randomization 
sched ule) will be used to assign subjects to treatments in a 2:1 ratio of DES BTK  to PTA. 
This list will b e specific to the invest igational  center . Random permuted blocks of size 3 and 
size 6 will be employed to ensure approximate balance of treatment allocatio n within each 
stratum. 
11.3.3. Control for Systematic Error/Bias  
Selection of subjects will be made from the investigators’ general o r professional referral 
population. All subjects meeting the inclusion and no exclusion criteria , and have signed the 
protocol -specific ICF , will be eligible for enrollment in the trial. Consecutively eligible 
subjects should be enrolled into the trial to minimize selection bias. Trial subjects will be 
randomly assigned to a treatment group within the investigational  center  (phase A  RCT). In 
determining subject eligibility for th e trial, the investigator’s assessment of imaging will be 
used. However, an angiographic core laboratory will independently analyze the angiograms , 
and the data obtained from the core laboratory will be utilize d for analyses. An independent 
clinical events  committee (CEC) , composed of medical experts , will adjudicate safety 
assessmen ts, as defined in the CEC charter.

Page 61 of 98  
 
  11.3.4. Enrollment for Each Investigative Center  
For phase A RCT, investigational centers  will not be allowed to randomize more than 10% 
(N=20) of the  total number of randomized subjects without prior approval from the sponsor. 
No study center will be allowed to enroll more than 20% (N=40) of the total number of 
randomized subjects. 
For phase B non- randomized, investigational centers  will not be allowed  to enroll more than 
10% (N=23) of the total number (including DES BTK from pha se A RCT) of subjects 
without prior approval  from the sponsor. No study center  will be allowed to enroll more than 
20% (N=47) of the total number (including DES BTK  from phase A  RCT) of study subjects . 
11.3.5. Baseline Data Analysis  
Baseline covariates will be sum marized for phase A  RCT and phase B  non-randomized. For 
continuous and/or ordinal variables, the descriptive statist ics will include mean, standard 
deviation, number evaluated, minimum and maximum. Some specific variables may also 
include additional statis tics such as median and confidence intervals. For binary or 
categorical variables, the descriptive statistics will include percentage, numerator, 
denominator, and number evaluat ed. Some variables may include confidence intervals as 
needed.  
11.3.6. Additional  Endpo int Assessments 
No formal tests of hypotheses are proposed for additional endpoints. Statistical comparisons 
may be performed for exploratory purposes. No formal inferences are planned on the 
additional endpoints and therefore alpha -adjustments for multiple comparisons will not be 
used. 
All additional endpoints are observational.  
11.3.7. Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses ar e planned.  
11.3.8. Subgroup Analyses  
Primary endpoints and/or additi onal endpoints will be summarized and treatment groups may 
be compared in each subgroup identified by the following categor ies (but not limit to):  
• Race  
• Gender (male vs female)  
• Age (≥ 65 and < 65)  
• Diabet es status (medically -treated vs non -diabetic)  
• Lesion c haracteristics (vessel diameter/lesion length)  
• Device matrix (diameter/length)  
• Other significant predictors identified by regression models  
 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 62 of 98  
 
  No formal tests of hypotheses are proposed for subgroups and therefore alpha- adjustment for 
multiple comparisons will not be used. 
In addition, an interaction test for the primary effectiveness a ssessment at two -sided 
significance level of 0.15 will be performed for the following subgroups:  
• Gender (male vs female)  
11.3.9. Justification of Pooling  
The concept of poolability ana lysis described below is applicable to both phase A  RCT and 
phase B  non- randomized. 
 
The poolability analysis regarding the primary effectiveness and/or safety endpoint across 
investigational center s, as well as among US , Europe, and  Japan  will be assessed  only when 
the success criteria are met, by using t he logistic regression model with a two -sided 
significance level of 0.15. If the p- value of an interaction test is greater than or equal to 0.15, 
the non- significance suggests that the homogeneity of treat ment effect is shown , and the 
primary endpoints dat a are poolable. However , when the p- value of an interaction test is 
smaller than 0.15, the significance suggests that the heterogeneity of treatment effect is 
detected , and poolability analysis regarding prognostic factors and/or poolability adjusted for 
prognostic factors will be performe d. 
11.3.9.1. Investigational Center Poolablity  
Due to the 2:1 randomization scheme using random permuted blocks ( ie, blocks of 3 and 6) 
employed within each center , ideally there wi ll be 2 DES BTK  subjects for every 1 PTA 
subject. O nly sites that enrolled sufficient subjects (i.e. 5 or more subjects) will be included 
for this poolability analysis and these sites will be reported individually.  
11.3.9.2. US, Europe, and Japan  Poolablity  
The focu s is mostly on the applicability of  the European and Japanese populations with the 
US po pulation. If the treatment effect is significantly different among US , Europe, and 
Japanese populations then possible/plausible explanation is required and/or potential  bias 
needs to be addressed.  
11.3.10.  Sensitivity Analys is for Missing Outcome Data 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary effectiveness and/or safety endpoints will be conducted 
to assess the impact of missing data on the result’s robustness. In addition to the use  of the 
worst -case analysis, the tipping point a nalysis will be performed for the ITT  and PP analys es 
sets to consider all combinations of present/absent for all subjects with missing primary 
outcome in the DES BTK  group and the PTA group.

  11.3.11.  Multivariable A nalyses  
Univariate and multivariable analyses will be performed as post -hoc analysis to assess the 
effect of potential predictors for the primary outcomes in a logistic regression model. 
Clinically and/or statistically meaningful baseline covariates will b e selected in the 
regre ssion model. No formal conclusion will be made by this secondary post -hoc analysis . 
11.3.12.  Analyses Software  
All statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), 
version 9.2 or later (Copyright © 2002- 2010 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina 
27513, USA. All rights reserved).  
11.3.13.  Chang es to Planned Analyses  
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the interim and/or the final primary analyses will be documented in an a mended statistical anal ysis plan, 
approved prior to performing the analyses . 
Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analyses will be 
documented in the clinical trial report along with a reason for the deviation. 
12. Health Economics Outcomes  
A formal health economics analysis may be compl eted as part of this trial, give n meaningful 
clinical results are obtained. This will take into consideration any differences in survival, 
complication rates, quality of life, and resource utilization. The EQ -5D questionnai re, generic 
quality of life measure, and the VascuQol  questionnai re, disease specific quality of life 
measure, will be used to  assess health utilities.  
Non-inpatient health care visits related to CLI will be documented using an unscheduled visit 
eCRF. (ie,  clinic visit, emergency room or urgent care visit, etc) .  
13. Data M anagement  
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside on a produc tion server hosted by Medidata . All changes 
made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review 
by Boston Scientific or its representative. The associated R ave software and database have 
been designed to meet re gulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system 
compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical trials pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are perfor med regularly.  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 64 of 98  
 
  The inve stigator is responsible for the accuracy, completeness and timeli ness of the data 
submitted and must review all data for accuracy and provides his/her electronic signature on 
the appropriate electronic case report forms (eCRFs) in co mpliance with local reg ulations. A 
written signature on printouts of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a n ew electronic 
signature by the i nvestigator acknowledging a nd approving the change s. 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to iden tify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the Medidata EDC system 
and will be issued to the investigational center  for appropriate response. Investigational 
center staff will be responsible for resolving all queri es in the database.  
All access to the clinical database will be changed to “Read only” after all data is either 
“Hard Locked” or “Entry Locked”. Once acceptance of the final report or finalization of 
publications (as applicable) is received, final database storage and archiving activities can begin. Once all of the closeout activities are completed a request to IT is submitted to have 
the “Database Locked” or “ Decommissioned”  and all database access revoked.  
13.2. Data and Record Retention  
The principal i nvestigator or his/her designee or investigational center  will maintain  all 
essential study documents and source documentation that support  the data collected on the 
trial subj ects in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements .   
The principal i nvestigato r or his/her designee will take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents . If for any reason the pr incipal investigator or 
his/her designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody 
must be  transferred to an individual who wi ll assume responsibility and Boston Scientific  
must receive written notification of this custodi al change. Investigational center s are required 
to inform Boston Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files are maintained in case 
files are stored off site and are not readily available.  
In Japan, Boston Scientific will maintain necessary essen tial documents for 5 years from the 
date of the marketing application approval (or during the period of user -results evaluat ion, if 
applicable and if longer than 5 years) or until 3 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical investigation of the device, whichever is l onger. 
If trial follow -up is continued beyond 5 years in Japan as part of a post market  clinical trial 
after receiving marketing approval  and using the data as part of a use -results evaluation , the 
invest igator and investigational center must retain essent ial documents during the period of 
use-results evaluation . 
13.3. Core Laboratories  / Central assessment of study data 
Core laboratories will be established for the central assessment of k ey data collected for t he 
trial. Guidelines for the collection, analysis, a nd interpretation of the data will be provided in 
the manual of operations. The followi ng core laboratories  / central reviewers  have been 
assigned  for the SAVAL  trial:

and during subsequent revascularization procedures when collected according 
to the investigational center’s standard procedures  
o To assess CTA or DSA angiographies taken at the 12- month follow -up visit i n 
case the 12 -month DUS is non- diagnostic  
o To confirm stent fractures identified by the X -ray core lab  
o When bailout stenting is required t he angiography  core lab will assess 
angiograms collected to document the bailout process  
• X-ray: to  review the x- rays collected for the trial to assess stent integrity * 
• Ultrasound:  to assess duplex ultrasound studies collected for the trial  for lesion and 
stent patency  
• Independent Wound Reviewer: to review wound assessment data and images. 
*Note: When a  stent fracture is identified , the x- ray will be reviewed by the angiography core 
lab to confirm the fracture . 
14. Deviations  
A trial deviation is an event where t he investigator or the invitational center personnel did not 
conduct the clinical trial according  to the clinical protocol, clinical study agreement, or 
applicable laws an d regulations . 
An investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol , except to protect 
the life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investigat or will notify the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB/ EC, and the regulatory authority if applicable  of any 
deviation from the investigational plan to protect the l ife or physical well -being of a subject 
in an emergency, and those deviations which affect the sc ientific integrity of the clinical 
investigation. Such notice will be give n as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days 
after the emergency occurred,  or per prevailing local requirements, if sooner than 5 working 
days.  
Deviations may include  but are not limited to: 
• Failure to obtain subject informed consent prior to beginning trial activities  
• Violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria

  Investigational centers may also be required to report deviations to the IR B/EC, and the 
regulatory authority, per local guidelines and national government  regulations.  
Deviations attributable t o the worldwide COVID -19 virus pandemi c will be  documented and 
reported to the sponsor using the EDC system.  The statistical analysis plan provides further 
detail on the handling of missing data , drop-outs, and prot ocol deviation .  
Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions including IRB /EC and regulatory authority  notification, 
investigational center re -training, or center  discontinuation /termination ) will be put into place 
by the sponsor. 
The sponsor wil l not approve protocol waivers.

applicable regulations. The  monitoring plan contains the strate gy for frequency of monitoring 
visits and source data verification to be completed for the trial.  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 71 of 98  
 
  The monitor verifies that trial records are adequately mainta ined, that data are reported in a 
satisfactory manner with r espect to timeliness, adequacy, and accuracy, and that the 
investigator continues to have sufficient staff and facilities to conduct the trial safely and 
effectively. The investigator/institution guarantees direct access to original source documents 
(ie, paper and electronic hospital charts,  appointment books, laboratory records) by Boston 
Scientific personnel, their designees, and applicable regulatory authorities. 
The trial may also be subject to  a quality assurance audit by Boston Scientific or its 
desig nees, as well as inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that the 
principal investigator and relevant trial personnel are available during on- site monitoring 
visits or au dits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
18. Potential Risks and Benefits  
18.1. Anticipate d Adverse Events  Associated with use and the Implantation of the 
DES BTK Vascular Stent System during an endovascular procedure  
• Allergic reaction (to drug/polym er, contrast, device or other)  
• Amputation  
• Bleeding/Hemorrhage  
• Death  
• Embolization (air, plaque, t hrombus, device, tissue or other)  
• Hematoma  
• Ischemia  
• Need for urgent intervention or surgery  
• Pseudoaneurysm formation 
• Renal insufficiency or failure 
• Restenosis of stented artery  
• Sepsis/infection  
• Thrombosis/thrombus  
• Transient hemodynamic instability (hypote nsive/hypertensive episodes)  
• Vasospasm  
• Vessel injury, including perforation, trauma, rupture and dissection  
• Vessel occlusion   
18.2. Adverse Events Unique to the Pacli taxel Drug Coating  
Certain side effects an d discomforts have been reported in subjects that have  received 
paclitaxel in intravenous forms as part of chemotherapy treatment. These subjects may have 
other comorbid conditions and/or have received concomitant medications that may also contribute to the reported side effects. In these circumstances the do se was delivered 
throughout the body by the blood and in doses hundreds of times higher than the total amount on the coated stent for use in the proposed clinic al trial. Potential adverse events that ma y be 
unique to the paclitaxel drug coating are:  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 72 of 98  
 
  • Allerg ic/immunologic reactions to drug (paclitaxel or structurally -related compounds) or 
the polymer stent coating (or its individual components)  
• Alopecia  
• Anemia  
• Gastrointestinal symptoms  
• Hematologic dyscrasi a (including leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia)  
• Hepatic enzyme changes  
• Histologic changes in the vessel wall, including inflammation, cellular damage or 
necrosis  
• Myalgia/arthralgia  
• Peripheral neuropathy  
 Meta- analyses of randomized controlled trials of paclitaxel- coated balloons and paclitaxel -
eluting stents used to treat peripheral arterial disease in the femoropopliteal arteries have 
identified an increased risk of late mortality at 2 years and beyond. The magnitude and 
mechanism f or the increased risk in mortality is currently unclear. The analyses also 
demonstrated reduced revascularization rates with the drug -containing products. The impact 
of future device exposure is unknown as is the impact of other drug -containing devices. 
Inadequate information is available to evaluate the potential mortal ity risk associated with the 
use of paclitaxel -coated devices for the treatment of other diseases/conditions. Physicians 
should discuss the benefits and risks of all available treatment options with patients. 
18.3. Risks Associated with Participation in the Clin ical Trial  
Risks associated  with venipuncture include ecchymosis, hematoma, infections, inflammation 
and pain. There may be additional risks linked to the inves tigational device procedure and 
follow -up testing that are unknown. Tests  planned for the trial follow -up phase is standard of 
care procedures except for the collection of high definition x- ray to assess stent integrity.  
18.4. Possible Interactions with Concomi tant Medical Treatments  
In addition to the risks associated with the implantation of stents and the use of paclitaxel, the 
use of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy after stent implantation may increase the risk of bleeding. Refer to the package insert fo r further information on drug interactions and side 
effects associated with paclitaxel  or antith rombotic/antiplatelet medic ations.  
18.5. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, performin g procedures in the appropriate healthcare environment, adherence to subject 
selection criteria,  close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow -ups and by promptly supplying Boston Scientific  with all pertinen t 
information required by this protocol.

Page 73 of 98  
 
  18.6. Anticipated Benefits  
Potential anticipated benefits inc lude the effective treatmen t of atherosclerotic infrapopliteal 
lesions with improvement in the symptoms of disease. However, the DES BTK  Vascular 
Stent System i s an investigational device and these potential benefits may or may not actually 
be present.  
18.7. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System  is expected to be suitable for its intended purpose. 
There are no unacceptable residual risks/intolerab le risks and all applicable risks have been 
addressed through the provision of appropriate direc tions for use (DFU). The DE S BTK  
Vascular Stent System is expected to have an acceptable adverse event profile when used 
under the conditions intended; the bene fits associated with the use of the DES BTK  Vascular 
Stent System are expected to outweigh the r isks. 
19. Safety Reporting 
19.1. Reportable Events  by investigational center to Boston Scientific  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and report to Bos ton Scientific (or 
delegate) the following events for enrolled subjects:  
• Adverse events/  serious adverse events  related to Study Device (Investigat ional Device ) 
and Com parator Device  
• All Serious Adverse Events related to the Procedure  
• Serious adverse event s 
• Device Deficiencies  
• Unanticipated adverse device effects /unanticipated serious adverse device effects  
• New findings/updates in relation to already reported events  
• New wounds on the index limb  
• All other adverse events (through the 12- month follow -up visit ) 
 
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the event term instead of individual symptoms.  
If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency.  
An AE experienced by the trial subjects after randomization/enrollment and during protocol -
required testing must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Underlying diseases are not reported as an AE unless the re is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the cours e of the investigation.  
Death will not be recorded as an AE, but will be reflected a s an outcome of a specific SAE .

  Refer to Section 18 for the known risks associated with the trial device(s).  
Device deficiencies will be reported on the appropriate eCRF per the trial CRF completion 
guidelines. Whe n an AE results from a device deficiency or other device issue, the AE will 
be reported separately.  
An in -patien t hospitalization is defined as the subject being admitted to the hospital for ≥ 24 
hours with the following exceptions:  
• A hospitalization for r outine follow -up per standard of care.  
• A hospitalization that is uncomplicated and elective/planned ( ie, planned prior to 
enrollment) does not have to be reported as an SA E or AE.  
• If complications or AEs occur during an elective/planned hospitalization after enrollment, the complications and AEs must be reported as AEs or SAEs if they meet the protocol -
specified definitions. However, the original elective/planned hospitaliz ation(s) itself 
should not be reported as an SAE. 
 If subjects are hospitalized during the course of the trial, the data about the hospitalization associated with adverse events will be collected in the EDC system.  
Planned m inor amputations ( ie, below the  ankle) or debridement that are performed as part of 
the subject’s  care pathway will not be reported as an AE , however, clinical sequelae resulting 
from the minor amputation must be reported as an AE. The underlying pathology for an unplanned debridement  and/or amputation procedure  (ie, 
one that is not part of the care p ath continuum) will be reported as an AE.  
New wound development  on the index limb will be reported as  an AE.  Images will be 
collected for  all new wounds and submitted for the study. 
Serious adverse device -effects that are still ongoing at the end of the subject’s participation in 
the trial will be followed up for resolution status and this information will be provided to 
Boston Scientific for the purpose of regulatory agency reporting for the  trial.

  19.3. Relationship to Study Device(s) (Investigational Device and C omparator 
Device)  and/or Study Procedure  
The i nvestigator must assess the relationship of the reportable AE to the study device , or 
procedure .  
Table 19.3- 1: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Trial Device (s) (Investigational 
Device and Comparator Device)  or Procedure to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Not Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 
 Relationship to the device , comparator  or procedures can be excluded when:  
• The event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational 
device or the procedures  related to the use of the investigational device ; 
• The event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if 
the response pattern is previously known) a nd is biologically impla usible ; 
• The discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level 
of activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use 
(or increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impa ct on the event ; 
• The event involves a body- site or an organ that cannot  be affected by the 
device or procedure;  
• The event can be attributed to another cause ( eg, an underlying or concurrent 
illness/clinical condition, an effect of another d evice, drug, treatment or other 
risk fa ctors) ; 
• The event does not depend on a false result given by the investigational device 
used for diagnosis, when applicable;  
• In order to establish the non -related ness,  not all the criteria listed above might 
be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the event .

  Classification  Description  
Unlikely Related  
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3  The relationship with the use of the device or procedure seems not relevant and/or 
the even t can be reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information 
may be obtained.  
Possibly Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 The relationship with the use of the investigational device  or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures  is weak b ut cannot be ruled out completely. 
Alternative causes are also possible ( eg, an underlying or concur rent illness/clinical 
condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases w here 
relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be 
classifie d as possible.  
Probably Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 The relation ship with the use of the investigational device  or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures  seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reaso nably 
explained by another cause . 
Causal Relationship  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 The event is associated with the in vestigational device or  comparator or  with 
procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:  
• The ev ent is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to 
or of similar devices and procedures ; 
• The event has a temporal relationship with investigatio nal device 
use/application or procedures ; 
• The event involves a body- site or organ that  
 the investigational device or procedures are applied to  
 the investigational device or procedures have an effect on ; 
• The event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) ; 
• The discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the e vent (when clinically feasible) ; 
• Other possible causes ( eg, an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical 
condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been 
adequately ruled out ; 
• Harm to the subject is due to error in use ; 
• The event depends on a false result given by the investigational device used for 
diagnosis, when app licable  
• In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the 
adverse event  
The investigator must assess the relationship of an AE to the antiplat elet med ication as 
related or unrelated.  
Table 19.3- 2: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Antiplatelet Medication to an AE  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  The adverse event is determined to be due to  a concu rrent illness or effect of a device/drug 
and is not determined to be potentially related to the antiplatelet medication.  
Related  The adverse event is determined to b e potentially related to the antiplatelet medication, and 
an alternative etiology is equal ly or less likely compared to the potential relationship to 
antiplatelet medication.

19.5. Boston Scientific  Device Deficiencies  
Device deficiencies for the DES BTK  Vascular Stent S ystem  (including but not limited to 
failures, malfunctio ns, use errors, product nonconformities, and inadequacy in the 
information supplied by the manufa cturer)  will be documented and reported to Boston 
Scientific. If possible, the device(s)/system should be re turned to Boston Scientific for 
analysis. Instructi ons for returning the investigational device(s) will be provided in the 
manual  of operations  and trial training. Device deficiencies should also be documented in the 
subject’s medical record s. 
Device deficiencies related to a non- BSC comparator device will  not be collected . Any non-
BSC comparator device malfunction will be reported by the Investigator  directly to the 
manufacturer of that device as a complaint.  
Device deficiencies  are not adverse events. How ever, an adverse event that results from a 
device deficiency should be recorded as an adverse event on the appropriate eCRF.  
Any Device Deficiency t hat might have led to a SAE if appropriate action had not been 
taken, intervention had not occurred or  circu mstances had been less fortunate is considered a 
reportable event.  
Device deficiencies may include, b ut are not limited to the following: 
• Packaging or labeling deficiency  
• Difficult or unable to advance over wire  
• Difficult or unabl e to track through anatomy

  • Difficult or unable to cross lesion  
• Difficult or unable to deploy stent  
• Stent damaged  
• Stent jump  
• Kinked or deformed stent  
• Difficult to remove stent delivery system from body  
• Stent fracture  
• Stent migration  
19.6. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / EC s / Investigators  
Boston Scientific  is responsible for reporting adverse event information to all participating 
principal i nvestigators , IRBs /ECs and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  
The principal i nvestigator is responsible f or informing the IR B/EC, and regulatory authorities 
of UADE s and SAE s as req uired by local /regional regulations . 
Safety reporting on the control device, which is approved in all regions at the time of the trial 
initiation, will be handled separately according to local regula tions.  
20. Informed Consent  
Subject partici pation in this clinical trial is voluntary. Informed consent is required from each 
subject or his/her legally authorized representative. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is obtained prior to any trial -required procedure or  testing, the 
use of an investigational device, and data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of informed consent must be in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, IS O 14155, any applic able national regulations, and 
local in stitutional ethics  committee and/or regulatory authority, as applicable. Boston 
Scientific will provide a template of the ICF to investigators participating in this trial. The ICF template may be mo dified to meet the requirements of the investigative  center’s IRB/ EC.  
Approval of the investigational center’s ICF is required by Boston Scientific (or designee) and the governing IRB/ EC prior to the first use and any time the ICF is updated during the 
trial. 
The ICF must be in a language understandable to the s ubject and, when n eeded, Boston 
Scientific (or delegate) will assist the investigational center with obtaining ICF translation. Translated ICFs must also have IRB/ EC approval prior to their use. Pri vacy language will be 
included in the body of the form or as a separate form  in compliance with local requirements.  
The process of obtaining informed c onsent will, at minimum, include the following and will 
be in compliance with all local applicable laws,  rules, regulations  and guidelines:  
• Be conducted by the pr incipal investigator or qualified designee authorized to conduct the 
process  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 82 of 98  
 
  • Include a description of all aspects of the clinical trial that are relevant to the subject’s 
decision to participate th roughout the clinic al trial 
• Avoid any coercion of or undue  influence of a su bject to participate  
• Will not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights  
• Will use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or his/her 
legal repr esentative  
• Provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions  
• Explain that important new information is to be provided to new and existing subjects 
throughout the clinical trial  
 
The ICF will be signed and personally dated by t he subject (or legal representative competent 
to sign the ICF under the appl icable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines) and by the 
investigator and/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent 
process. The original signed I CF will be retained  by the investigational c enter  and a co py of 
the signed a nd dated document and any other written information must be given to the person 
signing the ICF. The subject will receive a signed copy of the ICF and other written information as approved by the IRB /EC. 
For individuals less than 20 years  of age enrolled at a Japanese center, the subject’s legal 
representative, as well as the subject, must provide written informed consent. In Japan, ICF 
signature may be replaced by printed name and seals of appropriat e individuals. 
If the informed consent is obtained the sa me day the subject begins participation in trial -
related procedures, it must be clearly documented in the subject’s medical record that consent 
was obtained prior to participation in any trial -relate d procedures.  
Failure to obtain  subject consent will be r eported by Boston Scientific to the applicable 
regulatory authority according to the local requirements ( eg, FDA requirement is within 5 
working days of learning of such an event).  
Any violation of the informed consent process must be reported as a deviat ion to the sponsor 
and in compliance with local requirements ( ie, regulatory authority, IRB/ EC). 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's futu re health 
and medic al care, that information will be provided to the affecte d subject(s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested t o sign and date 
an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a 
trial, other situations may necessitate rev ision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to 
the applicable laws, protocol, a change in principal i nvestigator, administrative changes, or 
following annual review by the IR B/EC. The new versi on of the ICF must be approved by 
the IRB/ EC. Acceptance by Boston Scientific is required if changes to the revised ICF are 
requested by the investigational center ’s IRB/ EC. The IRB/ EC will determine the subject 
population to be re -conse nted.

  21. Committees  
21.1. Executive Committee  
An executive committee composed of Bost on Scientific clinical management and selected 
coordinating principal investigator(s) will be convened. Thi s committee will be responsible 
for the overall conduct of the trial whic h will include prot ocol development, trial progress, 
subject safety, overall  data quality and integrity, and timely dissemination of trial results 
through appropriate scientific sessi ons and publications. The executive committee may 
request participation o f SAVAL trial inves tigators on the committee . 
21.2. Safety Monitoring Process  
To promote early detection of safety issues, the independent clinical events committee (CEC) 
and data monitori ng committee (DMC) will provide evaluations of safety events. Success of 
this program requir es dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the e vent is 
reported. This is expedited through the Boston Scientific safety group (or designee) , which is 
responsible for coordinating the collection of information for the subject dossier from the 
Medidata Rave EDC database, that is entered by the centers an d core laboratories. During 
regularly scheduled monitoring visits, clinical research monitors will support  the dynamic 
reporting process through their review of source document information . 
21.3. Clinical Events Committee  
The CEC is an independent group of individuals with no affiliation with Boston Scientific. 
Committee membership will include practitioners of peripheral endovascular procedures, as well as other experts with the necessary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to review and adjudicate the foll owing endpoints and major adverse events reported by the trial 
investigators:  
• All deaths  
• Clinically -driven t arget lesion revascularization  
• Target vessel revascularization  
• Target l imb major amputatio ns 
• Target Lesion s tent thrombosis  
 
Responsibilities, quali fications, membership, and committee procedures are outlined in the 
CEC charter. Contact information for the CEC is included in the manual of operations for Japanese center s. 
21.4. Data  Monitoring Committee 
A DM C will be established to rev iew overall trial condu ct and safety and will be comprised 
of, at minimum, 3 members who are independent of Boston Scientific and the trial investigators. The DMC will be comprised of at least 2 independent clinicians and 1 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P

Page 84 of 98  
 
  independent statistician with ex pertise in peripheral e ndovascular procedures and/or 
statistical subject matter.  
The DMC will be responsible for:  
• Assessing the progress of the trial, including safety data  
• Evaluating trial conduct ( eg, trial deviations)  for the impact on the validity and scientific 
merit of th e trial  
• Recommending to Boston Scientific whether to continue, modify, or stop the trial  
• Provide recommendation for use of overlapping stents for the study (i.e. assessing the 
first 46 phase A RCT s ubjects)  
 
Boston Scient ific personnel , or delegate,  may facilitate the DMC meetings, provide trial 
progress updates, and answer questions. Boston Scientific personnel will not be voting 
members  or participate in the closed session portion of  the meetings.  
The frequency for meeti ngs and thresholds will be defined within a DMC charter. Meetings 
may be more frequent depending on the rate of enrollment, number of AEs, and/or deviations 
collected and at the request of Boston Scientific. Meetin gs may be held in- person or via 
teleconfer ence.  
21.5. Independent Wound Assessment  
Wound assessment data and images  will be reviewed by an independent reviewer (s), with 
expertise in wound care and with no affiliation with Boston Scientific. The independent 
asses sor(s) will be blin ded to random ization as signment in phase A . 
22. Suspension or Termination  
22.1. Premature Termination of the Study  
Boston Scientific reserves the right to terminate the trial at any stage but intends to exercise this right only for valid sci entific or business  reasons and reasons related to protection of 
subjects. Investigators, associated  IRBs/ ECs, and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be 
notified in writing in the event of trial termination.  
22.1.1 Criteria for Premature Terminati on of the Study  
Possible reasons for premature trial termination include, but  are not limited to, the following: 
• Suspic ion of an unaccepta ble risk, including serious health threat. In this case, the 
sponsor shall suspend the clinical investigation while the risk is assessed. The sponsor shall terminate the clinical investigation if  an unacceptable risk which cannot be 
controlled is confirmed . 
• Instructions by the IRB/EC  or regulatory authorities to suspend or terminate the clinical 
investigation. 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pivotal Trial Clinical Investigation Plan 92193192 /Version F  
Page 85 of 98  
 
  • An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudices the conclusion of the trial  
• A decision on the part of Boston Scienti fic to suspend or discontinue development of the 
device  
22.2. Termination of Study Participation by the Investigator or Withdrawal of IRB/ EC 
Approval  
Any investigator or associated IRB/ EC or regulatory authority may di scontinue participation 
in the trial o r withdraw approval  of the trial, respectively, with suitable written notice to 
Boston Scientific. Investigators, associated IRBs/ ECs, and regulatory authorities, as 
applicable, will be notified in writing in the event  of these occurrences.  
22.3. Requirements for Doc umentation and Subject Follow -up 
In the event of premature trial termination , a written statement as to why the premature 
termination has occurred will be provided to all participating investigational center s by 
Boston Scientific. The IRB/ EC and regulatory authori ties, as applicable, will be notified.

  Term  Definition  
Death  All deaths are c onsidered cardiac u nless an unequivocal non -
cardiac cause can be established. Specifically, an unexpected death 
in subjects with coexisting potentially fatal non- cardiac diseases 
(e.g. cancer, infection) should be classified as cardiac.  
All death events wi ll be submitted to the CEC and will be 
categorized as:  
• Cardiac death: any death due to immediate cardiac cause (e.g. MI, low -output failure, fatal arrhythmia) . Unwitnes sed 
death and death of unknown cause will be classified as cardiac death. This includes all procedure related deaths including those related to concomitant treatment.  
• Vascular death: death due to cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting 
aneurysm, or other vascular cause . 
• Non-cardiova scular death: any death not covered by the 
above definitions, including death due to infection, sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide, or trauma.  
Diameter Stenosis  The ma ximal narr owing of the target lesion relative to the 
reference vessel diameter.  
Dissection NHLBI 
Grade Types  Type A - Small radiolucent area within the lumen of the vessel 
disappearing with the passage of the contrast material. 
Type B - Appearance of contrast medium parallel to the lumen of 
the vessel disappearing within a few cardiac  cycles.  
Type C - Dissection protruding outside the lumen of the vessel 
persisting after passage of the contrast material.  
Type D - Spiral shaped filling defect with or with out delayed run-
off of the contrast material in the antegrade flow.  
Type E - Persisten t luminal filling defect with delayed run -off of 
the contrast material in the distal lumen.

  28. Appendices  
28.1. Appendix A: Affect to Medicare Beneficiaries (US only)  
Critical limb isch emia (CLI) represents the terminal stage of obstructive, atherosclerotic, 
peripheral arterial disease. Patients affected by critical limb ischemia are the most complex 
subset of those with peripheral arterial disease and typically bear the long- term pathol ogical 
consequences of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure.1  When 
left untreated, CLI caused major amputat ion in 73% of the patients with rest pain and in 95% 
of the patients with tissue loss at 1 year.2  Diabetics with CLI are at part icularly high risk for 
advanced complications; studies indicate that within one year of CLI diagnosis, 40% to 50% of diabetics will experience an amputation.
3 Incidence of CLI increases sharply among 
Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 to 69 (0.13%) to 85 and older (0.31%). As many as 33% of new CLI Medicare beneficiaries may undergo primary amputation within 1 year after diagnosis.
4    
According to HCUP National Inpatient Sample (NIS) all payer 2014 claims data*, Medicare is the payer for 69% of pati ents with lower extremity atherosclerosis and 67% of patients 
treated with Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or peripheral stent**. The subjects eligible for inclusion in the SAVAL  trial are likely to align with HCUP patients due to their 
expected age. Medicare eligible patients are not expected to respond differently to treatment 
compared to other patients, therefore the results of this trial are likely to be highly generalizable to the Medicare population.

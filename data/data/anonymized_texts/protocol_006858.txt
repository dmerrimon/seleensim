You are being asked to take part in a research study conducted by Hospital for Special Surgery 
(HSS).  You are being asked to participate in this study because you are undergoing ambulatory 
foot and ankle surgery with Dr. Ellis, Levine or Roberts, and your sur geon thinks that nerve 
blocks for pain relief after surgery are a good idea for you.  
 
You will still be responsible for the cost of your medical care  just as you would be if you 
were not part of this study .  For example, any co -pays, deductibles, and co -insurance 
associated with your medical care . 
 
This document provides you with information about this study.  After reading this document, any 
questions you may have will be answered.  You may take as much time as you need to review 
this document and ask questions to consider participating in this study before your surgery today.  
 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as required by 
U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify yo u. At most, the Web site 
will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time . 
  
 
1.  WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in patient outcomes with general 
versus spina l anesthesia when given in addition to the popliteal and adductor canal nerve blocks 
you will receive for your surgery today. Popliteal and adductor canal nerve blocks are injections

12/19 /2016 Thru 11/21 /2017  of local anesthetic agents near nerves in the back and front of the knee going to the foot and 
ankle that provide numbness during and after surgery. These peripheral nerve blocks offer good 
pain control and reduce the need for opioids (opioids are pain medications such as morphine, 
Dilaudid, and oxycodone). General anesthesia i nvolves the flow of oxygen and anesthesia gas 
through a tube which, along with additional intravenous medications, causes unconsciousness 
and unawareness of  sensations  during surgery. Spinal anesthesia involves an injection of local 
anesthetic in the lower back, which causes numbness below the waist. In addition to spinal 
anesthesia, a sedative is typically given intravenously to cause relaxation and sleepiness 
througho ut surgery.  
 
General, spinal, and nerve block anesthesia are all routinely used for surgery at the Hospital for 
Special Surgery. General or spinal anesthesia is typically used in addition to peripheral nerve 
blocks during foot and ankle surgery to 1) allo w the surgeons to use a thigh tourniquet to reduce 
bleeding, 2) provide anesthesia earlier, and 3) prevent unwanted movement. However, it is 
unclear whether general or spinal anesthesia provides better patient outcomes when given with 
peripheral nerve bloc ks. Some reports show that on its own, spinal anesthesia has advantages 
over general anesthesia in terms of side effects such as nausea and pain. However, these 
advantages may also be gained from combining peripheral nerve blocks with general anesthesia. 
A previous study at the Hospital for Special Surgery showed low rates of nausea among patients 
who received nerve blocks with spinal anesthesia, and no nausea among patients who received a 
nerve block with general anesthesia. Therefore, the primary aim of t his study is to determine if, 
as a treatment, either general or spinal anesthesia has advantages over the other treatment in 
terms of side effects, pain, patient satisfaction, and time it takes to leave the hospital in an 
ambulatory foot and ankle populati on. 
 
 
2.  WHAT WILL YOUR PARTICIPATION REQUIRE ?   
 
Participation in this study will not involve any additional visits to the hospital. If you decide to

X=  Research procedures  
SOC= Standard of care (care you would receive if you were not participating in this study)  
 
Before surgery  
 
In the holding area, you will be asked a series of questions to rate how you are feeling and assess 
your cognitive function (ability to perform tasks with your brain). You will be asked about your 
medication usage and history of headache/backache symptoms.  An alcohol swab will be applied 
to both sides of your lower leg and between your first and second toes to check nerve function.  A 
brief review of your medical chart will be conducted to collect basic information, such as age, 
sex, height, and weight.  
 
During surgery  
 
All patients will receive popliteal and adductor canal blocks, but t he study will select the rest of 
your anesthetic treatment randomly .  You will be assigned by chance to receive either general 
anesthesia or spinal anesthesia . The randomizati on process is comparable to (or similar to) the 
flip of a coin.    
 
You have a 50% chance of receiving either of the following treatments:  
1. Popliteal and adductor canal nerve blocks with standard of care general anesthesia  
2. Popliteal and adductor canal nerve blocks with standard of care spinal anesthesia  
and sedation  
 
If you have a preference for one of the treatments and would like to be sure to receive that 
treatment, you should not be enrolled in the study.  
 
In order to fairly evaluate the two treatments, b oth you and the study personnel assessing you 
will be blinded as to which anesthetic you were given. This means you will not be told whether 
you received general or spinal anesthesia. If you are interested, we can contact you with the 
results and your trea tment information when the study ends.   
 
Please note that you will also receive other anesthetic drugs intravenously throughout the 
surgical procedure. These drugs will be the same regardless of whether you receive general or 
spinal anesthesia. During sur gery, medications will be given to reduce the chance of nausea after 
the surgery.  
 
After surgery  
 
Once you are in the recovery room and your surgery is over, a study team member who does not 
know which treatment you received will assess your condition ever y 15 minutes to follow your 
rate of recovery. When you awake from general anesthesia or the spinal anesthesia wears off, the 
alcohol swab test will be applied again to test block function (by seeing if the nerve blocks made 
parts of the operative foot numb ). After one and two hours in the recovery room, you will be

12/19 /2016 Thru 11/21 /2017  asked a series of questions to rate how you are feeling and assess your cognitive function. When 
you are ready to be discharged, we will ask some additional questions about your experience, 
satisfaction and which treatment you think you received. We will provide you with a Patient 
Information Sheet with information regarding the next day’s follow -up. 
 
Day after surgery  
 
On the day after your surgery, you will be contacted by phone by a study team member and 
asked about how you are feeling, your cognitive function, any side effects that you may have 
experienced, and your overall satisfaction with your care. If it is determined that you may have 
had any symptoms of concern, you will be contacted by a n anesthesiologist for follow -up. 
 
Overall, your participation will occur over the course of your stay in the hospital and the day 
after. It may involve up to 6 study contacts, including the assessment of your condition every 15 
minutes in the recovery roo m and any follow -ups deemed necessary by an anesthesiologist. The 
repeated assessment every 15 minutes is expected to last 1 -2 minutes, and all other contacts are 
expected to last 10 -15 minutes.  
 
You and/or your insurance will be responsible for any costs  of all procedures performed that are 
standard of care, that is, care that you would receive even if you were not in this study.  
 
A total of 36  subjects will participate in this study at HSS.   
 
 
3.  WHAT ADVERSE (BAD) EFFECTS CAN HAPPEN FROM BEING IN THE STUDY?  
WHAT RISKS ARE KNOWN ABOUT THE STUDY DRUG/STUDY DEVICE?  
 
All treatments applied to you as a participant in this study are standard of care. The risk s from 
participation in this study  and receiving the peripheral nerve blocks  for pain relief after the 
surgery are the same  risks you would face with your surgical anesthesia if you did not participate 
in this study . These risks will be discussed in detail with you by your anesthesiologist and are 
described below.  
 
 In addition to the nerve block s, you need either a general anesthetic or a spinal anesthetic. The 
study involves randomly assigning you to receive either spinal or general anesthesia. Both spinal 
and general anesthesia are commonly used at HSS, as well as at other hospitals. Both spina l and 
general anesthesia are considered safe and effective. It is not clear whether spinal or general 
anesthesia is safer for patients such as yourself.    
 
There are potential rare serious complications from both types of anesthesia. Potential rare risks 
of general anesthesia include problems with the heart, lungs, and cognition (thinking) after 
surgery. These complications may be more likely with older patients. Potential rare risks of 
spinal anesthesia include spinal cord injury. Older patients are more likely to have conditions 
that increase the risk of spinal cord injury. Most patients having spinal anesthesia for foot and 
ankle surgery receive intravenous sedation, so that they are ‘asleep’ during surgery. Sedation has

Review Board Approval  
12/19 /2016 Thru 11/21 /2017  potential rare serious complicati ons such as problems with the lungs and cognition (thinking) 
after surgery.  
 
There are less serious potential risks from general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia. It is possible 
that patients receiving general anesthesia will be more likely to have a sore throat from the tube 
used to keep the airway open (a laryngeal mask airway will be used if possible). Some studies 
suggest that nausea and vomiting are more likely with general anesthesia (but a recent study at 
HSS showed no nausea after general anesthesia ). It is possible to have a headache or backache 
after spinal anesthesia, but most headaches and backaches after surgery are not from the 
anesthetic. If you experience prolonged numbness from the spinal, this may cause a longer stay 
in the hospital, but th is possible delay is in terms of hours. We will attempt to avoid prolonged 
numbness from the spinal by choosing an appropriate amount of local anesthetic.   
 
Participation in this research involves the potential risk of a breach of confidentiality to your 
stored health information.  HSS tries to minimize those risks by (i) removing some direct 
identifiers from stored information (i.e., names, social security numbers, medical record 
numbers); (ii) securing, in a separate location, and limiting access to info rmation that would 
identify you; and (iii) limiting access to information stored to HSS investigators.  
 
There may be risks or side effects that are unknown at this time. If we learn about new risks  that 
may affect your willingness to continue your particip ation, we will make you aware of them and 
you will be asked to re -consent to continue your participate in the study.  
 
 
4.  WHAT BENEFIT CAN YOU EXPECT?  
 
This study is comparing two standard of care procedures to determine which may be more 
effective.  The  knowledge gained from this study may benefit others in the future.  
 
 
5.  COST   
 
Those research procedures (i.e. study questionnaires) listed in Section 2 will be covered by the 
study and will not be your financial responsibility.   
 
As indicated in Section 2, those costs which are considered Standard of Care for your treatment 
here at Hospital for Special Surgery will be your/or your insurance’s responsibility.   You will be 
responsible for any co -pays, deductibles, and co -insurance associated with yo ur medical care, 
just as you would be for any costs billed to your health insurance outside of this study.  You will 
also be financially responsible for any medical care  costs  not covered by your health insurance . 
 
HSS is committed to providing financial a ssistance when financially warranted and consistent 
with its resources, regardless of age, gender, religion, race or sexual orientation.  So if you do not 
have health insurance, or if your health insurance does not pay for your medical care, you may 
seek f inancial assistance from HSS.  Eligibility determinations are made on a case -by-case basis

investigators and senior research staff to report to HSS significant financial interests (such as 
stock ownership, royalty payments, and consulting agreements) and relationships (such as 
membership on a scientific advisory board) that are related to their research studies.  When an 
investigator reports a signifi cant financial interest or relationship that relates to one of his/her 
studies, HSS’s Conflict of Interest Committee for Research reviews the information to evaluate 
the risk that the interest or relationship might influence how the investigator conducts t he study 
or interprets the results of the study.  HSS may also take steps to minimize that risk.   
 
 The Conflict of Interest Committee for Research has determined that there are no 
conflicts of interest associated with this study.

1 The parent or legal guardian of a child participant should sign this form on behalf of the child.  The signature of 
one parent is sufficient when the research is of minimal risk to the child, or when the research presents the prospect 
of direct benefit to  the child.  The signature of both parents is required when the research involves greater than 
minimal risk with no prospect of direct benefit to the child.  The requirements for signature of both parents may be 
waived if one parent is deceased, unknown, i ncompetent, or not reasonably available, or when one parent has sole 
legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.  If the participant is a child who is capable of giving assent, 
the child should also sign the attached Assent Form.

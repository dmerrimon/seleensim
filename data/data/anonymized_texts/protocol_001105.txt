 ABSTRACT  
Project Background: Pros tate cancer is the leading male cancer. One in three men with prostate cancer is 
chemically castra ted at some point wit h long-acting injectable drugs  (i.e., androgen deprivation therapy or 
ADT). This i mpact s the well -being of  thousands of men annually. Alt hough some patients benefit in term s of 
survival and symptom improvement, chemical castration with ADT is also commonly  performed when t here 
are litt le to no health benefits to patients raising questions of  low value care. A growing awareness of 
castration harms (e.g. , heart attack, ost eoporosis, loss of sexual function) creates patient safety concerns . 
Despite this, ADT use i n low valu e cases, such as  for localized prostate cancer treatment and biochem ical 
recurrence in non-m etastatic disease persists.  
 
Ineffective and harmful practices  such as chemical castration of prostate cancer patients with ADT outs ide 
of the evidenc e base are ide al targets for d e-implementation. De -implementation, or stopping low  value 
practices, has th e potential to improve patient outcomes and decrease healthcar e costs. For example, 
stopping low value chemical castration could prevent harm, limit s pending, and m aintain survival. However, 
provider preferences regarding de- impleme ntation are not well understood, and possible de- implem entation 
interventions range fr om b lunt formulary restriction policie s to shared decision- making. Blunt policy 
intervention s such as formulary restri ction of ADT (e.g., pre- authorization, order templat es) m ight seem 
warranted  given patient safety concerns,  yet could result in significant pr ovider resistance and work -
arounds  if introduced poorly. More nuanced, patient -centered interventi ons such as shar ed decision-
making (e.g., decision aid, talking points) l ikely involve ext ra clinical time. Both interventi on strategies need 
tailoring based on provider input for acceptability and feasibility in clinical  practice, including pilo ting prior  to 
trialing. As  many medical practices lack evidence and cause harm , robust, behavioral t heory -based 
methods for incorpora ting provider preferences into de -implementation strategy development  will advance 
both implementa tion research and practic e. 
 
Project O bjectives: This study will compare two different de -implementation str ategies that vary  in 
delivery, impact, and expected results for reducing low value AD T use.  
 
Research Plan/Methods: Com pare t wo tailored de- implemen tation strategies to reduce chemica l 
castration as localized prostate  cancer treatment and treatment fo r non -metastatic biochem ical recurrence 
with low PSA le vels.  
Our s pecific Aim is to e valuate the implementation of an ADT order check (Or) versus a prov ider script (Sc) on 
decreased low -value ADT use aft er six months. We will first examine low -value ADT use for up to 6 months of  
early piloting at 4 VA sites, as wel l as refine our proposed RE- AIM implementation outcomes and ascertainment, 
study of moderators (e. g., fidelity) and causal mechanisms underlying implementation interventions. The work 
will infor m the subsequent 4 site pilot randomized  implementation trial by addressing pr eferences and concerns 
through pil ot tailoring. Based on the early  pilot work, we will ref ine our site engagement strategies and study 
protocol me thods and materials for the trial. This work will advance de -implementation science for low v alue 
cancer care.

NARRATIVE  
 
Introduction  
A1. Evidence for castration as prostate cancer treatment 
Because prostate cancer cells ar e dependent on androgens,  i.e., 
testo sterone, depriving them of this hormone through castration  
can improve clinical outcomes, for some pati ents.1 The hi ghes t 
levels of evid ence for  chemical castration with androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) inject ions to t reat prostate cancer occ ur 
in two sc enarios: 1) high risk localized disease in combination with 
radiation therapy, and 2) metastatic cancer  with spread to bones or 
other  organs causing symptoms.2-4 However, a significant amount 
of castration in Medicare a nd integrated delivery sy stems ( e.g., 
VA), occurs outside scenarios where high levels of benefit exist.5,6 
For example, using castration for  the primary treatment of loca lized 
prost ate cancer is likely  ineffective and harmful, yet remains 
common in VA with  five-fold variation across faci lities (Figure 1).  
Neither long- term studies nor current guidelines support castration 
as primary treatment for localized prost ate cancer.1,3,4 Many times, this castrati on is continued indefinitely.   
Additionally, t he effic acy of using castration f or trea tment  of biochemical recurrence in non -metastatic 
disease is not well supported by long- term studies nor cur rent guidelines, particularly in patients  with lower 
risk of disease progression.  
 
A2. There is a disconnect  between  the value and use of cas tration  in prostate cancer  
A2.1 Surgery to remove t esti cles is no longer needed for castration 
The discovery that cast ration could be  used as palliation for 
patients with metastatic prostate cancer revolutionized the 
oncol ogy fiel d in 1941.8 Depriving prostate c ancer  cells of 
testosterone to relieve urinar y tract blockage and  decrease  
bone pain from metastatic lesions  ushe red in a  new way to 
think  about trea ting the disease tha t continues to fuel treatment 
approaches today.  However , surgical castration via orchiectomy  
(i.e., testicular removal) fell by the wayside in the 1990s  as 
long- acting injectable approaches to androgen depriv ation 
(GnRH agoni sts) became  available, and even lucrative, leading 
to dramatic increases in us e across all stages of the diseas e 
(Figure 2) .9-11 This phenomenon essentially lowered the 
threshold for treatment with ADT injections due to ease of us e, 
patient ac ceptability a s they no longer needed their t esticles  
removed, biological plausibility, and l ow appr eciation for side effects  of chemical  castration among the 
surgical specialists prescribing ADT (i.e., urologists) with little training in p rimary care.  
A2.2 Lucrative busin es s prac tice thwarted by Medicare payment reform  
The story of Medicare reim bursemen t for ADT is a fascinatin g example of  how financial incentives can drive 
medi cal overuse.9 In short, Medicare reimbursed providers at 95% of the average wholes ale price f or these 
injections throughout the 1990s making it profitable s ince many provi ders acq uired the drug at 82% or l ess 
of the average wholesale price.12 Up to 40% of urology practice revenues were derived from this business 
pract ice in some c ases .13 Orchiecto my was driv en out of practice, and thresholds for castration were 
lowered such that nea rly half of prostate cancer patients  received ADT by 2000.10 Despite a stabl e 
evidence- base, more patients were getting injections in cases  where there was no evidence t o support use 
(e.g., primary treatment) alongside a growing awareness of harms . When t he Medicare Part B tab for ADT 
inject ions reached $1 billion in 2003, the practice came under intense scrutiny.14 As a result, the Medicare 
Modernization  Act reduced paym ents by approximately 50% leading to significant reductions in 
inappropriate use as pub lished in the New England Journal of  Medicine by Co -Investigator Dr. Shahinian.9,15 
Despite a decrease in what was termed ‘inappropriate us e’ of ADT for  localized prosta te cancer through this 

 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 8 of 88   
 policy intervention, such use persists t oday indicating other i nterventions are needed.  
A2.3 Growing rec ognition of castration harms has led to patient safety concerns  
Not surprisingly, the side effects of castration are common and i mpact a hos t of physiologic mec hanisms 
that rely on the male hormone testoster one.16 Castration results not onl y phenotypic  changes due to 
feminization, but also osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, loss of se xual func tion, 
and decrements  to over all quality of life.17 Evidence also suggests the risks of diabetes ,18 cataracts,19 
deep vein thr ombosis,20,21 stroke22 and even acute cardiac death23 all increase for men receiving ADT. 
This led the American Cancer  Society and Amer ican Heart As sociation t o issue a 2010 consensus 
statement on the importance of secondary p reventat ive measures for men t reated with ADT .24 
A2.4 Reasons castration harms overlooked by providers and patients  
ADT decreases the serum PSA level, a  biomarke r of prostate cancer  activit y, falsely reassuring people 
there is a ‘remission’ of the prostate  cancer.  This is potentially harm ful in at le ast 2 ways. First, depriving 
prostate cancer cells of testosterone too early in the disease process may  foster castr ation resistance,  
limiting e ffects when it is ac tually needed (e.g., metastatic setting).25,26 Second, PSA is a poor surrogat e 
marker for su rvival in localized disease. That is, lowering PSA in localized disease is not associated with 
improved overall surv ival, creating false  optimis m.6,27 In addition, surgical specialists are prescribing a drug 
with devast ating metabolic and ca rdiovascular effects creating a disconnect between trea ting PSA levels 
and the consequences, often dealt with in primary c are. Whil e lowering PSA mi ght make se nse on the 
surface, understanding beliefs and preferences for using ADT is a critical step in sto pping its low v alue use. 
In many respects, this is an ideal model for understanding de- implementation of low value cancer care.  
 
A4. The benefits of  unlearning ineffective, low value clinical practices and ties to behavior chan ge 
Unlearning routinized clinical practices is challenging even if they are no longer or never were considered 
effective.32,33 This is particularly  true when it  comes  to treating p atients with cancer where pr ovider 
reluctance to hold off on  treatment is o ften a s ignificant barrier to stopping or not  initiating treatment when 
there are no symptoms. Unlearning clinical behaviors such as prescribing ADT in low evidence settings can 
have substantial benefits. First, patients are no longer subjec ted to treatment harms with little to no benefit . 
Second, unlearning misaligned castration practices  can provide opportunity for more efficient, higher value 
use of sp ecialis ts. Last, acquiring the skill of unlearning can increase flexibility and willingness to adapt to 
evidence more proactively.33 We believe unlearning is captured in the Behavioral Regulation domain of the 
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), our behav ior change fr amework, for which there  are evidence- 
based behavior change techniques to consider. This novel TDF  connection to a limited unlearning l iterature 
may play a significant role in advancing de -implementation science.  
 A3. Strategies to stop c hemi cal cas tration as prostate  cancer treatment are sorely needed  
De-implementation, or stopping practices t hat are n ot evidence- based, has tremendous po tential to improve 
patient outcomes and mitigate rising healthcare costs.
29,30 This is important given recent camp aign attempts 
to cu rb overuse of services. In fact , one group has called for including castration as prim ary prostate cancer 
treatment in the next generation of Choosing Wisely .34 De-implementation efforts have addressed 
analgesic35 and antibiot ic36 use, glu cose control,37 and blood tr ansfusions.38 For this study, stopping low 
value cas tration might he lp prev ent fractures, heart disease, and met abolic syndrome, preserve sexual 
function, in addition to freeing up provider time and decreasing pharm acy spending.   
A3.1 De-impleme nt ation categories and tailored de-implementation strategies  
Three categories h ave been proposed when deciding what and how  to de -implement: 1) contradicted, 
established, 2) unproven, and 3) novel medical practices.29 Most indications for  cast ration fall into the 
second category. Given the limited evidence base for castration in pri mary pro state cancer treatment, i ts 
cost, harms and ubiquity in other low value settings (e.g., non -metastatic biochemical recurrence), 
understanding how  best t o de-implement low  value init ial and ongoing castration could yield significant 
benefits. De- implementa tion strategies for unlearning castration practices will need to be tailored to 
provider preferences, facilitators, and barriers to maximize effectiveness.31,39 -44 Even t hough we ha ve 
identified two very different strategies for de-i mplementation ( i.e., or der check, informed decis ion-making),  
these are broad strategies, with considerable space in each for tailoring. In this study, we are using the term 
“tailoring ,” often u sed to desc ribe approaches to fitting implementation interventions to local con text or  site 
characteristics, to  mean designing specific aspects of each strategy to  increase acceptability and likelihood 
of effectiveness.45 Barriers and pref erences, includin g facilitat ors, for operationalization of two different de- 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023  Page 9 of 88 implementation int ervention s represent clinically -relevant knowledge gaps this proposal will inform in 
preparation for a comparative effectiveness trial. We believe our pr ior wor k has delineated t he most 
important factors influencing ADT treatment for inclusion in our tailor ing approaches.  
A4. Impact: This  innovative approach to de- implementation strategy development is directly aligned with state -
of- the-art complex i mplementation intervention dev elopment and implementation science. We believe this study 
will transform how a nd why chemical castration is performed for men with prostate cancer through combini ng 
trans - disciplinary expertise, rigorous assessment of provider pr eferenc es, and de- impleme ntation str ategy 
tailoring. This work will broadly advance de-i mplementation s cience f or low value cancer care,  and foster 
participation in our de -implementation evaluation trial by addressing barriers, facilitators, and concerns t hrough 
pilot tailoring.  Our proposal  has implications for the following cancer care stak eholders:  
•Implic ations for patients: Due to the large population of prostate cancer patients, enhanc ing safety by
promoting evidence- based use of chemical castrati on pr omotes q uality care and qual ity of  life.
•Implications fo r providers: Understanding how providers unlear n ineffec tive clinical behaviors is a
critica l step towards optimizing prostate cancer care and de- implementation of low value services.
•Implication s for  low value cancer care po licy: This proposal will address important issues
surrounding provider behavior change  and serve as a model to decrease overtreatment more broadly.
This is especially relevant given Choosing Wisely and a growing need for effec tive de-imple ment ation.
A5. In novation: Our focus on understanding barriers and facilitators to and prioriti es for d e-implementation 
of low v alue services is highly innovative. Despite the call  for a better understanding of how to de -implement 
practices sh own to have m ore harm than ben efit (inclu ding many cancer -related services such as 
mammograph y, lung cancer a nd PSA screening), little applied research has been conducted to inform 
tailoring of  strategies to be most acceptable and effective for stakeholder s. In addition to the topic, t his 
proposal is innovative in t hat it advances cancer care and implementation science by: 
•Building the evidence base for de -implementing medical interventions with unclear or no benefits. This is
novel and critical given our i ncreasing healthc are costs and the harms of  overtreatment.29,30
•Using a systematic, theory -based approach to tailor effective, reliable de- implementation interventions
and strategies. Our prior  work linking the TDF to behavior change techniques is especial ly innovative
and has enhanced the tailor ing of interventions  significantly.46,47 This project will enhance o ur abil ity to
map causal relationships to professional behavior change and advance i mplementation science.
•Better understanding acceptable ways to stop aggressi ve, low value cancer  care. T his is necessary
across disease types to maximize pa tient welfare an d contr ol spending.
B. PREL
IMINARY  STUDIES
Our multi -disci plinary team is exceedingly well- positioned to successfully carry out the proposed work . We
have col laborat ed previously . We have extensive expertis e in clinical prostate cancer care, implementat ion
resea rch, survey methods, qualitative & q uantitative analyses, decision- making, i nformatics tools,
pharmacy applications, and theory -based inter venti on design and t ailoring.
B1. Var
iation in low value castration rates indicate the need for ADT de- implementati on 
In our prior work in p reparation f or the pilot and cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT), we identified 
trends in ADT use  as primary  treatment fo r localized prost ate cancer (Figure 1) and for t reatment of non -
metastatic biochemical recurrence. We f ound persistent low value ADT and marked variation in facility level 
rates. W hile some might argue relatively low numbers of patients are unneces sarily t reated, patients are  
routinely committed to life long ADT injections once the treatment decision is made . Better understanding 
de-implementat ion of ADT also opens the door to stopping additional low value use (e.g., duration of 
great er than 18 month s of adj uvant A DT with ra diation therapy in high risk prostate cancer).4 
B2. A
merican C ancer Society P rostate Cancer Survivorship Guide lines highli ght ADT harms 
As lead author of the guidelines,17 Dr. Skolarus  (Co-PI) led a team to develop clinical follow- up care 
guidelines for  primary care  clinicians. The harms of castration were stressed as they i mpact m ost long-
term effect domains. In addition, Drs. Skola rus (Co-PI), Caram (Co -I), Shahi nian (Co- I) co-authored a 
manuscript on ADT- associated bone disease emphasi zing res triction of castration to evidence -based 
settings to limit unnecessary harms.51 Drs. Sk olarus  (Co- PI) and Hawley (Co- I) have also work closely on 
a randomized trial of tailored self -management strategies to address prostate cancer treatment side 
effects inclu ding those of ADT .

B3. De -implementa tion of cancer care: the case of bilateral mast ectomy ov eruse  
The growing rate of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy among women with breast cancer raises 
concerns about overtreatment driven by extr a-scien tific facto rs su ch as payment p olicy and media c overage 
akin to the ADT castration story. As hi ghlighted by Dr. Hawley (Co -I) in peer-reviewed and media outlets,52 
and reinforced by Montini & Graham’s Implementation Science paper on de -implementation of en trenched 
practices,30 contextualizing provider perceptions is critical to any de -implementation strateg y. 
 
B4. Extensive prior collaborations to understand prostate cancer provider  behavior  
Drs. Skolarus  (Co-PI), Hollenbeck (Co- I) and Shahinian (Co -I) have  characterized pr ostate canc er care 
delivery ove r the last decade including castration with ADT in the Medicare population.10,28,53 -55 They found 
urologists prescribed 95% of ADT a s initial treatment,28 low bone health surveillance for ADT,56 as well as 
significant provider-l evel variation in A DT use am ong patients unlikely to benefit from  treatment .57 
 
B5. Theory -driven barrier assessment and intervention development  
Dr. Sales (Co -I) has conducted several implementation research studies within and outside VA. She has 
develope d numero us tools  to guide theory -based implementation, including reminders,  provider led clinics, 
and feedback reports.58-61 Dr. Hawley (Co -I) also has extensiv e experience with theory -based cancer 
decision- making interventions and clinical trials.62-65 
 
B6. Whic h de-implementation factors are most important

address during implementation strategy development is many 
times a matter of convenience, gestalt  and ignorance as  to 
which are the most common barriers versus most 
importan t.31,40, 47,61,70 The TDF was recently used to direct 
development of an instrument that could readily identify hand - 
hygiene barriers and link them to evidence-ba sed behavior 
change techniques.31 While this advanced theory -based barrier 
assessment exists, t here are  no current tools to guide tailoring 
of (de- ) implementation interven tions to the most important 
barriers, stakeholder preferences, and facilitators. In our prior work, w e asked  local urologis ts who tr eat 
prostate cancer to identify potential barrie rs to s topping castration. We identified barriers and mapped 
them to TDF domains and candidate evidence- based behavior change techniques (Table 1). Conducting 
qualitative work acro ss facilities an d using a quantitative discrete choice technique to priorit ize barr iers in 
our prior work has informed tailoring of our two intervention strategies. 
 B7. Informatics tools to de- implement low value prostate cancer clini cal practices  
Dr. Skolarus (Co-PI) collaborat es with Dr. Shelton (Consultant) and his informatic s team at the Greater Los  
Angeles  VA Medical Center. They recently developed and impl emented a highly -specific computerized 
clinical decision support alert to remind providers, at t he mome nt of PSA screeni ng order entry, of current 
guidelines against scree ning elde rly men for pros tate cancer – essentially de-implementation of PSA 
screening. In a prospective study involving over 30,000 patients published in Journal  of Gen eral Inter nal 
Medici ne, the screening rate decreased by over 30%.
71 Dr. Shelton and his t eam are  fully supportive of 
development of an EMR- based intervention for de -implemen tation of low value ADT (Appendix I).

This team has t remendous clinical and research expertise in decisi on-makin g for cancer care. Dr. Sk olarus 
(Co-PI) updates an evidence- and expert opini on-based shared decision- making tool for prostate cancer 
decision making endorsed by the Am erican Urolog ical As socia tion. In  additi on, Dr. Hawley (Co -I) has led 
decision ai d studi es in both breast and colorectal cancer.62,64 She also has experience with us ing Opti on 
Grid™, a clinical encounter decision support tool.72 In addition,  Dr. Makarov (C onsul tant) ch aired t he 
American U rologic al Association’s 2015 White Paper on ‘Im plementa tion of Shared Decision-M aking into

C1. Overview and conceptual m odel 
It is useful  to consider the following conceptual model for piloting of de-implementation strategies tailored to 
provider behavior change techniques. Based on the results of our development work, we highlight several 
TDF domains and constructs in our conceptual model that may cont ribute to organizational, provider, and 
patient  behav ior in the setting of ADT for localized prostate cancer. In addition, our quali tative a pproach 
allowed for flexibility as we conceptualize the main issues when it comes to c hemical castration. La st, the 
quantit ative discrete choice methods used in our prior work created significant opportunities to examine 
interactions among domains and constructs allowing us to select, tailor and pilot the most informed organizational and individual  level de- implementati on interventions.

 C1.0 Study population  
Sampling, participant ide ntific

To compar e the interventions, providers who prescr ibe ADT (urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation 
oncologists) at participating s ites will see order checks and/or a note template in CPRS for their patients 
identified as receiving ADT as pri mary treatmen t for localized prostate cancer or for non- metastatic  
biochemical recurrence wit h low PSA levels.  Prio r to implementation of the interventions, study staff will 
send providers an email with an attached Information Sheet infor ming them of thei r ability to opt out as well 
as information on the Implement ation Education Session (IES). (See protocol section bel ow for detailed 
descriptions of inter ventions and study protocol procedures). 
We will administer a survey to assess feas ibility and  acceptability  of the inte rvention, determine 
organizational struct ure and support, and assess fidelity in the interventions.  We will work with study 
consultants throughout the pilot to further refine the survey, inviting the consultants/Site Champ ions at each

C2.0 . Broad intervention categories require t ailored design: Formulary restriction  & decision -making 
There are several potential implementation interventions t o de-implem ent low value c astra tion within each 
broad intervention category we  identified for this st udy. We focus on an order check and physician 
communications during the informed decision- making because of their difference in key attributes, including 
likelihood of quick su ccess vs. long- term su stainment and effort required by cl inicians . We describe s ome 
possible intervention design features  briefly fo r each intervention type in Table 2. While several options 
exist, there is no existing evidence to info rm which is  the best approach from the prov ider perspective. Our 
early work has inform ed which of these specific approaches is likely to be most acceptable to clinicians, and 
provided data needed to tailor these broad interventions. For 
example, we do not kno w how a blunt form ulary  restriction can 
be implemented at a national level.  Nuances  around order 
restriction need to  be addressed and order  checks programmed 
to only trigger when a patient meets certain criteria based on their medical r ecord data without b urdening providers  with 
additional steps  even when prescribing ADT within guid eline s. 
Whil
e formulary restriction of ADT for localized prostate canc er 
seems warranted, we may  find that it is widely considered 
unacceptable to providers . Nor do we know how  informed 
decision- making c an be effici ently operationalized in a clinical  
setting for providers considering castration for localized disease 
or for non-metastatic biochemical  recurrence. By tailoring each 
intervention strategy using behavior change techn iques and 
barrier solutions derived from  our prior work, we believe we have 
designed strategies that will be accepted by providers, but still 
allow us  to test differences in the widely varying mechanisms of 
action. We have refined these approaches through robust e fforts 
in our p rior work and the  expertise of our trans -disciplinar y, multi -
site investigative team, and will continue to refine these approac hes based on this pilot st udy. 
C2.1 S
election and tailoring of formulary restriction and decision- maki ng pilot in terventions 
C2.1.1 Formulary res trict ion interventions available in th e integrated deliver y system  
The VA Ph armacy Benefits Management Services uses several tools to encourage optimal use of 
medications including: 1) National Formulary, 2) Prior Authorizat ion, 3) Cr iteria for Use, and 4)  VA Center 
for Medication Safety. A DT is currently listed on the VA National  Formulary as a standard pharmacy benefit 
to eligible patients. No prior authorization is necessary to ensure ADT use is  appropriate. For  this pilot , we 
plan to test im plementation of a CPRS order check at the facil ity level. An order check was selected 
because it will flag prescribers that ADT may not be guideline supported for the Veteran, but it will not be a 
hard stop – providers can move through the order restr iction to order A DT without additional delays upon 
entering the indication (or any text) into  a text field. To reduce burden on providers as much as poss ible, 
this flag will on ly be triggered for Veterans with loc alized prostate c ancer getti ng primary  ADT or Veterans 
getting ADT for non -metastatic biochemic al recur rence with a low PSA level. We no te that this approach 
makes this a  benign intervention: providers are not required to cross administrative hurdles to be able to 
order ADT i f they feel they have good r eason to do so. 
C2.1.2 Tailoring a formulary restr iction s trategy for ADT de -implementat ion 
Our formulary restriction intervention involves a refined version of the current EMR order check template 
developed and in use by Dr.  Shelton and Dr. Skol arus (Co-PI) at the VA Ann Arb or to limit inappropriate 
prostate cancer screening.71 In general, these templates vary widely across the system, can be made more 
or less extensive, and can build in limited forms of decision support to s pecialists prescribing ADT. This is a 
very flexible , widely used approach, for  which the technology already exists and is integrated into the EMR. Table 2. E xample s of pot ential pi lot interventions

 We used the taxonomy outlined by Wright et al.84 to describe the decision support content and the Template 
for Intervent ion Description and Replicat ion (TIDieR)  checklist guided the refinem ent an d tailoring.85 For 
example, when an ADT injection is ordered, a bri ef interruptive message tailored to our pri oritized barriers 
TDF themes and behavior change techniques (e. g., persuasion , training, education ) based on our p rior 
work, will be shown  on the ordering screen. This will allow the prov ider the option of proceeding or 
cancelling the order, with or without justification. To ensure this formulary restriction approach is ‘smart’ we 
will use the foll owing  criteria as  we begin and explore options  during refinement: 1) injectable ADT order in 
pharmacy claims (e.g., leuprolide J9217), 2) prostate cancer  diagnosis (ICD -9 185, ICD -10 C61), and 3) low 
PSA l evel (e.g., level s <2 ng/mL are consis tent with non- metastatic disease4). We will continue to r efine 
these criteria th roughout the pilot with the investigative team. We w ill vary alert criteria (e.g., prior ADT 
injection, PSA level) to ensure the number of  triggers are acc eptable to providers as done previ ously . We 
will pilot  our theory -based messagin g, presentation, and approach, at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, 
VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Sys tem, and VA NY Harbor Healthcare System, with ongoing 
refinement. These pilot si tes have been selected because we have s tudy team member presence t o help 
facilitate imple mentation and assessment. 
C2.1.3 Decision- maki ng int erventions  to de -implement low value care Informed and shared decision-
making are increasingly recogniz ed componen ts of high quality care.63,73,86 This approach has been 
associated with les s decisional regret and conflict, increased adherence to a treatment plan, 
empowerment, higher satisfaction with care, and more realistic expectations.73 One relevant exa mple is a 
randomized trial of shared decision making leading to an absolute 25 % decrea se in antibioti c use for 
acute respirator y illness.88 Similarly, tr eatment of  localized prostate cancer and non- metastatic 
biochemically -recurrent prosta te cancer with AD T are ideal  conditions for improving patient -center ed care 
through better deci sion- making as continuous chemical castration with ADT is not guideline 
recommended in most cases. There are numerous treatment options in the case of localized disease: 
observat ion (i.e., watchful w aiting, active surveillance), surgery, and different types o f radiation therapy —
each with different risks and benefits (e.g., oncological “cure” vs. potential urinary  or sexual dysfunction). 
We plan to explore provider  factors associat ed with the decision to continue or stop ADT for localized 
prostate cancer and fo r non -metastatic bio chemical recurrence, and believe ADT prescribing is a prime 
candidate for at least 2 reasons. First, it is not guideline recommended in most cases for loca lized and 
non-metasta tic recurrent disease. Second,  there are significant harm s that m ay be under appreciated 
prior to using our decision- making approach  therefore decreasing ADT use through our interventions. 
Therefore, our interventions to de -implement l ow-value ADT include:  1) Brief provider training in 
communication and values elicitati on, 2) talking points for providers embedded into a CPRS note 
templ ate, and 3) clinic handout entitled “Living well with prostate cancer – is hormone therapy still right 
for you?” (Appendix I I). Most  of these are not routinely used in practice but could de crease ADT use.  We 
include information about the harms of ADT with a focus on  alternative treatment options in the clinic 
handout. Decision aids are one approach to help communicati on about treatment options thereby 
enhancing informed decision- making, and in some cases decreasing overtreatment es pecially when risks 
outwei gh benefit s.73   
As with the formulary restriction, we argue that this is a benign intervention focused  on the pro vider. 
Education is a common event in health care settings, and thi s is des igned to be brief, non- intrusive, and 
focused on a well -accepted practice of sharing elements of decision -making with patients.  
C2.1.4 Tailoring the decision -maki ng strat egy to de-implement l ow value ADT  
We are tailoring our intervention for castrati on with ADT as primar y treatment in localized disease and for 
non-metasta tic biochemical recurrence. Our extensive experience with the University of Michigan C enter for 
Health Communications Resear ch and its tailored approaches  to health care behavior chang e for Drs. 
Skolarus’  and Hawley’s prostate can cer survivorship trial, so cial marke ting in health literatur e,90-92 and Dr. 
Sriram, all indicate that, in fact, the way informati on is prese nted in our intervention could lead prov iders to 
withhold ADT in the face o f risks dramati cally outweighing benefits, in addition to perceptions of 
organizational support to decrease low value treatment with ADT. We involved several experts duri ng 
developm ent including Dr. Hawley, expert in breast and colon cancer decision-m aking, Dr. Makarov  
(Consultant) , Chair of the American Urological Association’s Shared Decision- Making White Paper, and 
marketing expert Dr. Sriram to ensure our interventions  are in lin e with state-of-the-art decision- making and 
marketing evidence. We wil l con tinue to refine the intervention and theory -based mess aging, presentation, 
and approach as  needed based on the pilot work.  
 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 14 of 88   
 The pilot work plays a critic al role to help u s understand t he ac ceptability, fe asibility, and scalability of these 
complex intervent ions in preparation for the full -scale randomized de- implementation evaluation trial.45 In 
fact, the UK Medical Research Council guidance indicates piloting is essential  to complex  intervent ion 
development and testing prior to large- scale evaluati on.93 The main goal of both interventions will be to 
decrease castration ra tes for patients with l ocalized prostate cancer  and patients with non- metastatic 
biochemical recurrence , but to do  this in a way that is acceptable to the clinicians who treat these  patients. 
We are purposely choosing intervention strategies from opposite ends of the behavior change continuum 
because of their evidence- based potential to change provider behavio r. Speci fically,  we are selecting one 
approach (formulary res triction polic y – order check) that operates at the site level and is widely  perceived 
as a forcing function, asking providers to provide a reason regarding their clinical dec ision. The other,  
physician communicat ion during the informed decision- making process, operates  at an individual and 
dyadic level, and is perceived as maximizing the opportunity for clinical discussions. The first approach 
requires little to no learning on the part of prov iders, while t he seco nd requires c onsiderable upfront learning 
(“cost” to the pr ovider ). This approach sets up a testable hypothesis for our  comparative effectiveness trial, 
that a blunt de- implementation policy may be effective in the sho rt term but that it will los e its effects as 
providers learn work -arounds. Conversely, an infor med decision-making approach to de -implementation 
might take longer to observe measurable decreases in castration rates, b ut its effects will create 
sustainable change as providers internal ize and routinize this clinical practice.94  
 
(See protocol section be low for detailed descriptions of interventions and study protocol procedures).  
 
C3.1 Methodological issues to be addressed in de- implementation pilots A well- designed pilot st udy 
has man y purposes , including testing methods of recruitment;  selecting the mo st ap propriate prima ry 
outcome; testing acceptability of the intervention by sta keholders; ironing out feasibility and fidelity issues; 
refining the full study protocol; and esti mating s ample size for a full t rial.45,95 As highlighted in 
implementation literatu re, preparation and planning are central to successful intervention development and 
implementation. The need for clear outcomes (e.g., castration rate), systematic, theor y-based int erventions  
to change provider behavior, and a timetable are necessary  to su ccessfully set up our full - scale evaluation 
trial. Fu rther refinem ent in the pilot work will allow us to explore outcomes including the total number of 
ADT injections as  we will also be wo rking to stop t reatment with low -value ADT. A s illustrated in  Table 3 
below, the piloting of the intervention strategies will focus on  4 major  methodological issues.45 We will 
exami ne issues surrounding recruitment, acceptability, feasib ility, scal ability, and data collection for the full -
scale trial .

C3.2 Study populations  
We will conduct pilot testing at 4 sites with multi- disciplinary review by study team mem bers to confir m 
targe t clinic visits prior to engagement with site provider. D r. Skola rus (Co-PI) will lead the pilot efforts at the 
VA Ann Arbor Ur ology  Clinic with Dr. Caram  leading pilot efforts at the VA Ann Arbor Urologic Oncology 
clinic and Dr. Ellio tt leading the effort s in the VA Ann Arbor  Radiation Oncology clinic. Dr s. She lton, and 
Makarov, each with urologic oncology practices, will lead pi lot efforts at the ir respective VA sites (Greater 
LA and NY Harbor). The number of patients  receiving primar y ADT for localized prostate cancer and 
receiving ADT for non -metastatic  biochem ical recurrence with low PSA levels at each site should be 
adequate for piloting based on preliminary data. However, the primary  purpose of the pilot is to ass ess for 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023  Page 15 of 88 issues in  the implem entation process in order to further refine the intervention plan. The pilot testing  will 
play a critical role to help us understand the ac cepta bility, feasibility, and scalability of these strategies in 
order to conduct the full -scale pilot randomized implementation trial. In particular, we expect to learn best 
practi ces in introducing both strategies to sites in the most efficient, least  intrusive ways.  
For the 4
-site pilot  randomized i mplementation trial , we will recruit  sites from the VA facilities with  the 
highest level s of low-va lue ADT u se. We will target facilities with high rates of low -value AD T for localized 
prostate cancer and non -metastatic biochemical recurrenc e. Sites will be identified through a combination 
of CDW data pulls and chart reviews, with expert mult i-disciplin ary revie w by study team members prior to 
moving forward with site provider s. We will also match our 4 intervention sites with up to 8 control s ites 
acting as contemporary controls for ADT overuse and our effectiveness outcomes.  
C3.3 D
ata sources and analysis  
We anticipate conducting the pi lots for six  months . For the pilot, our research team will host regular calls 
between Drs. Skolarus  (Co-PI), Caram (Co-I), Shelton ( Consultant ), Lepper t (Consultant) , Makarov  
(Consult ant), the Ann Arbor p roject team, other Co-I’s and consultants to discuss  issues. We will ta ke notes 
during these calls. At the beginning, we anticipate calls will occur weekly to deal with barriers and 
complications. By the end of the  interventions,  we anticipate that c alls will be shorter and less frequent, and 
will foc us more on achieve ments and lessons learned regarding m ethodological issues as we prepare for 
the pilot randomized implementation trial . We will extract data on ADT use from  VA a nd Medicare data to 
remain informed and updated about the status of  chemical  castration as primary treatment and treatment 
for non- metastatic biochemical re currence across VA (including the pilot sites).  This will allow us to monitor 
secular trends in performance and ass ess possible  changes in chemical castration over the pilot pe riod in 
our pilot sites. We will collect and maintain descriptive data, which is  most appropriate for pilot studies.95 We 
will use c ontent analysis methods to assess key issue s arising from confe rence call field notes. We will use 
bivariate analys es (t-test or chi -squared test) to assess the parameters (central tendency and variation)  for 
pilot intervention variables including pat ient and provider demographics.90 In preparation for our pilot 
randomized  implementation trial , we will u se national VA data to identify potential sites. Data collect ion and 
analysis procedures will be further  refined during the pilot.

Prior to commencement  of study ac tivities, we  will ob tain VA Ann Arbor Institutional Review Board approval , 
requesting exemption under categories 2 (survey), 3 (benign behavioral interventions), and 4 (secondary data analysis).  As an exempt project, all project modifications w ill be submi tted to the VA Ann Arbor Research & 
Development Committee for approval.  
We will c ondu
ct pil ot testing among clinicians who prescribe ADT at VA Ann Arbor Healthcare Sy stem, VA 
Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Sys tem, and VA NY Harbor Healthcare S ystem. Drs.  Skolarus  (Co-PI), Caram 
(Co-I), Shelton ( Consultant) , Leppert  (Consultant) , and Makaro v (Consultant)  will serve as champions for the 
pilot sites, working with the Ann Arbor project team to help with implementation. This includes providing 
information on s ite workf low, regula r status updates, and feedback on implementation.  For the pilot 
random ized implementation trial , the study team will recruit Site Champions (e.g. , Urology Chiefs) at each  of 
the participating sites. All clinicians who p rescribe ADT at participating sites wil l be eligible to receive the 
interventions. Ann Arbor team members will send clin icians an email  with an attached Research Information 
Sheet providing an opportunity to  opt out of participation. Opting out means that they will not  be asked to 
participate i n surveys or other approaches to measuring provider responses and the interventions will not be 
triggered for any of  their patients or clinic visits. 
No other
 inclusion or exclusion criteria will be applied. No patients will be r ecruited for either the pil ot testing  or 
pilot randomized implementation trial ; however,  identifiab le data will be collected from national VA CDW, 
Central Cancer R egistry, Vital Statu s, and CMS data, and chart reviews will be conducted  using 
CPRS/Capri/JLV/ WebVRAM , to identify target clinic visits and assess outcomes. Identifiers  will be str ipped as 
early as possible, once analytic data sets are crea ted.

 D1.2 Sour ces of materials  
As part of our development efforts, we have created real- time ‘smart’ criteria to suppor t streamlined 
implementation. We will collect data us ing CDW/Cancer Registry /Vital Stat us/CMS data from October 1, 1999  
to June 30, 2024 on up to 100,000 patients to ident ify low value ADT use at pilot testing sites and to determine 
eligibility of implementation trial sites. While the cohort will be defined using 2020 – 2022 data, t he remaining 
data is needed to properly identify target clinic visits and ensure t he alert criter ia (e.g., prior ADT injections) 
triggers ar e acceptable to providers. We  will develop and test the intervention stra tegies focusing on major 
methodological issues includi ng: provider engagement, acceptabilit y, feasibility, scalability, and data collect ion 
for the ful l-scal e trial. Dr. S kolarus (Co-PI) and t he research team, with the support of weekly study team 
meetings, will b e responsible for each pilot assessment and p rovider engagement. There will be regular calls 
between Dr. Skolarus  (Co-PI), the pilot Site Champi ons/S tudy Consultan ts, the Ann Arbo r project team, Co- I’s 
and consultants to discuss common issues or concerns during the pilot. We will take field notes dur ing these 
calls. At the beginning,  we anticipate the calls will occur weekly and deal with barriers  and complications.  By 
the end of t he in tervention, we anticipate that calls will be shorter and less frequent, and will  focus more on 
achievements and lesso ns learned regarding methodological is sues as we prepare for the randomized 
evaluation trial. We will extract data  on ADT us e from VA and M edicare data to remain informed  about the 
status of chemical castration as primary treatment for localized prostate c ancer and treatment for non-
metast atic biochemical recurrence across VA (including pilot sites). This  will allow u s to monit or secular  trends 
in performance over this per iod, and to assess possible changes in chemical  castration over the pilot period.  
We will collect and maintain descriptive da ta, which  is most  appropriate for pilot studies. We will use  cont ent 
analys is methods  to assess  issues arising in each site from the conference call field notes. All data will be 
collected specifically for the purposes of proposed research.

 D1.3 Potential risks  
Risks for participating providers  include possi ble slight  disruption of clinical workflow and a low likelihood of  
psychological distress. These risks will be site- and intervention- dependent. We are request ing exemption 
under categor ies 2 (survey), 3 (benign behavioral interventions), and 4 (secondary  data analy sis). Providers 
will be emailed a Research Information Sheet with details of the study. The right of prov iders to discontinue 
their involvemen t in the research at any time will  be fully disclosed in the Information Sheet. We are also 
request ing a waiver of  HIPAA aut horization for access to PHI. The proposed research qualifies for this waiver 
because it involves no more than minimal risk to subjects and  the waiver will not advers ely affect the rights or 
welfare of subjects. In addition, the re search could not pr acticably be car ried out without the waiver. In order to 
be granted the waiver, we demonstrate procedures (outlined below) that protect pa tient identifiers from 
improper us e and disclosure.  
 
The investigative team has considerable experi ence in maintai ning the c onfidentiality of large datasets and has 
established procedures in place to ensure data confidentiality. All investigators and resear ch sta ff will have met 
training r equirements for handling protected health information as defined by the Health I nsurance P ortability  
and Accountability Act (HIPAA), data security, and privacy. All data storage and handling will follow defined 
protocols at the V A Ann Arbor Healthcare Syst em. All data collected from VA CDW/Cancer Registry/Vital 
Status/C MS records and CPRS /Capri/JLV / WebV RAM  will reside on VINCI and in an a ccess- restricted study 
folder on the AAVA OI&T se cure drive. Paper records created for  chart review purpos es will be  labeled with a 
study ID  only and stored in locked filing cabinets in t he locked 3rd floor CCM R suite  in VA -rented space at 
NCRC.  Once data is digitize d, the paper  copies will be placed in the VA’s secure shredder bin.  Survey data will 
be collected anonymously  in VA Qualtrics  and downloaded into the access -restricted study folde r for additio nal 
analyses. 
 
D2. Adequacy of protection from risk  
D2.1 Recruitment and informed consent  
Providers, service leadership, and staff involved with ADT prescribing at the part icipatin g sites will be given an 
overview of the site -specific inte rvention, highlighting the nature and purpose of the proposed r esearch, as 
well as what they should expect to encounte r during routine clinical care should they agree to proceed with the 
study. Providers will be sent an email with a Research Information Sheet (attachment)  attached informing 
them of their abi lity to op t out and inviting them to the Implementation Education Session (IES) (attachment).  
 
D2.2 P rotection against risk  
All study  staff will have met local training requirements for handling protect ed health i nformation . All data will 
be stored on VINCI and in an access -restricted study folder on a secure server at  the Ann Arbor VA, or in VA 
Qualtrics , accessible only by authorized st udy team members. Individual real social security numbers (SSNs) 
will be needed to link in dividual data across data sources  (e.g., CDW -Oncology to clinical data) and to conduct 
chart reviews.  An electronic cross -walk file w ill be used when accessing large datasets for analyses. Access to 
the cross -walk file will be restrict ed to authorized personnel, who have  met the security criteria necessary for 
access to patient identifier mapping fi les at  the VA’s Austin Automation Cent er. As VA employees, all study 
staff members  are subject to the Federal Privacy Act. Site Champions will not use coercion i n their role and 
will not be priv y to names of providers opting out of the research. 
 
D3. P
oten tial b enefits of the proposed researc h to the subject and other s 
Though participat ion in the research study may not directly benefit parti cipan ts, the data c ollected will benef it 
future provider s and patients by improving the quality of prostate cancer care in and eventually outside the VA 
through theory -based interventions to reduce low value cancer care. Due to the expanding population of aging 
men with pros tate cancer, enhancing safety by prom oting evidence- based use of chemical castration promotes 
quali ty car e and likely will improve qualit y of life. It is possible  that providers taking part in the interventions will 
gain knowledge about be tter use of chemi cal castration for prostate cancer pat ients, particularly with respect to 
localized disease and non- metas tatic biochemical recurrence. M oreover, understanding how  providers unlearn 
ineffective clinical behaviors is a critical step towards opt imizing cancer  care and de -implem entation of low 
value services. Unlearning clinical behaviors such as prescribing ADT in low evidence settings can have 
substantial benefits. First, pa tients are no longer subjected to treatment harms with little to no  bene fit. Second, 
unlear ning misaligned castration pract ices can provide opportunity for more efficient, higher value use of  
specialty care providers. Last , acquiring the skill of unlearning can increase flexibility and willingness to adapt 
to evidence mor e proactively. The risk s posed to research participants a re minimal, consisting of potential 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 18 of 88   
 breaches in confidentiality. We believe we have procedures in place that will minimize t hese risks, and tha t the 
overall project has a highly favorable risk:benefi t ratio. 
 
 
D4. Importan ce of knowledge  to be gained  
Many  men with prostate cancer are castrated with long- acting injec table drugs (i.e., androgen deprivati on 
therapy or ADT). Although some patients benefit, it is also used in patients with little or nothing to gain. The 
best ways to stop, or de- implement, low v alue cancer care are unknown. A significant scientific and cli nical 
knowledge gap remains in priori tizing which barriers to s topping castration in low value settings need to be 
targeted for effective de-im plementation. We w ill compare two  different approac hes for reducing low value 
ADT use. In doing so, this study wi ll add ress important issues surroundin g provider behavior change and se rve 
as a model to decrease overtreatment more broadly. This is especiall y important gi ven Choosing Wisely  and 
the need for e ffective de -implementation strategies. Throughout this study, we will keep  a broad  focus  so that 
our work  lays a  foundation for transforming  how and why castration is performed for prostate cancer tr eatment 
across the globe . This work will address provide r preferences and concerns through pilot tailoring and advance 
de-implementation science for low val ue care through our subsequent de -implementa tion evaluation trial.  
 
D5. Data Safety and Monitoring P lan 
Drs. Saini (PI) and Skolarus  (Co-PI) will be  responsi ble for reporting all adverse events that might arise 
during the course of the study to the  Ann Ar bor Veterans Affairs Healt h System  IRB as well as to the I SSO 
and PO as appropriate. Adverse events dur ing this study would likely consist only of breaches in 
confidentiality. As outlined above, precautions have been taken to prevent this. However, should such 
breaches occur, Dr s. Saini  (PI) and Skolarus (Co-PI) will report t hese occurrences to the overseei ng IRBs as 
well as th e ISSO and PO within 48 hours of discovery. 
 
D6. Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
For provider  recruitment, no exclusions will be m ade on the basis of gender , race o r ethnicity. The only 
eligibility r equirement is that participants be providers with experience caring for prostate cancer patients 
on ADT.

 PROTOCO L 
 
STUDY  OVERVIEW  
We are using theory -based, mixed methods to approach de -implementation of low -value an drogen 
deprivation t herapy (ADT). Based on our prior w ork (DeADT  RDC-2017 -1070/  IRB-2017 -1047) involv ing 
behavioral  theory -based qualitative analyses and national provider survey  and dis crete choice experiment 
(DCE), we sel ected competing de -implementatio n strategies for multi- site pilot te sting in preparation for an 
innovative 4-site pilot randomized  implementation trial to decrease  low-value cancer care. This study is 
funded by NIH Na tional Cancer  Institute  with the VA Ann Ar bor Center for Clinical Management Research, 
an HSR&D Center of Inn ovation, providi ng all necessary resources, space, and support for conducti ng this 
researc h. 
 
During  our development work, we en gaged our team to identify and create the compet ing de -
implementation stra tegies based on our prior qualitative research eliciting stakeholder input. W e chose an 
ADT order check attestation (Or)  versus a n ADT provider script ( Sc) as a co mmunication aid to be used and 
documented as a n accounta ble justification in the electronic medical record. Sites receiving the Sc  
intervention wil l also receive  an educational handout that providers may elect to share with patients during 
clinic visits. B oth strategies have a strong evidence- base for changing provi der behavior and are tailored 
based on the COM -B and DCE survey. The work  from p ilot testing  will play a critical role to help us 
understand the acceptability, feasibi lity, a nd scalability of these  strategies  in order to conduc t the full -scale 
pilot randomized  implementation  trial. We will co nduc t pilots for up to six months across 3 VA sites and the 
pilot implementation tria l across 4 VA sites. 
 The main goal of both interventions  will b e to decrease ongoing l ow-value AD T use for patients with 
prostate cancer, but t o do thi s in a way tha t is acceptable to the clinicians who treat these patients. From a 
scientific perspective, we are purposely choosing to trial strategies from opposite end s of the behavior 
chang e continuum  because of their evidence -based potential to change provid er behavi or. Specifically, we 
are selecting one approach (Or)  that operates as an organizational constraint and  a competi ng approach 
(Sc) that operates at a n indiv idual and dyadic level  to build individual capacity, perceived to maximize 
ability of pr ovide rs to com municate effectively. The first approach requires little to no learning on the part 
of provid ers, whil e the second requires upfront learning (“cost ” to pr ovider). 
 As illustrat ed in Figure  2, this approach sets up a testable hypothesi s: 
that a blu nt de -implementation organizatio nal approach may be 
effective in the short -term, but that it will lose  its effe cts as providers 
learn work -arounds. Conversely, an i ndividual capacity bu ilding 
appro ach to de -implement ation using a script might take lon ger to 
observe measurable decreases in castration rates, but its effects will 
create sustainable change as providers internali ze and routinize this 
clinical prac tice.

 STUDY  DESIGN  
Pilot testing will be done  at 3 VA facilities and the pilot randomized  implementation trial will be conducted 
at 4 VA facilities th at care for prostate cancer patients with localized disease and non- metastatic 
biochemically- recurrent prostate cancer with low PSA lev els receiving ADT injec tions. Our ri gorous prior 
research demonstrates opportuni ties at the organizational level to address ongoing systematic use of ADT, 
as well as at the provider level where barriers t o individual behavior change need to be addressed.  
 
We will pilot the Or  vs. Sc de-implementation strategies for up to six months a cross 3 sites to reduce low -
value ADT use in prostate cancer patients with localized disease and non -metastatic  biochemically-
recurr ent prostate cancer with low PSA levels. This pilot work will play a critical role to help us und erstand 
the acceptability , feasibility, and scalability of these s trategies to conduct the 4- site pilot randomized  
implementation  trial. Using the RE -AIM framework, we  will ev aluate methods of recr uitment and  
acceptability of the intervention by stakehol ders, identify and troubleshoot any fea sibility and fidelity 
issues, an d refine the study prot ocol and power analys is for th e pilot implementation trial. 
 We have the fol lowing specific aim:  
 Aim 1 : To evaluate the implem entation of an ADT order check  (Or) versus a provider s cript (Sc) on 
decreased low -value ADT use  after  six months.  We will first examine low -value ADT use during 6 months 
of pilot testing  at 3 VA sites, as well as refine our propos ed RE -AIM implementation outco mes and 
ascertainment, study o f moderators (e.g., fid elity) an d causal mechanisms underl ying implementation 
interventions. This work will inform the subsequent 4- site pilot randomized  implementation  trial by 
address ing preferences and con cerns throu gh tailoring  during pi lot testing. Based on pilot testing, w e will 
refine our site engagement str ategies and study meth ods and materials for the trial.  
 
Data collection  
All 3 pilot test sites will be followed for up to  6 months. To i mplemen t the interventions and  assess for 
issues in the impl ementation process in ord er to further refine the intervention plan, information will be 
collected regarding the process of ADT ordering at each site, including who is involved, thr ough 
conversati ons wit h the Site Champion (who is also a project consultant ) or their designee. Addi tionally, 
information regarding imple mentation status as  well as any changes in site processes around prescribing 
ADT will be discussed at regular team meetings with the project consultants (including Si te Champi ons). For 
both the p ilot and implementation trial, outcomes will be collected fro m VA CDW/Cancer Registry/Vital 
Status/CMS records and CPRS/Capri/JLV /WebVRAM  for all clinic visits documented as providi ng low -value 
ADT at ba seline, 3  and 6 months.  An o rganiz ational survey will be developed and refined  throughout the 
pilot. For the p ilot implementation trial, an anonymous clinic  assessment survey will be administered to Site 
Champions at baseline and an ADT provider assessment will  be administered  to participating site p roviders 
at baseline and 1 -month post -intervention through VA Qua ltrics (Appendix VI).  
 
Outcomes Analyses  
Primary analyses: Comparing the effectiveness of two de- implementati on strategies, Or vs. Sc, on 
continued lo w-value ADT use a fter six  months. Our pr imary outco me is stopping ADT in jections, which wi ll 
likely be evaluated through a combination of chart reviews and informatics data generated through the ordering process. We will also explore the feasibility and im pact of six -month outcome s during pilo t testin g 
to increase study effici ency and timelines s. 
 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 25 of 88   
  
Secondary outcomes: RE -AIM implementation outcomes, changes from baseline measures, total ADT 
injections per arm a t 6 m onths post  implementation. (Table 4). We will examine m oderators o f strategy 
effec tiveness (e.g., fidelity) and cau sal mechanisms un derlying the strategies through content analysis from 
study team and pilot site meeting documents and discussion and ba sed o n our organizational assessment.

 PILOT  SITE SELECTION  
• The Or and Sc interventions will be piloted at the study PI and consultants’ sites as follows:   
Site  Site Champion s Interventio n 
VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System  Ted Sko larus, MD ( co-PI) Or & Sc  
VA Gr eater Los  Angeles He althcare System  Jeremy Shelton, MD  Or 
VA New York Ha rbor Healthcare System   Dan Makarov, MD  Or 
 
PILOT  SITE  IMPLEMENTATION  OVERVIEW  
• Drs. Shelton, Mak arov, and  Leppert are all consultants who have agreed to serve a s Site C hampion s for the  
pilot work. 
o Study  consultants do not have access to  identifiable data or t he study folder and are not “engaged” in 
study activities.  
 
• Pilot sites will not  be ra ndomize d. 
 
• The A DT O rder Check Attestation Intervention ( Or) will be im plemented at all sites, as this  interventi on requires 
engagement with other s ervices, such as C AC, pharmacy, etc., and its procedures are most in need of 
refinement.  
 • The ADT Provider Script I nterventi on (Sc) will be implemented at Ann  Arbor .  
 
• The official start d ate fo r the pil ot begi ns when we have started adding H F’s and/or as signing progress no tes. 
Pilot sites will be followed for up to 6 months.  
 
• Facilit y No
 tifications & Approvals   
o Site Champi ons will be asked to seek approval from the Medical Center D irecto r and n otify chiefs of 
Urology, Oncology, Radiation Oncology, and Ph armacy (as needed) at their respective sites.  
o Study staff will pro vide Site Champions with email templates (Appendix II ).  
 Email templates will be tailored to each facility, as need ed, an d revised based on provid er feedba ck 
o The Site Champions will be asked to direct any rep lies to the study group email 
VHAANNLivingWell@va.gov . Unless otherwise specified, the site champions wi ll be  included on a ll 
corresponden ce with  staff at t heir site  
 • CHIO/CAC ’s N
 otification s & Approvals  
o Once the Site Champion has notified the Chiefs of Urolo gy, M edical Oncology, Radiation Onc ology, and 
Pharmacy, s tudy staff will reach out to CHIO /CACs at ea ch facility (Append ix II) to begin  discus sions on  
implementing  the Order Check ( Or). Study staff wil l also ask CACs at Ann Arbor to crea te a new Provider 
Script  (Sc) progress note. 
o Our exper ience with the CACs at pilot sites will infor m development of a CA C instruc tion guid e to pr ogram 
the CPRS orde r che ck and progress note to be used in the cRCT .  
 
• Baseline AD T Prescribing Meetings  
o Information will be collected regarding the process of A DT order ing at each site, including who is  involved, 
through conversations with the Site Champi on or th eir desi gnee. 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 28 of 88   
 o Site Champions and Section Chiefs will  be asked about the ADT ordering pr ocess for their d epartment, if  
they are in the Sc  Arm this will include planning  on how to best make the patient handout available to 
providers who prescri be ADT . 
o This informati on is needed to ensure the intervention is t ailored to fit the sites’ existing workflow, to know 
who at the site should be informed o f the intervention, and to lea rn baseline workflow so we are aware of 
changes outs ide of our interven tion t hat may impact A DT ordering . 
o Site Champions and Section Chief s will also be asked for a list of providers who prescribe ADT at their site 
(including fello ws and residents). 
 If names of  the fellows/residents are unknown, we will lea ve it up to the Si te Champions and 
Sectio n Chiefs to  notify them about the study.  
 If departments outside  of the Site Champion’s department also prescribe ADT, we will request thi s 
information fro m their departmen t chief (or designee) as well (e.g. , Medica l Oncology, Radiat ion 
Oncology)  
o Site Cham pions will be asked for names of the site CH IO/CACs (if unknown) . 
 
• Implementation Edu cation Session (IES)  
o Study staff will work with Site Champions to schedule  a virtual IES . 
o The purpose of the IES will  be to explain the importance of the s tudy, describe t he light to uch 
interventions, and encourage use of the tools provided with the int erventions.  We will also field questions 
and address any concerns from providers.  
o The IES will idea lly be scheduled during Grand Rounds , tumor b oards, or ano ther regularly sche duled 
clinical department m eeting . 
o The IES will be around  10-15 minutes and  will include a PowerPoint presentation (see attached) . 
 The IES presentation wil l be tailored to each facility , as needed, and revised based on provider 
feedback. 
 The Study  Co-PI plans to f acilitate the IES, but it may also be c onducted by st udy staff or d esignee 
chosen by site leadership at their request . 
 
• Confirm List of ADT Pro viders  
o Once the Site Champions have obtained/provided all ne cessary approvals/ notifications and the I ES has 
been scheduled, study s taff will contact the Site  Champio n and/or department chief s to confirm the final 
list of  providers in each department  who prescribe ADT .  
 
• Intervention Kick -Off  
o Study staff will send providers an email w ith an attached information  sheet  and information about the 
upcoming IES  (if IES has not already  occurred)  (App endix II). 
 Site Cham pions will also ema il providers to encou rage parti cipation  in the IES (Appendix II). 
 Site Ch ampions will be careful to promote the study at their  sites without being coercive.  
 Providers will have a w eek from th e email being sent to opt  out. Provi ders may opt out by  emailin g 
the study team at: VHAANNLivingWell@va .gov. 
 Site Champions will not be informe d of any providers opting out.  
 
• Ongoing Communic at ions 
o Once the intervention is successfully implemented at the si te, study staf f will communica te with Site 
Champions/si te staf f as needed. These communi cations may in clude:  
 Monthly automated email inquiring  about any site changes (including changes in providers and 
procedures), feedback from other staff, or site needs . 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 29 of 88   
  Other communi cations as needed. 
 
• This pilot wo rk will help us  refine our prot ocol, trou bleshoot unfo reseen issues in the project, and determi ne 
whether our interventions are feasible as designed.  
 
• We will also pilot the preliminary organizational asses sment survey by i nviting the Site Champion s to com plete 
the survey in VA Qualtric s. 
 
IDENTIF YING LOW-VALUE  ADT  IN PILOT  
      CDW/CENTRAL  CANCER  REGISTRY/VI TAL  STATUS/CMS   
 
• We will collect data using CDW/Cancer Registry/Vital Status/CMS data fro m Octo ber 1 , 1999 to  June 30,  2024  
 
• Study Data Man ager will identify  the low-value ADT  coho rt using 20 20 - 2022 VA CDW/Central Cancer 
Registry/Vital Status /CMS data.  
o Real SSNs will be  necessary in order to link data across databases and to conduct chart r eviews . 
 
• Target clinic visits  appropri ate for low -value ADT de- impleme ntatio n will be identi fied using CD W/Cancer 
Registry/Vital Status/CMS data based on pa tient diagn osis, PC treatment, and treatment dates. 
 
• We developed real -time ‘smart’ criteria to supp ort st reamlined implementatio n including:  
1.  Injectable ADT order  within 14 m onths of the cur rent date ( e.g., leuprolide J9217)  
2.  Prostate cancer diagnosis (I CD-9 185, I CD-10 C61)  
3.  Low and non- rising PSA levels consistent with l ocaliz ed disease or treated non -metast atic biochemically -
recurrent prostate cancer ( <2 ng/mL ) 
 
• Clinic visits identified as  appropriate for ADT de -implementation will include all those with patients  undergoing 
ADT monotherapy as well as those with non -metastatic prostate cancer after definitive treatment, and those 
receivi ng con tinuous ADT for biochemica l recurrence .  
 
o ADT mon otherapy/pr imary ADT i s defined by:  
1. Never had  evidence of metast atic di sease (including bones and lymph nodes)  
2. No treatment with castration -resistant prost ate cancer (CRPC) medications (e.g.,  abirateron e, 
enzalutami de)  
3. No definitive  treatment with radiatio n (+/- adjuvant ADT),  RP, or cryotherapy, and has no immediate 
plan f or defin itive treatment  
4. Receiving ongoing ADT  at the VA  
5. Current PSA ≤2 and not rapidly rising  (no P SADT <10 month s) 
 
o Biochemical recurrence is defined by:  
1. Never had evi dence of metast atic disease  (including bones and lymph nodes)  
2. No treatment with CRPC  medications (e. g., abiraterone, enzalutamide)  in the last two years  
3. Has comp leted  definitive treatment with radiation (+/ - adjuvant ADT) , RP, or cryotherapy  
 The course of adjuv ant ADT no t within 3 y ears of definit ive trea tment   
4. Rise in PSA level  after definit ive tr eatment  
 2 ng/mL over nadir for  those with histor y of radiation  treatment  
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 30 of 88   
 o nadir = lowest PSA after tre atment  
 >0.2 ng/mL for those with radical prostatectomy (RP)  
5. Receiving ongoing ADT at t he VA for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer  
6. Not on adjuvant ADT with salvage radiation  
 
o nmPCa after local/defin itive treatment defined by:  
1. Never had evidence of me tastatic disease (including bones and lymph nodes)  
2. No treat ment with CRPC  medications (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide)  in the last two years  
3. Has complete d definitive treatment with radiation (+/ - adjuva nt ADT) , RP, or cryotherapy  
4. Receiving ongoing A DT at the VA  
5. No rise in PSA level  after definit ive tr eatment  
 Current PSA ≤2 and not rapidly rising  (no P SADT <10 month s) 
 
• Throughout the pilot, t he data manager will complete data pulls at different time int ervals (e.g., weekly, bi -weekly, 
monthly, et c.) to determine how often the data may  need to be refreshed duri ng the RCT.  Data such as patient 
appointment cancellations, changes in PSA scores, new dr ug names, variations of a ppointments/ treatments, etc.  
are important to keep updated as they can impact  patient eligibility.  
MPCA  NATURAL  LANGUAG E PROCESSING  (NLP)  TOOL USE IN VINCI  
• We will use a validated NLP tool developed by the VA Salt Lake City Health care System Prostate Core to identify  
Veterans with m etastat ic prostate cancer (mPCa) in real time.  This will enable us to further refine our cohort by 
excluding all mP Ca patients.  
o The Prostate Core has provided a data d ictionary for definitions of the va riables . 
o We will inform the Prostate Core if any of our defi nitions are different (e.g., prostate canc er, mPCa, etc.) .  
o In the event we find mPCa  patients after we co mplete chart reviews, we will i nform the P rostate Core team.  
o Study staff will view the NL P data output in a VINCI worksheet . 
 
• The PCa Data Core table /list is updated monthl y by VINCI (we should receive email notifications from VINCI w hen 
the list has been u pdated).  
CHART  REVIEWS  
• Study staff will also conduct chart reviews using CPRS/Capri/J LV/WebVRAM  to confirm target ADT orders  
and clinic visits . 
o Study staff will apply for  local CPRS access at participating sites  through WebVRAM , though Capri/JLV may 
also be used to conduct chart reviews  
 
• As the ADT injections occur serially at 1, 3, or 6 m onth intervals, an individual provider could have multiple 
opportunities to be exposed to the interventi on during the 6 -month study period.  
 
• Low-value ADT injections mu st have occurred within 14 months  prior to data pull .  
 
• In consultation with Co-PI Dr. S kolarus, a fellowship- trained urologi c onc ologist, and Co -I Dr. Caram, an  expert 
prostate cancer medic al oncologist, and Co-I Dr. Elliott, Chief of  Radiation Oncology  at AAVA, we will provide 
multi- disciplinary review for questionable low -value ADT use.  
 
• Clinic visits identified during chart  reviews or multi -disciplinary review as involving proper justifi cation for ADT use 
will not be considered appropriate for ADT de -implementation.  
 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 31 of 88   
 • When identifying clinic visits as appropriate for the ADT de-implementa tion interventions, no interventions will be 
triggered on any clinic visit s for providers who opted out of the study.  
 
• We will track numbers of identified low -value A DT injections each week per site.  
 
• Paper records created for chart review purposes will be  labeled with a study ID only and stored i n locked filing 
cabinets in the locked 3rd floor CCMR suite in VA-rented space at NCRC. Once data is digi tized, the paper co pies 
will be placed in the VA’s secure shredder bin.  
PATIENT  DASHBOARD  IN CPRS  
• See Appendix IV for screenshots of an exa mple d ashboard . 
 
• We will wo rk with Yehuda Bechar, MBA, ou r consultant  technology developer and study team member, to create a 
patient dashbo ard accessible through AAVA  CPRS.  
 
• The dashboard will enable the study team to:  
o View upcoming clinic visits identifie d as appropriate for ADT d e-implementation . 
o Know when w e can assig n the progress note template to providers who have an upcoming cl inic visit 
identified as appropria te for ADT de -implementation . 
o Determine when a patient ha s an order for ADT in CPRS. 
o Comple te qua lity checks (e.g., t o know whi ch patient records  to look at to  confirm the order check was 
generated) . 
 
• Once a site is randomized,  the Data Manager will run a new data pull for that site. She will create  a file  with the list 
of potentially eligib le patients from CDW  to upload to the dashboard. A separate Excel spreadsheet will be created 
for each site.  The data files will be save d here: I:\Skolarus 2017 \DeA DT\5. Identifiable Data \RCT Data \Files for 
Upload . Data files will be upl oade d to the dashboard.  
 
• Dashboard administ rators  will download exp ort data files from the dashboard  and save here: I:\Skolarus 
2017 \DeADT \5. Identifiable Data \RCT Data \Dashboard Export Files. These data will the n be im ported into the 
database. This will a lso need to be done when changes to the dashboard data fields are mad e, as the export fields 
need to match the database import  fields.  
 
• Prio
r to chart review screening, t he study team will ask Yehuda to run the program that looks for the most recent  
clinic visits  – these will be ad ded to the “ next screen date ” column.   
 
• Study team will ask site CHIO and/or CAC’s to add the dashboard link to their CPRS tools menu. The FID in the 
URL will need to be updated for each site.  Quotation marks are required at the beg inning and end of the

ADT ORDER  CHECK  ATTESTATION  (OR) INTERVE NTION 
• The pilot work will be used to refine the Order Check Attestation Intervention for  use in the cRCT, as needed. 
 
• The Or inter vention will not be implemented in departments using V ista Chemotherapy Mana ger (VCM ) or another 
separate ordering system where the order check will not be seen by providers. 
 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 34 of 88   
 • The screensh ot below sho ws the latest version of the clinical reminder orde r check ( CROC) dev elope d in 
coordination with Dr. Gabe Solomon, ACOS Informatics,  and Joy e Allen, Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, CAC , VA Ann 
Arbor Healt hcare System.  
 
• Study staff and/or the AAVA  CAC will em ail site CAC’s a coding guide to implement  the CROC  in CPRS . The codi ng 
guide is written to start in test mode  so the Study Team can use test patients  to ensure t he  CROC is triggering 
correctly .  
 
• When  t
he loc al CAC is  ready, study sta ff will put them in c ontact with Joye ( joye.al len@va.gov ), who will send th em 
a VISTA file with the CROC to ins tall and update ac cording to the coding guid e. In the event Joye isn’t  availab le, 
Erica Montressor ( erica.montressor@va.g ov) o r Cindy Shepler  (mary.sh epler@va.gov ) can send the V I STA file if we 
provide them w ith the lo cal CACs VISTA ema il. 
 
• Study st
aff will request CAC to change the CROC to live mode when the intervention is set to  start.  
 
• Once the CROC  has been swit ched to live mode, s tudy staff will place a “Living Wel l ADT” health  factor in th e EMR 
of pati ents whose  clinic visits stu dy staff have confirmed to be ta rgets for ADT de- implementation.  We will enter  
health factors as we identify eligible pa tients. This health factor combined with a low PS A level ( most rec ent PSA < 
2ng/ mL) will trigger the ADT Order  Check Attestation Interventi on (Or) when  the provider places an order f or ADT  
(Lupron, Eli gard, Viadur,  Goserilin, and Z olodex) . 
 
• Providers may ove rride the CRO C by entering a number from the order check text that corresponds t o the reason 
they are overri ding the order check. Provide rs are also able to  enter text if a numbere d reason is not lis ted.  
 
• If pro viders opt -out af ter the health factor was p laced for one of their patients, study staff wi ll remove the hea lth 
factor in CP RS. For a provider who opt s-out, the Study Data Manage r will run a query in our Access tracking 
database to pull a list of his/her pat ients. The Stud y Team will not place a h ealth factor  in the EMR of patients 
whose provider has opted out.  
 
• Study staff wil l do periodic quality cont rol checks to ensure the int erventi on is wo rking a s expected and work wit h 
the site CAC’s to make adjustme nts as necessary.   
 
• Appropriate use of the i ndication will be tracked for fidelity. We will track comments  entered by provid ers to 
override order chec ks. The Study Data Manager w ill periodically pull comments from order che cks (there are data 
tables for orde r checks that c ontain text for open fiel d that are s tored in CDW).  
o Using a combination o f progress notes and  other CPRS d ata, study staff will chec k to determine whether 
the pati ent received  the injection.  
• Deimplementing Or – study staff will remove HFs for intervention patients. W e’ll ask site to remove st udy HF from 
their CPRS .

• Click on the “ Notes”  tab (bottom o f screen)  
• Selec t (highlight) th e note that  make s most sense to y ou to add the health factor.  Ideally  this wil l be 
the last progress note by the provider who prescribes th is patient ADT.  Note: it s houldn’t hurt 
anything to add thi s to another encounter if the last progre ss note by the provider wh o prescribes ADT 
isn’t an optio n – the only consequence of t his heal th factor is triggering our order check while the 
order check  is live at the site.

PROVIDER  SCRIPT  (SC) INTERVENTION 
• The pilot work will be used to refine the Pr ovider  Script In tervent ion for use in the cRCT, a s need ed. 
 
• The purpose of th e script is to enable providers to:  
o Improve i nterpersonal skills 
o Increase confi dence in the evidence base and comm unication s urrounding low -value ca re 
 
• It is up to the dis cretion of the provider whether/how to inc orporate the s cript into the c linic visit d iscussion. 
PROGRESS  NOTE  
• We will work with Er ica Mons tressor (Erica.Montressor@va.gov ), or another,  AAVA CAC , to develop the progress 
note template. We will also creat e an instruction gui de for CAC s at oth er sites to upload the note templa te file in 
CPRS .  
 
• Eri
ca, or an other AAVA  CAC will send the note template via VISTA emai l to local CACs wi th direction s to install. In 
the event Erica is n ot available,  Joye Allen ( joye.allen @va.gov ), or Cindy Shepl er (mary.shepler@va.gov ) can send 
the VISTA f ile if w e pro vide them with the local CAC ’s VISTA email.  
• This is t he exact entry  for the reminder d ialog  they would need unless we make any updates to it between now 
and then.  
 
 
  
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 37 of 88   
 • Study  staff will ente r a CPR S progress note approximately  one busines s day prior to a target low-value ADT cl inic 
visit. Notes will not be assigned  for ADT in jection -only visits. The note includes talking point s for the provider t o 
help with a discussion with t he Veteran.    
o The note can be edited and signed by the provid er, givin g a quick and simple w ay to document the 
discussion.  The prog ress note will prompt providers  to indicate whether  patient prefers t o con tinue or 
discontinue ADT.   
 
• The progress not e will include links to  the clinic handout which will be po sted on CCMR ’s external website (outs ide 
VA firewall) .  
 
• Providers  may mo dify, ignore, or delete the progress  note.   
 
• Appropriate use of the indica tion will be tracked for fidelity.  We will track how man y notes are placed. We will also 
be able to run a report of all signed  and unsigned  progr ess notes.  
 
• At the end of the intervention period, Ann Arbor CAC’s will delete/remove all unsigned pro gress no tes. Unsig ned 
notes will need to be reassigned at the end of  the stu dy. Erica, or another AAVA CAC will run a report of unsigne d 
notes  by our not e title for An n Arb or. The CAC will change t he note author back to a member of the st udy team, 
which we  can then rem ove from CPRS. We will ask the Data Manager to reas sign the not e in CDW  for other sites or 
ask the site CAC if necessary.  
o If provide rs delet e an unsigned not e, it’s unlikely to  appea r in a TIU progress note report .  
CLINIC HANDOUT  
• The clinic h andout will be tailored to each i ndividual facility,  e.g., with site  name (Appendix V). 
 
• Prior to each site’s scheduled IES , study sta ff will provide clinic  handouts  to the clinic  point per son identified by the 
Site Champion  (the clinic  point person may al so be the Site Champion ). We may use one or more of the following 
approaches:  
o By mail: hardco pies of the handout will be mailed to the clinic point perso n (as requested ). Each clinic will 
receive 50 copies of the handout.  
o By email: copies of the handout will be emailed to clinic  point person ( this may hap pen when  we send Site 
Champions t he em ail templates or in a separate email) . Each clinic  will be instructed to print 50 copies of 
the handout.  
o By website:  a copy of  the handout will be accessible on CC MR’s  websit e (outsi de the VA firew all). A lin k to 
the w ebsite will be in cluded in the progres s note.  
 
• If requested by sit es, the study  will provide suppli es to sites to disp lay the clinic handouts. Stu dy staff will check in 
to ensure handouts were received and are b eing dis played and/or m ade accessi ble to providers and to  address 
any issues tha t come up.  
 
• It is up to the discret ion of th e provider whether/how to incorporate t he handout into the clini c visit discussion.

n. In the event  you need to ma nually enter PSA lab  values and AD T injection in formati on, please inclu de data 
for the  three most recent PS A labs and ADT injections within the last year .   
i. The best place to find  this inf ormation  is in the progress notes for an ADT injection appointment  
(they may include “Uro” or “ Onc” in the title  – do not assume informa tion about an ADT injection is 
not available just because a note doesn’t  include “Uro” or “Onc” in the title ). You c an also find 
informati on about ADT  injections in the progress notes and in the Meds tab.  
 
 
 
ii. If the patient d oesn ’t have three ADT injections in the last year, just add the two most 
recent injections.  
iii. Refer to the p ro gress note template to see what  information shou ld be included and how  
the section should be formatted.  
1) At a minimum, the n ame of the m edication, dosage, location of injection  and date of 
administration should be included .  If you can include additional information about the 
medication  (expirat ion date  and Lot # ), include t hat in the note as well. If that information

a. Add date you assigned progress note to “Date HF/Note Assigned. ”  
b. Add comment in the “H F Note Comments ” AND “Notes ” fields. The “Notes” field is at the bo ttom 
of the page.  
i. The comment for COLUMBIA should  read:  “Progress note assi gned to Dr. [ name]  on [date]  by 
[your initials]  to WJB Research Notes  encounter. ” 
ii. The comment for PHOENI X should  read:  “Progress not e assigned to Dr. [ name]  on [date] by

Important Notes:  
 
1. *Check the database every  morning to determine if a progress note needs to be assigned for an 
appointment the followi ng day.  
 
2. If a note is m istaken ly assigned to the wrong provider, or for a patient who is ineligible, notify Jordan and 
Ted immediately.  
 
3. Provider transitions – If you need to  assign notes for eligible patients whose ADT prescriber is no longer in 
CPRS ( and there’s n o other indication of who patients will be meeting with for their upcoming 
appointment ), ask Site  Champion if they wish to ha ve those notes assigned  to them or transfer them to 
another provider on our list.  
 
4. **When select ing note from CPRS  “Pro gress Note Properties ” box, you wil l see two notes with the sa me 
title in the list. It’ s not a  duplica te note, it’s a quirk of C PRS that  displays  the note t wice.   It has to do with 
how more title s are created a nd that note  titles c an have a  print name  that is diff erent. Whenever we 
create a  note title, it creates 2 l ines in CPRS t hat make  it look t hat ther e are two  titles but there’s only t he 
one. You may sel ect e ither note with our title.  
 
5. Do not assi gn notes f or ADT  injection-only visits.   
 
6. Once you have assigned this unsigned progre ss note to an a uthor th at isn’t yourself,  only that pe rson will 
see this unsigned progress note in  CPRS. Notes signed by the author  will be visible to everyone in CP RS. 
 
7. If you try t o select a new p atient o r exit CPRS  with a n unsigne d note, it will p rompt yo u to see if you w ant to sign it 
or proceed and delete it.

 PILOT  RANDOM IZED  IMPLEMENT ATION  TRIAL  
TRIAL  SITE  SELECTI ON  
• We will update nat ional VA a nd Medicare data t o identify el igible sites for the  cRCT. 
• All VA sit es with hi gh rates of l ow-value ADT from 2020 – 2 022 will be c onsid ered eligible to particip ate in the 
study . 
• We will start with the 40 facilities  with the highest rates of low -value ADT and continue down the list as 
necessary. 
• We will exc lude site s requi ring translated materials (e.g., Puerto Rico) . 
• If feasible, we will exclude sites scheduled to transiti on to Cerner prior t o the end of the cRCT . 
• We will ra ndomize 4 VA faci lities with high r ates of low -value AD T use.   
TRIAL  SITE  RECRUITMEN T & RAND OMIZATION  
• The top 4 sites with high rates  of low-value  ADT use  and meeting above cri teria will be in vited to participate in 
the study. 
• All inv ited si tes that agree to participate w ill be included . 
• We expec t 80% partic ipation by eligible si tes. 
• If sites are unwil ling or unable to particip ate, we wil l continue do wn the list of sites until w e reach a maxi mum 
of 4 participatin g sites. 
• Study staff will sen d an email from  the study Co -PI to Urology Chiefs  to rec ruit as Site  Champion s. 
o If we a re unable t o cont act Urology C hiefs, or if we do not receive a response from th e Urolog y Chief 
after two  formal email contacts , we may reach out to  the Chief of Surgery , Chief of Med/Onc, or Chief 
of Rad/Onc (and c opy the ACO S/R) about s erving as S ite Cha mpio n. 
o If the Urology  Chief dec lines to serve as Site Cha mpion, we may ask if they have any suggestions f or an 
alternate  designee. 
o In the event  we are unable to recruit a Site Cham pion, all Site Champion  communications  will co me 
from the st udy team. 
• Once Site Cham pions have ob tained approva l from the MC D, each site will be  randomized to the Or or Sc arm. 
The Data Man ager will work  with our C onsultant, Dr. Shawna Sm ith on randomizing s ites.  
o Our current pl an will b e to stratify sites by ava ilability of Radiatio n Onco logy to ens ure there i s an even 
distribution of Radiation O ncology in  both intervention arms. We intend to randomize sites in blocks of 
2-4. 
• Once site C linical He alth Informati on Offic er has agreed to implementation t he intervent ion at th eir site, stu dy 
staff will apply for sit e CPRS access.  
o Note: O nce you h ave CPRS access for a site, set an Outlook re minder to log in to each site every 30 
days.  
TRIAL  OR/SC IMPLEM ENTATION   
• Implementation procedures will be simila r to those of the pilot but refined as needed based on pilot outc omes 
and need s specifi c to trial site implementa tion. 
• Intervent ions wi ll be impl emented f or up to 12 mon ths at each site. 
• Study s taff will apply for C PRS access at each site once we receive approva l from  either the Medical  Center 
Director or Site Champ ion.  
• Baseline AD T Pr escribing Meetings  – these meetings with Site Champio ns or th eir designees will n ot be 
mandato ry for the RC T. We will move forward wi th our trial imple mentation even if we ha ven’t  collec ted 
information regard ing the ADT ordering proces s.  
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 47 of 88   
 • Implementatio n Ed ucation Session (IES)  – to mak e schedul ing easier on the st udy team,  we may imple ment  
one IES per site ins tead of ea ch department. We will move forward  with implementing the interventions after 
scheduled IES ’s, even if they have been c ancelled.  
• There is a  possibility tha t patients w ill receive  ADT injection s mo re than once du ring t he intervention perio d. If 
this is the  case,  then the intervention will b e triggered more than o nce for the sa me pat ient.  
TRIAL  DATA COLL ECTI ON  
• Data source s for o ur primary , implem entation and seconda ry fidelity outcomes will be refined during the pilot.  
Data col lection and outcomes  analyses  plan will also be furt her developed during the pilot.  
• We will likely  asse ss Or fidelity using informa tics data generated thro ugh the ordering process.  
• We will use cha rt review  to identify Sc docume ntation in th e EMR, in addition  to other inform atics approaches. 
• We will match ou r 4 intervention sites with up to 8 control sites wit h comparable departments and numbers of 
patients.  We will complete chart reviews for control sites twice. T he first review wi ll look at  ADT injections at the 
start of the intervention for the matching intervention site(s)  to confirm whether patients w ould have been 
eligible at the intervention launch sit e we are not looking after the date the interventio n start ed. The second  
review will occur again at the end of the 6 -month interve ntion period for the matching  intervention site.    
• Providers and Site Champion s at participating f acilities will be as ked to comple te an onymous assessments in 
Qualtrics  at baseline and 1-mont h post -intervention .  
• We will e xami ne relationshi ps between sur vey a nd tr ial outcomes in e xplor atory analyses to assist with 
unders tandin g the generalizability o f our fi ndings.  
 
     TRIAL  CLINIC  AND ADT PROVID ER ASSESS MENT S  
• We will obtain natio nal Union r eview for conducti ng assessme nts. For the  cRCT, Site Champi ons a nd provide rs 
will be in vited to complete the survey s (Appendix  VI). The Ann Arbo r Study Te am will revis e the survey  as 
needed  based on pi loting feedback and outcome s.  
 
The Site Cha m pion Clinic As sessm ent  
We w ill adminis ter surveys  to our Site Champi ons upon MCD ap proval . Survey data will b e collect ed 
anonymously vi a VA Qualtrics. The survey includes questions about A DT ordering and cli nic practic es; the 
survey s hould take abou t 5 minutes to complet e.   
o We will ask S ite Champions to co mplete a survey at baseline. The exac t timin g of the surv ey will be 
decided during the pilot testing period .  
 
The ADT P rov ider Assessme nt  
We will administer  surveys  at basel ine and 1-mo nth post-i ntervent ion period  to ADT  prescrib ers. S urvey  data 
will be col lected anonymo usly via  VA Qu altric s. The survey includ es questions about ADT ordering  and clinic 
practices; the survey should take abou t 5 minutes to compl ete.   
o Baseline survey  - we w ill ask provide rs to complete the baseline s urvey during the IES ’s. Providers 
will be abl e to access  the survey b y sca nning a QR co de on their phone (co de will be availab le in the 
IES PPT), or via a link t he study te am will ent er in the Zoom meeting chat.  
o 1-Month post-intervention survey – at the end of the i nterventio n perio d, we wi ll email provi ders 
with a link to the follow u p Qualtrics survey.

Dear << Insert Medic al Ce nter Direc tor nam e>>, 
 
The p urpose of this ema il is to re quest  your support for participation i n a rese arch proj ect funded by the NI H 
National Cancer Institute and coor dinated b y the VA An n Arbor Healthcare System .  The overall ob jective o f this 
project, e ntitled “Li ving W ell with Pr ostate Cancer”, is to encoura ge de- implementation of l ow-value Andr ogen 
Deprivation Ther apy (ADT) in a w ay that is accepta ble to the clinici ans treat ing these p atients.   Low-value ADT ( not 
supported by  guidelines) includes prima ry treatme nt for localized p rostate cancer and non-metast atic biochemi cally 
recurr ent prostate cancer w ith low P SA levels.  I will b e acting as  site champion, helping t o support the A nn Ar bor VA 
study team by gett ing them in touc h with the  appropriate  clinic staff a t our s ite.   
 
The g oal of this proj ect is to  pilot <<insert  for NY Harb or and WLA: o ne of>> two tools  to supp ort provider s in potent ial 
de-implementation of low -value care.   Our partici pation will last f or 6 months. At  the << insert site  name>> V A we will b e 
piloting  an ADT o rder-check (only  triggered when orders m eet criteria for low -value care.)  <<insert  for Ann Arbor: 
Additionally, we will p ilot a CPRS note templat e for cl inic vis its m eeting criteria f or low- value c are. The not e includes 
talking points f or the provider to  help with a de-implementat ion dis cussion with the Vet eran. It can be edited and 
acknowledged by the pro vider, giving a qui ck and simple way  to doc ument a discussi on. Handouts for patients about 
ADT use will be supplied for  providers to u se at t heir discre tion.>>  
 
Piloting  these tailored de -imple mentation st rategi es will allow t he study team  to tes t acceptab ility, feasibility , and 
scalability  for a su bseque nt randomized  controlled trial  to determine wh ich de -implementation strategy  is mos t effec tive 
in reducing low-value AD T use. 
 
Provider s are no t required t o change thei r prescr ibing habits and will still b e able to order ADT.  We will simply  be 
provi ding a light-touch intervention to e ncourage provide rs to follow standard of care and provide a quic k and eas y 
mechanis m for d ocumenti ng treatment decisions. << insert for Ann Arbor : Providers  are not required to  use the CPRS 
note template, it can be edit ed/signed, delet ed, or ignored. The  Ann Arbor  study te am will de lete any unsigned ve rsions 
of the template at  the en d of the st udy perio d.>> 
 
The VA An n Arbor IRB h as determined that o ur projec t meets federal crit eria for exempt minimal risk researc h under  
categor ies 2  (survey  procedures), 3 (benign behav ioral interven tions), and 4 (secondary research) .  I do not  believe our  
VA to  be engaged  in research for  the foll owing reasons : 
• The [ site] VA will not b e interveni ng or interactin g with research subj ects fo r resear ch pu rposes, including obtainin g 
informed cons ent. 
• The [ site] V A will not have access to s tudy data. 
• Please note that Th e Office  for Human Researc h Protect ions (OHRP) s tipulate s that permit ting investigators f rom 
another institution to use y our fac ility to  conduct  research does not con stitute  engageme nt. 
(https://www. hhs.gov/ohr p/regulat ions-and-policy/guidance/guidance- on-engageme nt-of-institut ions/index.html ). 
 
Therefore , we do n ot believe there is a need for  local RDC/IRB  approval. Howeve r, I think t his study  will be of val ue to 
our si te and I hope you will support  this effort.   
 Please reply  to thi s email to confirm your sup port, or  to let me know if you have an y concerns.   If you would like 
additional information  on the  project, t he intervention, or the inf ormed c onsent p rocedures that the Ann Arbor team  will

This is for notificat ion only.  
 Pleas e see below and attached,  we will b e piloting a study here focused on limiting lo w-value AD T using a CPRS order

This email is to  let you k now that our  VA will be par ticipat ing in a pr oject funded by the NIH Nat ional C ancer Institute and 
coordinated b y the VA  Ann Arbor He althcare System.  The overal l objective of this project, e ntitled, “Living Well with 
Prostate Canc er,” is to encou rage de -implementation of low -value A ndrogen Deprivatio n Ther apy (ADT) in  a way that  is 
acceptabl e to the cli nicians that treat th ese patients.  Low-value ADT ( not support ed by  guidelines) includes prima ry 
treatment for localized prostate can cer and non- metastatic bi ochemical re currence  with lo w PSA leve ls. I will be  acting as 
site champio n, helping to  support the Ann Arbor VA  study t eam by ge tting them in touch with the appropr iate clinic staff at  
our site.   
 
Goals of t
his project include:  
1. Provide education to provi ders on the benefits  vs. ha rms of ADT as prim ary treatment for prostate cancer and non-
metastatic bi ochemical recurrence . 
2. Provide a tool in CPRS to s upport providers  in potential de- implemen tation of low-valu e car e. The tools have  been 
informed by qualitat ive intervie ws of VA  providers who  prescribe ADT and discrete c hoice experiment s with V A 
urologists . Our site will receive:  
• An ADT o rder-check (only  triggered for V eterans meeting crit eria for low-value c are). 
3. To pilot tailored de- implementation strategies (including an orde r check) for accep tabilit y, feasibility, an d 
scalabi lity. 
4. To determine which of  two de- imple mentation strateg ies (an order check or a CPRS  note template) is most 
effective in reduc ing low-value ADT use.  
 
An exam ple of the propo sed de- implementation tool (order ch eck) is attached. Providers are not r equired to change their  
prescribing habits and w ill still be able to order ADT. We ar e simply providing a tool to encoura ge ev idence- based ca re, 
and to provide a quic k and easy mechan ism to do cument if there is a  reason 1) they ar e deviati ng from guidelin es 
(example  – patient pr eference/anx iety), or 2) that they are fol lowing guid elines (t hat this is not in fact low -value ca re). 
 If you have any c oncer ns or would like a dditional infor mation, pl ease do not hesitate  to ask . You c an also rea ch the Ann

This email is to le t you know t hat our VA wi ll be pa rticipating i n a pro ject funde d by the N IH Na tional Canc er Instit ute an d 
coordinated by the VA Ann Arbor Healt hcare System. The overall objective of  this pr oject, entitle d “Living W ell with 
Prostate Cancer”, is to encourage de-implemen tation of low -value A ndrogen D eprivation Therapy ( ADT) in a way th at is 
acceptable to t he cl inicians treat ing these patients. Low -value ADT (not sup ported by  guidelines)  includes prima ry 
treatmen t for l ocalized pro state cancer and non-m etastati c biochemical ly rec urrent  prostat e cancer with low PSA levels.  I 
will be actin g as site champion, helpin g to support t he Ann A rbor VA study tea m by getting them in touch with the 
appropriat e clinic staff at our sit e.   
 The goal of  
this proj ect is to pilot  one or two tools t o support prov iders who prescri be ADT (e.g. , urologi sts, me dical 
oncol ogists, an d rad iation oncologist s) in potential de- implementation of l ow-value c are. Our par ticipati on will last up to 6 
months . We will be pil oting an ADT ord er-check  (only trigge red when orders meet  criteria  for low-value care. ) Additionally, 
the Ann Arb or VA will be pi loting a CPRS  note te mplate for clinic  visits meeting criteria f or low -value care. T he note  
includ es talking points  for the provider to help with a de -implementati on discussion with th e Veteran . It can be edited an d 
acknow ledged by the provider, giving a qui ck and  simple way t o document a disc ussion. Handouts  for patien ts about AD T 
use wi ll be s upplied for provid ers to use a t thei r discret ion. 
 
Providers  are not required to change their  prescribing habi ts and will sti ll be able to  order A DT. We will simply be 
providing a light-touch intervention to encourage p roviders t o follow sta ndard of  care a nd prov ide a quick  and ea sy 
mechanis m for doc umentin g treatm ent decisions. Providers are not required to use the CPRS note  template, it can be 
edited/signed, deleted, or ign ored.  The Ann  Arbor study team  will delete any  unsigned versions of the template at  the end 
of the st udy pe riod. 
 
A Res earch Inf ormatio n Sheet about the st udy will be e mailed t o providers; this email will i nclude t he option to op t-out of 
the study.  An impl ementati on education session w ill also be offe red to pro viders to inform the m of th e study  and give 
them an  oppor tunity  to ask q uestion s.  
 
I think
 this st udy will be o f value to our site and I  hope you wi ll suppor t this effort.   
 An exampl e of th e proposed order chec k is attached and will only be tr iggered for low-value ADT orders . <<Insert for A nn

entitled “Living Well wit h Prostate Cancer”, i s to encourage de -impleme ntation of low -value A ndrogen Depri vatio n 
Therap y (AD T) in a way  that is acc eptabl e to th e clinicians  treating these patients.  Low -value ADT (not suppo rted by 
guidelines ) includes primar y treat ment for  localiz ed prostate cancer and non-metastatic biochemi cally recurrent 
prosta te canc er.   
 This projec t involve s piloting light-touch i nterventi ons supporting evidence -based car e that have b een tai lored to work 
within  your site’s existing wor kflow. The foll owing  will b e implemented at y our site on << insert imp lementation da te>>.  
The inter venti on wi ll be i n effect for six mo nths.  
 
• An ADT order-check which is  only trigger ed when o rders me et criteria  for low -value car e. You can still order 
ADT,  but you will b e ask ed to add the indication  in a text field b efore p roceeding.  
• <<Insert fo r Ann A rbor and Palo Alto : A CP RS note tem plate for  clinic visits m eeting criteria for low -value car e.  
The note includes talking  points to help with a de- implementation di scussion with the Veteran.  You can edit 
and acknowledg e the not e, giving a quick wa y to do cument  the discussi on. It can also be deleted o r ignored. If  
it is ignored, it will b e deleted by the Ann Arbo r study team  at the e nd of the study.>>  
 
You are  n

Good morning  <<insert name of site CH IO and site CAC( s)>>, 
 
We are working on a pro ject wit h Dr( s). <<insert  name( s) of site champion and other t eam m embers/leadership who hav e 
committ ed to pr oject>> to try to re duce low-va lue use of Androgen Depri vation Therapy (ADT)  such as leuprolide and  
goserelin (Lupron/ Zolodex/Eligard/Viadur). Low -value use inc ludes  prescri bing for  localiz ed prostate canc er and non-
metastatic  biochemical recurrence, where  it is not supported  by guidelines in most instances.  A DT does , howeve r, have 
significant side eff ects. 
 
We hope to d ecrease use of low -value ADT (or lear n why  it is still being prescribed i n these cases) by imple menting an 
order check. The goal i s to not ify the provider tha t they ma y want to consider stopping ADT, a nd to provide a 
quick/convenient mec hanism to document  why ADT is being pres cribed.  Attach ed is an ex ample of how we have 
imple mented thi s in Ann Arbo r with instr uctions  from our phar macy CAC . This can be complet ed within 15 min utes. To 
minimize th e burden to pro vider s, we o nly want the order che ck to be tri ggered for  Veterans who are getting l ow-value 
ADT. So w e are also hoping you will se t up a health factor for “LIVING WELL ADT”.  A  member o f the Ann Arbor proj ect 
team with ac cess to CPRS at your  site wil l comp lete thi s health factor for Ve terans meeting t he criteri a.  
 
We woul d
 like to talk w ith you to see if  the A nn Arbor exam ple is a good way to ac complish our  goals at your 
site, or if the re is a dif ferent way th at ma y bette r fit the current wo rkflow at your site. We are also hoping to le arn

• Are there currently a ny order c hecks/cover s heets/etc. for ordering A DT? 
• Is it reasonable for you  to implem ent this at the  <<insert name of si te>> VA ? 
o If yes, how  much notice do you need prior to the dat e we would  like the new note t emplate  to go

Dear << Insert Med ical Center Director na me>>, 
The purpose of th is em ail is to request  your support f or partici pation i n a research projec t funded by the NIH 
National  Cancer  Institute  and coordi nated by the VA Ann Arbor  Healthcare System. The overall objectiv e of this 
project, entitled “Living Well with Pr ostat e Cancer ”, is to support decreased use of low-value Andr ogen Depri vation 
Therapy ( ADT) in a  way that is acceptable to  the clinicia ns treat ing these patients. Low-value ADT (not s upported  by 
guidelines) i ncludes p rimary  treatment for localize d prostate  canc er and non- metastatic biochemi cally re current  
prostate cancer w ith low PSA levels.  I will b e acting as site champion,  helping to s upport t he Ann Ar bor VA study team 
by getting them in  touch with the appr opriat e clinic staff at our site.  
 
The g oal of t his p roject is to test one of two tools to support  providers  in decr easing low-value car e. Our participation  
will last for up to 12 months. At our site we will be testing < <insert for  Or site: an ADT  order -check (o nly triggered when 
orders meet cr iteria for  low-value care.)>> or <<insert fo r SC sit e:  a CPRS note te mplate for clinic v isits m eeting

with t he Veteran. It can be edit ed and s igned by the provi der, giving a quick and simple way to docu ment a disc ussion. 
Handout s for pat ients about AD T use will b e supplied for provid ers to us e at their discretio n.>> 
 
Testi ng th
ese strateg ies will allow the study  team to determine which  strategy  is most effective in reducing low -value 
ADT use.  
 
Providers are not  requi red to change t heir pr escribing habi ts and will still be able  to orde r ADT. We will s imply be 
providing a lig ht-touch interve ntion to encour age provi ders to follow standard of  care and pro vide a quick and eas y 
mechani sm for document ing treatme nt decisions. <<ins ert for Sc sites: Providers  are not required  to use the CPRS  
note templa te, it can be edited/sig ned, deleted , or ignored.  The Ann Arbo r study  team will delete  any unsi gned 
versi ons o f the template at  the end of the study perio d.>> 
 
The V A Ann A rbor IRB has  determ ined that  our project meets federal  criteria for  exempt minimal r isk research under 
categories  2 (survey  procedures),  3 (benign  behavioral  interventions),  and 4 (secondar y resear ch). I do not believe our 
VA to be  engaged in resear ch for the following reaso ns: 
• Our VA will not be intervening or interactin g with rese arch subje cts for research purposes,  includin g 
obtaining informed con sent. 
• Our VA will not have  acces s to study  data 
• Please note that The Office for Huma n Resea rch Protect ions (O HRP)  stipul ates tha t permit ting investigat ors 
from another institut ion to use your f acility  to conduct r esea rch does not  constitute engagement 
(https: //www.hh s.gov/ohrp/regulations -and-policy/guidance/guidance- on-engagement- of-institut ions/index.html ). 
 
Therefore,  we do not believe there is a need for local RDC/IRB  approval.  Howe ver, I think this study will be of value to 
our site an d I hope you will s upport t his effort.  
 
Please reply  to this email  to confi rm your  support,  or to let me know if you have a ny concerns.  If you would like 
additional information on  the proje ct, the interventi on, or the informed consent procedures that the A nn Arbor team will 
follow when contacting our staff, p lease do not hesitate to ask m e. You can also reac h the Ann A rbor study team at

Dear  <<Insert  Pharmacy  Chief  name >>, 
This is  for notifi cation only. 
Please see below and attached,  we will be testin g an order check  here focused  on limiting low-value ADT use.  
Please let me know  if you have any ques tions. 
Thank you,  
<<Inse rt site champion  signat ure line, including contact  informat ion>>  
 
 
This email  is to let you know  that ou r VA will be pa rticipating in a project funded by the NIH  Nation al Cancer Ins titute 
and coordi nated  by the VA Ann Arbor Healthca re System . The overall obj ective of this proje ct, entitled, “Living Well 
with Prost ate Cancer, ” is to support decreased us e of low-value  Androgen  Deprivation Therapy  (ADT) in a way that  is 
acceptable to the clinician s tha t treat these patien ts. Low-value A DT (not supported by gui delines) includes prim ary 
treatment for loc alized pr ostate cancer and non- metastatic biochemical  recurr ence with low PSA levels. I will be acting 
as sit e champion, h elping to suppor t the Ann A rbor VA study team by get ting them in touch with the appropriate clinic 
staff at our s ite. 
 
Goal s of t
his project  include:  
1. Provide education  to provider s on the benefi ts vs. harms  of ADT as prima ry treatment  for prostate cancer  and 
non-metastati c biochemic al recurrence.  
2. Provide a tool in CPRS to supp ort providers  in potential de-implementat ion of low-value care. The tools  have  
been informed by qualitative interview s of V A providers who prescribe  ADT and discrete choic e experiments  
with VA urologi sts. Our si te wil l receive:  
• An ADT order-check (only triggered for Veterans  meeting criteria  for low-value care).  
3. To de termine  which  of two de-implement ation strat egies  (an order  check or a CPRS  note templa te) is most 
effective  in reduc ing low-value ADT us e. 
 
An example o f the proposed de- implement ation tool ( order check) is atta ched. Providers are not required to change 
their prescribin g habits and will still be able to or der ADT . We are sim ply providing a tool to encourage evi dence- based 
care, and to provide a quick  and e asy mechanism  to docume nt if there is a reason 1) they are deviating from guidel ines 
(exam ple – patie nt prefer ence/anxiety), or 2) that  they are following  guidel ines (that t his is not in fa ct low -value care).  
 
If you h ave any concerns  or would like addit ional information,  please do not hesita te to ask. You can also reach  the 
Ann Arbor study team at VHAANNLivin gWell @va.gov.

Dear <<Insert name  of site Chief of Urology/Ch ief of Medical  Oncology/Chief  of Radia tion Oncology>>, 
This is for n otifica tion only.  
Please see below and attac hed, we will be leading a study  here focused  on limitin g low-value ADT use. I am a Site 
Cham pion for the s tudy and excited t o launch it here. 
 
With your cooperation,  our team  would  like to coordinate a b rief, 10-minute  introduction to the study  with your 
providers. We w ill reach out in the coming weeks  to sc hedule. 
 
Thank  you,

This email is to l et yo u know that our VA will b e partici pating in a p roject funded by the NIH Nat ional Cancer Institute 
and coordinated  by the VA Ann Arbor  Healthcare System . The overal l objective of this project,  entitle d “Living  Well with 
Prostate Cancer ,” is to support  decreased use of low-value Androgen Dep rivatio n Therapy (ADT) in a way that is 
acceptable to the clinicia ns treating these patients. Low -value ADT (not supported by gui delines) i ncludes primary 
treatment  for localized prostate canc er an d non- metastatic  biochemi cally recurr ent prostate cancer wi th low  PSA 
levels . I will b e acti ng as  site champion,  helping to support the Ann Arbor VA study t eam by getting them  in touch wi th 
the appr opriate clinic st aff at our site.  
 
The go al of this p rojec t is to test  one of two tools to supp ort providers w ho prescribe ADT  (e.g., urologi sts, med ical 
oncologist s, and radiat ion oncologists)  in potential  de-implementatio n of low-value ca re. Our participation will last 9-12 
months.  We will be  testing <<insert for Or site: an ADT or der-check ( only triggered when orders  meet crit eria for low-
value care .)>> or <<inser t for SC site :  a CPRS no te template for clinic  visits meet ing criteria for  low-value care.  The 
note includes t alking points f or the provider to help with a de -imple mentat ion discussion with the V eteran . It can be 
edited and signed by the pr ovider, giving a quick and s imple way to  document a discussion. Handouts for patients 
about A DT use w ill be supplied for pr oviders to use at their  discretion.>> 
    
Provi
ders are n ot required to c hange their pr escrib ing habi ts and w ill still be able to order A DT. We will simply be 
providing a l ight-touch intervention to encourag e providers to follow sta ndard of care and provi de a quick a nd eas y 
mechanism  for documenting  treatment  decisions. <<inser t for Sc site:  Providers  are not required  to use the CPRS  note 
template,  it can be edited/signed, deleted, or ignored. The Ann Arbor study team will delete any  unsig ned versio ns of 
the template at the  end of the s tudy period. >> 
 
A Research  Information Sheet abo ut the st udy wi ll be em ailed to  provid ers; thi s email will include the option to opt -out 
of the study.  An implementati on educati on session will a lso be offered to providers  to inform them  of the study  and g ive 
them an opportunity to a sk questi ons. 
 
I think this study will be of value to our site and I hope you will support  this effort.  
 
<<insert  for Or site: An example of  the proposed order check is attached and will only be trigger ed for lo w-value ADT  
order s. <<Insert for Sc site:  An exampl e of the CPRS n ote template and the pat ient handout  are attached. >> If you

Subject : Help us st op low-va lue AD T by servin g as Site Champion for the “Living W ell with Pros tate Canc er” study  
Attachments:  AA IRB Exemption Approval  Letter  
 
Dear Dr. <<Insert name >>, 
 
I’m writing to re quest your parti cipation as Site Cham pion for a study that aims to decrease the  use of  low-value 
androgen deprivation therapy (A DT). Our targets of low- value ADT in clude primary  treatment  for prostate cancer and  
non-metasta tic biochemically r ecurrent prostate ca ncer. I be lieve that stopping or s caling back  low-value ADT use i s 
an integral s tep in  improving prostate cancer care qual ity. Therefore, I am leading a NIH N ational Cancer Ins titute 
funded trial to test tw o intervent ions to decrease low-va lue ADT fo r pros tate cancer in a way that supports  clinic ians.  
 
Given its significa nt long-term effec ts on  cardiovascular,  sexual, and bo ne heal th, ADT should only be used w hen 
there is evidence i ts benefits outweigh its  side effect s. As you know, the use of ADT fo r loca lized pros tate cancer and 
non-m etastatic biochemica lly recurrent disease goes aga inst the s tandard of care guidelines publ ished b y the 
Ameri can Urolog ical Ass ociation and Natio nal Comprehensive Cancer Network. Our goal is  to help the medi cal 
professi on foc us on incr easing the use of standard  of care and de crease harms  to pat ients. Yo ur service a s Site 
Champion will help your site re duce low-value ADT an d contin ue to support  the missi on of the VHA .  
 
We under
stand that wi th competing  demands,  time is p reciou s. This st udy wi ll be conducted from Ann Arbo r, whi ch 
means we will im plement the study intervention and manage regulatory appr ovals . I’m asking you to act as  Site 
Champion to help support the A nn Arbor VA study team by g etting the m in to uch with the appropri ate cli nic 
staff at your sit e, and to help assur e the interv ention is tailor ed to fit we ll with your sit e’s existing workflo w. 
 Participating site s will be  randomized t o one  of two interventions:  
 
1) ADT Or der Check Arm : Providers will see an order check w hen placin g an order for ADT as  notification that 
the Veteran m ay not be getting guideline -concordant care.   Providers may cont inue wi th the order by  selecting 
a reason fo r con tinuing. The order  check will be triggered only for Veterans  identi fied by  the A nn Arbor s tudy 
team as potentially  getting low-value ADT. Cases  that are not clear will be dec ided upon by a multidisciplinary 
team in cluding a urologist,  a medical oncologist,  and a radiation oncologist.  
 
2) Provider Scri pt Arm: Providers  will be assigned a progress n ote in CPRS just ahead of a Vet eran’s vis it only 
when V eteran h as been i dentified by the Ann Arbor study team as potent ially getting low -value ADT. This note 
can be used b y the provider as a quick  way to docum ent either the indi cation for prescribin g ADT o r the 
decision to stop A DT. The  note can al so be ignore d or del eted.  A patient h ando ut “Living w ell with prostate 
cancer – is hormone ther apy still right for you?” t o sup port providers in these discussions will be linked in t he 
note template.  
 If you are  int
erested in serving as a Site Ch ampion, I will ask  that you work w ith the Ann Arbor project team 
to: 
1) Notify your f acility ’s Leadership t eam a bout the study (e mail templ ates will be provided)  
2) Promote the study  among your depar tment’s clin icians  (email te mplates will be provi ded) 
3) Assist in  the s cheduling of  an educat ion se ssion w ith providers and staff involved with prescribin g of ADT  
4) Provid e a list  of clinician s and staff involved wi th prescribi ng of ADT so that the project team may reach out to 
them as n eeded 
5) Consider taking a  brief survey regar ding ADT p ractices at your site 
 
This study is operationalized in such a w ay to avoid res earch “e ngagemen t” by VA pers onnel  at your site. All study 
activities will be p erformed by Ann  Arbor VA stud y staf f under AA VA RDC oversight. No l ocal VA p ersonnel w ill have 
access to identifiab le data. As  such, we feel t hat no local oversight is necessary . Please see the a ttached memo fro m 
the A AVA RDC and  let us kn ow if you would l ike to discuss further. 
 
Please rep ly to this  email if you have any q uestions ab out the research project, or to let  us know your interest 
in acting as Site Champi on. If you agree to participate , we will sen d you a site engagement  packet with additional 
information about the study. If we do not h ear fr om you, we will try to reach out  to you by  phone  or Microsoft Teams. 
Thank you f or your consider ation!

Good morning << insert nam e of site CHI O and si te CAC( s)>>, 
We are working  on a project w ith Dr( s). <<insert name(s) of si te cha mpion >> to t ry to reduce low -value use of 
Androgen D eprivat ion Therapy (ADT)  such as leuprolide and gos erelin ( Lupron/Zolo dex/Eligard/Viad ur). Low -value 
use inc ludes prescribing for localized prostat e cancer  and non- metastat ic biochem ical recurrence,  where it is not 
supported  by guidelines  in most instances . ADT does, however, hav e sig nificant side effects.  
 
We hope to decrease use of low-va lue ADT (or learn why it is still being prescribed in these  case s) by implementi ng 
one of two i ntervent ions. Your site will test <<insert for Or s ite: an ADT order check .>> or <<insert for Sc s ite: a

notify the provider tha t they may wan t to consid er stopping ADT, and to provide a quick/convenient mechanism to 
document why ADT is being prescribed.   
 
<< Inser t fo

Subject : Request for your participation in study “Living Well with Prostate Cancer” 
Dear <<Insert  provider name>>, 
Your site is one o f~20 VA si tes par ticipating i n a researc h project fun ded by the NIH National  Cancer  
Institute  and coordinated by the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare  System . The overa ll objective  of this project,  entitled 
“Living W ell with Prost ate Cancer ”, is to su pport decreased u se of  low-value Androgen Deprivati on Therapy (ADT)  
in a way that is acceptable to the clinicians  treating these p atients.  Low-value ADT (not supported by gu idelines) 
includes primary tr eatment for loc alized pros tate ca ncer and non- metastat ic biochemic ally recurrent prostate  
cancer.  
 
This project  involves  light-touch intervent ions suppor ting evidence- based care t hat have been tailored to work 
within your site’s  existing  workflow. The following  will be implemented  at your site on <<insert impleme ntation  
date>>. The i nterventio n will b e in eff ect for up to 12 months.  
 
• <<insert for Or site: An  ADT order-check  which  is only triggered  when orders meet criteria for low-value 
care. You can still order  ADT, but yo u will b e asked to add the in dication  in a text f ield before 
proceeding. >> 
• <<Ins ert for Sc site: A CPRS  note template for clinic visits  meeting criteria  for low-value  care. The  note 
includes tal king point s to hel p with a de- implementation discussi on with  the Veteran . You can e dit and 
acknowle dge the note, giving a quick way to document the discussio n. It can also be deleted or ignored.  If it 
is ignored, it will be deleted by the Ann Arbor study team at the  end of the study .>> 
 
You are not requir ed to change your  prescribing hab its and will still be able to o rder ADT.  We will si mply be providing 
a tool to encourage evidence- based care.  Pati ents are not being enrolled int o this st udy, so there is no need for  a 
consent form. As a provider, you do not need to  do anything to participate.  H owever, you can opt -out of this s tudy if  
you do not  wish to  participate.

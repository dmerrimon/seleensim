06 Jul 2017  Amendment 05  
 Global:  Revised protocol to include enrollment of subjects with intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) .  Rationale:  new article by Yoo et. al. (2017) shows 
that ICC has genomic alterations in FGF19 that are very similar to HCC and FGF19/FGFR4 could also potentially play a critical role in ICC. 
 List of Abbreviations:  Updated to reflect changes to protocol  (addition of ICC).  
 Section 5.3:  Removed sentence “Subjects will be required to provide separate 
informed consent for the collection of samples for pharmacogenomics (PG); see Section 9.5.1.3.4.”; in Section 9.5.1.3.4:  Removed portion of sentence stating 
that PG samples are collected “fro m all subjects who provide consent to have

H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 8 of 126 
 such samples collected.”  Rationale:   subjects are consented for PG sample 
collection in the main ICF (no separate ICF required).  
 Sections 7.2, 9.1, 9.1.1.3, 9.2, 9.4.4.3, Table 8, and Synopsis:  clarified that the 
food effect cohort will be comprised of the first 12 HCC subjects enrolled in 
dose expansion.   Rationale:  food effect may be different for ICC subjects 
compared with HCC subjects.  
 Section 9.1.1.1 and Synopsis:  revised protocol to allow for intrapatient dose 
escalation during dose escalation.  Rationale:  The possibility of intrapatient 
dose escalation theoretically reduces the number of subjects who are treated at 
sub-therapeutic doses.  Permitting intrapatient dose escalation gives some 
subjects the opportunity to be treated at higher and presumably more effective 
doses.  
 Section 9.1.1.1 and Synopsis:  revised protocol to clarify that once the 
MTD/RP2D is reached, at least 6 HCC subjects must be enrolled at the RP2D (regardless of the total number of subjects enrolled at that dose level) in order to 
proceed with dose expansion.  As subjects with ICC may have a better 
tolerability than subjects with HCC, the SRC may decide to continue dose 
escalation for ICC subjects after the RP2D has been established for HCC 
subjects. 
 Table 2 and Synopsis:  Revised DLT definition to include subjects with CTCAE 
Grade 3 anemia if transfused or if lasting for more than 7 days, or CTCAE  
Grade 4 anemia of any duration, per Taiwan health authority request.  
 Table 2 and Synopsis:   Revised DLT definition to clarify that for subjects with a 
starting ALT within the normal range for the local laboratory, an elevation ALT 
≥ 5 × ULN for the local laboratory will be considered a DLT; for subjects with 
an abnormal value ≥ ULN at baseline based on the local laboratory ranges, an 
ALT elevation ≥ 10  × ULN for the local laboratory will be considered a DLT, 
per Taiwan health authority request.  
 Section 9.3.1 and Synopsis:  Revised inclusion criteria # 3, 4, and 8 per changes 
to included population and RECIST 1.1.  
 Section 9.3.2 and Synopsis:  Added  clarifications to exclusion criteria # 22 , 23, 
24, 25, and 26.  
 Section 9.4.3.4:  Updated study drug storage conditions to clarify that study drug should be stored refrigerated at 2 -8°C at the study center due to availability 
of stability data for refrigerated conditions. 
 Section 9.4.8.1:  added systemic corticosteroids to prohibited medications and 
clarification of systemic corticosteroid washout period . 
 Section 9.4.8.2 and Synopsis:  Added minor language clarifications to 
management of hyperphosphatemia or hypercalcemia section . 
 Section 9.5.1.3.3, Synopsis, Table 7, and Table 8:   Clarified that tumor biopsy 
samples should not be formalin fixed paraffin embedded, for consistency with collection instructions in the lab manual.

C1D8 does not apply to the PK sampling (administrative change).  
 List of References:  added new references:  Sia, et al, 2013, Churi, et al., 2014, 
and Yoo, et al., 2017  to support inclusion of ICC subjects. 
 Added Appendix 2, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (Subjects  
with ICC); renumbered subsequent appendices accordingly 
22 Feb 2018  Amendment 06  
Global edits applied to conform with Eisai Writing Style Guide line (eg, parallel 
structure of bulleted lists, P value, capitalization and spacing).  
Section 7.2:  Edited to remove reference to the food -effect portion of the study, 
which will no longer be included in the current study .  The effect of food on the 
bioavailability of H3B -6527 will be assessed in a separate, concurrent  clinical 
study, H3B -6527-A001 -001:  A Randomized Phase 1 Food -Effect Study of 
H3B -6527 in Healthy Subjects .  Conditional language has been added to 
indicate that subjects may be asked to take study drug in conjunction with a 
meal depending on study results  from this Healthy Volunteer Food Effect 
(HVFE) study . 
 Section 8.2:  Removed the objective to determine whether a high-fat meal had 
any effect on bioavailability since sufficient data will be obtained from HVFE study  to support administration with or without food in the current study . 
 Section 9.1:  Edits to clarify the dose schedules and sample size for the dose 
escalation and expansion portions of the study and to allow simultaneous 
exploration of QD and BID dosing schedules.  
 Figure 1:  Add this study diagram to clarify the overall s tudy design between 
Parts 1 and 2 of the study, including the number of subjects planned for enrollment. 
 Section 9.1.1.1:   Added a statement to further clarify that the selection of the 
RP2D will be based on an integrated evaluation of safety and tolerab ility, as 
well as PD and PK data to allow flexibility in study design and dosing schedule.  
Added a statement to clarify that subjects who experience a dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT) or dose -modifying event  (an adverse event that meet the criteria 
for a DLT b ut occurring after Cycle 1 ) have the option for resuming treatment at 
a reduced dose following resolution of the event and joint consultation between 
the investigator and the Sponsor as to what is in the best clinical interest of the subject  as previously  outlined in Section 9.4.2 .  
 Table 1:  Revised the table footnote to include potential for a BID dose schedule and to allow greater flexibility with BID dose schedule or alternate dosing 
options.   Revised the table to reflect the total daily dose amounts so as to 
include the BID dose schedule.  
 Table 2 :  Updated table caption (this was Table 2) . Minor correction to the CTC 
AE Grade 3 bilirubin to specify that it must be >3 × ULN (not ≥ 3 × ULN)  to 
align with CTCAE v4.03 .

  Section 9.1.1.2:  Expanded this section to include additional study design details 
regarding the QD and BID dose schedules and to discuss the overall number of 
subjects to be recruited for this part of the study . 
 Section 9.1.1.3:  Deleted this section since the food effect cohort will no longer be applicable for this study.  
 Section 9.2:  Added additional information about food recommendations for the 
study.  If study drug plasma exposure is found to be increased with food (based 
on the HVFE study), this section included a few details about how study drug 
would be administered with food, including details  about  fasting for PK/PD 
testing prior to study drug administration.   This text helps to clarify important 
criteria if study drug administration is to occur in conjunction with a meal.   
 Section 9.3:  Revised the total number of subject s to be enrolled in the study 
based upon changes to the study design for Parts 1 and 2.  
 Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2 General:  Edits  to reflect parallel construction to adhere 
to the Eisai Writing Style Guide. 
 Section 9.3.1 #3:  Revised this bullet to allow for noninvasive diagnosis of HCC 
and to further clarify criteria to be used .   
Also added a sub -bullet to clarify that eligible subjects must have had at least 
one prior standard-of -care therapy or declined such  therapy given the changing 
treatment landscape in this subject population.  
 Section 9.3.1 #5:  New criterion to indicate that all subjects must be  FGF19 -
positive, as determined by Sponsor -designated laboratory prior to enrollment  in 
the Dose Expansion phase of the study.   
 Section 9.3.1 #6:  Added a window for the receipt of prior chemotherapy or 
immunotherapy to include 4 weeks or 5 half -lives (whichever is shorter).  
 Section 9.3.1 #7:  Edit to clarify the washout period for radiopharmaceuticals 
from “within 8 weeks” to “8 weeks before study drug administration.”  
 Section 9.3.2 #1:   Revised this criterion to indicate that subjects with stage 1 
prostate cancer are el igible for study participation.  
 Section 9.3.2 #11:   Revised this criterion to remove specific reference to “long-
acting” PPIs .  Additionally , added  a statement to allow antacid use during the 
study  with the except ion of  calcium carbonate antacids, which could interfere 
with calcium levels.  
 Section 9.3.2 #13:   Removed selective pan -FGFR inhibitor as an exclusionary 
previous treatment.  
 Section 9.3.2 #14:   Clarified that only live vaccines are prohibited . 
 Section 9.4.2:   Added a statement to discuss DLTs and to specify when a 
subject may continue on treatment at a reduced dose following a DLT.  
 Section 9.4.4.1:  Clarified the threshold for subjects to be evaluable as 17 of 21 days (80%) to accommodate the potential for a BID dose schedule.

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 11 of 126 
  Section 9.4.4.3:  Removed this food effect cohort , which will no longer be 
included in the current study.   The effect of food on the bioavailability of H3B -
6527 will be assessed in a separate, concurrent clinical study, H3B -6527-A001 -
001:  A Randomized Phase 1 Food -Effect Study of H3B-6527 in Healthy 
Subjects.  Conditional language has been added to indicate that subjects may be 
asked to take study drug in conjunction with a meal depending on study results 
from this HVFE study  as needed.  
 Section 9.4.6 :  Added a sentence to clarify guidance on missed doses, 
particularly for the BID schedule . 
 Section 9.4.8:  Added language to specify that study drug must be withheld if a subject requires a short course of steroids while on -treatment.  
 Section 9.4.9:   Removed some of the restrictions that were included in this 
section for the food effect cohort since that is no longer being included for reasons stated abov e.  Subjects are still required to limit physical activity 
immediately before and after blood draws.  
 Section 9.5.1.1.1:  Added this section to discuss prescreening requirements for subjects and to include that an optional separate consent may be used to screen subjects and collect tumor tissue samples.  
 Section 9.5.1.1.3:   Revised the medical history to specifically state the 
collection of  disease history of portal vein invasion or thrombosis.  
 Section 9.5.1.3.3:  Revised this section to state that a separate consent may be used to allow screening of tumor tissue samples prior to enrollment  and to 
include a visit window for the collection of the second tumor biopsy sample.  
 Section 9.5.1.4.3:  Revised this section to remove specific reference to the requirement to review bile salt s/acids prior to  study drug administration since 
turnaround time for results precludes real -time review .  However, results will be 
reviewed  by the site team when available, and in aggregate to look for any 
potential safety trends as outlined in the existing safety review plan.  
 Section 9.5.1.4.5:   Added language to the OCT examination to clarify that any 
abnormalities would be recorded as AEs and to provide a window for the completion of the examination prior to Day 1  of each specified cycle. 
 Section 9.5.1.4.6:  Revised this section to include appropriate windows/timing for Holter monitoring to be consistent with the ECG manual .

 Study Design 
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study that will be conducted in 2 parts, a Dose Escalation 
phase (Part 1) and a  Dose Expansion phase  (Part 2).  Approximately 30 to 128  are planned for 
enrollment. Dose escalation will follow a standard 3+3 cohort design until the MTD/RP2D for each dosing 
schedule is determined in this population.  
H3B -6527 will be administered as a single-agent  by oral administration in 21-day cycles without 
break
 to examine both once daily (QD) and twice daily ( BID) dosing schedules, with flexibility to 
also examine additional alternate dosing schedules.  The study drug will be administered with food 
based  on the Healthy Volunteers Food -Effect study ( Study H3B -6527-A001 -001:  A Randomized 
Phase 1 Food -Effect Study of H3B -6527 in Healthy Subjects).   The starting dose of study drug when 
given with food was agreed upon with the Safety Review Committee (SRC) to meet the criteria that it 
be no more than one -half of the previously determined safe total daily dose level.  Any additional 
dose escalation will follow the procedures outlined in Section 9.1.1 . 
Safety, tumor response, PK, and pharm acodynamic assessments will be performed for every subject; 
details are described under Assessments . 
This study makes provision for exploring a BID schedule of H3B -6527 if evaluation of the PK, 
pharmacodynamics, or safety of H3B -6527 suggests that it may be preferable to administer H3B-
6527 BID rath er than QD.  The criteria to evaluate a BID schedule will be based on an integrated 
evaluation of safety, tolerability, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data, for all dose levels 
tested.  In this case, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated with a BID dose.  The 
initial total daily dose given BID will be equal to a total daily dose that has been well tolerated as a 
QD dose (dose -limiting toxicity [ DLT] rate < 33% in a cohort  of 3-6 subjects).  If BID dosing of 
H3B -6527 is well tolerated in this initial cohort then dose escalation may continue with BID dosing, 
following the same dose escalation rules applied to QD dosing.   
Furthermore, additional cohorts of subjects may be enrolled to evaluate a less frequent dosing schedule (eg, daily for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks [dosing on Days 1 -14 of a 21-day cycle]).  
Dose Escalation (Part 1)  
The objective of  Part 1, the Dose Escalation phase is to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of 
H3B -6527 in subjects with HCC.  The total number of subjects to be enrolled will depend on the 
observed safety profile, which will determine the number of subjects per dose cohort, as well as the 
number of dose escalations require d to achieve the MTD and/or RP2D of H3B -6527.  Assuming 5 
dose levels will be stu died for the QD dose schedule and 3 dose levels for the BID dose schedule and 
a maximum of 6 subjects will be enrolled per dose level, approximately 30 to 48 subjects may be 
accrued during dose escalation.  
The criteria to evaluate the BID dose schedule  will be based on an integrated evaluation of safety, 
tolerability, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data, for all QD dose levels tested.   In this 
case, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated with a BID dose.  The initial total daily 
dose given BID will be equal to a total daily dose that has been well tolerated as a QD dose (DLT <33% in a cohort  of 3-6 subjects).   
Due to the potential for dropouts during the first cycle of treatment (eg, because of early disease progression), a c ohort may initially be expanded to include up to 2 additional subje cts.  However, if 
these additional subjects are to be enrolled, they must start treatment within  14 days after the third 
subject  enrolled in the cohort was first dosed with H3B -6527.  The d ecision to dose escalate may still

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 20 of 126 
 be made after the third subject  enrolled to the dose level in question has completed the first cycle  (C) 
of treatment.  However, if under these circumstances the decision is made to enroll subjects to a 
higher dose level,  and one of the additional subjects treated at the preceding dose level experiences a 
DLT in the first cycle of treatment, then further enrollment of subject s to the higher dose level will be 
suspended until it can be determined whether the preceding dose level exceeds the MTD.  In the meantime, subject s enrolled to the higher dose level may continue treatment at that dose if they are 
tolerating it well, and if continuing treatment is considered appropriate for the toxicity in question.  
For dose -escalation purposes, toxicities assigned as DLTs during the first cycle will be assessed.  
After 3-6 subjects in a cohort have completed C1, all available safety data will be reviewed by the 
SRC consisting of Sponsor  personnel and investigators and the decision to proceed to the next dose 
cohort will be made jointly.  If different dose schedules are explored, decisions regarding dose escalation will be made based on review of data from subjects enrolled in cohorts on the same schedule, however, safety data from alternate schedules may be considered by the SRC.  Toxicities 
will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.03.  
Once a subject  has completed C3 at the initially assigned dose schedule and dose level  (QD or BID), 
intrapatient dose escalation will be allowed.  Only subject s who have not progressed on treatment, 
and did not have a dose reduction or interruption because of drug- related adverse events ( AEs), can 
escalate to the highest dose level that has completed DLT assessment within that schedule and has been shown to be safe (no DLT in the first 3 subject s or no more than 1 DLT in 6 subject s).  Subjects 
on the intrapatient dose escalation will not be included in the DLT analysis at the higher dose level.   
The investigator and the medical monitor must agree that dose escalation is appropriate for the subject prior to escalating their H3B-6527 dose  level. 
The starting dose of 300 mg (first -in-human dose) is the human equivalent dose (HED) of 1/6th of  
the highest non -severely toxic dose in the dog.   
H3B -6527 will be tested in sequential , escalating dose cohorts (n=3 to 6) at the dose levels in the 
table below.  Dose escalation  will follow a modified Fibonacci design such that the magnitude of the 
escalation will decrease as the dose level nears the HED of the highest non-severely toxic dose  in 
dogs (HED ≈  2000  mg).

These total  daily  dose levels may be evaluated in QD or BID dose schedules , intermediate dose levels , 
and in expansion of an existing dose level of up to 12 evaluable subjects following discussions between

Subjects will be assigned to a dose level in the order of study entry.  Initially, 3 subjects will be

 dose level  below starting dose ) will be explored.  If 1 of the 3 subjects experiences a DLT then the 
dose will be expanded to 6 subjects.  If ≥2 of 6 subjects in the starting dose cohort experience a DLT 
during the first cycle, then the dose level -1 will be explore d. 
Dose escalation  to the next higher dose may proceed if no DLT is observed in C1 among the first 
3 subjects accrued to a cohort.  If 1 of 3 subjects in the cohort experiences a DLT , up to a total of 
6 subjects will be enrolled.  If 2 or more (≥33%) of the 3 -6 subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, 
dose-escalation will cease, and additional subjects will be treated at a lower dose level.  Dose 
escalation will continue until a dose level where ≥2 of 6 subjects experience a DLT.   
The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT in 
the dose cohort.  The RP 2D may not exceed the MTD and will be agreed upon by the SRC based on 
an integrated evaluation of safety, tolerability, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data, for 
all dose levels tested.  Clinically significant toxicities (eg, chronic Grade 2 toxicities) or  AEs that 
meet the definition of dose limiting but occurring after C1 (dose -modifying events [DME ]) may be 
considered when determining the RP2D.  Once the MTD/RP2D is reached, at least 6 HCC subjects 
must be enrolled at the RP2D (regardless of the total number of subjects enrolled at that dose level) in order to proceed with dose e xpansion.  
Subjects who do not receive study drug for at least 17 of 21 days (approximately 80%; not 
necessarily consecutively) during the first cycle for reasons not considered to be a DLT by both the investigators and the Sponsor will be replaced.  S ubjects who are replaced will not be considered 
evaluable for DLT assessments.  
Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicities or Dose- Modifying Events  
DLTs  are any of the following toxicities occurring during C1 Phase 1 only and judged by the 
investigator  as relat ed to study drug (ie , assessed as unrelated to disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medications).  Any event that occurs in C2 or beyond (including any cycle in Phase 2) will be considered a DME.

Expansion (Part 2)  
Prior to starting the Dose Expansion phase, the investigators and the Sponsor will use safety, 
efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data obtained during the Dose Escalation Phase, as well as clinical judgement, to jointly determine the dose schedules (e.g., QD and/or BID) to be studied.  
During Part 2, the Dose Expansion phase, a sample size of 40 evaluable subjects per dose schedule will be enrolled  to examine QD and /or BID dosin g of H3B -6527 based on the recommended dose 
determined from Part 1.  For a reference of the precision of ORR estimates, the associated 2 -sided 
95% CIs for ORR up to 30% for 40 subjects are provided.
  Subjects enrolled into Part 2, Dose 
Expansion phase, mus t be FGF19 -positive as defined by Sponsor -designated laboratory.  
When both dose schedules  are accruing  subjects, an alternating enrollment schema into QD and BID 
dose schedule will be followed.  
Study Phases  
The study will be conducted in the following 4 phases:  Pretreatment Phase, Treatment Phase, Extension Phase, and Follow -up Phase.  
Pretreatment Phase 
This Pretreatment Phase will last no longer than 28 days and includes:  
• A Screening Period to establish protocol eligibility.  
• A Baseline Period  to establish disease characteristics before treatment.  
Treatment Phase  
The Treatment Phase will last for  1 treatment cycle of 21 days. 
Subjects who are receiving study drug at the end of the Treatment Phase will continue to receive 
study drug in the Extension Phase.  
Extension Phase   
In the Extension Phase, subjects will continue to receive the same treatment and dose they received 
during the Treatment Phase,
 provided termination criteria are not met .   
Treatment and Extension Phases  
Subjects  will discontinue study drug at the time of disease progression, development of unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent , or termination of the study by the Sponsor .  However, subjects may 
continue to receive study treatment as long as they demonstrate  clinical benefit as judged by the 
investigator after discussion with the Sponsor  or until the end of the study.  D isease progression will 
be determined by the investigator  following  relevant modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101

 Tumors (mRECIST) guidelines .  The mRECIST for this protocol harmonizes the original mRECIST 
criteria (Lencioni and Llovet , 2010) using triphasic liver computed tomography (CT)/magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI; optimized for precontrast, arterial phase, and portal venous pha se) and 
elements of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1  (Eisenhauer, et al., 2009 ).   
Follow -up Phase  
After the Off -treatment Visit , all subjects who discontinue study treatment, regardless of their reasons 
for doing so, will be followed for survival approximately every 12  weeks for up to 12 months or  until 
6 cycles after last patient in, death, loss to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs 
first.  Subjects who discontinue study drug without progressive disease (PD ) will continue to undergo 
tumor assessments every 6 weeks until documented PD or initiation of another anti cancer therapy .   
The data cutoff for the primary analysis  will occur once the last subject completes 6 cycles of 
investigational therapy.  Subjects will be allowed to continue treatment until progression or the end 
of therapeutic benefit from the study drug as determined by Sponsor discussion with investigator .   
The end of study is defined as when the last ongoing subject completes their off treatment visit .  The 
off treatment visit should occur 30 days after final dose with a window of ± 3 days .  The maximum 
estimated period for each subject on treatment is anticipated to be approximately 4 months .  
However, subjects may continue to receive study treatment , as long as they demonstrate clinical 
benefit  as judged by the investigator  after discussion with the S ponsor or until the end of the study . 
Number of Subjects  
Approximately 30 to 128 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study:   30 to 48 during the Dose 
Escalation phase and 40 to 80 subjects in the Dose Expansion phase.  The total number of subjects to 
be enrolled in the Dose Escalation phase is dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will 
determine the number of subjects per dose cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required 
to achieve the MTD an d/or RP2D of H3B -6527.

30 days after study drug discontinuation.  Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatment.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs t o be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of

Study Treatment  
Test drug:   H3B -6527 will be supplied as 50-, 100 -, and 200-mg capsules.  The starting dose will be 
300 mg QD orally , with escalation of  total daily doses in successive cohorts to a maximum planned 
dose of 2000 mg.  Additionally, a BID dosing schedule may be explored.  In this case, the initial total 
daily dose given BID will be equal to a total daily dose that has been well tolerated as a QD dose.  
The study drug will be administered with food based on the Healthy Volunteers Food -Effect study 
(Study H3B 6527-A001 -001:  A Randomized Phase 1 Food-Effect Study of H3B-6527 in Healthy 
Subjects).  
Capsules should be swallowed whole.  Dosing should not be repeated if a subject vomits .  For 
subjects on a QD dose schedule , a dose missed by >8 hours should be skipped.  For subjects on a 
BID dose schedule, a dose missed by >4 hours should be skipped.  
Guidelines for Continuation of Treatment  
Study drug should continue to be administered until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study by the Sponsor .   
Subjects who experience a DLT during C1, will be discontinued from treatment .  In rare cases, an 
exemption to study discontinuation for a DLT in C1 may be considered after discussion between the 
treating physician, Sponsor and study medical monitor .   
If a subject experiences a DLT or dose-modifying event (ie , an AE meeting the criteria for a DLT but 
occurring after C1 ) during the study then study treatment will be interrupted  and subjects may, at the 
discretion of the investigator, and after discussion with the Sponsor, be allowed to continue study drug at a reduced dose, if the following criteria are met: 
• Absolute neutrophil count  ≥1.0 × 10
9/L (1,000/mm3) 
• Platelet count ≥75  × 109/L (75,000/mm3)

 • All other nonhematologic treatment -related toxicities are Grade 0 or 1 (except alopecia) or 
return to baseline level  
• The subject is deriving clinical benefit, and  
• The subject has an otherwise favorable risk/benefit profile.  
The magnitude of the dose reduction cannot be specified a  priori since the actual doses evaluated and 
the dose -toxicity relationship will not be known until there is clinical experience with H3B -6527; 
however, a minimum reduction of 33% must be taken.  The dose chosen will require discussion and 
agreement between  the investigator and Sponsor  following review of the relevant clinical data.  
Dose reductions are allowed for all subjects.   However, once the H3B -6527 dose has been reduced 
for a given subject, no re-escalation will be permitted for that subject.  
A maxim um of 2 dose reductions will be allowed as needed but study treatment should not be 
resumed in the case of the following treatment -related events:  
• Occurrence of a DLT in C1 except upon agreement with investigator, Sponsor  and medical 
monitor .  A dose reduction must be taken if treatment is resumed.  
• CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 cardiac event  
• Nonhematologic events of Grade 4 severity  
• Dose delay of ≥ 21 days for a treatment-related event in C2 and beyond.  
Comparator Drug:   None  
Duration of Treatment  
In the Dose Escalation and  Dose Expansion phases of the study, each subject will receive 1 cycle of 
treatment during the Treatment Phase.  In the Extension Phase , study treatment will continue until the 
subject develops  PD or  unacceptable toxicity  or withdraws consent , or until termination of the study 
by the Sponsor .  However, subjects may continue to receive study treatment, as long as clinical 
benefit is  demonstrated, as judged by the investigator after discussion with the Sponsor or until the 
end of the study.

 Concomitant Drug/Therapy  
The following are prohibited:  
• Other investigational drugs.  
• Other antitumor therapies such as chemotherapy, surgical resection, or antitumor 
immunotherapy.  
• Proton pump inhibitors.  
• Radiotherapy for central metastases (eg, vertebral, mediastinal) will not be allowed; the need 
for such radiotherapy while on study will be seen as an indication of disease progression and the subject should be withdrawn from therapy.  However, palliative radiotherapy for up to 2 local peripheral metastases not being used as target lesions is allowed but the need for such 
therapy may be an indication of PD and should be discussed with the Sponsor prior to 
implementation.  
• Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 enzyme or P-glycoprotein 
transporter.  
• Drugs that raise serum calcium and phosphorus levels (eg, vitamin D supplements, calcium dietary supplements, calcium antacids) or systemic corticosteroids.  The duration between the last systemic corticosteroid administration and the first d ose of study drug should be at least 
2 weeks.  If a short -term course of systemic corticosteroids is required while on treatment, 
then study drug must be held while the subject receives systemic corticosteroid treatment.  If 
the subject has not progressed in the interim, resumption of treatment with H3B -6527 may be 
considered following discontinuation of steroid treatment and a 2-week washout period.  
Growth Factors
:  Subjects receiving recombinant erythropoietin or darbepoietin-α prior to study start 
may continue to receive pretreatment doses.  Following initiation of study treatment, the use of 
erythropoietic and granulocyte growth factors in accordance with local practice or guidelines.  American Society for Clinical Oncology guidelines may be implemented at the discretion of the 
treating physician.
 
Management of diarrhea :  Subjects should be instructed to take loperamide, 4 mg, at the occurrence 
of the first loose stool and then 2 mg every 2 hours until they are diarrhea -free for at least 12 hours.  
During the night, subjects may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours.  Subjects should be advised to 
avoid dehydration through adequate fluid intake.  Bile acid sequestrants may be utilized in the case of 
bile acid diarrhea.  
Medications for the treatment of AEs or cancer symptoms, eg, packed red blood cells and pain medications, are allowed.  Additionally, medications (not addressed above) used to treat underlying medical conditions at study entry including anti -emetics and antidiarrheals will be allowed to 
continue.  
Guidelines for Management of Hyperphosphatemia or Hypercalcemia  
Phosphorus and calcium will be measured at screening, before the first dose, every week with safety labs during C1, and on Day 1 and Day 8 for C2 and beyond.  Please note that a cycle is 21 days.  Subjects with elevated levels of phosphorus or calcium at screening, as defined as being >1  × ULN on 
local laboratory ranges, may not participate in this study and should be referred for management of such.  If successfully controlled, subjects may be rescreened.  During study participation, any levels 
of phosphorus above 7 mg/dL, or calcium equal to or above Grade 2 hypercalcemia as per CTCAE, 
Version 4.03, will result in the dose of H3B -6527 being held for 14
 days.   
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101 
 
 
H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 30 of 126 
 The hyperphosphatemia and /  or hypercalcemia should be managed by local practice, with 
medication, diet change, and potential referral as necessary.  After 14 days of holding the drug, if the 
phosphorus level has returned to 5.5 mg/dL or lower, and the calcium is less than or equal to a Grade 1 elevation, the subject may begin taking H3B -6527 again at one dose level lower than their original 
dose and should continue other measures initiated during the drug holiday, such as phosphorus lowering agents, while on study.  If a subject sho uld experience hyperphosphatemia above 7 mg/dL 
or hypercalcemia equal to or above Grade 2 again on study, then study therapy will be discontinued.  
Assessments  
Efficacy Assessments  
Tumor assessments will be performed following mRECIST guidance . 
All subjects are required to undergo chest, abdomen, and pelvis imaging at baseline and all follow -up 
time points.  Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and contrast -enhanced CT or MRI scan of the 
abdomen, pelvis, and any other areas of disease, as clinically indicated, will be acquired at Screening and at all imaging time points.  A l iver CT or MRI scan must be performed using triphasic scanning 
technique s optimized to capture pre contrast, arterial, and portal venous phase s.  Historical standard -
of-care scans conducted within 28 days prior to study drug administration may be used  as 
screening/ baseline imaging if scanning parameters are consistent with the requirements for this 
protocol  as separately defined by the imaging core laboratory . 
MRI scans may be used instead of CT scans for imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.  However, the chest must be imaged using CT; and chest disease must be followed by CT  scan (ie, chest x-ray for 
response assessment is not allowed) .  The same method of assessment used during Screening must be 
used at all subsequent time points.  If iodinated intravenous contrast is contraindicated, chest CT scan should be performed without intravenous  contrast . 
A brain scan  should be performed for all subjects to assess potential central nervous system disease 
and/or metastases as clinically indicated .  For eligible subjects with previously treated brain 
metastases, a brain scan will be required at all tumor assessment time  points (eg, every 6 weeks).  For 
all subjects, a follow -up brain scan must be performed to confirm a complete response (CR) within 1 
week following response confirmation.   
The first radiological assessment of tumor response status will be performed during  Week 6, unless 
there is clinical indication warranting earlier radiologic imaging.  Response assessments will be 
repeated every 6 weeks until disease progression as determined by the investigator .  Although clinical 
progression may be determined by the investigator  based upon clinical deterioration, every effort 
should be made to document progression using radiographic methods .  Signs and symptoms of 
clinical deterioration that lead to disease progression should be documented.  
Subjects discontinued from treatment without disease progression will continue to undergo tumor assessments every 6 weeks until documented disease progression or initiation of another anticancer 
therapy.  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment, regardless of their reasons for doing so, will be followed for survival approximately every 12 weeks for up to 12 months or until 6 cycles after last patient in, 
death, loss to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected during C1 on Day 1, Day 8, and D ay 15 in Part 1 , 
Dose Escalation .  Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected during C1 on Day 8, and Day 15 
in Part 2, Expansion , according to the Schedule of Assessments.

 Urine and plasma samples for assessment of the metabolite profile will be collected during C1 on 
Day 8 for urine and Day 1, Day 8 , and Day 15 for plasma in Part 1, Dose E scalation , only.  
During the Expansion p hase, H3B -6527 levels in tumor tissue may be analyzed .  During Dose 
Escalation , the investigators and Sponsor  may agree that determination of H3B- 6527 exposure in 
tumor tissue is required to guide decisions pertaining to drug administration.  In this scenario, 
biopsies of tumor tissue will be obtained from all consenting subjects .   
Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacogenomics, and Other Biomarker Assessments 
Pharmacodynamics biomarkers including biomarkers to show target engagement and impact of 
H3B -6527 treatment on disease will be evaluated from collected samples as outlined in the schedule 
of assessments.  Retrospective testing for potential subject stratification markers will also be explored.  Results from biomarker studies may be used to aid the selection of the RP2D and schedule, and for monitoring drug efficacy .  When new research results emerge, the parameters and methods 
for the pharmacodyna mic biomarker analysis may change.       
 
Biomarker Sample Collection  
Screening Phase biomarkers:  
Subjects in the Dose Expansion phase will be evaluated for FGF19  expression.  A fresh tumor biopsy 
(for determining FGF19 expression levels by a Sponsor designated laboratory), the signing of the ICF, and the collection of blood samples for pharmacodynamic analysis  (same day as fresh tumor 
biopsy)  will be required up t o 8 weeks before administration of H3B -6527 on C1 Day 1, in order to 
enroll in the Dose Expansion Phase of the study.  The 28-day Screening Period will begin when any of the remaining screening assessments are performed.  The entire Pretreatment Phase must  be 
completed within 8 weeks of study drug administration on C1 Day 1.   Archived, fixed tumor tissue is  
also to be collected (if available) for all consenting subjects in both the D ose Escalation and 
Expansion phases.  These tissues and peripheral blood samples (for both  Dose Escalation and Dose 
Expansion phase) may be used for assessment of mutations and other exploratory biomarkers.
  
Baseline and T reatment Phase Biomarkers:  
Blood (serum/plasma) biomarker samples from study subjects may be analyzed for FGF19 (ligand of H3B -6527’s target FGFR4), bile acids, circulating tumor cells and other exploratory biomarker 
candidates (both protein and nucleic acids) using global proteomic/metabolomics/genomic methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, multiplex bea d-based immunoassay, or other assays/methods.  
These blood biomarker samples may be used for exploratory analysis for evaluation of response -
related and/or safety -related outcomes as well as for potential use in diagnostic development.  
In the event a subje ct is required to have a repeat tumor biopsy for medically indicated reasons, 
freshly obtained biopsy tissue from the procedure should be collected and shipped to H3 Biomedicine, Inc., or a predesignated laboratory for exploratory biomarker analysis  as out lined in 
the lab oratory manual. 
Pharmacogen omic s Assessment  
A blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic ( PG) analysis.  The role of deoxyribonucleic 
acid ( DNA) sequence variability on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination 
(ADME ) of H3B-6527 may be evaluated in this study .  Variation in H3B -6527 exposure or the 
occurrence of AEs observed in the study population may be evaluated by correlation of single –
nucleotide polymorphisms with PK, safety, or pharmacodynamic  data.  Genomic DNA extracted 
from blood samples may be used to confirm whether the DNA sequence variants observed in DNA extracted from tumor material are limited to the tumor.  
Data obtained will be used for research, to assist in developing safer and more effective treatm ents, 
and will not be used to change the diagnosis of the subject or alter the therapy of the subject .  The

H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 32 of 126 
 DNA will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not 
currently have.  Any sample or derivatives (DNA,  ribonucleic acid , and protein) may be stored for up 
to 15 years to assist in any research scientific questions related to H3B -6527 or cancer and for 
potential diagnostic development.  
 
General  
Archived tumor tissue samples and blood samples for pharmacodynamic , PG, and other biomarker 
assessments will be collected from all consented study subjects, except where prohibited by regional 
or local laws.  Samples will be collected at designated time points as specified in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments. 
Samples may be used for biomarker discovery and/or validation to identify blood or tumor 
biomarkers that may be useful to predict treatment response (efficacy, pharmacodynamics ), PK, 
and/or safety -related outcomes.  Samples may also be used for p otential diagnostic development .  In 
addition, biomarkers identified in other clinical studies may also be assessed in samples collected from subjects enrolled in this study .  The decision to perform exploratory biomarker analysis will be 
based on the clinical outcome of the study, the signals observed in other clinical studies and/or the scientific rationale of the study .   
Instructions for the processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Safety Assessments  
Safety  assessments include monitoring and recording all AEs, including serious adverse events 
(SAEs); clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, coagulation parameters, clinical chemistry (including total bile acids, cholesterol, triglycerides), and urinalysis; and periodic measurement of vital signs, ECGs, MUGA scans/echocardiograms, ophthalmic and physical examinations.  
Additionally, QTc intervals will be evaluated during Dose -Escalation .  All AEs will be assessed  
using the National Cancer Institute CTCAE, Version  4.03.  
Bioanalytical Methods  
Plasma concentrations of H3 B-6527 will be determined using a validated assay .  If appropriate, 
assessment of plasma and urine samples for any metabolites of H3 B-6527 may be explored.  
The ability to determine tumor concentrations of H3 B-6527 may be explored using a non validated 
assay such as matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization .  
Statistical Methods  
Primary Endpoints  
• Occurrence of DLTs as a function of the dose of H3B -6527 for determination of the MTD and 
RP2D.  
• Safety/tolerability:  the type and frequency of AEs, SAEs using CTCAE , Version  4.03, as well as 
changes in clinical laboratory values, ECG parameters and vital sign measurements. 
Secondary Endpoints  
• PK:  Standard primary PK parameters including but not limited to the area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve from time 0 through the last measurable point (AUC 0-t), maximum 
observed plasma concentration (C max) and time of maximum observed plasma concentr ation 
(tmax).

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 33 of 126 
 • Preliminary antitumor activity:  Response will be determined by the investigator  using 
mRECIST .  The following endpoints will be determined: 
- Objective response rate (ORR), defined as t he proportion of subjects achieving a best overall 
response of partial response (PR) or CR (PR + CR), from first dose date until disease 
progression/recurrence.  
- Duration of response , defined as the time from the date of first documented CR/PR until the 
first documentation of disease progression as determined by the investigator  or death, 
whichever comes first .   
- Progression -free survival (PFS), d efined as the time from first dose date to the date of the 
first documentation of disease progression as determi ned by the i nvestigator or death 
(whichever occurs first) .   
- Overall survival (OS) , defined as the time from first dose date to the date of death.  
- Time to response, de fined as the time from first dose date to the date of first documented 
CR/PR.   
Exploratory Endpoints  
• Correlat ion of biomarker expression levels with anti tumor activity and safety  
• Expression levels of biomarkers in blood  and tumor samples  
• Correlat ion of biomarker expression levels with H3B -6527 exposure in plasma 
• H3B -6527 levels in tumor tissue  may be assessed  
• H3B -6527 metabolites in plasma and urine . 
 
Analysis Sets 
Full Analysis Set will include all subjects  who received at least 1 dose of study drug .  This will be 
the primary analysis set for efficacy evaluations, as well as for demographic and baseline 
characteristics.  The summary of efficacy will be based on this set for HCC subjects.  
Safety Analysis Set  will include all subjects who received at least  1 dose of the study drug.  This will 
be the analysis set for all safety evaluations except DLT results.  
PK Analysis Set will include all subjects who have received at least  1 dose of study drug and have at 
least 1 evaluable plasma concentrations.   
Pharmacodynamics Analysis Set will include all subjects who have received at least 1  dose of study 
drug and have evaluable pharmacodynamic  data.  
PK/Pharmacodynamics Analysis Set will consist of all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set that also 
have evaluable plasma PK and pharmacodynamic  pretreatment assessment and at least 1 post 
treatment assessment. 
Response Evaluable Set  will consist of those HCC subjects who have received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and have measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline evaluation.  
Efficacy Analyses  
ORR, response duration, time to response, PFS , and OS will be listed and descriptively summarized 
as appropriate.   
• Response duration and time to response :  Summary statistics (median Q1, Q3 and range)

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 34 of 126 
 will be generated on subjects  achieving a best overall response of PR or CR (PR + CR) .   
PFS and OS:  The PFS censoring rules will follow the Food and Drug Administration 
guidance .  PFS will be reported in both summary tables and plotted with Kaplan-Meier 
curve .  Time of death will be censored for subject s who are without death infor mation at the 
time of OS analysis.  OS will be reported in both summary tables and plotted with Kaplan -
Meier curve.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations of H3B -6527 will be tabulated and summarized by dose level, day, and time .  
H3B -6527 PK parameters will be derived from plasma concentrations by noncompartmental analysis 
using actual times.  Minimally, the following PK parameters will be calculated:  C max, tmax, AUC 0-t, 
accumulation ratio (R acc); and if data permit, area under the plasma con centration -time curve 
extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf), terminal elimination half -life (t ½), apparent total body clearance 
(CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V z/F). 
Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacogenomics, and Other Biomar ker Analyses  
Pharmacodynamics, PG and other biomarker analyses may be performed and reported separately .  
Details of these analyses will be described in a separate analysis plan. 
Safety A nalyses  
Evaluation of safety will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set.  Safety data to be evaluated 
include AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, ECGs, and the results of ophthalmic and physical examinations.  
Safety parameters will be summarized using  descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 
Q1, Q3, and range for continuous variables; numbers and percentages for categorical measures). 
The effects of H3B -6527 on cardiovascular repolarization will be evaluated via 12-lead continuous 
Holter/ECG monitoring on C1 D ay 1 and Day 8 in the Dose E scalation phase of the study only.  
Individual ECGs will be extracted from the Holter recordings at specified time points per ECG 
manual and will be evaluated by a central laboratory.  QT intervals will be measured from Lead II 
and will be corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) correction factor.  The primary 
QTc parameter will be QTcF.  Secondary parameters (QT corrected for heart rate using Bazett’s formula [QTcB ], QT, PR, QRS, and h eart rate) and waveforms (T waves) will be evaluated.  
Interim Analyses  
There is no formal interim analysis for efficacy .  There will be an interim analysis to define the MTD 
and/or RP2D prior to initiating the Expansion  phase of the study .  Other interim analyses may be 
performed to determine if a different dose schedule  (eg, BID) or frequency ( eg, 2 weeks on/1 -week 
off) may  be preferable.  Safety  and PK  summaries may be provided periodically .   
Sample Size Rationale  
Dose Escalation phase (Part 1)  
It is anticipated that selection of the RP2D will be based on  an integrated evaluation of 
safety, tolerability, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data.  The total number of 
subjects to be enrolled is dependent upon the observed safety profile, whic h will determine 
the number of subjects per dose cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required to achieve the MTD of H3B -6527 and establish the RP2D.  For each dose schedule of QD and 
BID, a ssuming  5 dose levels for QD dose schedule and 3 dose  levels for the BID dose

 schedule will be studied and a maximum of 6 subjects will be enrolled per dose level, then 
between 30 to 48 subjects may be accrued during dose escalation.  
Dose Expansion phase (Part 2)  
Prior to starting the Dose Expansion phase, the investigators and the Sponsor will use safety, 
efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data obtained during the Dose Escalation Phase, as well as clinical judgement, to jointly determine the dose schedules to be studied.  
During Part 2, the Dose Expansion pha se, a sample size of 40 evaluable subjects per dose 
schedule will be enrolled to examine QD and /or BID dosing of H3B-6527 based on the 
recommended dose determined from Part 1.  For a reference of the precision of ORR 
estimates, the associated 2 -sided 95% CIs for ORR up to 30% for 40 subjects are provided.  
This study makes provision for exploring a BID schedule of H3B-6527 during the Dose 
Expansion phase if evaluation of the PK, pharmacodynamics, or safety of H3B-6527 suggests that it may be preferable to administer H3B -6527 BID rather than QD.  When both 
dose schedules are accruing subjects, an alternating enrollment schema into QD and BID dose schedules will be followed.  
Treatment Arms for Part 2, Dose Expansion  
Treatment Arm Number of Subjects  
1:  Subjects with advanced HCC who are FGF19 -positive to 
receive H3B -6527 QD for 21- day cycles  40 subjects

7 INTRODUCTION  
Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer -mortality and the 16th absolute cause of 
death worldwide (GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2015).  The high incidence and poor prognosis associated with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) together with the lack of effective systemic therapies warrant the development of new  
therapies for this indication (Llovet, et al. , 2008 ).  Although there are many studies ongoing, 
sorafenib , a multi -receptor kinase inhibitor, currently is considered the standard of care for 
unresectable H CC in the US, the EU, and multiple countries in the rest of the world 
(Nexavar
® US Prescribing Information [ USPI], 2015). 
H3B-6527 is an oral, selective, and covalent small molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth 
factor receptor 4 ( FGFR4 ).  In vitro, H3B -6527 showed >250- fold selectivity towards 
FGFR4 compared to other kinases tested.  FGFR4 and its major activator fibroblast growth 
factor 19 ( FGF19 ), play a critical role in HCC.  Addition of H3B-6527 to 
FGF19 -overexpressing HCC cell lines leads to dose-dependent inhibition of FGF19/FGFR4 
signaling and concomitant reduction in the viability of cells.  H3B-6527 dosing in mice leads 
to inhibition of FGF19/FGFR4 signaling and tumor regression in FGF19-overexpressing HCC cell line -derived xenografts and HCC pa tient-derived xenografts.  
These genetic analyses along with preclinical findings support the investigation of H3B-6527 in patients with advanced HCC.   
This first -in-human study is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1, dose-finding study that will 
be conducted in 2 parts:  a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose  Expansion phase.  The primary 
objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of H3B -6527 and to assess 
the safety and tolerability of H3B- 6527 as a single agent in subjects with advanced HCC.  
7.1 Indication  
Liver cancers occur predominantly in developing regions, most commonly in China, with 
83% of the estimated 782,000 new cancer cases worldwide occurring in developing regions in 2012, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Liver  cancers are more 
common in men than in women, ranking as the fifth most common cancer among men and ninth among women.  Globally, liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer

 deaths, estimated to be responsible for  approximately 746,000 deaths in 2012 (9.1% of the 
total).  Whereas mortality rates have decreased over the past several decades in many cancer 
types, the mortality rates for liver cancers, including  bile duct cancers, have doubled over 
that same time period  (Llovet, et al., 2015).  
The most common type of primary liver cancer is HCC, account ing for up to 90% of all 
primary liver cancers worldwide ( Llovet, et al., 2015).  The main risk factors for liver cancer 
are hepatitis B virus (HBV) , hepatitis C virus (HCV) , and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis 
secondary  to alcohol use and other causes, with HBV  and HCV being the most common 
causes ( GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2015).   
Most patients with liver cancers are diagnosed at intermediate or advanced disease stages, 
where curative approaches are often not feasible (Llovet , et al., 2015).  For patients with 
advanced disease, t reatment options are limited .  Thus, the prognosis for those with advanced 
disease is poor. 
The molecular targeted agent sorafenib, a multireceptor kinase inhibitor, currently is considered the standard of care for unresectable HCC in the US, E U, and multiple countries 
in the rest of the world ( Nexavar  USPI, 2015).  In a P hase 3, double -blind, ra ndomized, 
placebo -controlled clinical study in patients with unresectable HCC, sorafenib was associated 
with significant prolongation of survival versus placebo (median survival 10.7 versus 7.9 months, respectively; P <0.001) as well as significant prolonga tion of time to progression 
(5.5 versus 2.8 months, respectively; P <0.001) (Nexavar US PI, 2015).  However, in clinical 
practice, sorafenib demonstrates only modest efficacy and is associated with toxicity in patients with HCC ( Cheng, et al., 2012).  
Enhanced fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) expression is commonly observed in various types of human malignancies ( Tiong, et al., 2013).  Signaling through the fibroblast 
growth factor family is involved in fibrosis and its progression to cirrhosis of the liver, which 
is a risk factor for the development of HCC.  S everal alterations in FGFR signaling correlate 
with the outcomes of HCC patients, suggesting that signaling through this family of proteins 
contributes to the development or progression of HCC tumors (Cheng , et al., 2012).  The 
main FGFRs expressed in liver tissues are FGFR3 and FGFR4 (Cheng , et al., 2012).  
Recent genomic studies have identified FGF19 as a driver oncogene in HCC.  FGF19 is a gut-secreted hormone that acts in the liver through FGFR4 to regulate bile acid synthesis .  
Consistent with the notion that FGF19 is a driver oncogene in HCC, transgenic mice overexpressing FGF19 form liver tumors and genetic ablation of FGFR4 prevented tumor formation.  These data suggest that targeting HCC, which is dependent on FGFR4 signaling, would have therapeutic benefit in patients with altered FGF19 signaling, although tumor regression has also been observed in patient -derived xenograft models of HCC w ith 
undetectable levels of FGF19.  While a number of pan- FGFR inhibitors are being clinically 
evaluated, their application to FGFR4-dependent HCC may be limited by their FGFR1-3-related dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs).

 7.1.1 H 3B-6527  
7.1.1.1 Therapeutic Pathway  
H3B-6527 is a selective FGFR4 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of 
FGF19 /FGFR4 -driven HCC.  B iochemical selectivity assays showed that H3B -6527 is 
>250-fold more selective towards FGFR4 compared to other kinases tested .  The a ddition of 
H3B-6527 to FGF19 -amplified HCC cell lines led to dose- dependent inhibition of 
FGF19/FGFR4 signaling and concomitant reduction in the viability of cells.  Importantly, these effects were only observed in FGF19 -altered HCC cell line models.   
H3B-6527 dosing in mice leads to pharmacodynamic modulation and tumor regression in FGF19 -altered HCC cell line -derived xenografts .  In addition, ongoing preclinical studies in 
HCC patient -derived xenograft mouse models showed that both FGF19- altered (detectable) 
and FGF19- unaltered (un detectable) models respond to H3B-6527.  In particular, significant 
tumor growth inhibition relative to vehicle control was seen with H3B-6527 at oral doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg twice daily (BID) in the HEP3B xenograft model and at oral doses of 300 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg BID in the JHH7 model.   
Genetic analyses along with nonclinical study findings support the investigation of 
H3B-6527 in patients with advanced HCC.   
7.1.1.2 Clinical Experience with H3B-6527 
The current study represents the first clinical investigation of H3B -6527. 
7.1.1.3 Common Serious Adverse Events Expected to Occur in the Study Population in 
the Absence of Study Drug Exposure 
Common serious adverse events (SAEs) expected to occur in this study population include 
hepatobiliary dysfunction, ascites, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fatigue, abdominal pain and renal failure.  The current study represents the first clinical investigation of H3B -6527; 
therefore, the clinical safety profile of this investig ational agent is unknown.  Based on 
nonclinical studies, AEs potentially associated with H3B-6527 may include corneal atrophy, hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatobiliary toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and focal mineralization with associated hyperphosphatemia.  Additional details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
7.2 Study Rationale  
This first -in-human study is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1, dose-finding study that will 
be conducted in 2 parts:  a D ose E scalation phase (Part 1) and a D ose Expansion phase 
(Part 2) .  The primary objectives are to determine the MTD and/or the recommended Phase 2 
dose (RP2D) of H3B-6527 and to assess the safety and tolerability of H3B-6527 as a single agent in subjects with advanced HCC .

H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 49 of 126 
 H3B-6527 will be supplied as 50- , 100-, and 200- mg capsules and will be administered orally 
as a single-agent dose in 21-day cycles without a break ; this is supported by nonclinical data 
showing tumor growth inhibition and regressions in human HCC xenograft models grown in 
nude mice .  In addition, nonclinical safety evaluations with once daily ( QD) dosing in mice 
and dogs have shown evidence of on-target pharmacology ( eg, changes in circulating bile 
acid).  The starting dose of 300 mg (first- in-human dose) is the human equivalent dose 
(HED) of 1/6th  the highest non- severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in dog.  The maximum single 
dose proposed in the current study is 2000 mg.  It is also limited by the maximum number of capsules required to reach this dose.  
The Dose Escalation Phase will fo llow a standard 3+3 cohort design.  The dose will be 
escalated in successive cohorts based on a modified Fibonacci schema.  The RP2D will be selected based on an integrated evaluation of available safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetic ( PK), and pharmacodynamic data for all dose levels on the defined 
schedule.  The following considerations will help guide selection. 
1. The RP2D must have < 2/6 subjects experiencing a DLT at that dose (<33% DLT 
rate).  
2. The overall safety profile, including AEs assessed as related to study drug treatment 
but not considered dose- limiting, as well as the nature, type, timing , and frequency of 
toxicities.  
3. Tumor response(s).  
4. Demonstration of proof of principle with respect to in vivo biologic activity.  Mouse studies have sho wn an approximate 100- fold increase in cytochrome P450 
(CYP ) 7A1 tumor levels at efficacious doses.  The proof of principle for H3B-6527 
could be a robust increase in CYP7A1 tumor expression in humans. 
Safety, tumor response, PK, and pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed on all subjects.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is an open -label, multicenter, Phase 1 study that will be conducted in 2 parts:  a Dose 
Escalation phase (Part 1) and a Dose  Expansion phase (Part 2) .  Approximately 30 to 128 
subjects are planned for enrollment.  H3B-6527 will be administered by mouth ( PO) in 
21-day cycles without break  to examine both QD and BID dose schedules, with flexibility to 
also examine additional alternate dosing schedules (eg, daily for 2 consecutive weeks every 
3 weeks [dosing on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle]).   
During both parts of the study, subjects will  be administered the study drug with food based 
on the Healthy V olunteers Food-Effect study (Study H3B 6527-A001-001:  A Randomized 
Phase 1 Food-Effect Study of H3B-6527 in Healthy Subjects).  The starting dose of study drug when given with food was agreed upon with the Safety Review Committee (SRC) to meet the criteria that it be no more than one -half of the previously determined safe total daily 
dose level.  Any additional dose escalation will follow the procedures outlined in Section  9.1.1. 
The objective of Part 1, the Dose Escalation phase is to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of H3B-6527 in subjects with HCC.  The total number of subjects to be enrolled will depend on the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of subjects per dose cohort, as

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 51 of 126 
 well as the number of dose escalations required to achieve the MTD  and/or RP2D of H3B -
6527.   
This study makes provision for exploring a BID schedule of H3B-6527; t he criteria to 
evaluate H3B-6527 at the BID dose schedule will be based on an integrated evaluation of 
safety, tolerability, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data, for all QD dose levels tested.   In this case, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated with a BID dose.  
The initial total daily dose given BID will be equal to a total daily dose that has been well tolerated as a QD dose (DLT rate <3 3% in a cohort of 3- 6 subjects).   
During Part 2, the Dose Expansion phase, a sample size of 40 subjects per dose schedule will be enrolled to examine both QD and/or BID dosing of H3B-6527 based on the recommended dose determined from Part 1, the Dose Escalation Phase.  When both dose schedule s are 
accruing subjects, an alternating enrollment schema into QD and BID dose schedule will be 
followed.  
Safety , tumor response, PK, and pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed on every 
subject; see Section  9.5 for details.

integrated evaluation of safety, tolerability, and clinical benefit, including PK and pharmacodynamic data.  The total number of subjects to be enrolled will depend on the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of subjects per dose cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required to achieve the MTD and/or RP2D of H3B -6527.  
Assuming 5 dose levels will be studied for the QD dose schedule and 3 dose levels for the BID dose schedule and a maximum of 6 subjects will be enrolled per dose level, approximately 30 to 48 subjects may be accrued during dose escalation.  Subjects enrolled into Part 1, Dose Escalation phase, are not required to be FGF19-positive. 
 
The criteria to evaluate at the BID dose schedule will be based on an integrated evaluation of 
safety, tolerabil ity, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data, for all QD dose levels 
tested.   In this case, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated with a BID dose.  
The initial total daily dose given BID will be equal to a total daily dose that has been well tolerated as a QD dose (DLT rate <33% in a cohort of at least 3 subjects).  If BID dosing of 
H3B- 6527 is well tolerated in this initial cohort, then dose escalation may continue with BID 
dosing, following the same dose escalation rules applied to QD dosing.  Additional cohorts of 
subjects may be enrolled to evaluate a less frequent dosing schedule (eg, daily for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks [dosing on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle]).   
Due to the potential for dropouts during the first cycle of treatment (eg, because of early 
disease progression), a cohort may initially be expanded to include up to 2 additional subject s.  However, if these additional subject s are to be enrolled , they must start treatment 
≤14 days after the third subject enrolle d in the cohort was first dosed with H3B-6527.  The 
decision to dose escalate may still be made after the third subject  enrolled to the dose level in 
question has completed the first cycle of treatment.  However, if under these circumstances the decision i s made to enroll subject s to a higher dose level, and one of the additional 
subject s treated at the preceding dose level experiences a DLT in the first cycle of treatment, 
then further enrollment of subject s to the higher dose level will be suspended until it can be 
determined whether the preceding dose level exceeds the MTD.  In the meantime, subjects enrolled to the higher dose level may continue treatment at that dose if they are tolerating it well, and if continuing treatment is considered appropriate for the toxicity in question. 
For dose escalation purposes, toxicities assigned as DLTs during the first cycle will be 
assessed .  After 3-6 subjects in a cohort have completed Cycle ( C) 1, all available safety data 
will be reviewed by the SRC, consisting of Sponsor personnel and investigators, and the decision to proceed to the next dose cohort will be made jointly.  If different dose schedules are explored, decisions regarding dose escalation will be made based on review of data from subjects enrolled in cohorts on the same schedule, however, safety data from alternate schedules may be considered by the SRC.   Toxicities will be graded using the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ), Version  4.03.

 Once  a subject has completed C3 at the initially assigned dose schedule and dose level (QD 
or BID) , intrapatient dose escalation will be allowed.  Only subjects who have not progressed 
on treatment and did not have a dose reduction or interruption  because of a drug- related AE , 
will be permitted to escalate to the highest dose level  that has completed DLT assessment 
within that dose schedule  and has been shown to be safe (no DLT in the first 3 subjects or no 
more than 1 DLT in 6 subjects).  Subjects on the intrapatient dose escalation will not be 
included in the DLT analysis at the higher dose level.  The investigator and the medical 
monitor must agree that dose escalation is appropriate for the subject prior to escalating their H3B-6527 dose level .   
The starting dose of 300 mg QD (first- in-human dose) is the HED of 1/6th  the HNSTD in 
dog.  Dose e scalation  will follow a modified Fibonacci design such that the magnitude of the 
escalation will decrease as the dose level nears the HED of the HNSTD in dogs (HED ≈  2000 mg).

These total daily dose levels may be evaluated in QD or BID dose schedules , including intermediate dose

Refer to Section 9.4.4.1 for details regarding the dose -escalation procedure.  
The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects experiences a 
DLT in the dose cohort .  (Note that at least 6 subjects must be treated at the dose level 
potentially considered to be the MTD before that dose level can be considered the MTD).  Therefore, if ≥2 subjects within a cohort experience a DLT and the previous dose level did not enroll 6  subjects, enrollment will move down to the previous dose level and continue 
until 6 subjects are enrolled, and the same guidelines for determining the MTD will be followed. 
The RP 2D may not exceed the MTD and will be agreed upon by the SRC, based on an 
integrated evaluation of safety, tolerability, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data, 
for all dose levels tested .  Clinically significant toxicities (eg, chronic Grade 2 toxicities) or 
AEs that meet the definition of dose limiting but occurring afte r C1 (dose- modifying events,

 DME) may be considered when determining the RP2D.  Once the MTD/RP2D is reached, at 
least 6 HCC subjects must be enrolled at the RP2D (regardless of the total number of subjects enrolled at that dose level) to  proceed with dose expansion. 
To be evaluable for a DLT, subjects must  have completed safety assessments through 
predose on C2 Day 1 and must have received at least 17 of 21 (approximately 80%) study 
days within C1, unless due to a DLT .  Subjects who discontinue from the study for reasons 
other than DLT before completing C 1 are to be replaced.   Subjects who experience toxicities 
meeting DLT criteria during C 1 will be discontinued from treatment.   In rare cases, an 
exemption to study discontinuation for a DLT in 1
st cycle may be considered after discussion 
between the treating physician, Sponsor and study medical monitor.  Subjects who experience toxicities meeting DLT criteria may, at the discretion of the investigator and after discussion with the Sponsor, be allowed to continue study drug at a reduced dose if this is judged to be in the best clinical interest of the subject.  The S ponsor will communicate 
information about DLTs or safety concerns rapidly to all sites as per the separate Dose Escalation Plan, which also details the format and timelines of the Dose Escalation review meetings, and the communication of dose level decisions to all sites. 
9.1.1.1.1 DEFINITION OF DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITIES OR DOSE-MODIFYING EVENTS  
DLTs are defined as any of the toxic ities listed in Table 2 occurring during C1 Phase 1 only 
and judged by the investigator as related to study  drug (ie, assessed as unrelated to disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications).  Any event that occurs in C2 or beyond 
(including any cycle in Phase 2) will be considered a DME.  
Table 2 Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicity (Cycle 1 Phase 1 O nly) or 
Dose- Modifying Event (Cycle 2 or Beyond and Any Cycle in 
Phase 2)  
TOXICITY  CRITERIA  
Hematology  • Febrile neutropenia  
• CTCAE Grade  4 neutropenia that does not resolve to Grade  ≤2 within 7  days  
• CTCAE Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  requiring transfusion  
• CTCAE Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and clinically significant bleeding  
• CTCAE Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
• CTCAE Grade 3 anemia if transfused or if lasting for more than 7 days  
• CTCAE Grade 4 anemia  of any duration 
Gastrointestinal  • CTCAE  Grade 3 nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea lasting more than 72  hours 
despite the use of optimal anti -emetic/antidiarrheal treatment  
• CTCAE Grade 4 diarrhea and/or vomiting irrespective of prophylaxis or 
appropriate treatment  
Renal  • CTCAE Grade  ≥3 serum crea tinine  
Hepatic  • CTCAE Grade  3 bilirubin (>3.0 × ULN) and/or AST/ ALT ≥ 10 × ULN

 Table 2 Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicity (Cycle 1 Phase 1 O nly) or 
Dose- Modifying Event (Cycle 2 or Beyond and Any Cycle in 
Phase 2)  
TOXICITY  CRITERIA  
• For subjects with an abnormal value ≥ ULN at baseline based on the local 
laboratory ranges, an AST/ ALT elevation ≥ 10  × ULN for the local laboratory  
Other  AEs not listed 
above  • Nonhematologic toxicities of CTCAE Grade  ≥3 except for the following: 
- CTCAE Grade 3 fatigue lasting less than  1 week  
- Isolated CTCAE Grade  3 elevations in biochemistry laboratory values 
without associated clinical symptoms that last for ≤7 days .  This includes 
electrolyte abnormalities that respond to medical intervention.  
• H3B -6527- related, CTCAE Grade 2 nonhematologic toxicities that, in the 
opinion of the treating investigator, require a dose reduction or discontinuation 
of study drug, or lead to a failure to complete  at least  17 days of study drug 
administration in  C1, may b e deemed dose- limiting if agreed upon by the 
participating investigator and the Sponsor.  
AE = adverse event,  ALT = alanine aminotransferase , AST = aspartate aminotransferase,  C = Cycle,  CTCAE 
= Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , ULN  = upper limit of normal.  
 
As described in Table 2 , any subject with an increase in alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) or 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to ≥2  × the baseline value or with a bilirubin level of 
>3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN ) must have repeat testing 1 week later.  If either the ALT 
or bilirubin level increase further, testing will be repeated at 1 -week intervals until the values 
return to baseline levels.  
The only instance in which the AST/ ALT and/or bilirubin changes will not be considered a 
DLT is if there is unequivocal evidence that these increases are due to progression of the underlying disease or the intrahepatic malignancy.  In these cases, determination of a non -
DLT event will be made jointly by the Sponsor and the i nvestigator(s).  
For any dose-limiting hepatic toxicity that does not return to baseline  within 7 days, an 
abdominal computed tomography (CT)  scan must be performed to assess whether it is related 
to disease progression. 
9.1.1.2 Expansion (Part 2) 
Prior to starting  Part 2 of the study, the investigators and the Sponsor will use safety, 
efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data obtained during the Dose Escalation Phase, as well as clinical judgement, to jointly determine the dose schedules to be studied.  
During Part 2, the Dose Expansion phase, approximately 40 subjects per dose schedule will 
be enrolled to examine QD and/or BID dose schedules.  Subjects enrolled into Part 2, Dose Expansion phase, must be FGF19-positive as defined by Sponsor-designated laboratory.   
Part 2 of the study is designed to better characterize the safety, tolerability and preliminary 
antitumor activity of the study drug when provided at the RP2D and schedule.  For a reference of the precision of objective response rate ( ORR) estimates, the associated 2 -sided 
95% CIs for ORR up to 30% for 40 subjects is provided.  See Section 9.7.2 for additional

 information.  When both dose schedules a re accruing subjects, an alternating enrollment 
schema into QD and BID dose schedule will be followed. 
9.1.2 Study Phases  
The study will be conducted in the following 4 phases:  Pretreatment Phase, Treatment 
Phase, Extension Phase, and Follow-up Phase. 
9.1.2.1 Pretreatment Phase 
This pretreatment phase will last no longer than 28  days and includes: 
• A Screening Period  to establish protocol eligibility.  
• A Baseline Period  to establish disease characteristics before treatment.  
9.1.2.2 Treatment Phase 
The Treatment Phase will last for  1 treatment cycle of 21 days.   
Subjects who are receiving study drug at the end of the Treatment Phase will continue to receive study drug in the Extension Phase (see Section  9.1.2.3 ). 
9.1.2.3 Extension Phase  
In the Extension Phase, subjects will continue to receive the same treatment and dose they 
received during the Treatment Phase, provided termination criteria are not met.   
In both the Treatment and Extension Phases, subjects will discontinue study drug at the time 
of progressive disease (PD) , development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or 
termination of the study program  by the Sponsor.  However, subjects may continue t o receive 
study treatment, as long as there is demonstrated clinical benefit , as judged by the 
investigator after discussion with the Sponsor, or until the end of the study.  D isease 
progression will be determined by the investigator following relevant modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) guidelines .  The mRECIST for this protocol 
harmonizes the original mRECIST criteria (Lencioni and Llovet 2010) using triphasic liver CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; opti mized for precontrast, arterial phase, and portal 
venous phase) and elements of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (Eisenhauer, et al., 2009 ). 
9.1.2.4 Follow -Up Phase 
After the Off- treatment Visit (OTV) , all subjects who discontinue study tr eatment, regardless 
of their reasons for doing so, will be followed for survival via telephone (for those subjects who experience PD or initiate a new anticancer therapy) or office visit (for those subjects still undergoing tumor assessments) .  Subjects wi ll be followed for survival approximately every 
12 weeks for up to 12 months or until 6 cycles after last patient in , death, loss to follow-up, 
or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  Subjects who discontinue study drug and

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 57 of 126 
 have not experienced PD will continue to undergo tumor assessments every 6  weeks until 
documented PD or another anti cancer therapy is initiated .   
The data cutoff for the primary analysis will occur once the last subject completes 6 cycles of 
investigational therapy. Subjects will be allowed to continue treatment until progression or the end of therapeutic benefit from the study drug as determined by Sponsor discussion with investigator .  
The end of the study is defined as when the last ongoing subject completes their off treatment visit.  The off treatment visit should occur 30 days after final dose with a window of ±3 days.  
The maximum estimated period for each subject on treatment is an ticipated to be 
approximately 4 months.  However, subjects may continue to receive study treatment , as long 
as they demonstrate clinical benefit  as judged by the investigator after discussion with the 
Sponsor or until the end of the study. 
9.2 Discussion of St udy Design, Including Choice of Control Groups  
The g oals of Phase 1 oncology studies include estimation of the initial safety and tolerability 
of a study drug, establishment of an MTD, and determination of a recommended range of 
doses for evaluation in future clinical studies, based on PK and pharmacodynamic effects (Ahn, 1998; ICH E8, 1997; Gatsonis and Greenhouse, 1992; Dillman and Koziol, 1992); the 
primary objectives of the current  study are consistent with those typical of Phase 1 oncology 
studies.   
During the Dose Escalation Phase of the study, a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design w ill 
be used .  The dose escalation scheme to be followed is based on a modified Fibonacci 
sequen ce schema, which is commonly employed in P hase 1 dose- finding oncology studies 
(Storer, 1989).  An  integrated evaluation of safety, tolerability, PK, and pharma codynamic 
data will be utilized to select the RP2D dose schedule to be employed during the Dose 
Expansion phase. 
Preliminary assessment of activity or potential therapeutic benefit may be a secondary 
objective of Phase 1 studies (ICH E8, 1997).  Consistent with this premise, a secondary objective is to evaluate the potential antitumor activity of H3B-6527.  After identification of 
the MTD, the potential antitumor activity of H3B-6527 will be evaluated in Part 2, the 
Expansion phase, to determine whether there are any tolerability issues or antitumor activity 
associated with the use of H3B -6527 in subjects with HCC. 
It is recommended that the effect of food intake on the rate and extent of absorption of an orally administered investigational drug be investigated as early as possible during drug development to optimize dose finding and to ensure optimal food recommendations for study 
drug administration .  The decision  was made to allow study drug administration in 
conjunction with a meal, and this was informed by the Healthy Volunteers Food- Effect  study 
(H3B-6527-A001-001).  The star ting dose of study drug when given with food was  agreed 
upon with the SRC to meet the criteria that it be  no more than one -half of the previously 
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101 
 
 
H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 58 of 126 
 determined safe total daily dose level.  Any additional dose escalation will follow the 
procedures outline d in Section 9.1.1.  
Since the study drug is to be administered with food, a ll subjects will be required to fast 
2 hours prior to pharmacodynamic assessments and have a meal prior to or in conjunction with study drug administration.  
9.3 Selection of Study Population  
Approximately 30 to 128  subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study:  30 to 48 during 
Part 1, the Dose  Escalation  phase, and up to 80 subjects in the Expansion phase (40 subjects 
per dose schedule).  The total number of subjects to be enrolled in the Dose Escalation  phase 
will be  dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of 
subjects per dose cohort, a s well as the number of dose escalations required to achieve the 
MTD of H3B-6527 and establish the RP2D.  The total number of subjects in the Dose Expansion Phase will be dependent on whether data collected during the Dose Escalation 
Phase of the study can clearly differentiate between one dosing schedule (QD or BID) or 
whether both schedules will continue being evaluated during the Dose Expansion phase.  
Subjects who do not meet all  the inclusion criteria or who meet any of the exclusion criteria 
will not be eligible for enrollment in the study .

negative screening p regnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose 
of study drug. 
NOTE:  All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are 
postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). 
14. Females of childbearing potential  should avoid becoming pregnant and use highly 
effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 1 month after finishing treatment.  Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, sexual abstinence, an intrauterine device, a contraceptive 
implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confir med 
azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.  Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Female condom and male condom should not be used together.  Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.  Women using oral hormonal cont raceptives 
should add a barrier method.

 9.4 Treatments 
9.4.1 Treatments Admi nistered 
All subjects will receive H3B -6527 at their assigned dose daily PO.  For the purposes of this 
study, a cycle length is defined as 21 days. 
9.4.2 Guidelines for Continuation of Treatment  
Study drug should continue to be administered as planned unless a D LT has occurred.  
Subjects who experience a DLT during C1 will be discontinued from treatment.  In rare 
cases, an exemption to study discontinuation for a DLT in 1st cycle may be considered after 
discussion between the treating physician, Sponsor and study medical monitor.   If a subject 
should experience a DLT or DME (ie, an AE meeting the criteria for a DLT but occurring after C 1) during the study then study treatment will be interrupted  and subjects may
, at the 
discretion of the investigator, and after discussion with the Sponsor, be allowed to continue study drug at a reduced dose, if the following criteria are met: 
• ANC ≥1.0  × 109/L (1,000/mm3) 
• Platelet count ≥75 × 109/L (75,000/mm3) 
• All other nonhematologic treatment- related toxicities are Grade 0 or 1 (except alopecia) 
or return to baseline level  
• Clinical benefit is being received, and  
• Evidence of an otherwise favorable risk/benefit profile.  
The magnitude of the dose reduction cannot be specified a priori  since the actual doses 
evaluated and the dose-toxicity relationship will not be known until there is clinical experience with H3B -6527; however, a minimum reduction of 33% must be taken.  The dose 
chosen will require discussion and agreement between the investigator and Sponsor 
following review of t he relevant clinical data.  
Dose reductions are allowed for all subjects.  However, once the H3B-6527 dose has been reduced for a given subject, no re- escalation will be permitted for that subject.  
A maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed as needed , but study treatment should not 
be resumed in the case of the following treatment- related events:  
• Occurrence of a DLT in C1  except upon agreement with investigator, Sponsor and 
medical monitor.  A dose reduction must be taken if treatment is resumed. 
• CTCAE Grade 3  or 4 cardiac event  
• Nonhematologic events of Grade 4 severity 
• Dose delay of ≥21 days for a treatment-related event in C2 and beyond.

9.4.3.4 Storage Conditions  
Study drug will be stored in accordance with the labeled storage conditions.  At the study center, study drug is to be stored refrigerated at 2 -8°C.   
Subjects will be instructed to store study drug at home according to the storage requirements listed on the drug supply label.  
While at the study center and at home, the study participants will be instructed to take 
capsules immediately after removal from refrigerated conditions, in order to limit the time out of the required storage conditions. 
9.4.4 Method of As signing Subjects to Treatment Groups  
The dose level to which a subject is assigned is dependent on the study part and cohort into 
which the subject is enrolled.  
9.4.4.1 Dose  Escalation Scheme (Part 1) 
The starting dose of H3B-6527 is 300 mg QD. 
H3B-6527 doses will be escalated sequentially after the SRC, with appropriate representation 
from the Sponsor and participating i nvestigators, reviews safety data collected during C1 
from the subject(s) enrolled at the current dose level.  
Subjects who do not receive study drug for at least 17 of 21 days (approximately 80% ; not 
necessarily consecutively)  during the first cycle for reasons not considered to be a DLT by 
both the investigators and the Sponsor will be replaced.  The subjects who are replaced will not be considered evaluable for DLT assessments.  
Based on the interim evaluation of the safety and tolerability data of the previous dose level, the Sponsor may decide to initiate  accrual at an intermediate dose level .  The SRC may be 
convened earlier at the discretion of the Sponsor if important safety issues arise requiring the attention of the committee .   
Up to 3 subject s initially are to be enrolled .  After 3  subject s complete C1 and have safety 
evaluations performed through C2 Day 1, and: 
• None of these 3 subject s experience a DLT (see Section  9.1.1.1.1) , then enrollment of 
the next cohort may commence with approval from the SRC. 
• 1 of 3 subjects within a cohort experiences a DLT (see Section 9.1.1.1.1), then up to 
3 additional subject s are to be enrolled sequentially at that dose level.  If none of the 
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101 
 
 
H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 66 of 126 
 additional 3 subject s has a DLT (ie,  1 of 6  subjects has a DLT), then enrollment at the 
next scheduled dose may commence with approval from the SRC. 
• If ≥2 subject s within a cohort experience a DLT (see Section 9.1.1.1.1), then the DLT 
dose level will have been reached and the previous lower dose level will be 
considered the MTD.   Note that at least 6 subjects must be treated at the dose level 
potentially considered to be the MTD before that dose level can definitely be considered the MTD.   Therefore, if ≥2 subjects within a cohort experience a DLT and 
the previous dose level did not enroll 6 subjects, enrollment will move down to the previous dose level and continue until 6 subjects are enrolled, and the same guidelines for determining the MTD will be followed.  
- Once the MTD or RP2D is established, additional subjects will be treated in the 
Expansion phase of the study (Part  2), which is designed to better characterize the 
safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of the study drug when provided at the RP2D and schedule. 
Due to the potential for dropouts during the first cycle of treatment (eg, because of early disease progression), a cohort may initially be expanded to include up to 2 additional subjects.  However, if these additional subjects are to be enrolled, they must start treatment ≤14 days after the third subject enrolled in the cohort was first dosed wi th H3B -6527.  The 
decision to dose escalate may still be made after the third subject enrolled to the dose level in question has completed the first cycle of treatment.  However, if under these circumstances the decision is made to enroll subjects to a higher dose level, and one of the additional subjects treated at the preceding dose level experiences a DLT in the first cycle of treatment, then further enrollment of subjects to the higher dose level will be suspended until it can be determined whether the preceding dose level exceeds the MTD.  In the meantime, subjects enrolled to the higher dose level may continue treatment at that dose if they are tolerating it well, and if continuing treatment is considered appropriate for the toxicity in question.  Although decisions regarding dose escalation will be made based on review of data from C1, 
safety data will also be collected from all subject s continuing treatment and this will be 
reviewed periodically by the SRC.  Any detected cumulative toxicity may requir e later dose 
reductions or other action as appropriate, including further refinement of the RP2D. 
The dose escalation procedure is summarized in Table 3. 
Table 3 Summary of Dose E scalation Procedure  
Observed Safety Outcomes  Action  
Dose Escalation Cohorts (n=3-6 each)  
No DLT  • Escalate to the next planned dose level.  
DLT in 1 of 3 subject s • Expand cohort up to 6 subject s. 
No additional DLT in 6 subject s • Escalate to the next planned  dose level.  
DLT in ≥2 subjects • MTD reached; stop dose escalation .   
• Possibly explore intermediate doses for the RP2D.  
Note:  DLT is defined in  Section 9.1.1.1.1 . 
DLT = dose -limiting toxicity , MTD = maximum tolerated dose, RP2D = recommended Phase 2 dose.

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 67 of 126 
 If PK, pharmacodynamic, or safety data for H3B-6527 suggest that it may be preferable to 
administer H3B -6527 BID rather than QD, then the dose escalation procedure may be 
repeated for BID dosing.  In this event, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled and 
treated with a BID dose; the initial total daily dose given BID will be equal to a total daily 
dose that has been well tolerated as a QD dose (DLT rate < 33% in a cohort of 3- 6 subjects) .  
If BID administration  of H3B- 6527 is well tolerated in this initial cohort, then dose 
escalation may continue with BID dosing, following the same dose escalation rules applied to QD administration .   
Furthermore, additional cohorts of subjects may be enrolled to evaluate a less frequent dosing schedule (eg, daily for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks [dosing on Day -14 of a 21-day cycle]).   
9.4.4.2 Expansion (Part 2) 
In the Dose Expansion Phase , all subjects will receive H3B -6527 at the MTD or RP2D for a 
specific schedule as identified in th e Dose Escalation Phase of the study. 
9.4.5 Selection of Doses in the Study  
The starting dose of H3B -6527, 300 mg (first- in-human dose), is the HED of 1/6th  the 
HNSTD in dog .  Dose escalation will follow a modified Fibonacci design such that the 
magnitude of the escalation will decrease as the dose level approaches the HED of the 
HNSTD in dogs (HED ≈2000 mg). 
9.4.6 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
H3B-6527 will be supplied as 50- , 100-, and 200- mg capsules.  The starting dose will be 
300 mg/day PO, with escalation of total daily doses in successive cohorts to a maximum 
planned dose of 2000 mg (see  Section  9.1.1.1) .   
During Parts 1 and 2, s ubjects will be instructed to take the dose in conjunction with a meal  
at approximately the same time each day  (see Section 9.2 ).   
Capsules should be swallowed whole.  Dosing should not be repeated if a subject vomits.  
For subjects on a QD schedule, a dose missed by >8 hours should be skipped.  For subjects on a BID schedule a dose missed by >4 hours should be skipped. 
9.4.7 Blinding  
The study will not be blinded. 9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication (including over- the-counter medications) or therapy administered to the 
subject during the study (starting at the date of informed consent) will be recorded on the 
Prior & Concomitant Medication Case Report Form ( CRF ) or Non-Pharmacological

 Procedures CRF .  The investigator will record on the Adverse Event CRF any AE for which 
the concomitant medica tion/therapy was administered .   
9.4.8.1 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy and Procedures  
The following therapies and procedures are prohibited during study participation: 
• Other investigational drugs. 
• Other anti tumor therapies such as chemotherapy, surgical resection, or anti tumor 
immunotherapy. 
• Proton pump inhibitors. 
• Radiotherapy for central metastases (eg, vertebral, mediastinal) will not be allowed; 
the need for such radiotherapy while on study will be seen as an indication of disease progression and the subject should be withdraw n from therapy .  However, palliative 
radiotherapy for up to 2 local peripheral metastases not being used as target lesions is allowed but the need for such therapy may be an indication of PD  and should be 
discussed with the Sponsor prior to implementation .   
• Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4  enzyme  (see list  in Table  4) 
or P-glycoprotein transporter.  
• Drugs that raise serum calcium and phosphorus levels (eg, vitamin D supplements, 
calcium dietary supplements, calcium antacids)  or systemic corticosteroids.   The 
duration between the last systemic corticosteroid administration and the first dose of 
study drug should be at least 2 weeks.  If a short- term course of systemic 
corticosteroids is  required while on treatment, then study drug must be held while the 
subject receives systemic corticosteroid treatment.  If the subject has not progressed in the interim, resumption of treatment with H3B -6527 may be considered following 
discontinuation of steroid treatment and a 2-week washout period.

Medications and treatments other than those specified in Section  9.4.8.1, including palliative 
and supportive care for disease -related symptoms, are permitted during the study .  Subject s 
should be closely monitored, and treatment is to be instituted for disease-related symptoms, 
as appropriate. 
• Growth Factors:  Subjects receiving recombinant erythropoietin or darbepoietin- α 
prior to study start may continue to receive pretreatment doses.  Following initiation of study treatment, the use of erythropoietic and granulocyte growth factors is permitted in accordance with local practice or guidelines.
  American Society  for 
Clinical Oncology guidelines may be implemented at the discretion of the treating physician. 
• Management of diarrhea:  Subjects should be instructed to take loperamide, 4 mg, at the occurrence of the first loose stool and then 2 mg every 2 hours until they are diarrhea -free for at least 12 hours.  During the night, subjects may take 4 mg of 
loperamide every 4 hours.  Subjects should be advised to avoid dehydration through adequate fluid intake.  Bile acid sequestrants may be utilized in the case of bile acid diarrhea.  
Medications for the treatment of AEs or cancer symptoms, eg , packed red blood cells and 
pain medications, are allowed.  Additionally , medications (not addressed above) used to treat 
underlying medical conditions at study entry including antiemetics and anti diarrheals will be 
allowed to continue.  
Management of hyperphosphatemia or hypercalcemia:  Phosphorus and calcium will be measured at screening, before the first dose, every week with safety labs during C1, and on Day 1 and Day 8 for C2 and beyond.  Please note that a treatment cycle is 21 days.  Subjects 
with elevated levels of phosphorus or calcium at screening, as defined as being over the ULN on local lab ranges, may not participate in this study and should be referred f or management 
of such.  If successfully controlled, subjects may be rescreened.  During study participation, any confirmed levels of phosphorus above 7 mg/dL, or calcium equal to or above Grade 2 hypercalcemia as per CTCAE , Version 4.03, will result in the dose of H3B-6527 being held 
for 14 days.  The hyperphosphatemia and / or hypercalcemia should be managed by local practice, with medication, diet change and potential referral as necessary.  After 14 days of holding the drug, if the phosphorus level has returned to 5.5 mg/dL or lower, and the calcium is less than or equal to a Grade 1 elevation, the subject may begin taking H3B-6527 again at one dose level lower than their original dose and should continue other measures initiated during the drug holiday, such as phosphorus lowering agents, while on study.  If a subject should experience hyperphosphatemia above 7 mg/d L or hypercalcemia equal to or above 
Grade 2 again on study, then  study therapy will be discontinued.

may be removed from the site and hand delivered to the central or local depot by Sponsor representatives.  Where study drugs are approved for destruction at the site, destruction will occur following the site’s standard procedures and certificates of destruction will be provided to the Sponsor. 
Drug accountability will be reviewed during site visits and at the completion of the study. 
9.5 Study Assessments  
9.5.1 Assessments Subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility during the Pretreatment period, within 28 days 
before the first H3B-6527 dose.  All subject s must provide written informed consent before 
any study- related samples are collected or evaluations performed in this study , up to 8 weeks 
before the first dose of study drug.   
9.5.1.1 Pretreatment Assessments 
9.5.1.1.1 SCREENING  
Subjects in the Dose Expansion phase will be evaluated for FGF19 expression.  A fresh tumor biopsy (for determining FGF19 expression levels by a Sponsor designated laboratory), the signing of the ICF, and the collection of blood samples for pharmacodynamic analysis (same day as fresh tumor biopsy)  will be required up to 8 weeks before administration of 
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 72 of 126 
 H3B-6527 on C1 Day 1, in order to enroll in the Dose Expansion Phase of the study.  The 
28-day Screening Period will begin when any of the remaining screening assessments are 
performed.  The entire Pretreatment Phase must be completed within 8 weeks of study drug administration on C1 Day 1.  Subjects enrolled in the Dose Escalation phase are not required to be FGF19-positive. 
9.5.1.1.2 DEMOGRAPHY  
The s ubject s’ demographic  information will be collected during Screening.  Demographic  
information includes date of birth (or age), sex, race/ethnicity.  
9.5.1.1.3 MEDICAL HISTORY  
Medical and surgical history and current medical conditions will be recorded at the Screening Visit and updated at B aseline, prior to administration of the first H3B -6527 dose.  The 
medical history will also  include cancer history ( including the subject’s primary tumor type, 
date of and stage at diagnosis, method of diagnosis, etiology) extent of disease (including portal vein invasion/thrombosis) , and all previous treatments, including radiation therapy, 
and response to suc h treatment.  As part of the subject ’s cancer history, study centers are to 
submit a local histology or cytology report obtained prior to enrollment, if available .  
9.5.1.2 Efficacy Assessments  
9.5.1.2.1 TUMOR IMAGING  
All subjects are required to undergo chest, abdomen, and pelvis imaging at baseline and all follow-up time points.  Contrast- enhanced CT scan of the chest and contrast-enhanced CT 
scan or MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and any other areas of disease, as clinically indicated, will be acquired at Screening and at all imaging time points.  A liver CT scan or MRI must be performed using triphasic scanning techniques optimized to capture pre contrast, arterial, 
and portal venous phases.  Copies of all tumor imaging scans must be retained by the investigators.  If requested by the Sponsor or by the health a uthorities, these copies
 will be 
sent to an imaging core laboratory designated by the Sponsor for quality assessment, archiving, and potential future review.  Histo rical standard -of-care scans conducted within 
28 days prior to study drug administration may be used  as screening/ baseline imaging if 
scanning parameters are consistent with the requirements for this protocol  as separately 
defined by the imaging core laboratory. 
MRI scans (optimized for precontrast, arterial phase, and portal venous phase) may be used 
instead of CT scans for imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.  However, the chest must be imaged using CT; and chest disease must be followed by CT  scan  (ie, chest x -ray for 
response assessment is not allowed) .  If iodinated intravenous ( IV) contrast is 
contraindicated, chest CT scan should be performed without IV contrast .   
Imaging studies are to be repeated during the Treatment Phase and Extension Phase every 6 weeks, or more frequently if clinically indicated, until disease progression, withdrawal of

 consent, or the subject receives another anticancer therapy .  The same method of assessment 
used during Screening  must be used at all subsequent time points.  
After initiation of treatment, if a subject is unable to undergo a contrast CT due to allergy or 
renal insufficiency, a chest CT scan without contrast, combined with MRI images of the 
remaining anatomy with gadoli nium contrast, is preferred if tolerated by the subject.  If it is 
determined that neither CT scan nor MRI IV contrast can be tolerated by the subject, a chest CT scan without contrast combined with high quality T1 and T2 weighted MRI images of the remaini ng anatomy, should be provided.  Importantly, such a modality switch will render the 
subsequent measurements of target lesions, especially typical hepatic target lesions, inadequate and the target lesion disease should be followed as not evaluable or potentially progressing (if sufficient evidence is available).  
CT and MRI scans should be of diagnostic quality acquired on spiral or multidetector CT with oral and IV contrast.  Low -dose, noncontrast CT transmission scans from positron 
emission tomography/CT scanner are not acceptable.  Spiral or multidetector CT  scans 
should be performed with a 5-mm contiguous slice reconstruction algorithm.  If MRI scans are acquired, contiguous 5- mm slice thickness with minimal gap are also recommended.  
Ultrasound should not be used for radiographic assessment.  A chest x -ray or skeletal x -ray 
that clearly demonstrates a new metastatic lesion may be used to document progression in lieu of the CT/MRI scans.  
A brain scan should be performed for all subjects to assess potential central nervous system disease and/or metastases as clinically indicated .  For eligible subjects with previously 
treated brain metastases, a brain scan will be required at all tumor assessment t ime points (eg, 
every 6 weeks).  For all subjects, a follow-up brain scan must be performed to confirm a complete response ( CR) within 1 week following response confirmation.   
If a subject discontinues treatment prior to  C3 Day 1 (ie, 6 weeks after the fi rst study drug 
dose on C1 Day 1) , the scans for tumor assessment should be performed as close as possible 
to C3 Day 1, but before another anticancer therapy is initiated.  
If a subject discontinue s study treatment  due to radiographic evidence of PD, then imaging 
studies are not required a t the OTV.   
During the Follow-up Period, subjects who discontinue study treatment without objective evidence of PD will continue to have tumor assessments (including brain scans as clinically indicated) performed every 6 weeks from the date of last tumor assessment, or sooner if clinically indicated, until PD is documented . 
The tumor assessment schedule should not be affected by interruptions in therapy or any other events.  
Tumor a ssessments will be performed following mRECIST guidance ( Appendix 1) for HCC 
using triphasic liver CT/MRI (optimized for pre contrast , arterial phase, and portal venous 
phase).

 9.5.1.2.2 SURVIVAL  
After the OTV, all subjects who discontinue study treatment, regardless of their reasons for 
doing so, will be followed for survival via telephone (for those subjects who experience PD or initiate a new  anticancer therapy) or office visit (for those subjects still undergoing tumor 
assessments).  Subjects will be followed for survival approximately every 12 weeks for up to 12 months or until 6 cycles after last patient in, death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of 
consent, whichever occurs first.     
9.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker 
Assessments 
Tumor tissue samples and blood samples for pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics ( PG), 
and other biomarker assessments will be collected, as indicated in Table  6 and Table  7 except 
where prohibited by regional or local laws.   
Instructions for the processing, storage, and shipment  of PK, pharmacodynamic, PG, and 
other biomarker samples will be provided in the Lab oratory Manual. 
9.5.1.3.1 PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS  
Blood samples for PK assessments are to be collected from all subjects according to the 
schedule designated in Table 6 and Table  7.  A protocol deviation will be reported only when 
a PK time point is not collected  (missing) or blood is drawn on the wrong study day.  
For subjects in Part 1, dose  escalation, an aliquot of blood from the sample collected at each 
PK time point will be transferred for use for exploratory assessment of the metabolite profile 
of H3B-6527. 
Plasma concentrations of H3 B-6527 will be determined using a validated assay.   
Additionally, urine samples for assessment of the metabolite profile of H3B-6527 will be 
collected during C1 from subjects in Part 1 , dose escalation , only, according to the schedule 
designated in Table 6 . 
The total urine volume collected during each designated interval is to be documented in the CRF.  
During the Dose Expansion phase , H3B -6527 levels in tumor tissue may be analyzed using a 
nonvalidated assay such as matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization .  During the Dose 
Escalation Phase, the investigators and Sponsor may agree that determination of H3B-6527 exposure in tumor tissue is required to guide dosing decisions.  In this scenario, biopsies of tumor tissue will be obtaine d from all consenting subjects. 
9.5.1.3.2 PHARMACODYNAMIC  AND OTHER BIOMARKER ASSESSMENTS IN BLOOD  
Blood samples for determination of biomarkers (in serum and/or plasma) will be collected from all subjects at the time points designated in Table 6  and Table  7. 
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101 
 
 
H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 75 of 126 
 Such samples may be analyzed for FGF19 (ligand of H3B-6527’s target FGFR4), bile acids, 
circulating tumor cells , alpha-fetoprotein, and other exploratory biomarker candidates (both 
protein and nucleic acids) using global proteomic/metabolomics/genomic methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, multiplex bead-based immunoassay, or other assays/methods.  These blood biomarker samples may be used for exploratory analysis for evaluation of response- related and/or safety -related outcomes, as well as for potential use in diagnostic 
development.  Retrospective testing for potential subject stratification markers may also be explored.   
During the d ose e scalation  phase, results from biomarker studies may be used to aid the 
selection of the RP2D and schedule, and for monitoring drug efficacy.  When new research 
results emerge, the parameters and methods for the pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis 
may c hange. 
9.5.1.3.3 PHARMACODYNAMICS AND BIOMARKERS IN TISSUE  
Archival Tumor Tissue Collection  
For all subjects , an archival tumor tissue block or slide obtained before the first planned dose 
is to be collected , if available, any time during the study.  Archival tumor tissue may be used 
for assessment of mutations and other exploratory biomarkers. 
Screening Tumor Biopsy  
Subjects in Part 1, the Dose Escalation  phase, may have a fresh tumor sample, collected 
during Screening  if an archival sample is not available; however, this is not a requirement for 
study participation. 
For all subjects in the Expansion phase, the signing of the ICF, the collection of blood 
samples for pharmacodynamic analysis (same day as fresh tumor biopsy), and a fresh tumor tissue sample (for determining FGF19 expression levels by a Sponsor designated laboratory) is required  to be collected up to 8 weeks before administration of the first dose of H3B-6527 
on C1 Day 1.  The 28- day Screening Period will begin when any of the remaining screening 
assessments are performed.  
Additional Tumor Tissue Samples  
In the event a subject is required to have a repeat tumor biopsy for medically indicated reasons, freshly obtained biopsy tissue from the procedure should be collected and shipped to H3 Biomedicine  or a predesignated laboratory for exploratory biomarker analysis. 
9.5.1.3.4 PHARMACOGENOMIC ASSESSMENTS  
A blood sample will be collected at baseline for PG analysis.  If the sample cannot be 
collected at baseline, it may be collected at any time point thereafter.

 This sample may be used to evaluate t he role of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) sequence 
variability on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of 
H3B-6527. 
Furthermore, genomic DNA extracted f rom blood samples may be used to confirm whether 
the DNA sequence variants observed in DNA extracted from tumor material are limited to 
the tumor.   
DNA will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject 
does not currently have .  Any sample or derivatives (DNA,  ribonucleic acid, and protein) 
may be stored for up to 15 years to assist in any research scientific questions related to H3B -
6527 or cancer. 
9.5.1.4 Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments include monitoring and recording all AEs, including SAEs; clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, coagulation parameters, clinical chemistry (including total bile acids , cholesterol, triglycerides), and urinalysis); and periodic measurement of vital 
signs, ECGs, MUGA/echocardiogram, and ophthalmic and physical examinations.  Additionally, QTc intervals will be evaluated during the Dose  Escalation  phase. 
AEs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute  CTCAE, Version  4.03. 
9.5.1.4.1 ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the m edicinal product.  For this study, the study drug is H3B-6527.   
The criteria for identifying AEs in this study are:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product ( Note:  Every sign or 
symptom should not be listed as a separate AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is being reported as an AE) 
• Any new disease or exacerbatio n of an existing disease.  However, worsening of the 
primary disease should be captured under efficacy assessments as disease progression rather than as an AE.  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol- required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg , ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study drug 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)  
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101 
 
 
H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 77 of 126 
 • An abnormal laboratory test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory 
abnormality leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study drug, or withholding 
of study drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not  
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the OTV (ie, within 30 days after the last study drug dose).  Subjects who fail Screening  primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to 
screen failure reported on the Screening Disposition CRF.  Serious AEs (SAEs) will be collected for 30 days after the last dose  
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE .  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in  deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF.   
Abnormal ECG (QTc) results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QT corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula ( QTcF) interval is >450 ms and
 there is an increase of >60 ms from 
baseline.  Any ECG abnormality that the investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such.  
All AE s must be followed for 28 days or 5  × the half- life, ( whichever is longer)  after the 
subject’s last dose, or until resolution, whichever comes first.  All SAEs  must be followed to 
resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  
Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.  
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events  
AEs will be graded on a 5-point scale according to CTCAE, Version 4.03 ( Appendix 2).  
Investigators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing severity).  
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment  
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
• The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
Clinical Study Protocol   H3B -6527 -G000 -101 
 
 
H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 78 of 126 
 • The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event  
• The presence of nonstudy, treatment- related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event  
Classification of Causality  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF in response to the following question: 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the AE? Yes (related)  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility. 
No (not related) A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility.  
9.5.1.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST  
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening ( ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE  as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopar dize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations .   
In addition to the above, events associated with special situations include pregnancy or 
exposure to study drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error.  These events associated with special situations are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they meet 1 of the above cri teria.  All AEs associated with special situations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs .   
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.

H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 79 of 126 
 The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because there is no “AE ” (ie, 
there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization:  
• Hospitalizations for respite care  
• Planned hospitalizations required by the protocol 
• Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed post study drug administr ation) 
• Hospitalization for routine maintenance of a device ( eg, battery replacement) that was in 
place before study entry 
If possible, a blood sample for PK analysis should be drawn at the first report of an SAE or a 
severe unexpected AE and at its resolut ion. 
9.5.1.4.3 LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS  
Clinical laboratory tests to be performed, including hematology, chemistry, coagulation parameters, and urinalysis, are summarized in Table  5.  The Schedules of 
Procedures/Assessments ( Table 6 and Table  7) show the visits and time points at which 
blood for clinical laboratory tests and urine for urinalysis will be collected in the study.  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by the local laboratory.  Laboratory certification 
as available will be included in the final clinical study report for this study. 
Screening laborat ory assessments may be used as the Baseline assessment if performed 
within 72 hours before the first study drug dose.  All hematology, blood chemistry (including 
pregnancy test, as applicable)  and urinalysis samples are to be obtained prior to study drug 
administration and results reviewed prior to administration/dispensing of study drug at the beginning of each treatment cycle (refer to Section 9.4.2).  Total bile acids will be collected with blood chemistries but, due to potentially long turnaround times, results are not required for individual subject  treatment decisions prior to the st art of each cycle.   However,  results 
should be reviewed when available.  Additionally,  total bile acids  will be reviewed in 
aggregate to look for any potential safety trends as outlined in the existing safety review plan.  The primary purpose of this retrospective review is to look for a potential correlation with 
clinical observations of related signs and symptoms.
 
Subjects should be in a seated or supine position during blood collection.

A laboratory abnormality may meet the criteria to qualify as an AE as described in this 
protocol ( see Section  9.5.1.4.1) and the CRF Completion Guidelines.  In these instances, the 
AE corresponding to the laboratory abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. 
9.5.1.4.4 VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS  
Vital sign measurements ( ie, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [ mmHg], heart rate  
[HR; beats per minute], respiratory rate [ RR; per minute], body temperature [in centigrade]), 
and weight (kg) will be obtained a s designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments 
(Table 6 and  Table  7) by a validated method.  BP , HR, and RR will be measured after the 
subject has been sitting  for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be performed on the 
same arm, preferably by the same per son.   
Height (cm) is to be measured during Screening  only. 
When vital signs are to be obtained concurrently with PK or other blood samples, the vital sign measurements will be performed prior to drawing blood samples in order to maximize the accuracy of b lood sampling times while minimizing the potential effects of blood 
drawing on recordings obtained during safety assessments.

 9.5.1.4.5 PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS  
Comprehensive and symptom- directed physical examinations and ophthalmic examinations 
will be performed as designated in  the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 6 and 
Table  7).  Documentation of the physical examination will be included in the source 
documentation at the site.  Significant findings during the Pretreatment Period will be 
recorded on the Medical History and Curre nt Medical Conditions CRF.  Changes from 
pretreatment physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. 
Comprehensive Physical Examination 
A comprehensive physical examination will include evaluation s of the head, eyes, ears, nose, 
throat, neck, chest  (including heart and lungs), abdomen, limbs, skin, and a complete 
neurological examination.  The subject will  be queried regarding physical status and 
subject ive symptoms  as well .  A urogenital examination will only be required in the presence 
of clinical symptoms related to this region.  
Symptom -directed Physical Examination 
The subject must be queried regarding changes in physical st atus since the last examination 
and a symptom-directed physical examination accordingly conducted. 
Ophthalmic Examination 
As part of the ophthalmological examination, a visual acuity test, funduscopic examination (mydriatic test if necessary), slit- lamp examination (fluorescein staining will be performed if 
necessary), and an anterior eye optical coherence tomography (OCT) for assessing the corneal epithelium will be performed.  The central corneal thickness will be measured as part 
of the anterior eye OCT and recorded on the CRF.  Any clinically significant changes in OCT will be captured and recorded as AEs.   The ophthalmological examination may be 
completed within 7 days prior to Day 1 of each applicable cycle.  Ophthalmic examinations performed within 8 weeks of C1 Day 1 can be used in the event of a rescreen. 
9.5.1.4.6 ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS  AND HOLTER MONITORING  
For all subjects, 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained as designated in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments ( Table 6 and  Table  7).  In the event of any alteration, or if clinically 
necessary, an echocardiogram and/or cardiac enzymes should be performed.  
In Part 1, Dose  Escalation, the effects of H3B -6527 on cardiovascular repolarization will be 
evaluated via 12-lead continuous Holter/ECG monitoring on C1 Day 1 and on Day 8.  The  
continuous Holter monitoring must begin at least 1 hour prior to dose on C1 Days 1 and 8 and will continue through 10 hours postdose for all subjects regardless of dose schedule (QD or BID) in the Dose Escalation Phase of the study. 
Additionally, Holter monitoring/ECGs (12 -lead) are to be collected 1  hour before the first 
dose (at 3 time points) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours postdose on C1 Days 1 and 8.  At each of these time points, subjects should be supinely resting for at least 10 minutes before

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 82 of 126 
 and 5 minutes after the nominal time .  When coinciding, blood collection, vital signs, and 
12-lead safety ECG s should be performed immediately after the time window for ECG 
extraction .   
Screening & baseline ECGs will be performed as singles.  However, if clinically indicated, 
triplicates will be performed  at screening and baseline .  All other ECGs after 
screening /baseline  will be performed as singles. 
Individual ECGs will be extracted from the Holter recordings at specified time points per ECG manual and will be evaluated by a central laboratory.  QT intervals will be measured 
from Lead II and will be corrected fo r QTcF correction factors.  The primary QTc parameter 
will be QTcF.  Secondary parameters (QT corrected for heart rate using Bazett’s formula [QTcB ], QT, QRS, PR, and heart rate) and wave forms (T waves) will be evaluated. 
An ECG abnormality may meet the c riteria of an AE as described in this protocol ( see 
Section  9.5.1.4.1) and the CRF Completion Guidelines .  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. 
For ECG abnormalities meeting the criteria of an SAE (see Section  9.5.1.4.2), the site must 
fax or email the SAE report including the ECG report to the Sponsor using the SAE form 
(see Section  9.5.4.1).  
9.5.1.4.7 ECOG  PERFORMANCE STATUS  
ECOG performance status is to be determined  as designated in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments ( Table 6 and Table  7).   
The ECOG performance status scale, with corresponding Karnofsky performance status 
score equivalents, is presented in  Appendix 3. 
9.5.1.4.8 ECHOCARDIOGRAM /MUGA  
MUGA scans or echocardiograms will be performed during the Pretreatment Phase, at the OTV (±1 week) , and if clinically indicated during treatment.  MUGA scans or 
echocardiograms performed within 8 weeks of C1 Day 1 can be used in the event of a rescreen.  MUGA scans and echocardiograms will b e performed locally in accordance with 
the institution’s standard practice.  
9.5.1.4.9 PREGNANCY TEST 
A serum pregnancy test (β -hCG) will be performed during Screening  for all premenopausal 
women and postmenopausal women who have been amenorrheic for less than 12 mon ths.  A 
urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed before the first H3B-6527 dose and at the 
OTV.

f: Ophthalmic examination by an ophthalmologist will be p erformed at Screening  (or within 7 days prior to Day 1 of each  applicable  cycle) , on C1 Day 8, C2 Day 1, and on 
Day 1 of all subsequent cycles  (through C6), and at the off- treatment visit.   Ophthalmic exam inations  performed within 8 weeks of C1 Day 1 can be used in the event of a 
rescreen.  After C6, OCT will be required only on Day 1 of every other cycle.   As part of the ophthalmological examination, a visual acuity test, funduscopic examination 
(mydriatic test if necessary), slit- lamp examinat ion (fluorescein staining will be performed if necessary), and an anterior eye OCT for assessing the central corneal thickness 
will be performed.  The central corneal thickness will be measured as part of the anterior eye OCT and recorded on the CRF.  
g: MUGA scans or echocardiograms will be performed during the Pretreatment Phase, during the OTV (window of ±1 week) , and if clinically indicated during treatment .  
MUGA scans or echocardiograms performed within 8 weeks of C1 Day 1 can be used in the event of a  rescreen.  MUGA scans and echocardiograms will be performed 
locally in accordance with the Institution’s standard practice.  
h: A serum pregnancy test (β -hCG) will be performed during Screening for all premenopausal women and postmenopausal women who have been amenorrheic for less than 
12 months.  A urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed before the first H3B-6527 dose and at the OTV.  
i: Vital signs include BP, HR, RR, and body temperature, as well as weight.  BP, HR, and RR will be collected after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes.  Height will be 
measured during Screening only.  
j: Screening and baseline ECGs will be performed as singles.  However, if clinically indicated, triplicates will be performed  at screening and baseline .  All other ECGs after 
screening/ baseline  will be performed as singles.   
k: Continuous Holter monitoring will begin at least 1 hour prior to dosing through 10 hours post-dose on C1 Days 1 and 8.  S ubjects should be supinely resting for at least 
10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after the following time points, pre -dose (3 time points within 1 hour of dose) and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 ,8 and 10 hours postdose .  When 
coinciding, blood draws, vital signs and 12-lead safety ECGs should be performed immediately after the time window for ECG extraction.  
l: Hematology and blood chemistry samples will be obtained before drug administration.  Screening assessments may be used as baseline assessments if performed within 
72 hours of the first dose of study medication.  Hematology includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, platelet count, WBC and differential.  Chemistry includes albumin, 
alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, BUN, calcium, carbon dioxide, chloride, creatinine, glucose, inorganic phosphorus, pot assium, total protein, GGT, LDH, ALT, AST, 
cholesterol, triglycerides, sodium, uric acid , and total bile acids .  Total bile acids will be collected with blood chemistries but, results are not required for individual subject 
treatment decisions prior to the start of each cycle, but should be reviewed once available.  Coagulation parameters (prothrombin time or International Normalized Ratio, and 
activated partial thromboplastin time) will be collected at within 72 hours of dosing on Day 1 of each cycle, and at the OTV.  
m: Urine samples will be obtained before drug administration.  Analysis will include assessment of appearance, specific gravity and pH as well as a semi -quantitative “dipstick” 
evaluation of glucose, protein, bilirubin, ketones, leukocytes and blood.  Microscopic examination of sediment will be performed if urinalysis is positive for leukocytes, 
proteins, or blood.    
n: Blood samples will be collected at baseline for PG analyses.  If it cannot be collected at the designated time point, it may be collected at a time point after baseline.  
o: Urine will be collected for exploratory metabolite profiling on Day 8 , at the following collection intervals:  0 to 6 hours , 6 to 12  hours and 12 to 24  hours .  Total urine volume 
collected during each interval will be  recorded.   
p: For QD dosing, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected in C1 on D ay 1 and D ay 8 at predose (0 hours), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h ours (immediately prior to the 
next dose); and at Day 15 predose (0 hours ).  An aliquot of blood from each collection time point will be used for exploratory H3B-6527 metabolite profiling.   For BID 
dosing, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on C1 on Day 1 and Day 8 at predose (0 hours), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours  (imm ediately prior to the next daily 
dose), and at Day 15 predose (0 hours ).  The ±3 day -window does not apply  to the PK sampling  on Day 8. 
q: Blood samples for pharmacodynamic analysis (eg, circulating proteins, total bile acids) will be collected prior to dosing (all subjects will be required to fast 2 hours prior to 
pharmacodynamic assessments ) at the following time points:  Baseline, predose (0  hours ) on C1  Day 1, Day 8, and D ay 15, and D ay 1 and D ay 8 of subsequent cycles  
through cycle 6 , and at the OTV .

r: Blood samples for nucleic -acid and CTC/cf based pharmacodynamic analysis will be collected prior to dosing (all subjects will be required to fast 2 hours prior to blood 
sample collection ) at the following time points:  Baseline, predose (0 hours ) on C1  Day 1 , Day 8, and D ay 15, and D ay 1 and D ay 8 of subsequent cycles  through cycle 6, and 
at the OTV . 
s: An archival tumor tissue block or slide  (if available) must  be obtained any time  during the  study.  Archival tumor tissue may be used for assessment of mutations and other 
exploratory biomarkers.  
t: Subjects may have a fresh tumor sample collected during Screening if an archival sample is not available; however, this is not a requirement for study participation  for the 
Dose Escalation Phase.  In the event that a subject is required to have a repeat tumor biopsy for medically indicated reasons,  freshly obtained biopsy  tissue from the procedure 
should be collected and shipped to H3 Biomedicine  or a predesignated laboratory for exploratory biomarker analysis  as per instructions in the laboratory manual . 
u: Screening CT/MRI of the brain should be performed as clinically indicated.  For eligible subjects with previously treated bra in metastases, a brain scan will be required at all 
tumor assessment time  points.  For all subjects, a follow-up brain scan must be performed to confirm a CR within 1 week following response confirmation.  
v: Tumor assessments will be performed based on mRECIST.  CT scans (with oral and intravenous contrast) of chest, abdomen, pelvis and other known sites of disease will be 
obtained at Screening (within 28 days prior to C1/Day 1), every 6 weeks during the Treatment and Extension phases , and as clinically indicated.  Subjects will also have 
triphasic liver CT or MRI performed (optimized for precontrast, arterial phase, and portal venous phase).   Historical standard-of- care scans conducted within 28 days prior to 
dosing may be utilized as baseline imaging if scanning parameters are consistent with the requirements for this protocol.  
w: MRI scans (optimized for precontrast, arterial phase, and portal venous phase) may be used instead of CT scans for imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.  However, the chest must be imaged using CT; and chest disease must be followed by CT (ie, chest x-ray for response assessment is not allowed).  If iodinated IV contrast is contraindicated, chest 
CT scan should be performed without IV contrast.  The same method of assessment must be used at all time points as used at Screening.    
x: The first radiological assessment of tumor response status will be performed at Week 6, unless there is clinical indication warranting earlier radiologic imaging.  If subjects discontinue study treatment  for radiographic evidence of disease progression, tumor assessments are not required at the off- treatment assessment.  During the Follow -up 
Period, subjects who discontinue study treatment without objective evidence of disease progression, tumor assessments (including brain scans as clinically indicated) will continue to be performed every 6 weeks from the date of last tumor assessment, or sooner if clinically indicated, until  documented disease progression or initiation of  another 
anticancer therapy.  
y: H3B -6527 should be taken daily at the assigned  schedule and dose in conjunction with a meal.  On visit days, subjects should not take study medication before evaluations are 
performed.   
z: Subjects who discontinue study treatment will be followed for survival.  Survival follow -up will be conducted approximately every 12 weeks for up to 12 months or until 6 
cycles after last patient in, death, loss to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.

 9.5.2.1 Description of Procedures/Assessments Schedule 
The schedules of assessments are presented in Table 6 and Table  7, and details regarding the 
assessments to be performed are presented in Section 9.5.1. 
9.5.3 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Planned assessments are standard measurements for this type of study and are considered 
appropriate .  Per the US FDA guidance, demographic data, complete subject medical 
histories, including cancer treatment history, a nd baseline disease status are to be for all 
subject s prior to administration of the first dose of study drug ( FDA Guidance for Industry 
2001; European Medicines Agency 2011).  Study drug administration data, including dose interruptions and modifications and the associated reason(s), also are to be documented (FDA Guidance for Industry 2001; European Medicines Agency 2011).  
AEs and SAEs will be monitored in this study in accorda nce with ICH GCP guidelines to 
ensure the safety of subject s.  Furthermore, additional safety assessments conducted during 
this study, including physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs assessments, and clinical laboratory tests, are widely used and genera lly recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant .  
These tests and procedures also will be monitored in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. 
Tumor response and progression will be assessed using standard criteria for the assessment of disease response in solid tumors.  
The effects of H3B -6527 in FGF19 and other FGFR4-related biomarkers and any correlation 
with safety and antitumor activity will be evaluated during the study.   
9.5.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Events Associated 
with Special Situations  
9.5.4.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs , regardless of their relationship to study treatment, must be reported on a 
completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours from when the investigator  becomes aware of the event . 
SAEs , regardless of causality assessment, must be collected through the OTV (ie, 30 days 
after the last study drug dose).  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization .  Any SAE judged by the investigator to be related to the study 
treatment or any protocol-required procedure should be reported to the Sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed since study completion. 
For urgent safety issues, please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to 
the subject and contact the appropriate study team member listed in the Investigator Study File.

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 94 of 126 
 It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator ’s assessment of causality.  
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 1 business day of its receipt .  If the follow -up information changes the investigator ’s assessment of causality, 
this should also be noted on the follow -up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions including copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents requested by the Sponsor. 
The investigator must notify his/her IRB/IEC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, if 
required by their institution.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to the Sponsor or designee to be filed in the Sponsor ’s Trial Master File.  
9.5.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding 
Any pregnancy in which the estimated date of conception is either before the last visit or within 30 days of last study treatment or any exposure to study drug through breastfeeding during study treatment or within 28 days of last st udy treatment must be reported. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this should be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to study treatment.  
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous abortion is  considered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same time frame and in the 
same format as all other SAEs (see Section  9.5.4.1) . 
Pregnancies or exposure to study drug through breastfeeding must be reported by fax or email as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the investigator becomes awar e of the pregnancy.  The contact information for the reporting of pregnancies 
and exposure to study drug through breastfeeding is provided in the Investigator Study File.  The Pregnancy Report Form must be used for reporting.  All pregnancies must be followed to outcome.  The outcome of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the investigator becomes aware of the outcome.  
Study drug must be discontinued immediately for any subject who becomes pregnant during 
the study.

 9.5.4.3 Reporting of Events Associated with Special Situations 
9.5.4.3.1 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , 
MISUSE , ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR  
AEs associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer to AEs 
associated with uses of the study drug outside of that specified by the protocol.  Overdose, 
misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:  
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol-defined dose.   
Misuse  Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with 
the protocol .   
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intentional excessive use of study drug accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. 
Medication er ror Any unintentional event that  causes or leads to inappropriate study 
drug use or subject harm while the study drug is in the control of site personnel or the subject. 
All AEs associated with overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error should be captured on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using the procedures detailed in Section  9.5.4.1 even if 
the AEs do not meet serious crite ria.  Abuse is always to be captured as an AE .  If the AE 
associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF 
9.5.4.4 Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor must inform investigators and regulatory authorities of reportable  events, in 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis ( ie, within 
specific time frames) .  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE 
information in the manner described above. 
9.5.4.5 Breaking the Blind 
Not applicable. 
9.5.4.6 Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events  
AEs will be reported by the Sponsor or a third party acting on behalf of the Sponsor to 
regulatory authorities in compliance with local and regional law and established guidance.  The format of these reports will be dictated by the local and regional requirements.

 All studies that are conducted within any European country will comply with European GCP  
Directive 2005/28/EC and Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC.  All SUSARs will be 
reported, as required, to the competent authorities of all involved European member states. 
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects  
The investigator may discontinue study drug for a subject at any time for safety or 
administrative reasons.  A subject may elect to discontinue study drug and study participation 
at any time for any reason .  All subjects who discontinue study drug are to comple te the 
Off-Treatment visit, as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments Table 6 and 
Table  7).   
Study drug is to be discontinued for the following reasons:  
• Progression of disease that, in the opinion of the investigator , precludes further study 
treatment.  (After consultation with the Sponsor , H3B -6527 may be continued for a 
subject who has met the criteria for PD but, in the investigator’s opinion, is receiving benefit.) 
• Occurrence of an unacceptable AE.  
• Subjects who do not receive study drug for at least 17 of 21 days (approximately 80%, not necessarily consecutively) during the first cycle for reasons not considered to be a DLT by both the investigators and the Sponsor will be replaced.  The subjects who are replaced will not be considered evaluable for DLT assessments.  
• Subject requi res use of a prohibited concomitant medication or therapy. 
• General or specific changes in the subject ’s condition unacceptable for further treatment 
within the study parameters, in the judgment of the i nvestigator.  
• Non-compliance.   
• Lost to follow -up. 
• Subject, i nvestigator,  or Sponsor request.   
The reason for study drug discontinuation is to be documented in the CRF. 
Subjects who discontinue study drug for reasons other than PD are to continue to have tumor 
measurements and disease response assessments performed every 6 weeks until the development of PD.  After development of PD, subjects who discontinue study treatment, regardless of their reasons for doing so, will be followed for survival approximately every 12 weeks for up to 12 months or until 6 cycles after last patient in, death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  However, subjects may continue to receive 
study treatment, as long as they demonstrate clinical benefit as judged by the investigator 
after discussion with the Sponsor  or until the end of the study. 
Study participation also may be discontinued for any of the following r easons:

 • Subject withdrawal of consent  
• Non-compliance 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor request 
• Closure of the study by the Sponsor. 
The reason for study discontinuation is to be documented in the CRF. 
The investigator will promptly explain to the subject involved that the study will be 
discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary measures for the subject .  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed by 
mail, tele phone, or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, 
the status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms. 
9.5.6 Abuse or Diversion of Study Drug 
Not applicable. 9.5.7 Confirmation of Medical Care by Another Physici an 
The investigator will instruct subjects to inform site personnel when they are planning to 
receive medical care by another physician .  At each visit, the investigator will ask the subject 
whether he/she has received medical care by another physician sin ce the last visit or is 
planning to do so in the future .  When the subject is going to receive medical care by another 
physician, the investigator, with the consent of the subject, will inform the other physician that the subject is participating in the cl inical study.  
9.6 Data Quality Assurance  
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, Standard Operating Procedures, working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines.  Site audits may be made periodically by the Sponsor ’s or the CRO’s qualified 
compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from the study team responsible for conduct of the study.   
9.6.1 Data Collection  
Data required by the protocol will be collected on the CRFs and entered into a validated data 
management system that is compliant with all regulatory requirements .  As defined by ICH 
guidelines, the CRF is a printed, optical, or electronic document designed to record all of the protocol- required information to be reported to the Sponsor on each study subject. 
Data collection on the CRF must follow the instructions described in the CRF Completion Guidelines.  The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all

 of the study only.  Individual ECGs will be extracted from the Holter recordings at specified 
time points per ECG manual and will be evaluated by a central laboratory.  QT intervals will 
be measured from Lead II and will be corrected for QTcF correction factors.  The primary QTc parameter will be QTcF ; secondary parameters (QTcB , QT, QRS,  OTcB,  PR, and heart 
rate) and waveforms (T waves) will be evaluated.  
9.7.1.8.1 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE  
Descriptive statistics for subjects treated, including the duration of treatment, the number of cycles received , and the number of subjects requiring dose changes , will be presented .  A 
by-subject listing of the date of study drug administration and the dose administered will be presented.  
9.7.1.8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS  
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from  the CRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) .  AEs will be coded to the MedDRA (Version 18.0 or higher) lower level term 
closest to the verbatim term .  The linked MedDRA PT and primary system organ class (SOC) 
are also captured in the database.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event  (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during 
treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or  
• Reemerges during treatment, having bee n present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped 
before treatment, or  
• Worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.  
Only those AEs that were treatment emergent will be included in summary table s.  All AEs, 
treatment emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listing s. 
The TEAEs will be summarized overall and by study part and cohort.  The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by SOC and PT.  A subject will be counted only once within a SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific SOC and PT .  The number (percentage) of subjects with 
TEAEs will also be summarized by maximum CTCAE grade . 
The number (percenta ge) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by relationship to 
study drug ( Yes [related] and No [not related] ). 
The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs leading to death will be summarized by MedDRA SOC and PT overall and for each  study part and cohort.  A subject data listing  of

In DLT -evaluable subjects, t he number (percentage) of subjects with DLT will be presented 
by dose level for Dose Escalation phase of the study.  Listing of subjects with DLT will be provided. 
9.7.1.8.3 LABORATOR Y VALUES  
Laboratory results will be summarized using Système International (SI) units, as appropriate .  
For all quantitative parameters listed in Section  9.5.1.4.3, the actual value and the change 
from baseline to each postbaseline visit and to the end of treatment (defined as the last on -
treatment value) will be summarized by visit and study part and dose cohort using descriptive statistics.  Qualitative parameters listed in Section  9.5.1.4.3 will be summarized using 
frequencies (number and perc entage of subjects), and changes from baseline to each 
postbaseline visit and to end of treatment will be reported using shift table s.  Percentages will 
be based on the number of subjects with both nonmissing baseline and relevant postbaseline results.   
Furthermore, the frequency of laboratory abnormalities by maximum postbaseline CTCAE 
grade will be tabulated by cycle and overall for selected laboratory parameters to include at least hemoglobin, white blood cell count, ANC, lymphocytes, platelet count, AST , ALT, 
bilirubin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and electrolytes .  Shift tables will also be 
produced for these parameters based on the baseline CTCAE grade and the maximum CTCAE grade overall and by cycle.

 Absolute QTc interval prolongation: 
• QTc interval  >450 ms 
• QTc interval >480 ms 
• QTc interval > 500 ms 
Change from baseline in QTc inte rval: 
• QTc interval increases from baseline >30  ms 
• QTc interval increases from baseline >60 ms  
All ECG abnormalities will be listed on a per- subject basis.  
9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size  
Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1) 
It is anticipated that selection of the R P2D will be based on an integrated evaluation of 
safety, tolerability, clinical benefit, PK, and pharmacodynamic data.  The total number of 
subjects to be enrolled is dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of subjects p er dose cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required to 
achieve the MTD and/or RP2D.  For each dose schedule of QD and BID, a ssuming 5 dose 
levels for QD dose schedule and 3 dose levels for the BID dose schedule will be studied and 
a maximum of 6 subjects will be enrolled per dose level, then between 30 to 48 subjects may be accrued during dose escalation.  
Dose Expansion Phase (Part 2) 
A total of approximately 40 to 80 subjects will be enrolled in the Dose E xpansion phase.  
Prior to starting the Dose Expansion phase, the investigators and the Sponsor will use safety, 
efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data obtained during the Dose Escalation Phase, as well 
as clinical judgement, to jointly determine the dose schedules to be studied.  
During Part 2, the Dose Expansion phase, a sample size of 40 evaluable subjects per dose 
schedule will be enrolled  to examine QD and/or BID dosing of H3B-6527 based on the 
recommended dose determined from Part 1  (Table  8).  For a reference of the precision of 
ORR estimates, the associated 2 -sided 95% CIs for ORR up to 30% (40 subjects) are 
provided in Table  9.  
This study makes provision for exploring a BID schedule of H3B-6527 during the Dose 
Expansion phase if evaluation of the PK, pharmacodynamics, or safety of H3B-6527 suggests that it may be preferable to administer H3B -6527 BID rather than QD.  When both 
dose schedules are accruing subjects, an alternating enrollment schema into QD and BID schedule will be followed.

Within each treatment arm , if both QD and BID dose schedules are studied , an evaluation 
using efficacy, safety, PK, pharmacodynamic data will be performed  and the investigators 
and Sponsor will jointly  determine if one dose schedule is better than the other.  
9.7.3 Interim Analysis  
There will be interim analys es to define the MTD s and/or RP2Ds prior to initiating the 
Expansion phase of the study.  Other interim analyses  may be performed to determine if a 
different dosing schedule  (eg, BID) or frequency (eg, 2-weeks on/1- week off) may be 
preferable.  Database locks are not required to perform these analyses.  Safety and PK 
summaries may be provided periodically.

 11 PROCEDU RES AND INSTRUCTIONS  (ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES)  
11.1 Changes to the Protocol  
There are to be no changes to the protocol without written approval from the Sponsor .  
Protocols will be followed as written.  
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by the Sponsor before implementation .  Amendments specifically 
affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require submission to health or regulatory authorities as well as additional approval by the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the investigator, or by the Sponsor, in the interest of preserving the safety of all su bjects included in the study.  If the investigator determines that an 
immediate change to or deviation from the protocol is necessary for safety reasons to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the Sponsor ’s medical monitor (or appropriate 
study t eam member) and the IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately .  The 
Sponsor must notify the health or regulatory authority as required per local regulations.  
Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not require submission to health or regulatory authority or the IRB/IEC, but the health or regulatory authority and IRB/IEC should be kept informed of such changes as required by local regulations .  In these cases, the Sponsor may be required to send a letter to the IR B/IEC and 
the CA detailing such changes.  
11.2 Adherence to the Protocol  
The investigator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to ICH E6, Section  4.5). 
11.3 Monitoring Procedures  
The CRA representing the Sponsor will maintain contact w ith the investigator and designated 
staff by telephone, letter, or email between study visits.  Monitoring visits to each site will be conducted by the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator will allow the CRA to inspect the clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy facilities to assure compliance with GCP and local regulatory requirements .  The CRFs and subject’s 
corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully available for review by the Sponsor ’s representat ives at regular intervals .  These reviews verify adherence 
to study protocol and data accuracy in accordance with local regulations .  All records at the 
site are subject to inspection by the local auditing agency and IRB/IEC review.

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 110 of 126 
 In accordance with ICH E6, Section  1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to 
the following: 
• Clinic, office, or hospital charts 
• Copies or transcribed health care provider notes which have been certified for accuracy 
after production 
• Recorded data from automated instruments such as x -rays and other imaging reports ( eg, 
sonograms, CT scans, MRIs , radioactive images, ECGs, rhythm strips, EEGs, 
polysomnographs, pulmonary function tests), regardless of how these images are stored, including microfiche and photographic negatives 
• Pain, quality of life, or medical history questionnaires completed by subjects 
• Records of telephone contacts  
• Diaries or evaluation checklists  
• Drug distribution and accountability logs maintained in pharmacies or by research personnel 
• Laboratory results and other laboratory test outputs (eg , urine pregnancy test result 
documentation and urine dip- sticks)  
• Correspondence regarding a study subject’s treatment between physicians or memoranda sent to the IRBs/IECs  
• CRF components ( eg, questionnaires) th at are completed directly by subjects and serve as 
their own source 
11.4 Recording of Data  
A CRF is required and must be completed for each subject by qualified and authorized personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except when a section  of the CRF itself is used as source document .  Any correction to entries made 
on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction is dated, the individual making the correct is identified, the reason for the change is stated, and the original data are not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the study should be collected. 
The investigator must sign each CRF .  The investigator will report the CRFs to the Sponsor 
and retain a copy of the CRFs. 
11.5 Identification of Source Data  
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 111 of 126 
 11.6 Retention of Records  
The circumstances of completion or termination of the study notwithstanding, the 
investigator is responsible for reta ining all study documents, including but not limited to the 
protocol, copies of CRFs, the Investigator's Brochure, and regulatory agency registration documents ( eg, Form FDA 1572, ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence) .  The site should plan 
to retain study documents, as directed by the Sponsor , for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 3 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. 
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
investigator retire or relocate, the i nvestigator  contact the Sponsor, allowing the Sponsor the 
option of permanently retaining the study records. 
11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, the Sponsor ’s Clinical Quality Assurance 
department conducts audits of clinical research activities in accordance w ith the Sponsor ’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance with the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local regulations .  If a government regulatory authority requests an inspection during the study or 
after its completion, the investigator must inform the Sponsor immediately.  
11.8 Handling of Study Drug  
All study drug will be supplied to the PI  (or a designated pharmacist) by the Sponsor .  Drug 
supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg , locked cabinet) and stored according 
to the conditions specified on the drug labels.  The investigator (or a designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of the study drug in a drug accountability ledger, a copy of which must be given to the Sponsor at the end of the study.  An ac curate record of the date and amount of study drug dispensed to each subject must be 
available for inspection at any time.  The CRA will visit the site and review these documents 
along with all other study conduct documents at appropriate intervals once study drug has been received by the site. 
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study and not for any other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy any drug labels or any partly used or unused drug supply before approval to do so by the Sponsor.  At the conclusion of the study and as appropriate during the study, the investigator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug disposition form to the CRA representing the Sponsor or, when approval is given by the Sponsor , will destroy 
supplies and containers at the site.

 Appendix 1 Modif ied Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  
Tumor assessments will be performed following Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors guidance ( Lencioni and Llovet, 2010) using triphasic liver computed 
tomography ( CT)/magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ; optimized for pre contrast, arterial 
phase, and portal venous phase) and elements of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer, et al., 2009).  
Quantitative and Qualitative Assessments of Tumor Burden  
The disease burden during Screening will be categorized into target and nontarget lesions.  Within the target and nontarget categories are typical hepatic lesions, atypical hepatic lesions, and nonhepatic lesions.  
• Typical hepatic lesions are lesions that d isplay hypervascularity in the arterial phase 
and “wash -out” in the portal venous phase of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI imaging. 
• Atypical hepatic lesions are lesions that are not showing the distinctive enhancement 
pattern but are considered to be malignant. 
• Nonhepatic lesions are all nodal and non-nodal lesions outside of the liver. 
Selection and Measurement of Target Lesions  
A maximum of 2 target lesions per organ and 5 target lesions in total, representative of all 
involved organs, may be selected.  Target lesions are lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension and whose minimum lesion size is as follows:  
• Typical hepatic target lesions:  The longest diameter of the viable tumor must measure ≥1 cm or ≥2 times the slice thickness/reconst ruction interval (if the slice 
thickness/reconstruction interval is >5 mm).  
• Atypical hepatic target lesions:  The longest diameter must measure ≥1  cm or 
≥2 times the slice thickness/reconstruction interval (if the slice 
thickness/reconstruction interval is  >5 mm).   
• Nonhepatic non- nodal target lesions:  The longest diameter must measure ≥1 cm or 
≥2 times the slice thickness/reconstruction interval (if the slice 
thickness/reconstruction interval is >5 mm).   
• Nonhepatic nodal target lesions (lymph nodes):  The short axis must measure ≥1.5 cm with exception of porta hepatis lymph nodes that need to be ≥2.0 cm in the short axis (regardless of modality/scanner type and slice thickness/reconstruction interval).  
If typical and atypical liver lesions are present, preference should be given to typical liver lesions when selecting targets.  Target lesions are measured at every time point and a single Sum of Diameters (SOD) will be determined by adding the longest diameters of all

H3 Biomedicine, Inc.  
Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 116 of 126 
 non-nodal lesions and short axes (ie, w idest dimensions perpendicular to the long axis) of 
nodal nonhepatic lesions.  For typical hepatic lesions the longest diameters will include only 
the viable tissue, while for all other target lesions all tumor tissue (whether necrotic or not) will be included in the SOD.  Note that hypovascular tissue should not be considered as necrotic (nonviable) tissue.  While hypovascular tissue will still show contrast uptake (although less than what would be observed in a hypervascular lesion), necrotic tissue will show complete absence of any contrast enhancement.  Quantitative determinations of average Hounsfield Units (HU) in the tissue of interest both precontrast and postcontrast may be used, if needed, to support the subjective assessment:   necrotic (nonviable) tissue will show 
no change in HU between the phases, while hypovascular tissue will yield an increase in HU (although less than what would be observed in a hypervascular lesion) between precontrast and postcontrast images of the same region.   
Target lesions are assessed as complete response ( CR), partial response ( PR), stable disease 
(SD), progressive disease ( PD), or not evaluable ( NE) at every time point based on the SOD. 
Selection and Assessment of Nontarget Lesions  
Nontarget lesions are all  other lesions, including malignant portal vein thrombosis, 
infiltrative type, and diffuse type hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) with ill -defined lesion 
borders and truly nonmeasurable lesions.  Nontarget lesions will be assessed qualitatively, and the possi ble assessments are CR, Non -CR/Non -PD (NN), and PD.   
If a hepatic nontarget lesion exhibits an enhancement pattern that is consistent with HCC, the determination of CR, NN, PD, or NE will be dependent on the enhancing portion of the lesion.   
If pleural e ffusions or ascites selected as nontarget lesions at Baseline are stable in size or 
minimally enlarging, they will be assessed as NN.  A cytopathological confirmation of any 
effusion that appears or worsens on treatment is required when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or SD.  
New Lesions 
New lesions are defined as:  
• Unequivocally new nonhepatic lesions seen at follow-up, without a corresponding 
lesion on the baseline imaging 
• New typical hepatic lesions displaying intratumoral arterial enhancement 
(hypervascularization in the arterial phase and washout in the portal venous phase on contrast- enhanced CT or MRI) that measure ≥1 cm in the longest diameter  
• New atypical hepatic lesions ≥1 cm in the longest diameter that show interval growth in subsequent scans of at least 1  cm

Amendment 09:  30 Sep 2020 Confidential  Page 117 of 126 
 Any lesion that meets the requirements for unequivocal new lesions will trigger PD.  Any 
lesion that does not meet the above criteria (eg, <1 cm in longest diameter and/or does not show typical HCC vascular enhancement patter n) should be considered an equivocal new 
lesion.  If an equivocal lesion is later determined to be unequivocal, the time point of progression will be the time point the lesion was first noted as equivocal.

 Appendix 2 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(v4.03)  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) , Version 4.03 [published 28 May 2009 (Version 4.03:  14 June 2010)] provides 
descriptive terminology to be used for adverse event reporting in clinical trials.  A brief definition is provided to clarify the meaning of each adverse event ( AE) term.  To increase 
the accuracy of AE reporting, all adverse event terms in CTCAE , Version 4.03 have been 
correlated with single -concept, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
terms.  
CTCAE , Version 4.03 grading refers to the severity of the AE.  CTCAE Grades 1 through 5, 
with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, are based on this general guideline: 
Grade  CTCAE Status  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate: minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.
a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening: 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling, limiting self -care ADL.
b 
4 Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated. 
5 Death related to adverse event.  
ADL = activities of daily living, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , NCI = National Cancer 
Institute . 
a:  Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, 
etc. 
b:  Self -care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden. Adapted from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI.  CTCAE v4.03 .  Available from:

 Appendix 4 Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection, Handling, and 
Shipping  
Blood Samples 
Samples will be processed following the procedures below.  Each plasma sample will be 
identified by protocol number, subject number, nominal day and time of sampling, and 
specimen matrix .   
1. Draw blood samples from the median antebrachial vein and transferred into tubes containing sodium heparin. 
2. Mix the blood and anticoagulant by gently inverting the tube 8 to 10 times and then place on water ice (crushed ice).  
3. Within approximately 30 minutes of collection, centrifuge samples for 15 minutes at 2500 rpm at 4 °C. 
4. Pipette the separated plasma equally, at least 1.5 mL each, into two 5 mL polypropylene tubes (Tubes marked as A and B).  If the required volume of blood cannot be collected, a minimum of 1.5 mL of plasma must be transferred into Tube A and the remaining volume transferred to Tube B. 
5. Store samples i n an upright position at approximately –20 °C until samples are 
transferred for analysis to the designated bioanalytical laboratory.  
6. After plasma separation, the remaining buffy coat and red blood cell layers should be discarded by the study institution in  a proper manner. 
Urine Samples (for Metabolite Profiling) 
1. Subjects must void their urine just prior to the administration of study drug .   
2. Urine will be collected in containers.  During each collection period, the urine samples 
will be stored in a refrigerator at approximately 4  °C. 
3. At the end of each collection interval, weight the collected urine and measure total volume of urine.  Record the total volume in the case report form . 
4. Mix the contents of each urine container gently to obtain a homogeneous solution. 
5. Transfer approximately an aliquot of 8 mL each into the 13-mL polypropylene tubes (Tubes marked as A and B).  
6. Store urine samples in an upright position at approximately -20 °C until samples are transferred for analysis to the designated bioanalytica l laboratory.  
7. The remaining urine will be appropriately discarded by the study institution in a proper manner.

 Appendix 5 Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other 
Biomarker Research  
Subjects enrolled in this clinical study will have biologic samples c ollected for 
pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics ( PG) (separate consent required) , and other 
biomarker analysis.  These samples may be used for discovery and validation to identify 
biomarkers that may be used for exploratory evaluation of response and/or safety -related 
outcomes as well as for use in diagnostic development.  
The PG samples may be used to identify genetic factors that may influence a subject’s exposure to the study drug, as well as genetic factors that may have an effect on clinical response or potential adverse events related to study treatment, and to explore the role of genetic variability in response.  Samples may be analyzed to determine a subject’s genotypes or sequence for a number of genes or noncoding regulatory regions.  The research  may 
include the investigation of polymorphisms in genes that are likely to influence the study drug PK or therapeutic response.  
Collection of the pharmacodynamic, PG, and other biomarker samples will be bound by the sample principles and processes outlined in the main study protocol.  Sample collection for pharmacodynamic, PG, and other biomarker analysis is required as per the study protocol unless the collection and use of the samples is prohibited by specific country laws.  
Sample Collection and Handling 
The samples will be collected according to the study flow chart .  If, for operational or 
medical reasons, the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) blood sample cannot be obtained 
at the prespecified visit, the sample can be taken at any study center visit at the discretion of 
the investigator and site staff.  
Security of the Samples, Use of the Samples, Retention of the Samples  
Sample processing, for example DNA and/or ribonucleic acid  extraction, genotyping, 
sequencing, or other analysis will be performed by a laboratory under the direction of the Sponsor.  Processing, analysis, and storage will be performed at a secure laboratory facility to protect the validity of the data and maintain subject privacy. 
Samples will only be used for the purposes described i n this protocol.  Laboratories 
contracted to perform the analysis on behalf of the Sponsor will not retain rights to the 
samples beyond those necessary to perform the specified analysis and will not transfer or sell 
those samples.  The Sponsor will not sell the samples to a third party.  
Samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the completion of the study (defined as submission of the clinical study report to the appropriate regulatory agencies).  At the end of the storage period, samples will be destroyed .  Samples may be stored longer if a health 
authority (or medicinal product approval agency) has active questions about the study.  In this special circumstance, the samples will be stored until the questions have been adequately addressed.

 It is possible that future research and technological advances may identify genomic variants 
of interest, or allow alternative types of genomic analysis not foreseen at this time .  Because 
it is not possible to prospectively define every avenue of futur e testing, all samples collected 
will be single or double coded (according to the International Council for Harmonisation  E15 
guidelines) in order to maintain subject privacy.

If, during the time the samples are stored, a participant would like to withdraw his/her 
consent for participation in this research, H3 Biomedicine will destroy the samples .  
Information from any assays that have already been completed at the time of withdrawal of consent will continue to be used as necessary to protect the integrity of the research project. 
Subject Privacy and Return of Data 
No subject-identifying information (eg, initials, date of birth, government identifying 
number) will be associated w ith the sample .  All pharmacodynamics and other biomarker 
samples will be single- coded .  Genomic DNA samples used to explore the effects on PK, 
treatment response, and safety will be single coded .  Genomic DNA samples that will be 
stored for long- term use (defined as 15 years after the completion of the study) will be double 
coded.  Double coding involves removing the initial code (subject identification [ ID]) and 
replacing with another code such that the subject can be re-identified by use of 2 code keys.  The code keys are usually held by different parties.  The key linking the sample ID to the subject number will be maintained separately from the sample.  At this point, the samples will be double-coded, the first code being the subject number.  Laboratory personnel performing genetic analysis will not have access to the “key.”  Clinical data collected as part of the clinical study will be cleaned of subject identifying information and linked by use of the sample ID “key.” 
The Sponsor will take st eps to ensure that data are protected accordingly and confidentiality 
is maintained as far as possible.  Data from subjects enrolled in this study may be analyzed 
worldwide, regardless of location of collection. 
The Sponsor and its representatives and agents may share coded data with persons and 
organizations involved in the conduct or oversight of this research.  These include:  
• Clinical research organizations retained by the Sponsor  
• Independent ethics committees or institutional review boards that have re sponsibility for 
this research study  
• National regulatory authorities or equivalent government agencies  
At the end of the analysis, results may be presented in a final report which may include part 
or all of the coded data, in listing or summary format.  Other publication (eg, in peer-reviewed scientific journals) or public presentation of the study results will only include

 summaries of the population in the study, and no identified individual results will be 
disclosed. 
Given the research nature of the pharmacodynamics, PG, and other biomarker analysis, it 
will not be possible to return individual data to subjects .  The results that may be generated 
are not currently anticipated to have clinical relevance to the subject s or their family 
members .  Therefore,  these results will not be disclosed to the subjects or their physicians. 
If at any time, pharmacodynamics, PG, and/or other biomarker results are obtained that may have clinical relevance, Institutional Review Board /Independent Ethics Committee review 
and approval will be sought to determine the most appropriate manner of disclosure and to determine whether or not validation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) -certified setting will be required .  Sharing of research data with individual subjects 
should only occur when data have been validated by multiple studies and testing has been done in CLIA- approved laboratories.

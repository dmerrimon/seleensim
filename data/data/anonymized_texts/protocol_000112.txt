19. Tumour assessment: CT or MRI imaging of the chest, abdomen a nd pelvis at screening and prior to the start C3D1 onwards (see below ) according to modified RECIST criteria (version 1.1)
see appendix 10.4 . If clinically indicated, imaging of any other known or suspected sites of disease using an appropriate method (CT scan and MRI) should be performed. After study entry, 
all lesions identified during the screening should be followed up at all specified imaging time points. The same radiographic p rocedure must be used throughout the study. See section 5.1.2. 1
A bone scan should be performed at screening and prior to the start C3D1 and onwards according to schedule below. 
Tumour assessment and bone scan will be performed at the following time points until progression/start of further anti-cancer the rapy (assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to 
the scheduled assessment date):
∀ At screening: all patients will have a  CT or MRI and bone scan at screening, unless valid results are available from a scan pe rformed within 28 days prior to start of study 
treatment, as part of routine clinical practice
∀ Week 8 (49-56 days after start of study treatment)
∀ Week 16 (105-112 days after start of study treatment)
∀ Week 24 (161-168 days after start of study treatment)
∀ Every 12 weeks thereafter (i.e., during week 35-36 (245-252 days after start of study treatment), during week 47-48 (329-336 days a fter start of study treatment), etc…)
In the event of an interruption/delay to treatment the tumour assessment schedule should not be changed.  
20. All patients should have a tumour assessment/bone scan at EOT visit regardless of the reason for discontinuation, unless the  last evaluation was performed within 4 weeks of EOT
21. Optional physical examination.
22. If not recovered at EOT, or new AE, or drug related death.
23. Dispensing of enzalutamide at every weekly visit. However for those patients which discontinue BI 836845 permanently, from cycle  4 onwards, enzalutamide will be dispensed only on Day 1 
of each cycle, e.g. C4D1, C5D1 onwards.
24. Diary card issued only in expansion cohort at the time of informed consent and at C1 Day 22. Diary card to be completed for 7 days in screening period prior to C1 Day-1 (Day-7 to Day-2), 
and for 7 days prior to C2 Day 1 (C1 Day 23 to Day 28).
25. For expansion cohort only at these visits: Review of diary card and compliance check of enzalutamide taken during screening period prior to C1 Day -1 and prior to C2D1
26. For more details on patient completion, see section 6.1.3.5
Optional fresh tumour biopsy – see footnote 5.

* From cycle 4 onwards patients on enzalutamide (Arm B) and those patients that have discontinued BI 836845, but remain on enzal utamide (Arm A), will only be required to visit on day 
1 of each cycle.
1. Treatment cycles: each treatment cycle consists of 28 days 2. EOT: end of treatment visit; within 7 calendar days after permanent termination of trial drug(s). If permanent discontinuatio n of study drug falls on a scheduled visit, examinations as 
defined for EOT should be performed instead of the examinations of the scheduled visit
3. FU: Follow-up visit; 42 days (+7) after per manent discontinuation of trial medication.  
Additional FU: Patients who have not progressed and not started further anti-cancer therapy at first FU should have additional f ollow-up visits at scheduled tumour assessments until 
progression /start of further anti-cancer therapy. Only tumour assessments, AEs and concomitant medication to be reviewed, no oth er assessments required.
4. OP: Observational phase; every 90 days ( ∃15) after last FU, patients will be followed for survival every three months until patient death. Survival information can be o btained via phone 
contact
5. Written informed consent must be obtained before any trial specific screening assessments are performed
8. Physical exam: includes a thorough cardiopulmonary, abdominal and lymph node exam and an assessment of the mental and neurolo gical status. 
9. Vital signs: includes respiration rate respiration rate (after two minutes supine rest), pulse, temperature, and blood pressure . On dosing days, at any time before drug administration.
10. 12-lead ECG: 12-Lead resting digital electrocardiogram (ECG) are recorded digitally and in triplicate. ECGs will be performed  at: Screening, Cycle 1 on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15; 
Cycle 2 on Day 8 and Day 15; Cycle 3 on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15. Day 1 of Cycles 6, 9, 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter; also E OT and first FUP. See Appendix 10.6 for schedule.
ECGs to be taken: Pre-dose (-20 min. to -5 min. before administration of BI 836845 and/or enzalutamide) and immediately after th e end of infusion of BI 836845 (up to 15 minutes after
end of infusion), or one hour after the administration of enzalutamide. ECGs to be taken prior to PK sample time-points where app licable.
12. Safety labs: haematology, coagulation, biochemistry, electrolytes, urinalysis by dipstick before dosing. See section 5.2.5 for details.
13. Fasting glucose and HbA1C only at screening and Day 1 of each cycle and EOT.
5.1.2.3 and Appendix 10.6 for schedule.
17. PSA blood sampling at screening, C1D1 and from C3 D1 and at Day 1 of every cycle thereafter.

20. Tumour assessment: CT or MRI imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at screening and prior to start C3D1 onwards (see below) acc ording to modified RECIST criteria (version 1.1). 
If clinically indicated, imaging of any other known or suspected sites of disease using an appropriate method (CT scan or MRI) should be performed. After study entry, all lesions 
identified during the screening should be followed up at all specified imaging time points. The same radiographic procedure mus t be used throughout the study. See section 5.1.2. 1
A bone scan should be performed at screening, prior to the start C3D1and onwards according to schedule below. 
Tumour assessment and bone scans will be performed at the follo wing time points until progression/start of further anti-cancer th erapy (assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior 
to the scheduled assessment date):
∀At screening: all patients will have a  CT or MRI and bone scan at screening, unless valid results are available from a scan pe rformed within 28 days prior to start of study 
treatment, as part of routine clinical practice
∀ Week 8 (49-56 days after randomisation)
∀ Week 16 (105-112 days after randomisation)
∀ Week 24 (161-168 days after randomisation)
∀ Every 12 weeks thereafter (i.e., during week 35-36 (245-252 days after randomisation), during week 47-48 (329-336 days after randomis ation), etc…)
In the event of an interruption/delay to treatment the tumour assessment schedule should not be changed.
21. All patients should have a tumour assessment/bone scan at EOT visit regardless of the reason for discontinuation, unless the la st evaluation was performed within 4 weeks of EOT .
22. Optional physical examination.
23. If not recovered at EOT, or new AE, or drug related death.
24. Dispensing of enzalutamide at every weekly visit. However for patients in Arm B and those patients in Arm A which discontinue  BI 836845 permanently, from cycle 4 onwards,
enzalutamide will be dispensed only on Day 1 of each cycle, e.g. C4D1, C5D1 onwards.
25. For more details on patient completion, see section 6.1.3.5
 
27. The randomization may take place up to 3 days prior to C1D1 if site procedures require advance randomization to accommodate t he logistics of dispensing study medication to patients. 
Sites that use this option must include a copy of site policy/written justification in the ISF and submit a copy to the sponsor.  If randomization is performed prior to C1D1, the subsequent 
visits must be scheduled with reference to C1D1.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths among men in developed countries ( R11-0764 ). Androgen-deprivation 
therapy is, and has been, the gold standard of care for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer 
for decades. Although more than 90% of prostate cancer patients initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy, most tumours b ecome refractory and eventually reoccur as 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), for which there are limited treatment options with only modest survival benefit.
A significant amount of data has been accumulated suggesting that the insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF) system plays an important role in prostate cancer initiation and progression.  The IGF axis is composed of 2 peptide growth factors (IGF-1 and -2), 2 transmembrane receptors (IGF-1R and -2R), 6 IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6), and IGFBP proteases. IGFs are synthesized primarily in the liver and have effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism but also regulate cellular processes of proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and apoptosis ( R13-0728 ). These later attributes have resulted in the IGF axis being associated 
with a critical role in the development of a variety of malignancies including prostate cancer 
(R10-6695 , R13-0992 , R13-0723 , R13-0724 , R13-0729 ). IGF-1R is a transmembrane 
receptor tyrosine kinase that is widely expressed in human tissues. Binding of IGF ligands 
induces conformational changes of IGF-IR and activation of its intrinsic intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. The activated receptor induces recruitment of the insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2, which in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt intracellular signaling pathways, leading to cellular proliferation and apoptosis inhibition ( R13-0725 , R13-0726 ). 
Elevated levels of serum IGF-1 have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer 
in meta-regression analysis ( R07-4212 , R13-0727 ) (R13-0730 ), and high plasma IGF-1 and 
low IGFBP-3 has been associated with more advanced stages of prostate cancer ( R13-0731 , 
R13-0732 ). In human primary prostate cancers, IGF-1R, IGF-1, and -2 have all been reported 
to have increased expression compared with normal prostate tissue ( R13-0982 , R13-0993 , 
R13-0994 ) and is also increased in advanced and metastatic disease ( R13-0659 , R13-0018 ). 
IGF-1 and IGF-1R are increased with progression to castration-resistance in vivo (R13-0660 ). 
In the TRAMP model (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate), prostate cancer 
incidence is substantially reduced in IGF-1–deficient mice, whereas organ-specific overexpression of IGF-1R increased prostate neoplasia ( R13-0705 ). In other preclinical 
studies, the IGF axis appears to be up-regulated in bone metastases ( R13-0704 ) and IGF-1 
has been shown to accelerate tumour growth ( R13-0703 ), promote migration through 
PI3K/AKT ( R13-0995 ), and be involved with angiogenesis through VEGF ( R13-0707 ).
Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that targets multiple steps in the androgen 
receptor signalling pathway in the tumour cell; namely inhibition of nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor, DNA binding, and co-activator recruitment and has no known agonistic effect.
A phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (the AFFIRM trial) with enzalutamide,  
stratified 1199 men with CRPC after chemotherapy according to the Eastern Cooperative

Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score and pain intensity. Patients were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg per day (800 patients) or placebo (399 patients). The primary end point was overall survival.
The median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3 to not yet 
reached) in the enzalutamide group versus 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death in the enzalutamide group, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.75; P<0.001). The superiority of enzalutamide over placebo was shown with respect to all secondary end points: the proportion of patients with a reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level by 50% or more (54% vs. 2%, P<0.001), the soft-tissue response rate (29% vs. 4%, P<0.001), the quality-of-life response rate (43% vs. 18%, P<0.001), the time to PSA progression (8.3 vs. 3.0 months; hazard ratio, 0.25; P<0.001), radiographic progression-free survival (8.3 vs. 2.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001), and the time to the first skeletal-related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; P<0.001). Hence enzalutamide significantly prolonged the survival of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy ( R13-1229 ).
These data were more recently confirmed in the PREVAIL trial ( R15-1307 ) investigating 
Enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer before chemotherapy: Enzalutamide significantly 
decreased the risk of radiographic progression and death and delayed the initiation of chemotherapy. 
The present trial shall investigate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide taken in 
combination with BI 836845, an IGF ligand blocking agent directed towards IGF-1 and IGF-2, in CRPC patients.
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
1.2.1 BI 836845
BI 836845 is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises the 
function of IGF-1 and IGF-2. 
The growth of multiple cancer cell lines derived from different cancer types was inhibited by 
BI 836845 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs in preclinical models. BI 836845 has a potent inhibitory effect on the IGF-1R phosphorylation potential (IGF bioactivity) of human plasma ex vivo . Due to its cross-reactivity to rat and Cynomolgus 
monkey IGF-1 and IGF-2, the pharmacodynamic effect of BI 836845 on IGF bioactivity in both these species was demonstrated by a clear and potent reduction in plasma IGF bioactivity for all doses tested.
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with once weekly intravenous administration of BI 836845 for 
13 weeks in Cynomolgus monkeys and for 13 or 26 weeks in rats revealed a variety of dose related and essentially reversible effects. The treatment related changes included the body as a whole (growth retardation) in both species and liver functions, the haematolymphatic system, kidneys, bone, teeth, and ovaries in rats only. Most, if not all, observed effects were attributable to the pharmacodynamic potential of BI 836845, i.e. reflecting the neutralization of specific growth factors in these species during a phase of rapid body growth.

Consequently, signs of general growth retardation, e.g. reduced body weight gain and body 
size were apparent in both species examined. The effects on the haematolymphatic system and liver function seen in the rat studies were considered to be of no toxicological relevance. For more details please refer to the most recent update of the investigator brochure (IB, c01690707 ).
Two Phase I studies with BI 836845 monotherapy are ongoing in patients with advanced 
solid tumours to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and/ or relevant biological dose, pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) correlation, applying either a weekly dosing schedule in study 1280.1 ( U11-3025 ) or a once every three weeks dosing 
schedule in study 1280.2 ( U10-2994 ) during escalation phase; study 1280.2 has since 
changed to a weekly dosing phase in the expansion phase.
As of the database cut-off date of the IB (U10-2830) of 10 July 2013, 81 subjects have 
received BI 836845 across the two phase I trials (U11-3025 and U10-2994). Overall in these studies, BI 836845 was well-tolerated. The type and pattern of adverse events (AEs) observed to date have generally been mild to moderate (CTCAE Grade 1 and 2) and consistent with the underlying neoplastic conditions of patients enrolled in the trials. The most frequently reported AEs reported across both studies (any cause) were general disorders, especially fatigue, as well as gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). Specifically, there were no laboratory findings that would indicate kidney damage in patients, as previously observed in the 13-week study in rats ( U10-2830 ).
Of the 81 subjects treated until the cut-off date, only one experienced a drug-related serious 
adverse event (SAE). One further patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
Four subjects discontinued treatment due to non-drug related AEs. Infusion-related reactions 
were not observed. Metabolic AEs involving perturbed glucose homeostasis, among the most common toxicities documented for IGF-1R-targeting monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, were observed at relatively low frequencies. Two out of 81 subjects reported transient hyperglycemia: one patient (CTCAE Grade 2) in study 1280.1 and one patient (CTCAE Grade 3) in 1280.2, see the most recent edition of the IB for full details ( U10-2830 ).
Preliminary tumour response data is available for the subjects treated in both the first in-man 
studies; however the results are insufficient to reliably assess the anti-tumour activity of BI 836845 as monotherapy. There were 12 (25.0%) patients with confirmed stable disease in study 1280.1 and four patients (12.1%) with confirmed stable disease in study 1280.2. Two patients had confirmed partial responses in study 1280.1: a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a patient with peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour, a member of the Ewing’s family of tumours.
Preliminary PK interim data from the dose escalation part of both trials indicate that 
maximum plasma concentrations of BI 836845 are reached at the end of the infusion or shortly thereafter. After reaching the peak, plasma concentrations showed an at least biphasic decay with a terminal half-life of about 6 days. The estimated volume of distribution was about 5.8 L (approx. two times the plasma volume) and the total plasma clearance was about 0.5 mL/min. The incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was approximately 19% in 1280.1 and 30% in 1280.2. Overall, the ADA-response was weak, dose-independent and in many cases transient and had no impact on PK or PD.

No deviations from dose-proportional pharmacokinetics have been observed in the dose 
range analysed (10-1050 mg q1w in 1280.1 and 10-3600 mg q3w in 1280.2). Steady state plasma concentrations of BI 836845 were achieved after 5-7 weeks. Repeated weekly dosing resulted in about 1.5 fold accumulation of BI 836845 plasma concentration at steady state, while only limited accumulation was observed after repeated infusions every three weeks. 
It is known that humanised IgGs like BI 836845 are mainly cleared by catabolism. This 
mechanism of clearance is not shared or overlapping with the clearance mechanism for small molecules. Thus, BI 836845 is not predicted to directly affect the hepatic, renal, or biliary elimination of small molecules. Furthermore, BI 836845 is not targeting cytokines, and mAbs targeting upstream IGFs have not been related to modulation of CYP450 isozymes or drug transporters ( P13-02270 ). Hence, the potential of BI 836845 to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
co-medication is considered low. 
1.2.2 Enzalutamide
Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that acts on different steps in the androgen 
receptor signalling pathway. The chemical name is 4-{3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo -2-sulfanylideneimidazolidin-1-yl}-2-fluoro- N-
methylbenzamide. The molecular weight is 464.44 and molecular formula is C21H16F4N4O2S. Enzalutamide is a white crystalline non-hygroscopic solid. It is practically insoluble in water.
Enzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen
receptors and inhibit androgen receptor nuclear translocation and interaction with DNA. A major metabolite, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to 
enzalutamide. Enzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell death of prostate cancercells in vitro , and decreased tumour volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model.
Following oral administration (160 mg daily) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer, the median time to reach maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) is 1 hour (range 0.5 to 3 hours). At steady state, the plasma mean Cmax values for enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are 16.6 μg/mL (23% CV) and 12.7 μg/mL (30% CV), 
respectively, and the plasma mean predose trough values are 11.4 μg/mL (26% CV) and 13.0 
μg/mL (30% CV), respectively.  With daily dosi ng enzalutamide steady state is achieved by 
Day 28, and enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. Daily fluctuations in enzalutamide plasma concentrations are low (mean peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). At steady state, enzalutamide showed approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the daily dose range of 30 to 360 mg. The plasma pharmacokinetics is adequately described by a linear two-compartment model with first-order absorption.
In vitro, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the metabolism of enzalutamide. Based 
on in vivo and in vitro data, CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of the active 
metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide). Enzalutamide is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism. The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days) ( R13-5391 ).  Please also refer to the current 
summary of product characteristics (SPC) from eMC website.

Second Primary Malignancies
Cases of second primary malignancies have been reported in patients treated with 
enzalutamide in clinical studies. In phase 3 clinical studies, the most frequently reported events in enzalutamide treated patients, and greater than placebo, were bladder cancer (0.3%), adenocarcinoma of the colon (0.2%), transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%) and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.1%).  Patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if they notice signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic haematuria, or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment with enzalutamide.
Hypersensitivity reactionsHypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, rash, or 
face, tongue, lip, or pharyngeal oedema, have been observed with enzalutamide. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) have been reported with enzalutamide. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for 
skin reactions.

2. RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES, AND BENEFIT - RISK 
ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
Among men in the United States, prostate cancer accounts for more than 200,000 new cancer 
cases and 32,000 deaths annually. Although androgen deprivation therapy yields transient efficacy, most patients with metastatic prostate cancer eventually die of their disease. These aspects underscore the critical need to articulate both genetic underpinnings and novel therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.  During disease progression, CRPC increasingly utilizes salvage pathways to evade therapeutic attempts to block growth. Multiple mechanisms that may drive progression involve the androgen-receptor (AR) pathway, including AR activation via crosstalk of signal transduction pathways such as the IGF axis.
An increasing body of evidence has linked activation of the IGF axis with castrate-resistant 
progression of prostate cancer including via ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor ( R13-0706 ) and increases in IGF-1 ( R13-0660 ), IGF-1R ( R13-0018 ), IGFBP-2 
(R13-0756 ), and IGFBP-5 ( R13-0757 ). Preclinical studies have supported this approach using 
a variety of IGF pathway inhibitors ( R10-5690 , R13-0758 , R13-0759 ). In both castrate-
sensitive and –resistant prostate cancer models, activity has been observed with the IGF-1R–
specific monoclonal antibody cixutumumab (formerly IMC-A12), which induced tumour cell apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and down regulation of ligand-independent, androgen-regulated gene expression ( R13-0016 , R13-0658 , R13-0657 ).A recently completed phase 2 clinical trial 
with figitumumab (formerly CP-751,871), an IgG2 IGF-1R antibody inhibitor that blocks 
IGF-1 binding and promotes receptor internalization, in patients with localized prostate cancer showed a decrease in serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) ( R13-0656 ). 
Enzalutamide is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.
A recent non-clinical study (unpublished in -house study) of enzalutamide (MDV-3100), plus 
BI 836845, was conducted to test the anti-proliferation effects in vitro by 2D cell 
proliferation assay of the combination, when compared to single agent activity. Three of the prostate cell lines tested showed single agent responses with enzalutamide and BI 836845 and resulted in limited inhibition of cell proliferation; however the combination effect in the same cell lines was complete inhibition of cell proliferation. Overall, the results indicate that the presence of androgen receptor and IGF-1R, in addition to the expression of PTEN and wild-type PIK3CA, characterises prostate cancer cells that showed complete inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of the combination of enzalutamide and BI 836845 in vitro .
The progression to CRPC correlates with gain-of-function of the AR and activation of AKT. 
However, as single agents, AR or AKT inhibitors result in a reciprocal feedback loop ( R14-
0873 ). The existence of bidirectional cross-talk between the IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT pathway and 
the AR axis has been proposed ( R14-0873 ) and there is ample evidence for the interaction of 
IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression ( R14-0855 ; R14-
0854 ). Specifically, IGF-1R signaling to activate PI3K/AKT pathway has been proposed to 
be one of the mechanisms to transactivate the AR in the absence of androgen and progression 
to androgen-independent diseases ( R14-0855 ; R14-0851 ; R14-0852 ). For instance, Schayek 
et al. showed that re-expression of wild-type AR in an AR-negative metastatic prostate cancer 
cell line M12 led to significant increase in IGF-1R expression. However, when they 
Boehringer Ingelheim 06 Jun 2022

expressed two AR mutants that were compromised in the ability to bind to androgens or co-
regulators, no effect on IGF-1R expression was seen. The authors thus concluded that androgens regulate IGF-1R expression through a genomic pathway. To further support this conclusion, they further showed that AR can directly bind to IGF-1R promoter region. These data, along with recent evidence indicating that the combination of an AKT inhibitor with an antiandrogen, results in prolonged disease stabilization in a model of CRPC, provide further evidence for the strategy of targeting the AR and the IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT signaling axis ( R14-
0873 ;P14-02928 ). Taken collectively, these studies suggest that co-targeting the IGF and AR 
pathways with BI 836845 and enzalutamide may offer synergistic therapeutic benefits for 
prostate cancer.
The above information taken together, demonstrates that targeting the IGF axis is an 
attractive concept as a treatment for prostate cancer.
The present trial shall therefore investigate the safety and anti-tumour activity of 
enzalutamide in combination with BI 836845, compared to enzalutamide given alone, in CRPC patients previously treated and failed on docetaxel and abiraterone treatment. Patients recruited to this trial may, or may not, have received and failed prior cabazitaxel treatment, in any setting.
An expansion cohort, during the phase Ib study, will also be pursued at the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD), and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D), in patients that are already undergoing treatment with enzalutamide and showing a measured rise in PSA whist on enzalutamide according to standard criteria ( R13-1642 ). Patients may not have received 
prior taxane therapy or abiraterone
Overall, this trial is intended to prove the clinical proof of concept for the proposed 
combination of enzalutamide and BI 836845. The data of this randomised II trial will be used as the basis for the clinical assumptions for the phase III pivotal trial in an area of high unmet medical need.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the trial are to:
∀Determine the safety and tolerability profile of BI 836845 in combination with 
enzalutamide following progression on docetaxel-based chemotherapy and abiraterone (phase Ib escalation).
∀Evaluate the anti-tumour activity of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide in 
patients naïve to taxane-based chemotherapy and abiraterone (phase Ib expansion cohort).
∀Evaluate the anti-tumour activity between the two treatment arms of BI 836845 in 
combination with enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone following progression on 
docetaxel-based chemotherapy and abiraterone (phase II)

 the incidence and intensity of adverse events according to 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 dated 14 June 2010 (R10-4848 ); ECG evaluation correlated with PK assessment.  
All patients in the trial have sufficient data to adequately answer the primary and secondary 
objectives of the trial. After approval of protocol version 10, the data collected in the clinical trial database will be limited to data required to ensure the safety of the patient, and to support safety reporting to authorities. Patient visits and assessments will continue per the revised Flow 
Chart . At the end of the clinical trial, the new reduced data collected will be locked and the 
data will be summarised in a CTR revision.
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Monotherapy studies performed to date with BI 836845 in patients with various malignant 
tumours has shown the drug to be well tolerated, with only mild to moderate drug related adverse events reported of CTCAE Grade 1 and 2 ( U10-2830 ). Published data from IGF-1R 
antagonist therapies report serious adverse events such as hyperglycemias and deaths related 
to metabolic and cardiac adverse events have been reported ( P12-08900 ). Thus, although 
BI 836845 has a different mechanism of action i.e. inhibition of the ligand rather than 
inhibition of the receptor, with the potential to have a different side effect profile, parametchfor glucose metabolism, other metabolic parameters, renal function, other adverse events, including full ECG analysis of the QT interval, will be carefully supervised and evaluated in the present trial.
BI 836845 is a humanised antibody given intravenously. Infusion reactions and immune 
responses cannot be excluded; and have been reported. Any infusion reactions that occur will be carefully evaluated and appropriate preventive and/or corrective action implemented. Immune response monitoring and analysis will be assessed continually throughout treatmentand into the follow-up period.
The collection of tumour biopsy in this trial will only be performed if there is a low risk of 
complication and as little discomfort to the patient as possible. Risks and complications associated with biopsy are usually small; however they can cause pain or bruising at the biopsy site, bleeding, infection, and reaction to local anaesthetic. Very rarely the bleeding may be significant and require surgery.  As a consequence, so as to minimise potential risks associated with the tumour biopsy, restrictions have been stipulated in this study: patients must have controlled haematology parameters and platelet counts, and the use of concomitant anti-platelet and anti-coagulation therapy prior to biopsy has been restricted. Patients with a

history of a hereditary bleeding disorder, or clinically relevant major bleeding event will be 
excluded from giving a biopsy.
Data from literature suggest that inhibition of the IGF pathway by monotherapy with either 
IGF receptor inhibitors or inhibitors of the IGF ligands may only exert moderate efficacy, thus the combination of an IGF inhibitor drug with other drugs already established in the treatment of prostate cancer, may confer an advantage.
Patients eligible for participation in the randomised phase II part of the trial will receive 
either BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide, or enzalutamide alone. The side effectsof enzalutamide are well known and described in the respective SPC. The most common adverse reactions with enzalutamide ( ≥ 5%) are asthenia/fatigue, back pain, diarrhoea, 
arthralgia, hot flush, peripheral edema, musculoskeletal pain, headache, upper respiratory infection, muscular weakness, dizziness, insomnia, lower respiratory infection, spinal cord compression and cauda equina syndrome, haematuria, paresthesia, anxiety, and hypertension. 
All adverse reaction will be carefully monitored throughout the course of the trial. The 
addition of BI 836845 to the standard enzalutamide therapy is not expected to substantially worsen or contribute to the toxicity profile of enzalutamide; however, the tolerability and safety phase of the study will confirm the safety of the combination and determine a recommended dose before proceeding to the randomised trial. Renal and hepatic function as well as other safety parameters will be carefully examined before each new treatment course.
Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury is under constant surveillance by 
sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safety.
The phase Ib escalation and expansion parts of the study will be continuously supervised and 
monitored by the BI study team and investigators (steering committee), as described in section 3.1.1 . An internal Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) data monitoring committee (DMC) will 
be nominated and be responsible for the continuous supervision of the safety of the patients 
included in the phase II randomised trial. 
Patients are expected to benefit from the established and registered enzalutamide treatment. 
The addition of BI 836845 to enzalutamide is hoped to provide additional benefit to patientsthat include: improved disease control, increased survival and quality of life over the standard therapy alone.
Based on the pharmacological mechanism and existing non-clinical and clinical data, there is 
currently no reason to believe that xentuzumab, either as monotherapy or in combination with enzalutamide therapy, will increase the occurrence or worsen the outcomes of a COVID-19 infection. In the target population of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and progression on docetaxel-based chemotherapy and abiraterone, the benefit-risk assessment for xentuzumab remains positive also in the presence of a COVID-19 outbreak. 
The decision on whether to continue study drugs if a patient develops COVID-19 will be left 
to the investigator’s benefit/risk assessment on a case-by-case basis. Based on laboratory data and any adverse event that may occur, the clinical trial protocol includes guidance for continuation, interruption, dose reduction, and discontinuation of study drugs.

The 1280-0022 phase II placebo-controlled, randomized trial recently completed primary 
endpoint analysis and showed no added benefit of xentuzumab compared to placebo, in patients with everolimus and exemestane backbone therapy, when treating trial participants with metastatic breast cancer, HR+, HER2- and non-visceral disease. No new safety signals were observed with the addition of xentuzumab to the everolimus and exemestane combination.
In consideration of these top line results of 1280-0022, as of 19 October 2021, Boehringer 
Ingelheim recommended to immediately discontinue all xentuzumab treatments. Sites were also recommended to discontinue associated assessments, including central laboratory sampling. Boehringer Ingelheim also terminated all oncology development of xentuzumab.
Relative to benefit-risk for any patient continuing on enzalutamide treatment:  The recent 
SmPC label for enzalutamide identified two new risks/warnings:
1. Second primary malignancies:  Cases of second primary malignancies have been 
reported in patients treated with enzalutamide in clinical studies. In phase 3 clinical studies, the most frequently reported events in enzalutamide treated patients, and greater than placebo, were bladder cancer (0.3%), adenocarcinoma of the colon (0.2%), transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%) and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.1%).  Patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if they notice signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic haematuria, or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment with enzalutamide.
2. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions(SCARs):  Hypersensitivity reactions manifested 
by symptoms including, but not limited to, rash, or face, tongue, lip, or pharyngeal oedema, have been observed with enzalutamide. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) have been reported with enzalutamide. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions.
However, in spite of these rare recently identified serious side effects (low risk of secondary 
malignancies and of severe cutaneous adverse reactions) of enzalutamide noted above, given the proven survival benefit of enzalutamide in CRPC patients in the Affirm study (noted above in section 1.1 ), the continued use of enzalutamide in patients having apparent benefit 
remains positive in terms of benefit-risk.  However, investigators should use their discretion 
in weighing all benefits and risks in deciding to continue patients on enzalutamide.

3. DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND TRIAL POPULATION
3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This phase Ib, and phase II randomised open label trial, will be conducted to explore the anti-
tumour activity and safety profile of the combination treatment of BI 836845 andenzalutamide (Arm A), compared to enzalutamide alone (Arm B) in patients with CRPC.  A tolerability and safety phase Ib will initially be performed to determine the MTD, and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide for the phase Ib expansion cohort and phase II randomised trial, see figure 3.1:1. In addition, anysafety issues will also be assessed before commencement of the expansion cohort andrandomised trial.
BI 836845 will be administered weekly in 28 day cycles of treatment, as per the Flow Chart , 
by a one hour intravenous infusion. Enzalutamide will be administered daily by continuous 
oral dosing during each treatment cycle.

Phase Ib – Tolerability and safety / expansion cohort:
A 3+3 design tolerability and safety phase (escalation) will initially be performed with a 
single escalation step in order to determine the MTD, and/or recommended phase II doses,and the safety profile of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. Approximately 9-12patients may be assessed to determine the MTD and/or the recommended phase II dose(RP2D). Patients in phase Ib escalation will not be randomised into phase II and will not be included in the final efficacy (anti-tumour activity) analysis of the study; however these patients will continue treatment until disease progression, undue toxicities, or discontinuation for any other reason, see section 3.3.4 for details. 
An exploratory expansion cohort will be pursued in approximately 25 enrolled patients to 
ensure 21 evaluable patients at the MTD, and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D)determined in the escalation part of phase Ib described above. A patient is considered evaluable if data for the assessment of the primary endpoint is available. Patients recruited to this cohort will be on ongoing enzalutamide therapy and be beginning to show a rise in PSA(as described in section 3.3.2 inclusion #19) on this treatment at the time of consent for the
expansion cohort of the study. These patients will continue to receive enzalutamide from the 
first day of treatment on the study combined with BI 836845. Patients in this expansion cohort will continue treatment until disease progression, undue toxicities, or discontinuation for any other reason, see section 3.3.4 for details. 
Phase II – Randomised phase II:
In phase II, 80 patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either BI 
836845 plus enzalutamide (Arm A) at the MTD, and/or the recommended phase II dose(RP2D) determined in phase Ib escalation, or enzalutamide alone (Arm B), in an open label, parallel group study design. Patients will continue treatment until disease progression, undue toxicities, or discontinuation for any other reason, see section 3.3.4 for details. 
After discontinuation of all trial drugs and completion of the final follow up visit, see section 
6.1.3 , patients will be followed up further (every 90 days after the last follow up visit) for 
survival status in an observation period (until approval of protocol version 10 after which no 
further survival status will be collected).

Phase I and Phase II:
Patients will be enrolled onto the study at the time of signing the informed consent and will 
conclude participation in the treatment phase of the study once the end of treatment (EOT) and last follow-up visit has been performed. If withdrawal from the study falls on a scheduled visit then that visit will be considered the EOT and all EOT assessments will be performed. For the collection of adverse events, these will be collected from the signing of the informed consent (pre-treatment). Patients will still be considered as “on-treatment” from first study drug administration until 42 days after the last study drug infusion of BI 836845 and/or the last dose of enzalutamide (i.e. at the planned time of the first follow-up visit), whichever is the last drug to be taken by the patient.
Prior to approval of protocol version 10, patients that withdraw from treatment and do not 
have progressive disease, or have not started another anti-cancer therapy, will continue with limited follow-up visits at scheduled tumour assessments, until start of progressive disease, or start of other anti-cancer therapy. Patients, after protocol version 10 is approved will only require FU1 at least 42 days after the last study drug infusion of BI 836845 and/or the last dose of enzalutamide.
Soft tissue tumour assessment by imaging according to modified Response Evaluation 
Criteria for Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 ( R09-0262 and appendix 10.4 ), as well as 
bone scans according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) ( R13-
1642 and section 5.1.2.1 ), at baseline, every two cycles until week 24 and then every three 
cycles thereafter as per the Flow Chart .  Assessment of response will be performed at the 
investigator site and will be sufficient for the decision to allow a patient to continue on 
treatment in the study. Patients should be kept on trial until radiographic, and/or bone scan progression and/or symptomatic progression, which may include PSA progression. Patients should not be discontinued due to rising PSA alone. During phase II an independent analysis of response will also be performed by a central imaging unit CRO (see section 5.1.3 ); 
however this CRO will not be used to make treatment decisions.
PSA collection  
CTC collection will be performed throughout phase Ib and phase II as per the time-points 
specified in the relevant Flow Chart and Appendix 10.6 .
The study will be performed by investigators specialised in the treatment of advanced solid 
cancers, especially CRPC, and experienced in phase I/II oncology trials. The sites will have available all equipment necessary for dealing with any serious side-effects and potential emergencies.

3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial
The trial is sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). BI will appoint a Trial Clinical Monitor, 
responsible for coordinating the activities required in order to manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal standard operating procedures (SOPs), directing the clinical trial team in the preparation, conduct, and reporting of the trial, order the materials as needed for the trial, ensures appropriate training and information of local clinical monitors (CMLs), clinical research associates (CRAs), and investigators of participating countries.
Data management and statistical evaluation will be performed by BI according to BI SOPs. 
For these activities, a Trial Data Manager and a Trial Statistician will be appointed. Tasks and functions assigned in order to organise, manage, and evaluate the trial will be defined according to BI SOPs. Special tasks may be contracted to a CRO. A list of responsible persons will be given in the Clinical Trial Master File (CTMF) document. In each local BI-organisation (OPU) participating in this study, a local clinical monitor (CML) will be appointed responsible for coordinating the activities required in order to manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal SOPs in the countries covered by the respective BI OPU. On-site monitoring will be performed by Boehringer Ingelheim or a CRO appointed by Boehringer Ingelheim.
A Co-ordinating Investigator will be nominated to coordinate investigators at different sites 
participating in this multicentre trial and to sign the clinical trial report. Documents on participating (Principal) investigators and other important participants, especially their curricula vitae, will be filed in the Clinical Trial Master File (CTMF).
Evaluation of the imaging findings and response assessment will be performed at the 
investigational site. Independent review will be performed by a central imaging unit CRO in the phase II randomised trial.
The trial drugs (where required) will be provided by BI or a CRO appointed by BI. The trial 
drugs will be stored according to the required storage conditions.
During phase Ib dose escalation phase of the study, regular teleconference will be held 
between the investigators and BI study team for review of safety data, decisions over doseescalation, discussions of on-going patients, and discussion of operational aspects. Relevant safety, laboratory, and efficacy data should be reviewed by on-site monitoring and, if possible, recorded in the eCRF before the teleconference. During the regular teleconferences with the investigators and BI study team, the next higher dose level will be determined from the progress of existing patients at the current dose level and in consideration of available safety, toxicity and PK-PD data. Any potential patients for the trial will also be discussed. The decision to conclude dose escalation should be agreed by the investigators and BI study team. The decision to commence the expansion cohort and phase II will be discussed between the investigators and BI study team. All teleconference details will be documented accordingly and reviewed by all investigators. Approval of the entry of a new patient into any cohort will be confirmed, and documented, in a fax or e-mail between the CML and the investigator/site.

During phase Ib dose expansion phase of the study, regular teleconferences will be held 
between the investigators and BI study team for review of safety data, discussions of on-going patients, and discussion of operational aspects. Relevant safety, laboratory, and efficacy data should be reviewed by on-site monitoring and, if possible, recorded in the eCRF before the teleconference. Any potential patients for the trial will also be discussed. 
An internal DMC for the phase II study will be appointed by BI which will represent an
independent group of experts at BI who, collectively, have expertise in the evaluation of efficacy and safety and data quality and in the conduct and monitoring of clinical trials. The DMC’s responsibility will be the continuous assessment of the trial data to ensure overall safety in the patients treated, monitor the quality and provide the trial team with advice about the conduct of the trial and the integrity of the data in the phase II randomised trial. Details of the DMC responsibilities and frequency of data review will be described in the DMC charter.
All trial relevant documentation will be stored in BI’s CTMF document according to BI 
SOPs. Trial relevant documentation which has to be at the trial site will be filed in the investigator site file (ISF) at the investigator site. The ISF document will be kept in print-out version at the sites as required by local regulation and BI SOP. 
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
BI 836845 is currently being investigated as monotherapy in two phase I trials ( U11-3025 , 
U10-2994 ) in various malignant tumour indications. A relevant biological dose (RBD) of 
BI 836845 has been determined as the recommended dose for monotherapy and will be the 
basis for determining the dose that can be used safely in combination with other therapies. Given the good tolerability and safety profile of BI 836845 it is expected that the addition of enzalutamide at the labelled dose might be combined safely. 
Thus, the phase Ib dose confirmation part of this trial aims to determine the MTD, and/or 
recommended phase II dose, of BI 836845 to be used in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic CRPC is deemed a sufficient safety analysis before commencement to the expansion cohort and phase II randomised trial. This design allows for a simple transition from the safety and tolerability dose-finding phase Ib, to the randomised phase II proof of concept trial, thereby preventing delays in the development of BI 836845 in CRPC.
The initial tolerability and safety phase Ib of the trial (escalation) will be performed to 
determine the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and any safety issues of combining enzalutamide and BI 836845 before commencement of the randomised trial and the exploratory expansion cohort. The traditional 3+3 design remains the prevailing method for conducting phase I cancer clinical trials. The main advantages of the 3+3 design are that it is simple to implement and considered safe for patients. In addition, the accrual of three patients per dose level will provide additional information regarding the pharmacokinetic inter-patient variability. The 3+3 rule-based design will allow for the assignment of patients to chosen dose levels according to specified rules, or DLTs, based on actual observations of target events noted from the clinical data. The MTD will be determined using the DLT criteria specified in this protocol, see section 5.2.3 .

The exploratory expansion cohort is to be conducted in patients that are already undergoing 
treatment with enzalutamide and are beginning to show a rise in PSA level according to standard criteria ( R13-1642 ). Patients may not have received prior taxane chemotherapy or
abiraterone treatment for inclusion into this part of the study. The results of the expansion 
cohort will not affect the continuation of the randomised phase II trial. Further data concerning safety, QT assessment and drug-drug interactions will also be collected throughout this cohort.
The phase II trial will be performed according to an open-label, randomised design. Blinding 
is not considered ethical, or necessary. The determination of radiological disease progression will be assessed by the investigational site and as recommended by modified RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262 ), and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group Criteria (PCWG2) ( R13-
1642 ) as per Appendix 10.4 and Section 5.1.2.1 , to assess whether a patient should remain on 
trial. However, an independent central imaging unit will be used to analyse and confirm 
progression free survival endpoint in the phase II trial in a blinded manner. Internal review by the trial team will also be blinded.
All patients will receive the standard enzalutamide regimen that is registered and 
recommended by the manufacturer during the phase Ib escalation, expansion cohort, and the phase II randomised trial, regardless of the treatment arm to which they are randomised.
The main objective of the trial is to test and support the hypothesis that BI 836845 will 
improve clinical outcome when combined with enzalutamide in patients with advanced and/or metastatic CRPC. 
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
A total of up to approximately 120 patients may be recruited into the study.  Approximately 
9-12 patients will be entered into the phase Ib tolerability and safety phase of the study (escalation part) to ensure the safety of the combination therapy and determine the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D). For the exploratory expansion cohortapproximately 25 patients will be treated with BI 836845 at the MTD, and/or recommendedphase II dose (RP2D) in combination with enzalutamide.
In phase II of the study, 80 patients will be randomised onto one of the two study arms, with 
40 patients randomised to each arm (Arm A=40, Arm B=40).  
The Phase Ib escalation part of the study will be performed in 4 or more centres. The Phase 
Ib expansion part of the study will be performed in 8 or more centres. The Phase II of the study will be performed in 25-30 centres globally.
A log of all patients included into the study (i.e. having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.

2. The patient develops unequivocal disease progression, supported by radiological evidence 
where possible.
3. An individual patient violates eligibility criteria which would affect the safety of the 
patient and/or the patient fails to comply with the protocol (after discussion between the sponsor and the investigator)

4. The patient is receiving forbidden concomitant therapy affecting the safety of the patient 
according to the judgment of the investigator (refer to section 4.2 )
5. The patient is no longer able to participate for other medical reasons (e.g. surgery, 
adverse events, or other diseases)
6. The patient meets one of the criteria that require permanent discontinuation of trial drug 
or dose reductions beyond those specified in section 4.1.4.4
7.  Investigator and patient (following discussion) consider it in the patient’s best interest to 
remove the patient from BI 836845 following results of the phase II trial.
8.  The trial is terminated for any of the reasons listed in section 3.3.4.2 ”Discontinuation of 
the trial by the sponsor”.
Patients who discontinue or withdraw prior to entering the active treatment phase will be 
entered in the trial database and will be reported. The data for patients who discontinued or withdrew from the trial after entering the active treatment phase must be documented and the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF. These data must be included in the trial database and must be reported.
If an individual patient withdraws consent for further participation in the trial including 
withdrawal to be followed up, the patient will be asked to have an end of trial investigation and the data collected until the point in time when withdrawal occurred will be included in the final analysis of the trial data. No further follow-up will be done for this patient. However, the investigator will be allowed to report the date and reason of death in case ofpublic registry, or the investigator becomes aware of the date and/or reason for death.
3.3.4.2 Discontinuation of the trial by the sponsorBoehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particular trial 
site at any time for the following reasons:
1. Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site,
2. Emergence of any efficacy/safety information that could significantly affect continuation 
of the trial or any other administrative reasons.
3. Violation of GCP, the CTP, or the contract by a trial site or investigator, disturbing the 
appropriate conduct of the trial.
4. Discontinuation of the clinical development program with BI 836845 in CRPC.
As described in section 2.3 Benefit-risk assessment, topline results of 1280-0022 showed 
no added benefit of xentuzumab compared to placebo when treating participants with 
metastatic breast cancer. Consequently, the clinical development of xentuzumab (BI 836845) was discontinued by Boehringer Ingelheim in oncology generally, including in CRPC.  Due to the worsening in benefit-risk and the discontinuation of the clinical development program with BI 836845 in CRPC, the trial will proceed towards termination based on the following 3 steps:
a. For xentuzumab-treated patients, the xentuzumab treatment will not extend past the 
drug expiration date (May 2023) of the last planned GMP manufacturing batch of IMP xentuzumab (provided that all patients are on xentuzumab for at least 2 years, and they

are tolerating the drug without tumor progression). Patients that will discontinue 
xentuzumab can still be eligible for continued treatment with enzalutamide (standard of care in this setting) provided they are tolerating the drug without tumor progression.
b. When all patients have discontinued xentuzumab treatment, if any patient on 
enzalutamide is able to continue taking this approved medication off study, then, at the request of the sponsor, the patient may end such treatment as part of the trial and discontinue study participation (if both the Investigator and patient agree).
c. After all patients end treatment with all study drugs (xentuzumab and enzalutamide), 
the trial will be terminated.
The investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).
3.3.5 Replacement of patients 
For phase Ib escalation:
Patients will be replaced for determination of the primary endpoint (MTD) in cases of:
∀Patient’s withdrawal during the first cycle of treatment for reasons other than DLT, e.g. 
patient no longer wishes to participate, or lost to follow up during first cycle.
∀Patients who do not experience DLT, but miss more than one dose of BI 836845 during 
the first cycle of treatment. 
∀Patients who do not experience DLT, but miss 3 or more consecutive doses of 
enzalutamide during the first cycle of treatment.
∀Patients who miss one complete cycle at any time beyond the first cycle of treatment may 
be replaced after discussion between the sponsor and the investigator.
∀Patients who are non-evaluable with respect to DLT.
∀Patients with CTCAE grade ≥3 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity to the study drug(s) 
within the first cycle will be replaced.
Patients that have been replaced might continue treatment in the trial should criteria in section 
4.1.4.4 apply; however these patients will not be considered for analysis of the primary 
endpoint of this part.
For phase Ib expansion cohort:
Patients who withdraw after assignment but before start of therapy will be replaced.

4.1.2 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and who have given 
written informed consent are eligible for participation in the study.
Patients entering Phase Ib:
∀At least 9-12 eligible patients will be entered into the safety and tolerability phase Ib, 
dose escalation part of the study and receive BI 836845 plus enzalutamide. Patients 
will be entered in a 3+3 design with a single dose escalation, dependent on DLTs observed.  
∀Approximately 25 patients will be entered into the exploratory expansion cohort at the 
MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) determined from the above safetyand tolerability phase.
Patients entering Phase II will be randomised at the first visit of Cycle 1 in a 1:1 ratio to 
either:
∀Arm A and receive BI 836845 plus enzalutamide, or 
∀Arm B and receive enzalutamide alone
Treatment assignment in the randomised trial will be by means of a third-party phone /web-
based randomisation during the screening phase. This will involve the use of an interactive response technology (IRT i.e. Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]/Interactive Web Response System [IWRS]). To facilitate the use of the IRT, the investigator will receive an IRT worksheet for each patient with the complete IRT dialogue and all necessary instructions for using the IRT.
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
4.1.3.1 BI 836845
The dose level and frequency of BI 836845 was determined following phase I dose escalation 
studies in both a weekly ( U11-3025 ) and 3-weekly dosing scheme ( U10-2994 ).  Minimal 
protocol defined DLTs were observed and no MTD was reached in either study; however a 
relevant biological dose was determined.
A dose of BI 836845 is considered biologically relevant, when concentrations of free IGF-1 
and free IGF-2 are considerably reduced over time. Free IGF-1 and free IGF-2 plasma concentrations are not measured in studies 1280.1 and 1280.2. Therefore a semi-mechanisticPK/PD model was developed describing the time-dependent kinetics of and the interaction between BI 836845 and the different PD biomarkers (i.e. IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP3) over time. Simulations using this model indicate that a weekly dosing of 1000 mg BI 836845 reduces free IGF-1 concentration by more than 90% and in addition free IGF-2 by 64 % at trough steady-state relative to pre-treatment; this is considered a relevant biological effect. Therefore, a weekly dose of 1000 mg BI 836845 is considered a suitable dose.

The exact dose of BI 836845 to be used in the expansion cohort and combination treatment 
arm of the phase II study will be determined during the phase Ib tolerability and safety phase,(phase Ib escalation phase) see section 4.1.3.3 .
4.1.3.2 Enzalutamide
The recommended dose of enzalutamide, as per the SPC, is 160 mg (four 40 mg capsules, 
four 40mg tablets or two 80mg tablets) administered orally once daily and can be taken with or without food (for dosing instructions on PK sampling visits see below).
4.1.3.3 Determination of the dose of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamideThe phase Ib tolerability and safety phase (phase Ib escalation cohort) will be performed to 
determine the MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide using a 3+3 design in order to confirm the recommended dose to be used in thephase II randomised trial and exploratory expansion cohort.
Dosing with BI 836845 will be as follows:
∀The starting dose of BI 836845 will be 750 mg (75%) total dose plus 160 mg (100%) 
daily dose of enzalutamide.  
oIf 0 out of 3 patients experience a DLT enter 3 patients at highest dose of BI 
836845
oIf 1 out of 3 patients experience a DLT enter 3 more patients at starting dose 
of BI 836845. 
If 0 of 3 of these additional patients experience a DLT move to highest 
dose of BI 836845. 
If ≥ 1 out of 3 of these additional patients experience a DLT trial is 
stopped. 
oIf ≥ 2 out of 3 patients experience a DLT trial is stopped.
∀The highest dose of BI 836845 will be 1000 mg (100%) total dose plus 160 mg 
(100%) daily dose of enzalutamide.
oIf ≤1 out of 3 patients experience a DLT enter 3 additional patients at 
highest dose of BI 836845.
oIf ≥ 2 out of 3 patients experience a DLT:
If only 3 patients are entered at starting dose of BI 836845 enter 
additional 3 patients at starting dose of BI 836845
If 6 patients are already recruited in starting dose regimen recruitment 
into escalation part of trial is complete.

The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which one or less DLT is observed in six 
patients during the first cycle of treatment of each patient (28 days). See section 5.2.4
Non-evaluable patients for DLT will be replaced. 
The decision on dose escalation and determination of next dose, the MTD, and/or 
recommended phase II dose (the exploratory expansion cohort will also use the same dose as Phase II) will be determined after discussion with the trial team comprising of at least one BI Clinical Monitor, BI project physician (TMM) and Coordinating Investigator, or designee, and taking into account patient safety.
4.1.3.4 Exploratory expansion cohortFor the exploratory expansion cohort patients will have received prior enzalutamide, but no 
prior abiraterone for CRPC, and while on enzalutamide show a rise in PSA according to standard criteria ( R13-1642 ), and section 3.3.2 (inclusion criterion #19), before entry into the 
trial. Patients may not have received any prior taxane-based chemotherapy before entering 
this cohort. Approximately 25 patients will be treated with the combination therapy of BI 836845 and enzalutamide at the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).  This expansion cohort will allow for further safety, tolerability and PK assessments (including investigation of potential drug-drug interaction), in addition to the evaluation of anti-tumour activity.
The current enzalutamide treatment taken prior to the trial must be continued after 
patient informed consent and throughout the screening period and up to the day before
the dosing with BI 836845. A compliance check of enzalutamide taken prior to the first day 
of study treatment should be performed to ensure consistent dosing up to the point of entry into the study, see section 4.3 .
Safety will be continually assessed and reported accordingly for all repeated cycles of 
treatment for all patients throughout the phase Ib escalation and at the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
4.1.4.1 Phase Ib tolerability/safety and dose finding phase
Initially, three patients will be treated at the starting dose regimen (75% BI 836845 and 100% 
enzalutamide). Dose escalation will be performed according to the rules outlined in Section 
4.1.3.3 . Dose escalation and entry of patients into the highest dose regimen will begin only 
after accrual of the required minimum number of patients has been achieved and all patients 
in the cohort have completed cycle 1 (28 days) of treatment. Patients who are not treated to the end of the first cycle for any reasons other than DLT will be replaced, as per section 3.3.5 . 
MTD is the highest dose at which no more than one of 6 patients experiences DLT within the 
initial treatment cycle. Six patients must be treated at the MTD, or recommended phase IIdose (RP2D) before commencement of the phase Ib exploratory expansion cohort and phaseII.

Prior to inclusion of any new patient, the investigator must confirm the correct dose with the 
BI Clinical Monitor by means of a fax registration form. If a patient develops a DLT, treatment must be paused and a dose reduction must occur as per the details described in section 4.1.4.4 . 
BI 836845 vials will be allocated by the IRT system at each weekly visit before study drug 
administration.
4.1.4.2 BI 836845 (Phase Ib and Phase II - Arm A)BI 836845 will be given intravenously as a single dose over approximately one hour (60 
minutes), with repeated weekly administr ation on day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of every 28 day cycle 
of treatment in phase Ib and Arm A in phase II.
BI 836845 will be administered in the exploratory expansion cohort and phase II Arm A, at 
the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) level determined during phase Ibtolerability and safety (escalation).
Infusion reactions that might occur during infusion with BI 836845, e.g. pyrexia, chills, 
rigors, dyspnoea, urticaria, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, may be managed byreducing the infusion rate and administering prophylactic antihistamines for subsequent dosing. Severe reactions may require immediate and permanent discontinuation of infusion. A one hour observation period is recommended following each infusion for the first 3 cycles of treatment and at least a 15 minute observation period is recommended following subsequent infusions. See section 4.2.1.1.
Infusion reactions will not be reported on the standard AE page but will be reported on a 
separate page specifically for infusion reactions in the CRF.
BI 836845 vials will be allocated by the IRT system at every weekly visit.4.1.4.3 Enzalutamide (Phase Ib and Phase II- Arm A and B)On the days of infusion, the enzalutamide dose (160mg daily) should be taken in the clinic 
immediately after the start of the infusion of BI 836845. On all other days patients must take the recommended enzalutamide dose of 160 mg daily, as per the SPC at the same time of day and preferably in the morning.
On the days of PK sampling, enzalutamide must be taken in the clinic, and not at home.
For countries where enzalutamide is supplied, enzalutamide packs will be allocated by the 
IRT system for every weekly visit and/or the start of every cycle dependent on the part of the trial to which the patients are entered. The supply will cover either a full week (7 days), or a full cycle (28 days), of treatment. Back-up packs will be provided. Replacement packs will also be available for supplies that might be lost by the patient, or where there might be a delay in the first visit of a cycle.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical visits to the sites may need to be restricted to 
ensure patient’s safety. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the investigator may still decide to continue the trial treatment and trial medication may be shipped to the patient’s home if acceptable according to local law and regulations. The

conditions of shipment.
4.1.4.4 Temporary treatment interruption and dose reduction for BI 836845 and 
enzalutamide during phase Ib and phase II
Drug-related DLTs or those adverse events requiring dose adjustment, will be managed by a 
pause in treatment followed by a subsequent dose reduction of the relevant medicationaccording to tables 4.1.4.4:1 and 4.1.4.4:2 . In phase Ib escalation, BI 836845 and 
enzalutamide must be paused when a drug-related DLT occurs regardless of the cycle of 
treatment. In the phase Ib exploratory expansion cohort and phase II, the causal drug(s) should be paused regardless of the cycle of treatment. In both phase Ib and phase II, the patient will be kept on study until both BI 836845 and enzalutamide are permanently stoppedand the patient is discontinued.

BI 836845 treatment may resume when 
patient has recovered to grade ≤1 or baseline. 
Baseline is defined as the CTCAE grade at the start of treatment. Resume treatment at reduced dose according to table 4.1.4.4:2
If patient has not recovered to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline within 28 days study treatment must be permanently discontinued*
Enzalutamide treatment should be withheld 
for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ 
Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced dose if warranted, as per the SPC. Resume treatment at reduced dose according to table 4.1.4.4:2
If patient has not recovered to ≤ Grade 2 or

up to 28 days, but no dose reduction should occur unless indicated in the current drug label/SPC of enzalutamide. Otherwise, the decision to continue with the study treatment will be made by the BI Clinical Monitor in agreement with the investigator.
*In the event that the patient is deriving obvious clinical benefit to the judgement of the investigator, e.g. stable disease or an objective response further treatment with the study drug will be decided only after agreement between the investigator and the BI clinical monitor
Dose reduction of BI 836845 and/or enzalutamide:
Either treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose; however only two dose reductions of BI 
836845 or enzalutamide will be permitted. If more than two dose reductions of the same drugare required then the patient should be removed from the drug treatment. A patient will be kept on study until both BI 836845 and enzalutamide are stopped. Dose reduction below 500 mg for BI 836845 or 80 mg for enzalutamide will not be permitted. See table 4.1.4.4:2 for

4.2 CONCOMITANT THERAPY, RESTRICTIONS, AND RESCUE 
TREATMENT
4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatment(s)
All concomitant (non-oncological) therapies initiated during the trial to provide adequate care 
to the patient, where clinically required, are allowed but should be recorded in the eCRF. Patients should receive full supportive care, e.g. transfusions of blood and blood products, antibiotics, analgesia, according to local practice/guidelines where appropriate. Trade name and indication of concomitant therapies will be documented. If patients receive parenteral nutrition during the trial, the components need not be specified in detail. It should be indicated as “parenteral nutrition” and the eCRF completed accordingly. If a patient requires anaesthesia, it will be sufficient to indicate “anaesthesia” without specifying the details.
Rescue medication to reverse the effects of BI 836845 is not available. Potential side effects 
of BI 836845, as well as enzalutamide, should be treated symptomatically. Please refer to the current SPC for enzalutamide for details of side-effects and management.
Symptomatic treatment of tumour-associated symptoms is allowed (including the use of 
bisphosphonates for treatment of bone metastases).
Anti-emetic medication should be prescribed according to local practice and according to the 
label instructions from the manufacturer. All anti-emetic drugs administered shall be reported in the eCRF indicating whether the respective drug is given as prophylaxis and/or premedication or treatment of an adverse event.
Premedication to avoid allergic reactions shall be administered as recommended by the 
manufacturer and as requested by the local requirements at the site. Administration of the drugs shall be reported in the eCRF indicating whether the respective drug is given as prophylaxis and/or premedication or treatment of an adverse event.
Precaution should be taken to avoid extravasation. Patients should be asked to report any pain 
or burning at the site of injection immediately. If extravasation is suspected the infusions should be stopped immediately. Treatment should be initiated according to local practice and according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Patients should be instructed about signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia and asked to take 
food once they suffer from sweating, hungriness and tremor.
If elective surgery is considered necessary for the patient, at least 7 days should elapse after 
the last dose of BI 836845 before surgery is performed wherever possible. Treatment can be resumed on the 3rd post-operative day.
Patients that are chemically castrated before entry to the trial must continue taking luteinizing 
hormone release hormone (LHRH) agonists throughout the duration of the trial treatment.
For patients entering the phase Ib expansion cohort: 
Enzalutamide taken by patients prior to entering the trial must be continued through the 
screening period up to the first day of the trial, in countries where the enzalutamide is supplied by Bohringer Ingelheim clinical trial supplies of enzalutamide will then be

dispensed.  The clinical supplies of enzalutamide must be taken by the patient continuously 
throughout the duration of the trial treatment.
4.2.1.1 Management of infusion reactions 
Infusion reactions may occur during infusion with BI 836845 and include pyrexia, chills, 
rigors, dyspnoea, urticaria, bronchospasm, hypotension and hypertension and should be treated symptomatically as judged clinically relevant by the investigator. 
A one hour observation period is recommended following each infusion for the first 3 cycles 
of treatment and at least a 15 minute observation period is recommended following subsequent infusions. Grade 1 to 2 infusion reactions may be managed with a slower infusion rate as per local guidelines. For symptomatic treatment of infusion reactions hydrocortisone, antihistamines such as chlorphenamine accompanied by an antipyretic/analgesic, and/or a bronchodilator may be administered according to the local recommendations. Severe reactions require immediate and permanent discontinuation of infusion. The grading of hypersensitivity reactions will be according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE version 4.03, 14 June 2010 ( R10-4848 ), 
see appendix 10.5 .
Infusion reactions will not be reported on the standard AE page but will be reported on a 
separate page specifically for infusion reactions in the CRF.
Table 4.2.1.1: 1 Infusion reaction management
Infusion Reaction Grade Management
CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 In the event of a mild to moderate CTCAE grade 1 or 2 non-
allergic infusion event, the infusion should be interrupted immediately with symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, NSAIDs, steroids, narcotics, IV fluids) if needed. Once the event has resolved, the infusion should be restarted at half of the previous rate. If the reduced infusion rate is tolerated for 30 minutes, the infusion rate may then be increased to the next close rate on the patient’s infusion schedule. 
CTCAE Grade 3 For patients experiencing CTCAE grade 3 infusion related 
event, infusion should be interrupted immediately and patients should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. Only after all the symptoms have disappeared the infusion should be started. The infusion rate at restart should be half of the infusion rate at the time of onset of the reaction.
CTCAE Grade 4 Patients experiencing CTCAE grade 4 such as anaphylaxis 
during an infusion should have infusion immediately stopped and receive appropriate treatment including use of resuscitation medications and equipment that must be available. Such patients should NOT receive any further BI 836845 treatment.

4.2.1.2 Management of potential hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia as a consequence of BI 836845 therapy can be treated with standard 
treatment regimens such as oral hyperglycaemic therapy, e.g. metformin, sulfonylurea and/or insulin as per standard and/or local guidance. When treatment with the study drug is discontinued the need for further antidiabetic treatment has to be evaluated depending on the blood glucose levels of the patient. The appropriate expert advice should be considered in the management of hyperglycaemia.
4.2.2 Restrictions
4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Additional chemo-, immuno-, hormone- or radiotherapies to treat the tumour disease are not 
allowed during the active treatment period of this trial. 
For symptom control palliative radiotherapy may be permitted for bone metastases after 
discussion with the sponsor provided that radiotherapy does not affect the target lesions, and the reason for the radiotherapy does not reflect progressive disease.
Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be 
avoided. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily. 
Enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 (see appendix 
10.3 for example list), CYP2C9 (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin), or CYP2C19 (e.g. S-
mephenytoin), should be evaluated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase 
in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate.
Enzymes that may also be induced include CYP2B6 and uridine 5'-diphospho-
glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CYP2B6 (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate.
Enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp. Medicinal products with a 
narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with enzalutamide and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
Please refer always to the current SPC/label for specific restrictions for enzalutamide.
Additional restrictions for patients in Phase Ib expansion:
In order to effectively assess the potential for pharmacokinetic drug interaction between 
enzalutamide and BI 836845 and to investigate potential alterations of pharmacokinetics

during co-administration, strong and moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers are prohibited during the periods specified below in the Ph Ib 
expansion cohort:
∀from Day -7 of the screening period till visit 1 of treatment course 1 (C1V1) and
∀from visit 4 of the first treatment course (C1V4) till visit 2 of treatment course 2 
(C2V2)
A list of examples is provided in appendix 10.3.2 . Switching to a different class of drug that 
is not a strong or moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor/inducer or CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer is 
recommended.
Outside the above time periods, follow the respective drug package insert/SPC when 
considering concomitant treatment with CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.
Anti-platelet medications (e.g. acetyl salicylic acid) should be discontinued 7 days prior to 
tumour biopsy. Anticoagulant medications should be discontinued prior to tumour biopsy. In all patients, the risk of discontinuing anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant medications must be weighed against the (potential) risk of bleeding during/after biopsy. Anti-platelet and anticoagulant may be restarted after tumour biopsy by the judgment of the investigators.
Any concomitant medication should be reduced to the clinically necessary minimum on the 
days of BI 836845 infusion.
Treatment with other investigational drugs or treatment within another clinical trial is not 
allowed at any time during this trial.
4.2.2.2 Restrictions on diet and life style
There are no major dietary or life style restrictions except that patients should attend visits in 
a fasting condition at the site for analysis of specific blood parameters (glucose and HbA1c on day 1 of every cycle).
Patients are requested to take enzalutamide at the same time every morning to facilitate 
accurate PK analysis. (This also applies to patients in the screening phase of the expansion cohort).
On day -1 of the screening period (expansion cohort only) and day 1 of cycle 2 (phase Ib
and phase II), patients should remain fasting for at least 1 hour after administration of 
enzalutamide , (i.e. food/water intake is not allowed before the 1:00 h PK sample). The 
timing of food intake prior to and after enzalutamide administration must be recorded 
in the eCRF.

4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
BI 836845:
BI 836845 will be administered as a single infusion over one hour under supervision of the 
investigator or dedicated study personnel.
Enzalutamide:
On the days of PK sampling, patients must take enzalutamide in the clinic and should not 
take the dose at home prior to the visit. Sites should be encouraged to schedule PK visits 
early in the morning to accommodate consistent dosing schedules. 
For patients in the phase Ib expansion cohort :
Patients in the expansion cohort must be questioned by site staff  on day -1 (screening 
period) and at cycle 2 day 1, as to the date, time and dose of last enzalutamide intake prior to the visit, and this information must be recorded in the eCRF.   
Patients in the expansion cohort will be issued a diary card upon receipt of the patient 
information sheet. Date and time of enzalutamide administration must be completed in thediary card from day -7 to -2 of the screening period. A second diary card will be issued in the expansion cohort at C1V4 for completion of the date and time of enzalutamide administration from day 23 to 28 of cycle 1. Enzalutamide compliance must be recorded in the eCRF.
For patients in the phase II arm B :
All patients in arm B of the Phase II part must be questioned by site staff at cycle 2 day 
1 as to the date, time and dose of last enzalutamide intake prior to the visit, and this information must be recorded in the eCRF.   
Site staff must check enzalutamide compliance and reconcile the returned medication every 
week during the first two cycles and, thereafter, at the end of every cycle /start of next cycle.  Weekly checks can be completed, if required, throughout study participation.  Compliance must be reviewed prior to the dispensing of new enzalutamide kits to patients.

oMaximum change in CTC counts compared to baseline that occurs at any point 
after treatment start
5.1.2 Assessment of efficacy (anti-tumour activity)
5.1.2.1 Assessment of tumours and bone
For soft tissue lesions:
Radiological disease progression will be evaluated at the investigative site and be based on 
tumour assessments in bone and/or soft tissue lesions. For patients with measurable disease at baseline, progression will be determined according to modified RECIST 1.1( R09-0262 ). See 
Appendix 10.4 for additional details of modified RECIST criteria.
The following modification applies only for lymph nodes as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical 
Trials Working Group ( R13-1642 ): only lymph nodes > 20 mm in the short diameter at 
baseline should be used to assess a change in size during the trial and may be considered a 
target lesion. 
Re-appearing, or enlarging, lymph nodes < 20 mm in the short diameter shall not serve as the 
only trigger for PD. The radiologist will make every effort to assess the patient’s disease 
Boehringer Ingelheim 06 Jun 2022
BI Trial No.: 1280.8Doc. No.: c02304008-15         Trial Protocol Version 12 Page 61 of 241

elsewhere, and provide explanatory comments for the oncologist to take into consideration 
upon determining the final overall assessment, if applicable.
When a lymph node continues to increase over 20 mm in short diameter on subsequent 
images, or other accompanying findings on images change from equivocal to unequivocal, the time-point where the lymph node increase was first documented shall serve as the date of PD.
Tumour assessment must be by CT or MRI imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at 
screening. If clinically indicated, imaging of any other known or suspected sites of disease using an appropriate method (CT scan or MRI) should be performed. After study entry, all lesions identified during the screening should be followed up at all specified imaging time points. 
The same radiological procedure should be used throughout the study at baseline and for all 
repeated measurements according to the Flow Chart . Clinical tumour assessment will 
contribute to the decision for continued patient participation in the trial. Every effort should 
be made to objectively evaluate tumour response for all patients who enter into the trial, including those who discontinue prematurely. 
If a patient presents with marginal or equivocal tumour progression at their first RECIST 
assessment, confirmation by a second scan 6 or more weeks later, after continued treatment, is recommended.
Bone lesions are to be reported on the assessment of bone metastases CRF page and not on 
the response to therapy RECIST assessment CRF page. 
For bone:
A bone scan should be performed at screening, at 8 week intervals until week 24 (i.e. weeks 
8, 16 and 24) and then at 12 week intervals thereafter (i.e. weeks 36, 48 etc) throughout the trial at until disease progression and/or new anticancer therapy is started. 
Radiographic progression on bone scans is defined by the following criteria (as per the 
Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 ( R13-1642 )):
∀≥ 2 new bone lesions on bone scan performed within the flare window plus ≥2 
additional at confirmation (“2 + 2”) on a second bone scan ≥ 6 weeks later. The date 
of progression is the date of the first scan that shows the change.
∀≥ 2 new bone lesions on bone scans performed after the flare window, disease 
progression is determined at that assessment.
∀If bone scan does not show new lesions OR new lesions are not consistent with 
progression, then patient should continue on study protocol and continue dosing until 
the next tumour assessment, as clinically indicated, until radiographic disease progression.
The flare window is considered as 12 weeks from randomization for patients in phase II and 
12 weeks from start of treatment for patients in phase Ib escalation and expansion.

Proprietary confidential information. !2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
For examples of bone scan progression using the prostate cancer clinical trials working group 
guidelines (PCWG2), see appendix 10.7
Any changes in bone imaging should be evaluated radiographically by CT scan, MRI, or X -
ray to ascertain the presence of bone destruction versus a healing reaction. 
Only new bone lesions consistent with progression are to be counted towards defining 
radiographic progression in the bone scan eCRF page. New bone lesions should not be recorded in the RECIST evaluation eCRF page unless there is a soft tissue component that has met the modified RECIST 1.1 progression criteria.
In general:
Assessments will be performed at screening, or if valid results are available as part of routine 
clinical practice and are within 28 days prior to start of study treatment, repeat imaging will not be required. Imaging will be at baseline and then every 2 cycles (8 weeks) up to week 24 and then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter i.e. prior to the start of cycles 3, 5, 7, 10 onwards. Tumour assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to the scheduled date for start of the relevant cycle/assessment date.
In the event of a delay, interruption or discontinuation of treatment, tumour assessment 
should continue to follow the original schedule. The schedule should be followed until 
progression is observed or until the patient commences further treatment for disease, 
whichever occurs first. For patients who prematurely discontinue study medication without disease progression, tumour assessments should continue to be performed until disease progression or start of further treatment.
5.1.2.2 Assessment of PSAPSA assessments and determination of response, or progression, will be performed locally.
Early changes in PSA should not be considered in clinical decisions for continuation of participation in the trial. PSA will be assessed according to the schedule on the Flow chart . 
PSA will be measured during screening to confirm eligibility and at cycle 1 day 1 before 
study treatment for a baseline value.  PSA will be measured 8 weeks later at the start of cycle 3 and every cycle thereafter to assess possible disease response or progression.
PSA progression is defined in this study as the date that a 25% or greater increase in PSA and 
an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir is documented (which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later) ( R13-1642 ).  Patients should be kept on trial until 
radiological or symptomatic progression is documented with or without confirmed PSA 
progression.
5.1.2.3 Circulating tumour cell (CTC) assessmentsCirculating tumour cells will be analysed using the Veridex CellSearch technology. After cell 
counting, isolated CTCs might be used for morphological, protein or molecularcharacterization by FISH. CTC counts will be exploratory evaluated as prognostic and surrogate efficacy markers.

In phase Ib and phase II of the study at least 10 mL blood will be taken from a forearm vein 
at those time points specified in the Flow Chart and immediately shipped to a CRO with 
given authorization by BI.
Measurements and analysis will be made to determine the maximum decline in CTC counts 
compared to baseline that occurs at any point after treatment start. CTC response will be measured by a CTC reduction compared to baseline: CTC decline from ≥5 to <5 cells per 7.5
ml blood ( R14-0865 ) for at least one time point after treatment start will be reported, as will
all declines in CTC counts of 30% or more. 
5.1.3 Central Imaging
Until the primary analysis, image data collection in phase II will be sent to a central imaging 
unit to obtain an independent blinded confirmation of tumour response assessment based on a uniform interpretation of radiographic image for all patients entered on to the trial. Upon receipt of image data, the central imaging unit will log all data onto a tracking system and perform quality control of digitised radiographic images.
An independent review of radiographic images including: (i) sequential lesion selection and 
measurement, (ii) incremental radiological response assessment followed by, (iii) global review of tumour response or progression, will be performed by blinded (with regard to patient, treatment, and visit) radiologist. 
The review of the image data will be performed by independent radiologists, who are not 
affiliated with the study. All procedures will be done according to the specifications provided in the investigator site file. The purpose of the blinded reading is to independently assess patient response to therapy and disease progression (for details, please refer to the ISF).
Further details of the independent review are described in the Imaging Charter. Modifications 
of the conventional RECIST 1.1 lesion measurement criteria will be introduced into the measurement process in an attempt to reduce variability in the measurements for the independent central imaging review. Eligibility and treatment decisions will be based on the assessment of disease by the investigator (as per Section 5.1.2.1 andappendix 10.4 ). Central 
imaging will not be used for this purpose and the results of the central imaging review will 
not be communicated to the investigator.
5.2 SAFETY
5.2.1 Endpoint(s) of safety
Safety of BI 836845 when administered together with enzalutamide will be evaluated by 
intensity and incidence of AEs, and will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 dated 14 June 2010 ( R10-4848 ). Safety endpoints will include:

Primary endpoints (Phase Ib Escalation):
∀Number of patients with Dose Limiting Toxicities 
∀Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836845
All other safety endpoints will be defined in Section 5.3.1 and details are provided in Section 
5.2.2.
5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.2.1 Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence in a patient or clinical
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of amedicinal product, whether or not consid ered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which:
∀results in death,
∀is life-threatening,
∀requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation,
∀results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,
∀is a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect,
      or∀is to be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the above definitions.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have causeddeath if more severe.
An AE does not meet the SAE criteria for hospitalisation if:
∀The subject was treated in the emergency room but was not admitted for an overnight 
stay
∀Hospitalisation due to pre-planned treatments or procedures
Boehringer Ingelheim 06 Jun 2022

Proprietary confidential information. !2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
∀Hospitalisation due to social circumstances or administrative reasons
∀Hospitalisation for diagnostic reasons without AE
AEs  considered “Always  Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events,
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can always be
considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as
given above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the RDC system. A copy of the 
latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided to you upon request. These events 
should always be reported as SAEs as described in Section 5.2.2 .
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any specific AE that ha s been identified at the project level as 
being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within 
this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same 
class. AESI need to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section 5.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs: 
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters:
For patients with normal liver function at baseline:
∀an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of 
total bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
∀marked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN
For patients with impaired function tests at baseline:
∀an elevation of transaminase ≥ (baseline + 4 x ULN) combined with an elevation 
of total bilirubin ≥ 2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample.
∀patients with abnormal liver function tests must have their abnormalities and the 
etiology documented in detail as baseline conditions. Every effort should be 
made to explain possible deteriorations of baseline conditions
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF. In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should 
make sure these parameters are analysed, if  necessary in an unscheduled blood test. 
Should the results meet the criteria of hepa tic injury alert, the procedures described in 
the DILI checklist should be followed.

Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs):
∀DLTs occurring during the phase Ib escalation cohort will be considered protocol-
specified AESI. See section 5.2.3 for DLT definitions. AESI will be reported on the 
eCRFs/SAE reporting forms, as per the SAE reporting instructions detailed in the 
‘Adverse Event Reporting’ section of the Investigator Site File.
AESI are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to Serious Adverse Events, even if 
they do not meet any of the seriousness criteria – for details please see section 5.2.2 .
Intensity of AEs
The intensity of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the (e) CRF according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 dated 14 June 
2010 ( R10-4848 ) in the (e)CRF.
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgment should be used to dete rmine the relationship, considering all relevant
factors, including pattern of reaction, temp oral relationship, de-challenge or re-
challenge, confounding factors such as conc omitant medication, concomitant diseases
and relevant history.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relati onship between the investigational 
product administered and the AE.
No: There is no reasonable causal relati onship between the investigational 
product administered and the AE.
The causal relationship must be provided by the Investigator for all potential trial drugs, i.e. 
the BI trial drug and for all other trial drugs (such as any active comparator or placebo and for trial procedure).
The reason for the decision on causal relationship needs to be provided in the (e)CRF and 
on the SAE form (if applicable).
5.2.2.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF by theInvestigator:
- From signing the informed consent onwards through the Residual Effect 
period (REP), until the end of the REP all AEs (non-serious and serious), and 
AESIs.
- After the end of the REP until trial completion, all related SAEs and related AESIs.- If in an individual patient only vital status information (Phase II patients only)
is collected from a certain timepoint on, no further AEs or AESIs will bereported for this patient.

Figure 5.2.2.2: 1 Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The REP is defined as 42 days after the las t trial medication application. All AEs which 
occurred through the treatment phase and throughout the REP will be considered as on treatment please see section 7.3.3 . Events which occurred after the REP will be considered
as post treatment events.
After the last per protocol contact the Inve stigator does not need to actively monitor 
patients for AEs. However, if the Investigator becomes aware of SAEs or AESIs that occurred after the last per protocol cont act, the SAEs and AESIs should be reported by the
Investigator to the Sponsor if considered relevant by the Investigator.
AE reporting to sp onsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for thereported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours ) to the 
Sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in theISF). In specific occasions the Investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to 
be provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as forinitial information.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate
(e)CRF pages and the BI SAE form, e.g. onset, end date, intensity, treatment required, 
outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug(s). The Investigator 
should determine the causal relationship to the trial medication, the trial procedures 
outlined under section 6.2 , and any possible interactions between the investigational
drug(s) and a non-investigational product (NIMP)
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the (e)CRF and SAE form 
(if applicable):
∀  Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions

∀  Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if 
they are judged clinically relevant by the Investigator.
If such abnormalities already pre-exist prior trial inclusion they will be considered 
as baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after trial completion must be followed up until 
they have resolved, have been sufficiently cha racterized, or no further information can be 
obtained.
Screening failures:
SAEs occurring in patients after having discontinued in the trial due to screening failures, 
i.e after the screening period and who did not receive any trial medication, are to be reported if 
the Investigator considered the SAE related to the screening procedure. SAE which occurred during the screening period are to be reported according to standard practices .
Pregnancy
In the rare case that a female partner of a subject participating in this clinical trial becomes pregnant, the Investigator must report immed iately (within 24 hours) the drug exposure to 
female partners of male participants during pregnancy (DEDP) to the Sponsor’s unique entrypoint (country- specific contact details will be provided in the ISF). The PregnancyMonitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must
be followed up and reported to the Sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy
Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying
SAE, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy then the SAE has to bereported on the SAE form in addition.
The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
Exemption to (S)AE Reporting:
Disease Progression is a trial endpoint for analysis of efficacy and as such is exempted from 
reporting as an (S)AE.  Progression of the patients underlying malignancy will be recorded on the appropriate pages of the (e)CRF as part of efficacy data collection only and will not be reported on the SAE Form. It will therefore not be entered in the safety database (ARISg) and hence not get expeditiously reported. Death due to disease progression is also to be recorded on the appropriate (e)CRF page and not on the SAE Form.
However, when there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study drug(s) 
and the progression of the underlying malignancy, the event must be reported as an SAE on the SAE Form and on the (e)CRF.
Examples of exempted events of PD may be:

• Progression of underlying malignancy (Progressive disease [PD]):  if PD is clearly 
consistent with the suspected progression of the underlying malignancy as defined by the respective response criteria. • Hospitalization/Procedures due solely to the progression of underlying malignancy (PD)• Clinical symptoms and/or signs of progression (without confirmation by objective criteria e.g. imaging, clinical measurement): if the symptom can exclusively be determined to be due to the progression of the underlying malignancy and does meet the expected pattern of progression for the disease under study. 
Exempted events are collected and tracked following a protocol-specified monitoring plan.Exempted events are monitored at appropriate intervals by the Data Monitoring Committee.
5.2.3 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) definitions
DLTs will be assessed during the phase Ib escalation part of the study. The determination of 
the number of DLTs experienced during the first cycle of treatment will be used to identify the MTD of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide.
A study drug-related adverse event constitutes a DLT, if one of the following applies during 
treatment in the phase Ib escalation cohort:
∀AST or ALT > 5x ULN (for baseline AST/ALT ≤ ULN) or > (baseline value + 4x ULN) 
(for baseline AST/ALT > ULN)
∀CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 toxicity (except for incompletely treated nausea, untreated 
vomiting, untreated diarrhoea, fatigue, infusion reaction, electrolyte, or AST/ALT).
∀CTCAE Grade ≥2 infusion reaction despite adequate pre-medication.
∀CTCAE Grade ≥2 nausea and/or vomiting persisting for 7 or more days despite 
antiemetic treatment.
∀Any grade 4 hyperglycaemia (symptomatic or asymptomatic).
∀Any Grade 3 hyperglycaemia lasting >48 hours.
∀Any electrolyte grade 3 AE which is refractory to optimal correction therapy
∀Seizure event of any CTCAE grade
∀No recovery from a non-DLT CTCAE grade >2 toxicity to grade 1 within 14 days of 
administered dose
∀Sustained fatigue/asthenia grade 3 for longer than 96 hours associated with deterioration 
of ECOG Performance Score
∀Any other study drug related toxicity at any time point during the study considered 
significant enough to be qualified as DLT in the opinion of the investigators and confirmed by the safety review with the BI clinical monitor, will be reported as a DLT.
It is essential that patients are treated sufficiently according to supportive care standards.
As patients with a documented clinical benefit, e.g. objective tumour response or absence of 
tumour progression, will receive further treatment with the trial drug all DLT events in individual patients occurring at any time during treatment cycles, or the follow-up period, must be reported as an AESI.

Proprietary confidential information. !2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
The decisions regarding dose escalation steps in the tolerability and safety phase will be made 
only upon review of the DLTs during the first cycle of treatment and after discussion between 
the sponsor and the clinical investigators at all sites, and in consideration of all the available toxicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.
5.2.4 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)
The maximum tolerated dose in this study is defined as the highest protocol dose level of BI 
836845 in combination with enzalutamide, at which no more than 1 out of 6 patients in a cohort experiences a drug related DLT during the first 28 day treatment cycle – i.e. the incidence of a dose limiting toxicity is no more than 17%. DLT events experienced after the start of the second treatment course will be examined separately.
The MTD or a lower dose level will be chosen as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) 
based on the totality of the safety data available at the time that 6 evaluable patients have 
finished course 1 of treatment at the MTD (or RP2D if MTD not reached); at the earliest . 
The discussion and agreement on dose selection between the phase Ib escalation investigators and the sponsor will be documented and communicated to all participating sites. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will also be used for the phase Ib expansion cohort.
5.2.5 Assessment of safety laboratory parameters
Safety assessments, including clinical and laboratory evaluations will be assessed during 
treatment cycles according to Flow Chart . Adverse events are to be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE 
version 4.03, 14 June 2010 ( R10-4848 ). Changes in laboratory tests from baseline will be 
assessed.
Assessment of safety laboratory parameters prior to approval of protocol version 10
Blood samples, including fasting serum samples (fasting state from midnight the night 
before), will be collected up to one day prior to the scheduled time points as specified in the Flow Chart and analysed in a laboratory facility at (or close to) the investigational site. Safety 
laboratory examinations include hematology, biochemistry, coagulation and urine 
examination. See Table 5.2.5: 1 for details. Futher samples may be taken throughout the course of the study when deemed appropriate by the investigator. All analyses are to be performed by the local clinical laboratory.

If blood sampling at the trial site is not possible, safety lab analyses can be performed at a 
local lab. The results of the lab tests must be transferred to the investigator who ensures medical review and proper documentation in the eCRF.
5.2.6 Electrocardiogram
5.2.6.1 ECG Recording – Phase Ib and Phase II 
Triplicate 12-lead ECGs (each ECG to be taken approximately 2-3 minutes apart) will be 
performed in all patients at the time-points as specified in the Flow Chart and Appendix 10.6
and will be coincident to PK sampling. The investigator will review the ECG recording, 
comment on any clinical significance and if applicable record any ECG abnormality that meets AE criteria. 
Triplicate ECGs will be recorded at the following time-points:
∀Screening
∀Pre-dose (-20 min. to -5 min. before administration of BI 836845 and/or 
enzalutamide) and immediately after the end of infusion of BI 836845 (within 15
minutes after the end infusion to ensure PK sampling is also completed within 15 minutes), or one hour after the administration of enzalutamide on the following days*:
o Cycle 1: Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 
o Cycle 2: Day 8, Day 15 
o Cycle 3: Day 1, Day 8, Day 15
o Cycles 6, 9, 12 and in 12 weeks intervals thereafter on Day 1
∀EOT
∀First follow-up visit only
* ECGs to be taken prior to PK sample time-points where applicable. See appendix 10.6 for 
ECG flowchart.
ECGs will only be correlated to PK for the drug combination (BI 836845 and enzalutamide) 
during phase Ib and phase II arm A.
All ECGs will be recorded digitally with ECG equipment provided by a CRO ECG core lab.Before study start the study sites will be trained for the proper use of the equipment and 
transfer of the electronic data to the CRO core lab. To be able to assess the electrocardiographic variables in resting phases the ECGs have to be recorded in supine position after the subjects were at rest for at least ten minutes. At specific time-points 
triplicate ECGs will be recorded to minimize the physiologically induced QT and heart rate variability. The recordings will be evaluated at the site by the investigator (or  delegate) to assess any ECG abnormalities and changes in interval duration. ECG abnormalities will be

carefully monitored and, if necessary, the subject will be removed from the trial and 
medically treated.
All ECGs will be sent to the CRO core lab to centrally and independently evaluate the
electrocardiograms.
After the primary analysis of the study, a decision can be made by the sponsor and
communicated by the trial clinical monitor to stop the centralized ECG review if necessary. Thereafter the ECG will be evaluated locally by the investigator if clinically indicated
5.2.6.2 ECG evaluationThe digitally recorded ECGs sent to the CRO core lab will be evaluated for cardiac intervals 
(RR, PR/PQ, QRS, QT and heart rate-corrected QT (QTc)). Measurements of the cardiac intervals will be done from three (possibly consecutive) normal heart complexes in lead II using the core lab’s procedures. Heart rate correction of QT intervals will be done using Fridericia’s and Bazett’s formula. In addition, the ECGs will be reviewed by a board-certified cardiologist using a standardized worksheet to obtain clinically significant findings such as rhythm, morphology, and conduction abnormalities as well as those of ST Segments, T and U waves. The central measurement of the ECG intervals will be done in all ECGs. In triplicate ECG recordings one randomly selected ECG from this time-point will be evaluated. In case of clinically significant abnormalities (e.g. heart blocks or large changes in interval duration) the CRO core lab may contact the investigator and vice versa. Changes in QT interval compared to baseline will be evaluated internally at BI.
5.2.7 Left ventricular ejection fraction
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) as measured by echocardiography or MUGA scan 
will be assessed at screening and post treatment if clinically indicated. The same method of measurement should be used throughout the study.
5.2.8 Assessment of vital signs and physical examination
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respiration rate after two minutes supine rest) and 
temperature will be recorded at the screening visit and at the time points specified in the Flow 
Chart.
A physical examination, including weight, will be performed at screening and at the time 
points specified in the Flow Chart . The physical examination should include a thorough 
cardiopulmonary examination, an examination of the regional lymph nodes, an examination 
of the abdomen and an assessment of the mental and neurological status. Additional symptoms which have not been reported during a previous examination should be clarified. A physician should perform this examination. Measurement of height (in cm) and body weight (in kg) and the evaluation of the ECOG performance score and  will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart.
5.2.9 Demographics and medical history
Demographics (sex, birth date and race) and baseline conditions will be collected during the 
screening visit.

5.4 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS
The RECIST criteria version 1.1 ( R09-0262 and appendix 10.4 ) to be used for evaluation of 
tumour response are well established and scientifically accepted. The Common Terminology 
Criteria, CTCAE version 4.03, 14 June 2010 (R10-4848 and 5.1.2.1 )are used in the 
assessment of adverse events in cancer patients.
All measurements performed during this trial will be to monitor safety and tolerability of BI 
836845 in combination with enzalutamide, to determine the MTD and /or recommended phase II dose during the phase Ib tolerability and safety phase, and to collect further safety data during the randomised phase II phase of the trial.
The scheduled assessments are to monitor drug induced changes in respect to vital signs, 
standard laboratory values and ECG. Tumour evaluations are necessary for determination of tumour response to treatment  
PSA 
measurements will be used to confirm changes from baseline during treatment and to confirm PSA response and progression.

6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
6.1.1 Screening Visit: -28 to day -1 
All screening assessments will be performed within 28 days of first administration of study 
drug/s on day 1 (visit 1) of cycle 1. Patients who have signed the informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria will be scheduled to begin treatment with either: BI 836845 and 
enzalutamide (phase Ib and phase II arm A), or enzalutamide alone (phase II arm B).
6.1.2 Treatment Visits 
The treatment phase of the study will start on the first day of infusion of BI 836845 in cycle 
1. Administration of BI 836845 will be weekly and enzalutamide will be daily over a 28 day
cycle of treatment in phase Ib and phase II of the study.
All treatment cycles will comprise of four visit days as per the Flow Chart Phase Ib and 
Phase II. 
During the phase II randomised trial of the study from cycle 4 onwards patients on arm B 
(enzalutamide only) will only be required to attend for one visit per cycle on day 1 and when imaging assessments are scheduled; optional telephone contact calls may be included at day 8, day 15 and day 22 per cycle where required, and at the discretion of the investigator, for the collection of AE and concomitant medication information. For those patients receiving the combination treatment in any part of the trial, and who later discontinue BI 836845 permanently, they may attend only on day 1 of every cycle, from cycle 4 onwards, and when 
imaging assessments are scheduled.
For those patients that complete cycle 3 in phase Ib and phase II, these cycles will be repeated 
where clinical benefit is indicated. All assessments stated for cycle 3 in phase Ib and phase II will be repeated for all subsequent cycles, unless otherwise indicated in the Flow Chart. 
Tumour assessments, including bone scans, will be performed as per the Flow Chart at week 
8, week 16, week 24, week 36 and every 12 weeks thereafter. All tumour assessment visits may be within 7 days prior to the start of the respective cycle of treatment.
PK, biomarker assessments, PSA, CTC and immunogenicity sampling will be conducted for 
all days stated in the Flow Chart and Appendix 10.6 .
No visit windows will be permitted on day 1 (visit 1) at the start of a cycle. On days 8, day 15 
and 22 of every cycle a ±1 day window will be permitted.
All planned visit dates are programmed from the start of day 1 (visit 1) of cycle 1. If a visit is 
missed there will be no re-scheduling; if a patient should attend the study site between the “missed” and scheduled visit, then the missed visit assessments should be performed. The current date and the reason for the delay must be noted in the medical records. All subsequent visits must adhere to the scheduled programme of visits for all cycles of treatment.
In situations where a patient is unable or unwilling to attend a clinic visit, the investigator 
must assess the risk-benefit balance for the individual patient and may decide to perform a

provided that it is allowed by local country regulations and the investigator ensures that the local 
facilities are adequately qualified to perform the tests required per protocol for the given visit.
The following assessment can be done remotely: assessment of ongoing and/ or new adverse 
events and concomitant medications and compliance check for enzalutamide.
All COVID-19 related deviations from the original schedule of visits and procedures will be 
documented and the implications considered for the analysis of the trial data.
The treatment phase of the study will continue for an indeterminate number of cycles until 
one of the criteria for patient removal applies and the end of treatment (EOT), plus the first follow-up visit has been performed.

6.1.3.2 Residual effect period (REP)
The REP starts immediately after permanent discontinuation of trial medication and ends 
after 42 days. In this study, the End of Residual Effect Period visit (EoR) is combined with the scheduled FU visit. All AEs collected during this period will also be considered as ‘on treatment’.
6.1.3.3 Follow-up periodThe follow-up period starts immediately after permanent discontinuation of trial medication. 
All patients should have at least one follow-up visit 42 days (+7) after permanent discontinuation of trial medication which coincides with the EoR visit. 
Additional follow-up visits should be performed in phases Ib and II (until approval of 
protocol version 10) for patients who withdrew for reasons other than progressive disease or start of further anti-cancer treatment; the additional visits will follow the usual tumour scan assessment schedule as per the Flow Chart , i.e. every 12 weeks from the start of trial. 
Prior to approval of protocol version 10, follow-up period for every patient will end at the 
earliest of the following events
∀Lost to follow-up
∀Disease progression 
∀Start of a new anti–cancer therapy
∀Death
After approval of protocol version 10, the follow up period for every patient will end after the 
first follow up visit.
6.1.3.4 Observation period Until approval of protocol version 10, all patients in the phase II randomised trial will be 
followed-up for overall survival every 90 days after the last follow-up visit (as specified in Section 6.1.3.3 ) until death, lost to follow-up or completion of the whole trial (as specified in 
Section 6.1.3.6 ) whatever occurs earlier. For patients who progressed on treatment, this 
period starts after the first follow up visit. For patients who have not progressed on treatment, 
this period starts after the last FU visit. 
These visits may also be performed by telephone interview in case the patient is unable to 
visit the investigator. 
The following information will be collected during the observation period:
∀Date and method of contact
∀Further treatment : regimen and drugs name, start and stop dates, reason for stopping 
this treatment
∀Outcome death (date of and reason for death [if applicable])
∀Follow-up of adverse events in case they were not yet recovered at the last FU visit.

6.1.3.5 Patient completion
A patient has to be considered to have completed the trial if no further information is 
collected, i.e. in case any of the following applies:
∀Completion of planned follow-up period (or planned observation period if applicable)
∀Lost to follow-up
∀Withdrawal to be followed-up
∀Death
At the earliest of the above criteria, the Patient Completion (PC) information should be 
entered in the CRF. 
6.1.3.6 End of whole trialThe trial will end when the last patient in both the phase Ib expansion and phase II has 
completed at least the last follow-up visit (as specified in Section 6.1.3.3 ) and an adequate 
number of overall survival events have been observed in phase II.  
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
The investigations and assessments will be performed as outlined in the Flow Chart and as 
per the descriptions listed below.
6.2.1 Screening period

7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN – MODEL
This is a Phase Ib/II open label trial split into three parts. Phase Ib escalation follows a 3+3 
design, and the objective of this phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. There is also an exploratory expansion cohort in phase Ib; the objective is to evaluate restoration of anti-tumour activity of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. In phase II, patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to two treatment arms: BI 836845 + enzalutamide (Arm A), and enzalutamide alone (Arm B). The objective of phase II is to further explore the anti-tumour activity and safety of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide, versus enzalutamide alone, in patients with diagnosed and histologically, or cytologically, confirmed metastatic CRPC that have received and progressed after docetaxel and abiraterone treatment.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
As an exploratory Phase Ib/II trial, inferences about the efficacy of BI 836845 in combination 
with enzalutamide will be based on the magnitude of the observed difference in PFS and other efficacy endpoints (including overall survival), rather than formal hypothesis testing. 
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
During phase Ib (escalation), cohorts of patients treated with BI 836845 in combination with 
enzalutamide will be evaluated continuously based on the safety profile in order to determine the MTD and /or recommended phase II dose. This MTD, and /or recommended phase IIdose will be used in the phase Ib expansion cohort and in phase II. 
Efficacy analyses will include all randomised patients in phase II. For phase Ib expansion 
cohort PFS will be summarised on cohort level. No comparisons between dose cohorts will be performed for phase Ib escalation.
Safety analyses will be summarized separately for patients treated in phase Ib and phase II. 
The safety profile for the phase II patients will be compared in a descriptive manner between the BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide arm, and the enzalutamide only arm.
7.3.1 Primary analyses
The primary analysis of PFS for the phase II will be conducted and reported when 
approximately 60 patients (out of 80 randomised patients) have progressed or died. However, it may be performed with fewer events after approximately 23 months of the first patient being randomized in the Phase II part. Any additional information collected after the data cut-off for the primary analysis will be part of a revised report.
A Cox proportional hazards model (using Breslow’s method for dealing with ties) will be 
used to analyse PFS for the phase II patients. The model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide alone, where a value 
Boehringer Ingelheim 06 Jun 2022

of less than one favours BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. The estimate of the 
hazard ratio, its asymptotic two-sided 95% confidence interval and asymptotic two-sided p-value when testing against a value of one will be displayed. The proportional hazards assumption will also be checked.
The Kaplan-Meier survival rate quartiles (with two-sided 95% confidence intervals found 
using Greenwood’s variance estimate) will be presented for each treatment group. The equality of the survival curves will be tested by the log-rank test at the 5% significance level.
PFS for phase Ib expansion, patients will be summarized separately to phase II patients using 
descriptive statistics only.
PFS is defined as the time from randomisation for phase II (from the start of treatment for 
phase Ib) to disease progression in bone based on prostate cancer clinical trials working group (PCWG2) criteria, or soft tissue based on modified RECIST 1.1 (as detailed in Section 
5.1.2.1 ), or death. Patients without image-based progression or death at any time during the 
study will be censored at the date of their last imaging. Detailed censoring rules will be 
specified in the TSAP.
For the exploratory expansion cohort, PSA response, defined as a decline in PSA >50% 
(which is confirmed by a second value 3 to 4 weeks apart), will be used as primary endpoint. Descriptive statistics for PSA response will be provided for all treated patients. 
7.3.2 Secondary analyses
The analysis of PFS based on independent review data will be performed in the same way as 
the primary evaluation on investigator assessments.
Overall survival will be analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model in the same way as 
the primary endpoint for phase II (see Section 7.3.1 ). A hazard ratio and 95% confidence 
interval for BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide alone will be 
presented. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival will be plotted by treatment group. A log-rank test will also be performed to compare the survival curves. 
The first analysis of overall survival will be performed at the time of primary PFS analysis. 
The analysis will be updated once all patients have completed the last follow-up visit and/or when an adequate number of patients have died. The time to PSA progression will be analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model in the same way as the primary endpoint for phase II (see Section 7.3.1 ). In addition, the percentage change from baseline in PSA will 
be summarized descriptively. The maximum decline in PSA compared to baseline will be 
explored graphically. Further details will be provided in the TSAP. 
7.3.3 Safety analyses
DLTs will be tabulated for each dose cohort in phase Ib (escalation). The tabulation will be 
done in two ways:
Boehringer Ingelheim 06 Jun 2022

Proprietary confidential information. !2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
• DLTs with onset in the first treatment course, and
• All DLTs regardless of treatment course at onset
The MTD analysis is defined in Section 5.2.4.
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE, Version 4.03 ( R10-4848 ). Key safety 
measures will include:
∀Events leading to dose reduction or permanent treatment discontinuation
∀The overall incidence and intensity of AEs, as well as seriousness and relatedness of 
adverse events to treatment
Other safety-relevant assessments including those involving ECG, and ECOG score, will be 
described with respect to possible changes compared to baseline values. Further details on the analysis of ECG data will be specified in the TSAP.
7.3.4 Interim analyses
No formal interim analysis is planned for efficacy. In the phase Ib escalation, the study team 
will continuously monitor and assess safety data to ensure patients’ safety, as well as to determine the dose for the exploratory expansion cohort and phase II. If considered necessary, as soon as the MTD and/or the recommended phase II dose is determined, an evaluation of the safety and efficacy aspects will be performed via a snapshot of the database. Results of this evaluation will be documented and stored.
Continuous monitoring of safety data for phase Ib expansion cohort will be done by the BI 
study team and trial investigators and phase II will be done by an internal DMC to ensure a benefit risk assessment during the DMC meetings. During regular meetings, the committee may examine the efficacy data in order to completely assess the benefit risk advantage of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide.
The results of the phase Ib expansion cohort and the phase II will be analysed separately.

7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
In general, missing data will not be imputed. Further details for handling of missing PSA 
values will be specified in the TSAP. 
See section 3.3.5 for replacement of patients.
For PFS, every effort will be made to obtain date of progression for patients known to have 
progressed. Detailed censoring rules will be specified in the TSAP.

For partial or missing AE onset and/or end dates, BI internal rules will be followed for 
imputation (see Reference Document 001-MCG-156_RD01 “Handling of missing and incomplete AE dates”).
7.5 RANDOMISATION
No randomisation is needed for phase Ib. Patients will be assigned sequentially to the dose 
cohort at the time for the escalation part, and to the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose.
In phase II, patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to each of the two treatment groups. Treatment assignment will be centrally managed by means of a third-party phone/web-based 
randomisation during the screening phase. This will involve the use of an interactive response technology (IRT i.e. Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]/Interactive Web Response System [IWRS]). Boehringer Ingelheim will arrange the randomisation. A randomisation list will be generated using a validated pseudo-random number generator, yielding reproducible and non-predictable results.
7.6 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
Phase Ib escalation follows a 3+3 design to determine the MTD and/or recommended phase 
II dose of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. Approximately 9-12 patients may be assessed. Assuming two cohorts are needed to determine the MTD, 3-6 patients may be treated in the first cohort, followed by 3-6 patients in the second cohort. 
The phase Ib exploratory expansion cohort consists of one cohort treated at the MTD and/or 
recommended phase II dose. In this cohort, approximately 25 additional patients will be

see Arm B2), a sample size of evaluable 21 patients leads to a probability of about 80% of 
observing at least 5 patients with a PSA response (as shown in Table 7.6: 1 below).
If the true PSA response rate is less i.e. 25%, then the probability of observing at least 5 PSA 
responses is 63%. If the true PSA response rate is higher i.e. 35%, then the probability of observing at least 5 PSA responses is 91%. A probability of 80% was seen as sufficient, leading to the chosen sample size of 21 evaluable patients. In the phase Ib expansion part of the study an evaluable patient is defined as a patient where data for the assessments of the primary endpoint is available.
The probability of a false positive signal is also sufficiently small given a sample size of 21 
evaluable patients. For example, the probability of observing 5 PSA responses if the true PSA response rate is 5% is less than 0.5%.

The phase II of the trial is intended to provide evidence that will allow informed decision 
making during the next stages of development. The phase II is therefore sized such that, if the true hazard ratio of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone was 0.65, the probability of observing a small hazard ratio is sufficiently large. Similarly, if the true hazard ratio was 1, the probability of observing a small hazard ratio should be sufficiently small. Table 7.6: 2 displays the probability of observing a hazard ratio less than a 
threshold X, given a true hazard ratio and a pre-specified number of events.

2 Calculated based on the approximate normal distribution of the estimated log hazard ratio, i.e. assuming the log hazard ratio
is normally distributed with mean log(true hazard ratio), and variance (4 / number of PFS events) ( R10-4988 ).
3Note that 70 events out of 80 patients can only be seen if the number of permanently censored patients is very low.
Assuming the true hazard ratio is between 0.65 and 0.70, and given 60 events, the probability
of observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently high, between 0.70 and 0.79. In comparison, if the true hazard ratio is 1.0 (i.e. no treatment effect) and given 60 events, the probability of observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently low at 0.19. 
Due to the inherent difficulties determining radiographic progression in this indication, a 
central imaging unit is employed to interpret the radiographic images and obtain an independent tumour assessment in addition to the investigator’s assessment. However, due to these difficulties, there is potentially a high discordance rate between the independent review and the investigators (fewer independent review events compared to investigator assessed events). From Table 7.6: 2 it can be seen that having a discordance rate of going up to 33% –
leaving potentially only 40 independent review events – still gives a probability of between 
0.66 and 0.74 (corresponding true underling HR of between 0.65 and 0.70) of observing a HR of less than 0.8 in the evaluation of the independent review as well. If the true underlying HR should be 1.0, then the probability of observing a HR of 0.8 is still sufficiently low with 0.24.
Due to the patients’ advanced condition and previous treatment regiments obtained before 
joining this study, the estimated median PFS time in the enzalutamide arm is around 3 months, and between 4.3-4.6 months in the combination arm of BI 836845 + enzalutamide.

where λ1=0.151 and λ2=0.231 are the parameters of exponential distribution assuming median 
PFS of 4.6 months for BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide and 3 months for emzalutamide alone. Based on the formula above, and taking multiple parameter combinations into consideration, the study duration until the required numbers of events are obtained is estimated to be between 17-23 months. Therefore, the primary analysis is targeted when 60 PFS events by investigator’s assessment are observed or 23 months after the first patient was randomized in the phase II part.

RECORDS
The trial will be carried out in compliance with the protocol, the principles laid down in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and relevant BI Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Standard medical care (prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures) remains in the responsibility of the treating physician of the patient.
The investigator should inform the sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures taken 
to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and also of any serious breaches of the protocol/ICH GCP.
The rights of the investigator and of the sponsor with regard to publication of the results of 
this trial are described in the investigator contract. As a general rule, no trial results should be published prior to finalisation of the Clinical Trial Report.
Insurance Cover: The terms and conditions of the insurance cover are made available to the 
investigator and the patients via documentation in the ISF (Investigator Site File).
8.1 STUDY APPROVAL, PATIENT INFORMATION, AND INFORMED 
CONSENT
This trial will be initiated only after all required legal documentation has been reviewed and 
approved by the respective Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and competent authority (CA) according to national and international regulations. The same applies for the implementation of changes introduced by amendments.

10.4 TUMOUR RESPONSE ASSESSMENT ACCORDING TO MODIFIED
RECIST 1.1
The RECIST response evaluation criteria version 1.1 will be adhered to as described in the 
guidelines published in the European Journal of Cancer ( R09-0262 ) and the accompanying 
articles.  Study personnel involved in tumour assessment for this trial must be trained and 
knowledgeable of RECIST criteria version 1.1.
Modification re Lymph Nodes:
The following modification applies only for lymph nodes as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical 
Trials Working Group ( R13-1642 ): only lymph nodes > 20 mm in the short diameter at 
baseline should be used to assess a change in size during the trial and may be considered a 
target lesion. 
Re-appearing, or enlarging, lymph nodes < 20 mm in the short diameter shall not serve as the 
only trigger for PD. The radiologist will make every effort to assess the patient’s disease 
elsewhere, and provide explanatory comments for the oncologist to take into consideration upon determining the final overall assessment, if applicable.
When a lymph node continues to increase over 20 mm in short diameter on subsequent 
images, or other accompanying findings on images change from equivocal to unequivocal, the time-point where the lymph node increase was first documented shall serve as the date of PD.
Bone lesions are to be reported on the assessment of bone metastases CRF page and not on 
the response to therapy RECIST assessment CRF page. 
Response criteria for target lesions :
1.   Complete Response 
(CR):Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in short axis to <10mm)
2.   Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters
3.   Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of a least 5mm (note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
4.   Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as references the smallest sum diameters while on study

Response criteria for non-target lesions:
1.   Complete Response 
(CR):Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumour marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10mm short axis)
2.   Non-CR/ Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and 
maintenance of tumour marker level above the normal limits
3.   Progression (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions 
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)
Timepoint response for patients with measurable disease at baseline:

10.5 COMMON TERMINOLGY CRITERIA FOR ADVERSE EVENTS (CTCAE)
The CTCAE version 4.03, 14 June 2010( R10-4848 ) will be use to classify and record the 
intensity of adverse events in the (e)CRF.
Grading of Hypersensitivity Reactions According to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE 
version 4.03, 14 June 2010, described above, will be used for the grading of infusion 
reactions and subsequent management will be according to the protocol and/or local hospital 
guidelines.

into the trial. Patients in the phase Ib expansion 
cohort must not have received any taxane or abiraterone prior to inclusion into the trial.
The secondary objectives have been updated to 
include overall survival for the phase II part of the trial and to remove pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics.
The word treatment also had a spelling mistake 
corrected.
Rationale for change The USA is being added as an additional country 
for the Phase Ib expansion cohort. This additionrequired the expansion group of patients to be pretaxane-based therapy only. The other two cohorts (phase Ib escalation and phase II) have been updated to clarify difference in the 3 cohorts. 
Overall survival was missing as a secondary 
endpoint in the synopsis so this section has been updated.

treatment it enables the patient to start treatment 
in the morning.
Section to be changed Abbreviations
Description of change New abbreviations have been added for 
recommended phase II dose,  
and functional assessment of 
cancer therapy – prostate. EOT corrected to End of Treatment rather than End of Trial.
Rationale for change Administrative changes
Section to be changed Section 1.1 Medical Background
Description of change The following paragraph was added: These data 
were more recently confirmed in the PREVAIL trial, investigating Enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer before chemotherapy: Enzalutamide significantly decreased the risk of radiographic progression and death and delayed the initiation of chemotherapy.
Rationale for change Addition of more recent clinical trial data on 
enzalutamide.
Section to be changed Section 1.2.2: Drug Profile - Enzalutamide
Description of change The version date of the SmPC for Enzalutamide 
was removed from the protocol.
Rationale for change The SmPC is updated regularly and investigators 
and site staff must refer to the most recent version of the SmPC
Section to be changed Section 2.1: Rationale for Performing the Trial
Description of change The following paragraph was removed: Whilst 
there is a lack of preclinical data for synergistic activity between IGF-targeting compounds and specifically enzalutamide thus far, there is a strong theoretical (mechanistic) rationale.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
The section has been updated to clarify that 
patients require a rise in PSA in order to be eligible for phase Ib expansion and the words “failing on this  treatment” have been removed.
Boehringer Ingelheim                                                                                                    06 Jun 2022

The wording has been updated to clarify that 
patients must not have received any taxane therapy in order to be eligible to enter the Phase Ib expansion cohort.
Rationale for change The paragraph was removed as this is no longer 
correct.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within Boehringer Ingelheim.
Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” to enter the trial but have not been considered to have “failed” treatment. The words failing treatment have therefore been removed.
Inclusion of the USA as country for Phase Ib 
expansion required that only patients not pre-treated with taxane-based therapy may enter the cohort.
Section to be changed Section 2.2: Trial Objectives
Description of change Primary Objectives: Primary objectives updated 
to clarify the treatment regimens that patients must/must not have received prior to entering the trial. 
 
Rationale for change Primary Objectives: The USA is being added as
an additional country for the Phase Ib expansion cohort and this added the requirement to make the expansion group of patient’s pre taxane -based therapy only. The other two cohorts (phase Ib escalation and phase II) have been updated to clarify the difference in the 3 cohorts.

Section to be changed Section 2.3: Benefit-Risk Assessment
Description of change The requirement for the DMC to review the 
Phase Ib expansion part of the trial was removed. The phase Ib expansion will instead be continuously supervised and monitored by the BI study team and investigators.
Rationale for change The phase Ib expansion part of the trial is being 
reviewed by BI in an open label manner and would therefore be better monitored by the BI study team during regular review of the data as well as by the investigators during teleconferences.
Section to be changed Section 3.1 Overall Trial Design and Plan
Description of change In the first paragraph in the section  the words 
“two drugs” were replaced with BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within BI.
The words “at the start of each treatment cycle” 
were removed from the sentence: “BI 836845 will be administered weekly in 28 day cycles of treatment, as per the flow chart, by a one hour intravenous infusion at the start of each treatment cycle.”
Figure 3.1:1 updated to clarify that only patients
who are pre taxane-based therapy may enter the expansion cohort. Also the words “at least” were added in front of 21 patients to be consistent with other places in the protocol (also in paragraph below).
Section updated to clarify that patients require a 
rise in PSA in order to be eligible for phase Ib expansion and the words “and be failing” have been removed.
This section has been updated so that fresh 
tumour biopsy is mandatory at baseline and cycle 1 day 15 and optional at end of

tissue lesions are to be assessed using modified RECIST and bone lesions are to be assessed usingPCCTWG2 guidelines.
The word “and” was removed from the following 
sentence: Patients should be kept on trial until 
radiological or and symptomatic progression is 
documented with or without confirmed PSA progression.
 
Rationale for change The words “two drugs” in the first paragraph in 
the section were updated to be consistent with other wording in rest of protocol.
The terminology for MTD/recommended phase II 
dose was updated to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within Boehringer Ingelheim.
The words “at the start of each treatment cycle” 
were removed as treatment is given weekly.
Figure 3.1:1 was updated because the USA is 
being added an additional country for the Phase Ib expansion cohort. This added the requirement to make the expansion group of patient’s pre taxane-based therapy only.  Also the words “at least” were added in front of 21 patients to be consistent with other places in the protocol.
Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” but have not been considered to have failed treatment so the words failing treatment have been removed.

Section to be changed Section 3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial
Description of change This section has been updated to state that trial 
drugs (only when required) will be provided by BI or a CRO appointed by BI.
The words “steering committee were removed 
from the following sentence: ”During phase Ib dose escalation phase of the study, regular 
teleconference will be held between the 
investigators and BI study team (steering 
committee) for review of safety data, decisions 
over dose escalation, discussions of on-going patients, and discussion
This section has been updated to clarify the 
review that will take place for each part of the trial: the phase Ib escalation part, phase Ib expansion part, and phase II.
Review of the Phase Ib escalation and expansion 
cohort data will be performed by the BI study team. A new paragraph has been added to confirm the review performed for the phase Ib expansion part of the trial and clarification has been provided in paragraph about the review of the data for the phase Ib escalation part of the trial.

The section has also been updated to confirm that 
the decision to move to the phase II part of the trial as well as the phase Ib expansion will be discussed between the investigators and BI study team.
Rationale for change The section relating to provision of trial drugs 
was updated as in the USA enzalutamide will be provided by the trial sites as it is standard of care.
The wording steering committee has been removd
from the section as there is no official steering committee on the trial.
It has been agreed that the phase Ib expansion 
part of the trial (a single arm cohort) would be better monitored during regular review of the data by the BI study team as well as by the investigators. The DMC (an internal but independent group of experts at BI) will review the phase II data randomised data.
The safety data from the Phase I escalation cohort 
will be reviewed by BI and Investigators in order to determine Phase II dose as well as the Phase Ib expansion dose.
Section to be changed Section 3.2 Discussion of Trial Design, Including 
Choice of Control Groups

Rationale for change Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” but have not been considered to have failed treatment so the words failing on the treatment have been removed.
The USA is being added an additional country for 
the Phase Ib expansion cohort. This added therequirement to make the expansion group of 
patient’s pre taxane-based therapy only.
The section on assessment of imaging has been 
updated to clarify how the different types of lesions are assessed. 
Naming convention of escalation phase updated 
to be consistent throughout protocol.
Section to be changed Section 3.3 Selection of Trial Population
Description of change The words “at least” were added in front of 21 
patients in this section.
Additional wording has been added to clarify that 
that the safety and tolerability phase of the trial is called the escalation cohort. 
The number of centres taking part has been
updated to specify how many centres are taking part in each phase of the trial. Up to 8 centres for the phase Ib expansion part of the trial and 25-30 centres for the phase II part of the trial.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within BI.
Rationale for change The words “at least” were added in front of 21 
patients in this section to be consistent with other places in the protocol.
Escalation part added as administrative change to 
make wording consistent throughout the protocol. Number of centres updated based on updated feasibility.

Section to be changed Section 3.3.1 Main diagnosis for study entry
Description of change The word “dose” has been added to the 
paragraph: For the phase Ib dose escalation 
cohort and phase II cohort patients must have received and progressed after docetaxel-based chemotherapy…..
Section updated to clarify the allowed pre-
treatments before entering the trial. Patients in the phase Ib escalation and phase II must have received a docetaxel-based therapy. Patients entering phase Ib expansion cohort must be pre-taxane and abiraterone therapy.
Section also updated to clarify that patients 
require a rise in PSA in order to be eligible for phase Ib expansion and the words “failing on this  treatment” have been removed.
Rationale for change The word dose was added as an administrative 
change.
Clarification on pre-treatments based on addition 
of USA into phase Ib expansion cohort. 
Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” to enter the trial but have not been considered to have failed treatment. Therefore the words failing treatment have been removed.

Description of change Several inclusion criteria updated:
Inclusion 14: INR changed to 1.4 for inclusion 
into trial
Inclusion 18: 5 removed from wording in bullet 
point b as incorrect
Inclusion 19: The words “and be failing treatment 
prior to entering the study” have been removed.
The word “dose” was added into the following 
header: Inclusion criteria only for patients entering phase Ib dose escalation and phase II:

investigators and reassessment of safety for the patient. 
Number 5 removed from bullet 18b as inserted in 
error.
Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” to enter the trial but have not been 
considered to have failed treatment. Therefore the words failing treatment have been removed.
The word dose was added as an administrative 
change.
Section to be changed Section 3.3.3 Exclusion Criteria
Description of change Exclusion 1 and 2: These were removed as they
were relevant for patients being treatment with docetaxel. This is no longer applicable for thePhase Ib expansion phase. The exclusion criteria are now added in subsection of exclusion for the Phase Ib escalation and Phase II only.
Exclusion 6: The list of potential medications to 
be excluded and wash-out time has been updatedin the exclusion criteria to be in line with the 
current enzalutamide summary of product 
characteristics. Strong CYP2C8 and inducers and inhibitors must be stopped within 2 weeks of starting trial treatment.
Exclusion 19: Updated to clarify that patient must 
not be pre-treated with any taxane- based therapies in the expansion cohort
Additional exclusion criteria added: 21: Exclusion regarding previous or concomitant 
malignancies added
22: Added for patients entering Phase Ib
escalation or Phase II – amended wording from original exclusion 1. Amended to clarify number of regimens of docetaxel that patient can have had
23: Added for patients entering Phase Ib 
escalation or Phase II – original exclusion 2 but

moved due to change in requirements for patients 
entering Phase Ib expansion cohort. Patients entering phase Ib escalation or phase II must not have received abiraterone or taxane treatment within 4 weeks of starting treatment.
The word “dose” was added into the following 
headers: Exclusion criteria only for patients entering phase Ib dose escalation and phase II: 
and  Only for patients entering phase Ib dose
escalation and phase II cohorts:
Rationale for change The exclusion criteria were updated due to 
changes in pre-treatment allowed (patients in phase Ib expansion cohort must now be pre-taxane therapy), review of inclusion/exclusion criteria vs current summary of product characteristics for Enzalutamide and the missing requirement for patient not to have previous or concomitant malignancies.
The word dose was added as an administrative 
change.

836845 in combination with enzalutamide
Description of change Escalation part added to sentence to confirm that 
the safety and tolerability phase of the trial is the same as the escalation part of the trial.
The terminology for MTD/recommended dose 
was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within BI.
The paragraph “All safety aspects… randomised 
trial will commence” was removed from the protocol and instead the section refers to section 5.2.4 where MTD and recommended dose for Phase II is described.
A statement is added to confirm that the 
recommended phase II dose will be used for phase Ib expansion cohort.
Rationale for change Administrative change to ensure consistent 
terminology throughout protocol.
Section to be changed Section 4.1.3.4 Exploratory Expansion cohort

phase Ib expansion and the words “failing on 
enzalutamide…” have been removed.
Section updated to remove the detail of how 
supplies specifically for the study will be dispensed at cycle 1 day 1 in the expansion cohort. 
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose in the exploratory expansion cohort and 
phase II was updated to MTD and/or 
recommended phase II dose (RP2D). The phase Ib expansion will also be treated at this same dose.
Rationale for change The USA is being added as an additional country 
for the Phase Ib expansion cohort. This added therequirement to make the expansion group of patients pre taxane-based therapy only.
Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” to enter the trial but have not been considered to have failed treatment. The words failing enzalutamide have therefore been removed.
The section on enzalatamide being supplied in 
from cycle 1 day 1 specifically for the study has 
been removed as the US sites will provide their 
own enzalutamide for the phase Ib expansion cohort.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose in the exploratory expansion cohort and phase II was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within BI. The dose for phase Ib expansion cohort and phase II is described in section 5.2.4 of the protocol.

Ib expansion will also be treated at this same 
dose.
Rationale for change The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose in the exploratory expansion cohort and phase II was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within BI.
Section to be changed Section 4.1.4.2 BI 836845 (Phase Ib and Phase II 
– Arm A)
Description of change Wording MDT (maximum tolerated dose) and/or 
recommended phase II added with regard to the dose that BI 836845 will be given in Phase Ib expansion cohort and Phase II.
Rationale for change The phase Ib escalation part of the trial will 
determine either the MDT and/or recommended dose for Phase Ib expansion and Phase II. As only two dose levels are being explored it is not possible to know if the MDT will be reached.
Section to be changed Section 4.1.4.3 Enzalutamide (Phase Ib and Phase 
II- Arm A and B)
Description of change Section updated to change the wording for the 
supply of enzalutamide in Phase Ib expansion cohort. For countries where enzalutamide is supplied….
Rationale for change The US sites will provide own enzalutamide for 
phase Ib expansion cohort.
Section to be changed Section 4.1.4.4 Temporary treatment interruption 
and dose reduction for BI 836845 and enzalutamide during phase Ib and phase II
Description of change The end of the following paragraph was updated 
to state permanently stopped and the patient discontinued rather than just stopped: In both phase Ib and phase II, the patient will be kept on study until both BI 836845 and enzalutamide are
permanently stopped and the patient is 
discontinued.
A new table has been added (Table 4.1.4.4:1

events has also been added. Previously the 
terminology DLT was used all through this section to describe the adverse events requiring dose adjustment.
Table 4.1.4.4:1 Dose reduction scheme BI 
836845 and enzalutamide has been renamed to Table 4.1.4.4:2 Allowed dose reductions for BI 
836845 and enzalutamide.
Rationale for change The words permanently stopped and patient is 
discontinued were added as administrative change.
As the trial is a phase Ib/II study the terminology 
DLT is not applicable for all the trial. DLT is only applicable for the phase Ib escalation part of the trial. DLTs are still referred to in section 5.2.3 and these will be used to determine the MDT/recommended dose from the phase Ib escalation cohort. 
Section 4.1.4.4 lists those adverse events whereby 
an action is needed by investigator to either pause or reduce the study treatments.
Original table 4.1.4.4:1 renamed to 4.1.4.4:2 due 
to new table 4.1.4.4:1 
Section to be changed Section 4.1.4.5 Additional cycles of treatment
Description of change The word “in phase Ib” in the title of the section 
has been removed as this section is relevant for phase Ib and phase II.  An additional paragraphhas been added to clarify the additional cycles of treatment for patients in phase II
Rationale for change Administrative change
Section to be changed Section 4.1.4.6 Preparation of BI 836845
Description of change Language around administration of BI 836845 
was corrected to: …at this temperature they must be administered within 24 hours. Infusion bags stored at room temperature must be administered within 6 hours. Previously the protocol had stated that the medication could be stored for these periods whereas it administration should be completed within these timelines.

Description of change The words where required have been added into 
the paragraph about supply of trial drugs. The trial drugs, BI 836845 and enzalutamide, where required will be…
Rationale for change In the USA for the phase Ib expansion part of the 
trial the enzalutamide will be supplied by the centres.
Section to be changed Section 4.1.8 Drug accountability
Description of change This section has been changed to apply to the 
supplies provided by Boehringer Ingelheim.
Rationale for change In the USA for the phase Ib expansion part of the 
trial the enzalutamide will be supplied by the centres. 
Section to be changed Section 4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency 
procedures, and additional treatment(s)
Description of change Change to the number of days post elective 
surgery that patient may restart treatment from 12 
days to 3 days.
Details of the supply of enzalutamide for the 
phase Ib expansion cohort has been updated to state that only in countries where enzalutamide is provided, clinical trial supplies will be provided on cycle 1 day 1
Rationale for change Following review of the safety profile of BI 
836845 there is not considered to be any effect on wound healing. It was therefore considered to be more beneficial for patient to be able to restart treatment sooner.
Wording on the supply of enzalutamide from 
cycle 1 day 1 has been updated as in USA enzalutamide will be supplied by the trial sites.

Rationale for change Administrative change
Section to be changed Section 4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding 
concomitant treatment
Description of change This section has been updated to match the 
requirements for restricted medications in the Summary of Product Characteristics for Enzalutamide. 
Rationale for change The protocol originally had a very exhaustive list 
of medications that should be discussed and agreed with BI in case patient wanted to stay on the concomitant medication (appendix 10.3). This section was not in line with the SPC for enzalutamide. After review with the investigators this section was revised to be more in line with Summary of Product Characteristics for enzalutamide and allow investigators to make clinical decisions on the best concomitant treatments for their patients.The Summary of Product Characteristics for enzalutamide was also updated and included a new CYP substrate that has interactions with enzalutamide. Language refers investigator back to Summary of Product Characteristics for treatment related decisions to always ensure that Investigator is considering most current update.

phase Ib expansion part of the trial. As wording 
not required it was removed.
The section was updated to clarify the imaging 
timelines from baseline to be consistent with flowcharts. Imaging time points will be calculated from start of treatment/randomisation.
Section to be changed 6.1.3 Follow up period and trial completion
Description of change Reference to AE and SAE reporting timelines 
removed from figure 6.1.3:1 
Rationale for change All safety requirements are covered in section 5 of 
protocol and considered better not to have duplication
Section to be changed 6.1.3.2 Residual effect period (REP)
Description of change The REP has been changed from 42+7 days from 
discontinuation of trial medication to 42 days from discontinuation of trial medication.
The word “also” has been added to paragraph. All 
AEs collected during this period will also be 
considered as “on treatment”.
Rationale for change The REP for the treatments is 42 days. If the 
patient comes in for first follow up visit at day 42+7 (allowance for visit window) REP will still only be considered as 42 days.
Word also added as on treatment does not only 
apply to AEs in follow up period.
Section to be changed Section 6.1.3.4 Observation Period
Description of change Removal of the sentence regarding reporting of 
adverse events in the follow up phase of the trial:
After the end of FU contact….not yet recovered 
at the last FU visit will continue.
Rationale for change Adverse event requirements are all covered in 
section 5 of the protocol and so it was decided not to duplicate these in section 6.1.3.4
Section to be changed Section 6.2.1 Screening Period
Description of change A sentence has been added to state that patients 
who failed screening may repeat screening after discussion between investigator and sponsor.

protocol.
Section to be changed Section 7.6 Determination of Sample Size
Description of change The words “at least” were added in front of 21 
patients in the section.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose.
Rationale for change The words “at least” were added to be consistent 
with other parts of the protocol.

dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose to be consistent throughout the protocol.
Section to be changed Appendix 10.3
Description of change Appendix simplified to only list examples of 
CYP3A4 substrates.
Rationale for change Investigators are referred to look at most current 
summary of product characteristics for enzalutamide. As this is likely to change throughout course of the trial it was decided the best approach would be to refer directly to SPC rather than maintain a separate list of medications that have possibility to interact with enzalutamide metabolism.
Section to be changed Appendix 10.4
Description of change Appendix updated to clarify that bone lesions 
should be assessed on the assessment of bone metastases CRF page and not the response to therapy RECIST assessment CRF page.Additional criteria for bone lesion assessments removed from appendix 10.4
Rationale for change Administrative change to inform sites where bone 
lesions should be entered.

Exclusion 4 was updated as administrative 
change.
Exclusion criterian 22 was re-written in protocol 
version 3 (formally exclusion criterian 1) as the 
original wording in protocol version 1 was 
considered unclear. In error the new language was worded as an inclusion criterian rather than an exclusion criterian. This has been corrected in version 4 of the protocol.

Randomised Trial Endpoints
Description of change The primary endpoint has been changed from:
Radiological progression free survival (PFS) based on central review
To:
Radiological progression free survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment.
An additional secondary endpoint has been added:
Radiological progression free survival (PFS) based on central review
Rationale for change Based on the discrepancy rates seen in previous 
prostate cancer trials between investigator assessment and central imaging review there is a concern that the original primary endpoint of 90 events by central imaging will not be met.

Description of change Reference to section 5.1.2.1 has been added.
The timing of the imaging assessments (CT/MRI 
and bone scans) has been updated. Imaging will now be performed at 8 weekly intervals (starting at cycle 3 day 1) up until week 24 and then at 12 weekly intervals thereafter.
It has been clarified that a bone scan must be 
performed at each tumour assessment:
“A bone scan should be performed at screening 
and, prior to the start C3D1 and onwardsaccording to schedule below.”
Rationale for change The imaging schedule has been updated during the 
early part of the patient’s participation on trial. 
Data is available that shows patients’ with 
advanced prostate cancer having received multiple lines of treatment (including abiraterone and docetaxel) have an estimated median PFS of around 3 months on enzalutamide alone. The median PFS in combination arm (BI 836845 + enzalutamide) is expected to be between 4.3-4.6 months.
As the primary endpoint of the trial is progression 
free survival by imaging it is important to ensure that the imaging assessments are scheduled to be able to capture any early imaging progressions.
Bone lesion progression must be assessed by bone 
scan and not by CT/MRI.

As the primary endpoint of the trial is 
progression free survival by imaging it is important to ensure that the imaging assessments are scheduled to be able to capture any early imaging progressions.
Section to be changed 3.3 Selection of Trial Population
Description of change The following sentence was corrected:
In phase II of the study, 120 patients will be
randomised onto one of the two study arms, with 60 patients randomised to each arm (Arm A=60, 
Arm B=60) .  
Originally Arm B was mentioned twice.
Rationale for change Administrative change
Section to be changed 3.3.2 Inclusion criteria 
Description of change The following inclusion criteria were changed:
6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1. 
ECOG score of 2 is no longer allowed.
7. Cardiac left ventricular function with resting 
ejection fraction ≥50% as determined by ECHO 
or MUGA
>50% was changed to ≥50% 
Rationale for change Only patients ECOG 0 and 1 should be 
considered for trial to ensure that they are fit enough to manage the weekly visits and to stay on treatment long enough to benefit from it.
An LVEF measurement above 50% is considered 
normal.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria 
Description of change The following exclusion criterion was removed:

11. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes 
mellitus. Patients with a history of diabetes are allowed to participate, provided that their blood glucose is within normal range (fasting < 160 mg/dL or below ULN) and that they are on a stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for this condition
Rationale for change This exclusion criterion is not required based on 
the presence of inclusion criterion 15. The additional wording in exclusion 11 caused confusion and has therefore been removed. Inclusion criterion 15 requires the patient to have a fasting plasma glucose < 8.9 mmol/L (< 160 mg/dL) and HbA1c < 8.0.%. This automatically excludes patients with poorly controlled diabetes.
Section to be changed 3.3.5 Replacement of patients
Description of change The following section was changed from:
For phase Ib expansion cohort and phase II:
Patients who withdraw after assignment (phase 
Ib expansion), or randomisation (phase II),
but before start of therapy will be replaced:
to: For phase Ib expansion cohort:
Patients who withdraw after assignment but 
before start of therapy will be replaced.
Rationale for change For the phase II part of trial an intent-to-treat 
analysis will be performed and replacing patients will not have an impact on the analysis. Therefore no patients will be replaced and only 60 patients per arm should be randomized.

Section to be changed 4.1.4.2 BI 836845 (Phase In and Phase II - Arm 
A)
Description of change The following sentence was changed from:
A one hour observation period is recommended 
following each infusion. See section 4.2.1.1.
To: A one hour observation period is recommended 
following each infusion for the first 3 cycles of 
treatment and at least a 15 minute 
observation period is recommended following 
subsequent infusions. See section 4.2.1.1.
The following sentence was added to the section:
Infusion reactions will not be reported on the 
standard AE page but will be reported on a separate page specifically for infusion reactions in the CRF.
Rationale for change Infusion reactions seen to date in patients infused 
with BI 836845 have been during treatment. After the first 3 cycles the patient will have received 12 infusions of BI 836845 and so to make the trial less time consuming for the patient the recommendation that the patient stays in for one hour after the infusion has been reduced to at least 15 minutes.
A new page is being added into the CRF to 
collect additional information about infusionreactions.

Description of change The bolded wording was added to the following 
paragraph:
Drug-related DLTs or those adverse events 
requiring dose adjustment, will be managed by a pause in treatment followed by a subsequent dose reduction of the relevant medication
according to tables 4.1.4.4:1 and 4.1.4.4:2.
Rationale for change To ensure that it is clear in protocol that only the 
medication considered relevant to the adverse event is required to be reduced.

Section to be changed 4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant 
treatment
Description of change The wording in extremities was removed from the 
following paragraph:
For symptom control palliative radiotherapy may 
be permitted for bone metastases in extremities 
after discussion with the sponsor provided that
radiotherapy does not affect the target lesions, and the reason for the radiotherapy does not reflect progressive disease.
New wording: For symptom control palliative radiotherapy may 
be permitted for bone metastases after 
discussion with the sponsor provided that 
radiotherapy does not affect the target lesions, and the reason for the radiotherapy does not reflect progressive disease.
The following paragraph was added to the 
section:
Exceptions for patients in Phase Ib expansion:
In order to effectively assess the potential for 
pharmacokinetic drug interaction between enzalutamide and BI 836845 and to investigate potential alterations of pharmacokinetics during 
co-administration, strong and moderate 
CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers are prohibited during the periods specified below in the Ph Ib expansion cohort:
∀from Day -7 of the screening period till 
visit 1 of treatment course 1 (C1V1) and
∀from visit 4 of the first treatment course 
(C1V4) till visit 2 of treatment course 2 (C2V2)
A list of examples is provided in appendix 10.3.2. 
Switching to a different class of drug that is not a strong or moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor/inducer or CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer is recommended.

Outside the above time periods, follow the 
respective drug package insert/SPC when considering concomitant treatment with CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.
Rationale for change Palliative radiotherapy will be allowed for all 
bone metastases so long as any target lesions are not affected by the field of radiotherapy. This change is in line with the PCWG2 guidelines. This must be discussed with medical team at sponsor.
An exceptions section with regard to co-
medications for patients in the phase Ib expansion has been added. This covers the time frame of the drug-drug-interaction assessment for each patient. Any of these co-medications may influence the exposure of enzalutamide during this period.
Section to be changed 5.1.1.1 Endpoints of efficacy: Phase Ib expansion 
cohort
Description of change The reference to the prostate cancer working 
group 2 (PCWG2 guidelines) has been removed from the primary endpoint PSA response
Rationale for change PSA response is not considered any more by 
PCWG2 guidelines.
Section to be changed 5.1.1.2 Endpoints of efficacy: Phase II 
Randomised trial
Description of change The primary endpoint has been changed from:
Radiological progression free survival (PFS) -
defined as time from randomisation to disease progression based on central review :
To:Radiological progression free survival (PFS) -
defined as time from randomisation to disease progression based on investigator assessment :
An additional secondary endpoint has been added:

clinical trials working group (PCWG2) criteria, (R13-1642) (see section 5.1.2.1)
oor soft tissue based on modified RECIST 
1.1 (R09-0262) where applicable (see Appendix 10.4)
oor death 
The reference to the prostate cancer working 
group 2 (PCWG2 guidelines) has been removed from the secondary endpoint PSA response
Rationale for change Based on discrepancy rates seen in previous 
prostate cancer trials between investigator assessment and central imaging review there is a concern that the original primary endpoint of 90 events by central imaging will not be met.
As this is an open label phase II trial tumour 
assessment by central imaging is not required as primary endpoint.
PSA response is not considered any more by 
PCWG2 guidelines.
Section to be changed 5.1.2.1 Assessment of tumours and bone
Description of change The following sentence has been added to the 
section on soft tissue lesions:
If a patient presents with marginal or equivocal 
tumour progression at their first RECIST assessment, confirmation by a second scan 6 or more weeks later, after continued treatment, is recommended.
The section on assessment of the bone lesions was 
updated in line the imaging schedule being

updated to 8 weekly for up to week 24 and then 
12 weekly.
Changed from:A bone scan should be performed at screening 
and if clinically indicated every 12 weeks
throughout the trial at scheduled scan assessment visits until disease progression and/or new anticancer therapy is started.
Radiographic progression on bone scans is 
defined by the following criteria (as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (R13-1642)):
∀≥ 2 new bone lesions consistent with 
progression
∀If the first scan was performed < 12 
weeks from randomization, then it requires ≥ 2 new bone lesions plus 2 
additional at confirmation (“2 + 2”) on a second bone scan ≥ 4 weeks later. The 
date of progression is the date of the first scan that shows the change.
Any changes in bone imaging should be evaluated 
radiographically by CT scan, MRI, or X-ray to ascertain the presence of bone destruction versus a healing reaction. As such, the first protocol-defined imaging assessment is scheduled at the end of week 12 of treatment (end of cycle 3 tumour assessment, within 7 days prior to Cycle 4 Day 1).
∀If this assessment shows definitive 
evidence of ≥ 2 new bone lesions 
consistent with progression, then patient should discontinue from study.
∀Alternatively , if bone scan does not show 
new lesions OR new lesions are not
       consistent with progression, then patient 
should continue study protocol and 
continue dosing until the next tumour

A bone scan should be performed at screening, at 
8 week intervals until week 24 (i.e. weeks 8, 16 
and 24) and then at 12 week intervals 
thereafter (i.e. weeks 36, 48 etc.) throughout the 
trial at until disease progression and/or new anticancer therapy is started. 
Radiographic progression on bone scans is 
defined by the following criteria (as per the 
Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2
(R13-1642)):
∀≥ 2 new bone lesions on bone scan 
performed within the flare window plus 
≥ 2 additional at confirmation (“2 + 2”) 
on a second bone scan ≥ 6 weeks later. 
The date of progression is the date of the first scan that shows the change.
∀≥ 2 new bone lesions on bone scans 
performed after the flare window, disease progression is determined at that assessment. 
∀If bone scan does not show new lesions 
OR new lesions are not consistent with progression, then patient should continue 
on study protocol and continue dosing 
until the next tumour assessment, as clinically indicated, until radiographic disease progression.
The flare window is considered as 12 weeks 
from randomization for patients in phase II and 12 weeks from start of treatment for patients in phase Ib escalation and expansion.
Any changes in bone imaging should be evaluated 
radiographically by CT scan, MRI, or X -ray to 
ascertain the presence of bone destruction versus a healing reaction.

The following paragraph in the general rules on 
imaging was also updated from:
Assessments will be performed at screening, or if 
valid results are available as part of routine  clinical practice and are within 28 days prior to start of study treatment, repeat imaging will not be required . Imaging will be every 3 cycles (12 
weeks) from baseline and prior to the start of 
cycle 4, 7, 10 onwards . Tumour assessments may 
be performed up to 7 days prior to the scheduled date for start of the relevant cycle/assessment date.
To:
Assessments will be performed at screening, or if 
valid results are available as part of routine clinical practice and are within 28 days prior to start of study treatment, repeat imaging will not be required. Imaging will be at baseline and 
then every 2 cycles (8 weeks) up to week 24 and 
then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter i.e. 
prior to the start of cycles 3, 5, 7, 10 onwards . 
Tumour assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to the scheduled date for start of the relevant cycle/assessment date.
Rationale for change The soft tissue lesion section has been updated to 
add an example of where an investigator can chose to keep patient on treatment if equivocal or marginal tumour progression is seen at the first imaging assessment at week 8.
The bone imaging section has been updated due to 
the fact that the first imaging assessment for bone lesions now falls within the flare window. A confirmation scan would therefore always be required if new lesions were seen on the first bone scan.
The section has also been updated to confirm the 
new timelines for all imaging assessments.
Reference to a new appendix 10.7 has been added

Section to be changed 5.1.2.2 Assessment of PSA
Description of change The timing of PSA assessments has been 
amended to assess at PSA 8 weeks after the start of treatment, at the start of cycle 3 and then every cycle thereafter. Originally PSA was first assessed after 12 weeks (start of cycle 4).
Rationale for change The scheduling of PSA samples has been updated 
in line with imaging assessments so that efficacy assessments can be performed on both PSA and imaging in parallel.
Section to be changed 5.1.3 Central Imaging
Description of change The following sentence was removed from this 
section:
The data will also be reviewed by an oncologist 
who will provide a final assessment of each patient
Rationale for change This was an error in previous version of protocol. 
Images will only be reviewed by radiologists to evaluate and confirm response and progression. An oncologist will not perform an overall assessment.
Section to be changed 5.2.2.1  Definitions of Adverse Events
Description of changeThe following paragraph has been added in the 
section on definitions of AEs:
An AE does not meet the SAE criteria for 
hospitalisation if:
∀The subject was treated in the emergency 
room but was not admitted for an 
overnight stay
∀Hospitalisation due to pre-planned 
treatments or procedures
∀Hospitalisation due to social 
circumstances or administrative reasons
∀Hospitalisation for diagnostic reasons

Rationale for change By adding examples that are not SAEs it means 
that unnecessary reporting of events (for example planned procedures) will be avoided.
Section to be changed 5.2.2.1  Definitions of Adverse Events
Description of changeA section on exemptions to (S)AE reporting has 
been added regarding disease progression.
Rationale for change This section is based on a language from new 
oncology standard template at Boehringer Ingelheim so that investigators are not required to report all disease progressions but instead report only ones where there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between study drug and underlying malignancy.

Rationale for change Updated as per change to imaging schedule.
Section to be changed 6.1.3.5 Patient completion
Description of change The following bullet has been added to reasons 
for patient completion in the trial:
∀Withdrawal to be followed-up
Rationale for change In case patients withdraw consent from follow up 
they will be considered to have completed the study.
Section to be changed 6.2.2 Treatment Period – Circulating tumour cells

Section to be changed 6.2.2 Treatment Period – Prostate serum Antigen 
(PSA)
Description of change The timing of the PSA samples has been changed. 
An additional PSA sample is now being performed at C3D1.
Rationale for change The scheduling of PSA samples has been updated 
in line with imaging assessments so that efficacy assessments can be performed on both PSA and imaging in parallel.
Section to be changed  
Section to be changed6.2.2 Treatment Period – Tumour assessments 
and bone scans
Description of change The timing of the imaging assessments has been 
changed. Imaging will now be performed at 8 weekly intervals up until week 24 and then at 12 weekly intervals thereafter.
Rationale for change The imaging schedule has been updated during the 
early part of the patient’s participation on trial. 
Data is available that shows patients’ with 
advanced prostate cancer having received multiple lines of treatment (including abiraterone and docetaxel) have an estimated median PFS of around 3 months on enzalutamide alone. The median PFS in combination arm (BI 836845 + enzalutamide) is expected to be between 4.3-4.6 months.

As the primary endpoint of the trial is progression 
free survival by imaging it is important to ensure that the imaging assessments are scheduled to be able to capture any early imaging progressions.
Section to be changed 6.2.3 End of trial and follow-up period - Tumour 
assessments and bone scans/
Description of change The following statement was added to the section:
All patients should have a tumour 
assessment/bone scan at EOT visit regardless of the reason for discontinuation, unless the last evaluation was performed within 4 weeks of EOT
Rationale for change This footnote has been updated to clarify that all 
patients at the end of treatment visit should have an imaging assessment unless they have had animaging assessment within the last 4 weeks.
Section to be changed 7.3.1 Primary Analyses
Description of change The following paragraph has been changed:
The primary analysis of PFS for the phase II will 
be conducted and reported when approximately 90 patients (75% of all randomised patients ) 
have progressed according to independent 
review or died . Any additional information 
collected after the data cut-off for the primary analysis will be part of a revised report.
To:
The primary analysis of PFS for the phase II will 
be conducted and reported when approximately 90 patients ( out of 120 randomised patients ) 
have progressed or died .However, it may be 
performed with fewer events after
approximately 23 months of the first patient 
being randomized in the Phase II part . Any 
additional information collected after the data cut-off for the primary analysis will be part of a revised report.
Rationale for change This section has been changed as independent 
review is no longer the primary endpoint. There is

also an allowance that the data may be analysed 
even if 90 events are not reached after 23 months. This has been added in the case that more patients than expected come off the trial due to symptomatic progression and therefore 90 events are not obtainable.
Section to be changed 7.3.1 Secondary Analyses
Description of change The following sentence was added to the start of 
this section:
The analysis of PFS based on independent review 
data will be performed in the same way as the primary evaluation on investigator assessments.
Rationale for change Analysis of PFS by central imaging review has 
now been added as a secondary endpoint.
Section to be changed 7.6 Determination of Sample Size
Description of change Table 7.6:2 has been updated ….
The following paragraph was changed from Assuming the true hazard ratio is 0.65 , and 
given 90 events, the probability of observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently high at 
0.84. In comparison, if the true hazard ratio is 1.0 
(i.e. no treatment effect) and given 90 events, the probability of observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently low at 0.14. 
To:
Assuming the true hazard ratio is between 0.65 
and 0.70 , and given 90 events, the probability of 
observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is 
sufficiently high, between 0.84 and 0.75 . In 
comparison, if the true hazard ratio is 1.0 (i.e. no treatment effect) and given 90 events, the probability of observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently low at 0.14.

Due to the inherent difficulties 
determining…….observing a HR of 0.8 is still sufficiently low with 0.19
Due to the patients’ advanced condition and 
previous treatment……in the combination arm of BI836845 + enzalutamide.
Assuming recruitment rates of 10-13 patients per 
month for a period of A months….after the first patient was randomized in the phase II part.
Table 7.6:3 was added.
Rationale for change Table 7.6: 2 has been updated to take into account
more assumptions with regard to true HR. Details have been added to the descriptions to account for potential discrepancies between investigator and independent review assessment. As there is now the possibility of not waiting for the 90 events, it has also been described in this section how the minimum duration of the trial has been calculated
.
Table 7.6:3 has been added to provide examples of expected time to reach primary endpoint of 90 events.

Rationale for change During the course of the trial it was detected that 
performing blood drawn, analysis and lab results review on the same day of the drug administration could cause treatment delays and patient should be at the hospital for more time than strictly needed. This, together with the fact that blood parameters do not suffer from major changes in less than 24 hours, lead the clinical team to allow blood sampling (even for fasting parameters) on the day before drug adminitration.

Note that 70 events out of 80 patients can only 
be seen if the number of permanently censored patients is very low.
Rationale for change New statistical estimations and sample size 
calculations gives no sense to calculations over 70 events. Less patients  imply less events therefore calculations for less events (40) have been added.
Section to be changed Section Table 7.6, determination of sample size
Description of change The following text was changed from:
Assuming the true hazard ratio is between 0.65and 0.70, and given 90 events, the probability of observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently high, between 0.84 and 0.75. In comparison, if the true hazard ratio is 1.0 (i.e. no treatment effect) and given 90 events, the probability of observing a hazard ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently low at 0.14. 
(…)From Table 7.6: 2 it can be seen that having a 
discordance rate of going up to 33% – leaving potentially only 60 independent review events –still gives a probability of between 0.79 and 0.70 (corresponding true underling HR of between 0.65 and 0.70) of observing a HR of less than 0.8 in the evaluation of the independent review as well. If the true underlying HR should be 1.0, then the probability of observing a HR of 0.8 is still sufficiently low with 0.19.
(…)Therefore, the primary analysis is targeted when 
90 PFS events by investigator’s assessment are observed or 23 months after the first patient was randomized in the phase II part.

Number of global amendment 9
Description of change Wording protocol version 9 updated to protocol 
version 10
Rationale for change Protocol version 9 was rejected by a health 
authority due to the reduced collection of safety laboratory data. It was determined that as patients are on experimental therapy the safety laboratory tests should be clearly defined in the protocol rather than being per standard of care. Protocol version 9 was therefore not implemented by any sites with ongoing patients. Instead it was agreed that the protocol should be updated to protocol version 10 to include safety lab testing on day one of every cycle for all patients ongoing on trial treatment.  
Protocol version 9 included statements as to 
which procedures should be performed before and after the implementation of protocol version 9. These statements have been updated throughout the protocol to state which procedures should be performed before or after implementation of protocol version 10. 
Protocol version 9 was not implemented by any 
sites with ongoing patients.

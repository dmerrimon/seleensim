Objective  
The INFORMED study aim ed to support Chinese, Vietnamese, and Hmong Americans with up -to-date 
information  in multiple languages  related to COVID -19 testing.  
The acronym INFORMED stands for “Individual and Family Oriented Responsive Messaging Education.” 
The study aim ed to deliver updated information that keeps pace with the rapidly changing landscape of 
COVID -19. Additionally, the messag es were adapted accordingly to the feedback received from 
community members to ensure it s relevan ce and understandability . The ultimate objective was to 
empower these communities to make informed decisions regarding safety practices and testing for 
COVID -19. 
Study Design  
The INFORMED study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 24 7 RCT  
participants  with assessments at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 . All participants received intervention 
via SMS text messaging. Participants who were randomly assigned to t he intervention group received 
educational outreach from lay health workers (LHW) through Zoom or other mutually agreed online 
video conferencing platforms  or in-person adhering to the local COVID -19 social gathering safety 
practice , as well as by telephone or instant messaging.

Methods  
Academic and Community Partnership  
The INFORMED study team consisted of researchers from the University of California and three 
community -based organizations: the Chinese Community Health Resource Center (CCHRC), The Fresno 
Center (TFC), and the Immigrant Resettlement and Cultural Center (IRCC). Each community par tnering 
agency has a long history of serving their respective targeted communities: Chinese (CCHRC), Hmong 
(TFC), and Vietnamese (IRCC). In addition, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) included 7 members with 
expertise in health education, medicine, public h ealth, media communications, social services, and 
immigrant health. CAB members provided valuable insights into the evolving community needs and 
ensured the cultural relevance and appropriateness of the study materials, facilitating effective 
information d elivery and outreach to Chinese, Hmong, and Vietnamese American community members . 
Participants Eligibility  
The inclusion criteria for participants in the randomized controlled trial (RCT) were: i) age 18 and older; 
ii) self -identified as Chinese, Hmong, or Vietnamese; iii) ability to read and/or speak English, Chinese 
(Cantonese/Mandarin), Hmong, or Vietnamese;  iv) access to a mobile phone to receive SMS text 
messages (participants received reimbursement if their mobile phone had limited SMS services); v) 
access to a telephone to be contacted by research staff (to obtain informed consent) and/or by Lay 
Health Wo rkers (LHWs) for educational sessions when video conferencing on mobile or computer 
devices was not available . 
Participants Recruitment and Payment Incentives  
Recruitment utilized multi -pronged strategies proven effective in previous trials involving LHW outreach 
in various Asian communities. Trained LHWs initially reached out to their social networks. Partnering 
agenc ies conducted recruitment through their client population  via social media announcements or 
various events . The program was described  as the “Healthy Family Project,” focusing on staying healthy 
by getting informed about COVID -19 testing updates. Each participant received up to $70 for 
completing al l the surveys  online : $20 for the baseline survey (15 -20 minutes long), $10 for each brief 
survey at weeks 4, 8, and 12 (5 -10 minutes), and $20 for the final survey at week 16 (15 -20 minutes) for 
outcome evaluation.  
Procedures  
All study procedures and contacts were conducted in the participants’ preferred language: English, 
Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin), Hmong, or Vietnamese. The procedures were reviewed and approved 
by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Californi a, San Francisco.

Enrollment & Informed Consent  
Interested participants were provided a URL to complete an eligibility survey. Once eligibility was 
confirmed, participants were provided an informed consent form describing the study, which they 
signed online to indicate their willingness to participate. Those who had questions about the informed 
consent form and/or their participation in the study could contact the research staff, who provided the 
needed information in the language they preferred. Once informed consent was obtained, participants 
completed  a baseline survey where they indicated whether they would be participating individually or 
with a partner (friend or family member) together in the study.  
Randomization  
Randomization took place at the individual level. A randomization unit consisted of either an individual 
participating alone or with a partner to form a dyad and  was stratified by partnering agency/Asian 
ethnicity. Prior to randomization, participants chose their mode of participation (individually or with a 
partner as a dyad). Randomization occurred after the completion of the baseline assessment. 
Participants we re assigned to either the INFORMED intervention group, which received both LHW 
educational outr each and a 12 -week automated SMS text messaging intervention, or the control group, 
which received only the SMS text messaging program without LHW support.  
Intervention  Group Activities  
Participants assigned to the intervention group received t he INFORMED intervention  (described below). 
They were assessed via online  follow-up surveys with links and reminders delivered by SMS at  
weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. Each participant will receive up to $70 for completing all the surveys  as 
described earlier (Participant recruitment and payment incentives).  
The INFORMED intervention  consisted of two components:  
1. Lay Health Worker (LHW) outreach/support providing responsive education and support, and  
2. a 12-week automated SMS text messaging program.  
Intervention Component #1:  
The LHW educational outreach component included 2 small group educational sessions and 2 
individual follow -up calls. The small group sessions were delivered via video calls using Zoom or 
other mutually agreed platforms . Each LHW outreach session, lasting under 1 hour, involved 2 to 6 
participants. The sessions included presentations on COVID -19 testing and related information 
(including vaccination and safe practices) aimed at enhancing participants’ understanding of 
upda ted COVID -19 testing information, informing them about free testi ng availability, and 
motivating them to get tested.  Sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart, with follow -up 
calls conducted within 2 weeks after each session. Thus, the 4 LHW outreach contacts (group 
sessions and follow -up calls) were completed within 6 to 8 weeks. Participants who chose to 
partici pate as a dyad attended the sessions together. The educational sessions utilized culturally 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]:  INFORMED Study Protocol  
Page 4 of 5 
appropriate PowerPoint presentations with simple texts and images to present current information 
on: 
• COVID -19 testing,  
• reasons for getting tested,  
• current testing guidelines/who should be tested,  
• types of tests available (e.g., antigens and antibodies tests using nose swabs and saliva tests),  
• understanding test results (positive versus negative) and the limitations of tests (false negatives),  
• the importance of repeated testing, and addressing barriers to testing.  
LHW sessions provided a socially and culturally acceptable platform for participants to share 
personal stories, ask questions, and address concerns. At the end of each session, participants were 
encouraged to choose an “action item” from their ‘Healthy Act ion Plan’ to enhance their knowledge 
and/or make informed decisions about testing, and if appropriate, take steps toward getting tested 
(such as identifying test sites).  LHW outreach education is responsive to both culture and the rapid 
changing landscape of the pandemic situation as our intervention contents will be updated 
accordingly.  
Intervention Component #2:  
The 12 -week automated SMS text messaging component sent weekly messages covering topics 
taught in the LHW educational outreach sessions. Designed as non -intensive, weekly contact 
updates, participants received approximately 2 messages on the 6 topics descr ibed in the LHW 
education curriculum. Each message included a link to the full information on the study website 
“INFORMED.”  
Messages were responsive to the rapidly evolving developments and changes related to COVID -19 
testing guidelines. Participants were notified by text when free testing resources became available in 
their county. Thus, there were at least 12 pre -programmed m essages, along with additional 
messages responsive to updates in testing resources and related advancements.  
All intervention group participants  
Control Group Activities:  
The control group participated in a 12 -week SMS text messaging program only, without LHW 
educational outreach (as described in Intervention Component #2). The SMS text messaging 
intervention was identical to that received by the INFORMED participants. All control participants were 
assessed on the same schedule: baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. They received the same amount of 
incentives ($70 for completing all assessments).

Statistics Analysis Plan  
We conducted our primary outcome using multilevel mixed effects models, controlling for baseline 
values and incorporating relevant covariates. Additional details of the statistical methods, covariates, 
and model specifications are provided below.  All analyses were conducted using SAS.  
Primary Outcome Analysis  
1) Primary Outcome  
 Decisional Conflict for Getting Tested for COVID -19 measured by “SURE” score  
2) Model Construction  
a) Multilevel Mixed Effects Model : Using GLIMMIX procedure of SAS, w e constructed the final 
multilevel mixed effects model to analyze the primary outcome at week 16 by treatment group 
(LHW + text message or text message  alone). These models were adjusted for the baseline value 
of the outcome variable and include a random effect to account for participant clustering.  
b) Model Specification : 
i) Fixed Effects: Treatment group, baseline outcome value, covariates at individual , 
interpersonal and community levels . 
ii) Random Effects: Participant cluster (random intercepts for participa tion mode: individual vs 
dyad ) 
 
3) Covariates  
a) Individual -Level Covariates : Asian cultural groups, a ge, sex at birth , current employment 
status, education, health insurance, self -rated health, preferred language (English vs non -
English)  
b) Interpersonal -Level Covariates : marital status, household type (family with kids, 
multigenerational, and no kids/others)  
c) Community -Level Covariates : COVID cases per 100,000 populations (matched participants’ 
county and month of survey date), California Healthy Place Index  
The following covariates were considered but were not included in the final model due to 
multicollinearity with other covariates: English proficiency and nativity  (highly correlated with 
preferred language), and income (correlated with current employment status)  
Secondary Outcome Analysis  
Additional models were  constructed to analyze secondary outcomes  at week 16: COVID -19 testing 
receipt (proportion of participants received COVID -19 testing during the past 30 days); intention for 
getting COVID -19 testing as much as needed; and “SURE” score for getting COVID -19 vaccination.  
These models will follow the same structure as the primary outcome model, controlling for baseline 
values and including relevant covariates.

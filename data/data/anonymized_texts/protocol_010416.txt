Protocol number: TAK-881-1001 Drug: TAK-881 - Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 
20% Solution (abbreviated as IGSC, 20%) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (abbreviated as rHuPH20) 
Title of the study: A Phase 1, Single-Dose, Single-Center, Open-Label, Three-Arm Study to Assess the 
Tolerability and Safety of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Solution with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (TAK-881) at Various Infusion Rates in Healthy Adult Subjects
Number of subjects (total and for each treatment arm):
The planned total sample size for this study is 24 subjects with 8 subjects enrolled/treated in each of the 
3 treatment arms.
Investigator(s):
Site(s) and Region(s): 
Single site, USA
Study period (planned):Initiation: approximately September 2021
Completion: approximately March 2022Clinical phase: 1
Study Subject Population: Healthy male and female subjects aged 19 to 50 years (inclusive) at the time of 
consent and body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2(inclusive) at screening. This study plans to 
enroll 8 subjects in each of the 3 treatment arms, and a minimum of 3 subjects in each of the 2 BMI groups 
(18.0 to <25.0 kg/m2, ≥25.0 to 30.0 kg/m2) in each treatment arm.
Objectives:
Primary: 
To assess the tolerability of TAK-881 at various subcutaneous (SC) infusion rates in healthy adult subjects.
Secondary:
To assess the safety of TAK-881 at various SC infusion rates and immunogenicity of TAK-881 in healthy adult 
subjects.
Exploratory: 
To assess serum total immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels.
Rationale:
TAK-881 (IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20) is a facilitated immune globulin subcutaneous (IGSC) infusion 
evolved from HYQVIA (IGSC 10%) and CUVITRU (IGSC 20%). Both HYQVIA and CUVITRU have very well-established efficacy and safety data. The higher concentration of TAK-881 (IGSC 20%) in comparison with HYQVIA (IGSC 10%) has the potential of reducing infusion volumes by 50%, decreasing infusion time, and 
potentially leading to improved tolerability. This Phase 1 study is being conducted to assess the tolerability, 
safety, and immunogenicity of TAK-881 at various SC infusion rates in healthy adult subjects with a focus on evaluating key dosing and administration parameters to support further clinical development.For non-co881 at var881 at vcommerciaubjects agbjects

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration:
TAK-881: Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Solution (abbreviated as IGSC, 20%) w ith 
Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (abbreviated as rHuPH20).
The dose levels for IGSC, 20% will be 0.4 g/kg (in-line warmed)for Treatment Arm 1 ,1.0g/kg (in-line warmed)
for Treatment Arm 2 , and 1.0 g/kg (un -warmed) for Treatment Arm 3 .
The dose for rHuPH20 is 80 U/g IgG. The rHuPH20 units will be calculated as per the following:
The dose of rHuPH20 is 80 Units × planned IGSC 20% dose in grams = total units to be infused 
(eg,80 U × 40 g = 3200 U).
Then, to calculate the volume required, divide the prescribed units by 160 as each vial has a concentration 
of 160 U/mL, (eg, 3200 U ÷ 160 U/mL = 20 mL).
Methodology:
This study is a Phase 1, single -dose, single -center, open -label, three- arm study to evaluate the tolerability, safety, 
and immunogenicity of TAK -881 at various infusion rates in healthy adult subjects. 
This study comprise s 3treatment arms:
 Treatment Arm 1 -Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK -881 comprising of 0.4 g/kg (in-line 
warmed) IGSC, 20% at progressively increased infusion rates and rHuPH20 dose of 80 U/g IgG on Day 1 
of the study treatment period.
 Treatment Arm 2 -Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK -881 comprising of 1.0 g/kg (in-line 
warmed) IGSC, 20% at progressively increased infusion rates and rHuPH20 dose of 80 U/g IgG on Day 1 
of the study treatment period.
 Treatment Arm 3 -Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK -881 comprising of 1.0 g/kg (un-warmed) 
IGSC, 20% at progressively increased i nfusion rates and rHuPH20 dose of 80 U/g IgG on Day 1 of the 
study treatment period.
Mode of Administration: 
The TAK- 881-1001 investigational product ( IP)will be administered via a SC route of administration using a 
22to 
24-gauge SC needle set. TherHuPH20 solution w ill be administered first followed by IGSC 20% using the 
same needle set. 
The rHuPH20 solution w ill be administered subcutaneously via a peristaltic infusion pump at a rate of 
120mL/hour /site (2 mL/minute /site) and infusion volumes of up to 30 mL/site.
The infusion site(s) can be either the abdomen (middle to upper abdomen) or the thighs (left or right).
The SC infusion of the IGSC 20% solution will begin within 10 minutes of completion of the SC infusion of 
therHuPH20 solution via a peristaltic infusion pump with programmable infusion rates and infusion volumes 
ofup to 300 mL/site and may require 1 or 2 infusion sites. If 2 infusion sites are requi red, the doses will be 
administered sequentially; the infusion of up to 300 mL will be administered first. A flushing step of normal 
saline will be required to ensure the total dose is administered due to the large priming volumes of the 
2administration s ystems. Normal saline will not be infused into the subject. For each infusion site, infusion 
rateramp -up schedule will be followed as shown below .
If the infusion rate is reduced or interrupted due to an intolerability event, the infusion rate will stay a t the 
maximally tolerable infusion rate (eg, if the maximum infusion rate is 300 mL and it is not tolerable ,the infusion 
rate w ill be decreased to the previous infusion rate of 180 mL assuming it was well tolerated )
.
A step -wise infusion rate escalation regimen as shown below will be follow ed for the study based on tolerability 
of each incremental infusion rate increase:

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
A total of 24subjects are planned with 8 subjects enrolled/treated in each of the 3 treatment arms .
Dosing will be first initiated at the low er dose level (Treatment Arm 1, 0.4 g/kg, in-line warmed ) followed by the 
higher dose level (Treatment Arm 2, 1.0 g/kg, in-line warmed )and then the un -warmed arm (Treatment Arm 3, 
1.0g/kg, un-warmed ). Subjects in all 3
treatment arms will be dosed according to a sentinel dosing design with 
ongoing safety monitoring by the investigator to ensure optimal tolerability and safety. Subjects in each treatment 
arm will be grouped into 4subgroups of 1, 1, 2, and 4 subjects, resp ectively . The subgroups will be dosed 
sequentially to allow safety and tolerability evaluation prior to initiating dosing of the following subgroup.
Dosing will start with Treatment Arm 1. Initially, 1subject will be dosed at the low er dose level and the subject 
will be closely observed by the investigator during the infusion period and for the first 72 hours (or longer, per 
investigator’s discretion) following drug administration. The s ubject w ill be d ischarged from the site after an 
overall assessment on Day 4. The investigator will evaluate the safety and tolerability for the first subject from 
infusion start through 72 hours and consult the sponsor as necessary ,prior to dosing the next subject from 
Treatment Arm 1. The next 2subjects from Treatment Arm 1 (0.4 g/kg) will be dosed at least 3 days (72hours)
after dosing of the second subgroup of 1subject. The remaining 4 subjects from Treatment Arm 1 (0.4 g/kg) will 
be dosed at least 3 days (72hours )after dosing of the third subgroup of 2 subjects.
Dosing for Treatment Arm 2 will begin upon the recommendation of the safety revie w team after all subjects in 
Treatment Arm 1 have been dosed, and the tolerability and safety through Day 4of the last sub ject in Treatment 
Arm 1 have been reviewed by the safety review team consisting of the investigator, the Study Clinical Lead, the 
sponsor's Study Medical Monitor (chair ), and the sponsor’s Global Drug Safety Physician.
Dosing for Treatment Arm 3will begin upon the recommendation of the safety revie w team after all subjects in 
Treatment Arm 2have been dosed, and the tolerability and safety through Day 4 of the last subject in Treatment 
Arm 2have been reviewed by the safety review team consistin g of the investigator, the Study Clinical Lead, the 
sponsor's Study Medical Monitor (chair ), and the sponsor’s Global Drug Safety Physician.
Subjects participating at the higher dose level s(Treatment Arm 2, 1.0 g/kg [in-line warmed ]and Treatment 
Arm 3, 1.0 g/kg [un-warmed ]) will be dosed following the same sentinel dosing scheme as Treatment Arm 1.
Study Periods
The study consists of 3 periods :
Screening period: up to 21 days prior to dosing. 
Study treatment period: 
4days.
Follow -up period: up to 12 (±1) weeks after TAK -881 infusion. 
Tolerability and safety including immunogenicity of TAK -881 will be assessed during the treatment and 
follow -up periods for all 3treatment arms. 
All subjects will be monitored for the formation of binding anti -rHuPH20 antibodies (binding anti -drug antibody 
[ADA]) at predose (baseline) ,postdose (Day 30 ±3 days ), and at end of study [EOS] (Week 12 ±1 w eek). 
Postdose s amples with antibody titers ≥1:160 (ADA positive) w ill be analyzed for the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies. At any time over the course of the study, subjects who have (a) 2 consecutive anti -rHuPH20 
antibody titers of ≥1:160 that are elevated from the subject’s baseline titers, and (b) a moderate or severe 
adverse event (AE) (Grade 2 or higher as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [ CTCAE ]v5.0
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017 )) that may be a result of an immune -mediated response 
toeither IG, rHuPH20, or other concomitant medications will be asked to return to the clinical research center 
(CRC )as soon as possible to undergo an additional panel of immunogenicity testing.

Maximum duration of subject involvem ent in the study:
Planned Study Duration: approximate overall duration of the study is 14 to 16 w eeks from screening to EOS
Duration of Treatment Period : 4days
Endpoints and statistical analysis:
Primary Endpoint: 
The primary endpoint corresponding to the primary objective of the study is the occurrence of tolerability 
events related to the infusion of TAK -881per infusion site .
Definition: A tolerability event is considered to have occurred if an infusion was tolerable. An infusion is 
considered tolerable if the infusion rate was not reduced or the infusion was not interrupted or stopped, due 
to any treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) related to TAK-881.
Secondary Endpoints: 
Safety and Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
Occurrence of TEAEs, including but not limited to: TAK -881-related and non -related TEAEs
Clinical laboratory parameters 
Vital signs 
Immunogenicity: occurrence of binding and neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20
Note that clinically significant treatment -emerg ent changes in clinical laboratory measurements and vital signs 
will be recorded in the study database as TEAEs.
SC Administration Endpoints:
The follow ing SC administration endpoints represent supportive tolerability and safety measures:
Maximum tolerable infusion rate achieved per infusion site
Total volume infused per infusion site
Time to deliver the total infused volume per infusion site
Exploratory Endpoint:
Serum total IgG levels at predose and postdose of TAK -881 SC administration
Statistical Consid erations:
No interim analysis is planned for this study. However, before the dosing in Treatment Arm 2, the tolerability and 
safety data through Day 4of the last subject in Treatment Arm 1 w ill be reviewed by a safety review team.
Similarly, the tolerabil ity and safety data through Day 4of the last subject in Treatment Arm 2 will be reviewed 
by a safety revie w team before the dosing in Treatment Arm 3.
No statistical hypothesis testing will be performed.
Tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity endpoint data as well as serum total IgG levels will be analyzed using 
descriptive statistics. Continuous endpoints will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: number 
of subjects (n), mean, median , standard deviation (SD), minimum value, and maximum value. Categorical 
endpoints will be summarized in terms of number and percent of subjects and number of occurrences in each 
category, as appropriate. Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value b efore the dose of TAK- 881.

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK-881-1001 09 Jul 2021
Study endpoints will be summarized, as appropriate, by treatment arm. Additional summaries will be presented 
by study visit.
Claim of tolerability/safety/immunogenicity of TAK-881 will be based on clinical judgment on the totality of 
evidence, with no predefined tolerability/safety/immunogenicity statistical margin or criteria.
Sample Size Justification:
Assessment of tolerability to TAK-881 SC administration at various infusion rates is the primary objective of this 
study.
This study is not designed for statistical hypothesis testing; therefore, the sample size was not based on statistical 
considerations. The planned total sample size for this study is 24 subjects (8 subjects per treatment arm).
Of the 24 subjects to be enrolled, a minimum of 18 subjects are expected to complete the study, assuming a 
conservative overall dropout rate of 25% in this healthy subject study (overall dropout rates assumed for HYQVIA patient studies are generally 10%-15%). The number of subjects expected to complete the study ( ≥18) 
is considered adequate for claiming tolerability and safety of TAK881 based on clinical judgment.

2.BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
TAK -881, Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Solution (IGSC, 20%) with 
Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is a facilitated subcutaneous immune globulin 
(IG) evolved from the currentl y licensed HYQVIA, I mmune Globulin I nfusion 10% (Human) 
with Recombinant Human Hy aluronidase, and CUVITRU, Immune Globulin Subcutaneous 
(Human), 20% Solution. TAK -881 dif fers from HYQVIA onl y by the use of warmed IGSC, 20% 
(CUVITRU) instead of immune globulin infusion ( IGI), 10% at room temperature.
TAK -881 is administered by  sequential subcutaneous (SC) infusion of rHuPH20 first, followed 
immediately  (within 10 minutes) b y warmed IGSC, 20%. The ratio of rHuH20 to IG is the same 
as for HYQVIA, which is 80 U rHuPH20 per gram of IG.
Given the doubled IG concentration delivered with TAK- 881, the required infusion volume 
would be reduced b y 50% at an equivalent dose level as co mpared to HYQVIA. Reduced 
volumes potentially  lead to improved tolerability  due to fewer local site reactions with better 
patient outcomes.
However, the higher IG concentration, as with CUVITRU, is associated with higher viscosity, 
increasing in
-line press ure, which onl y allow lower infusion rates in conventional I GSC, 20% 
therap y.
Dynamic viscosity  is inversel y proportional to temperature. In liquids, viscous forces are caused 
by molecules exerting attractive forces on each other and increasing temperature results in a 
decrease in viscosit y as particles gain greater thermal energy and can overcome the attractive 
forces binding them together.
Therefore, to decrease viscosity , a commerciall y available in -line warming device is used for 
TAK -881 (for Treatment Arms1 & 2 onl y,in this study )to warm the infusion tubing used to 
infuse the IGSC, 20% component.
By decreasing viscosit y of the IGSC, 20% with warming, TAK- 881 may  allow for faster infusion 
time as compared to CUVITRU (currentl y up to 1 m L/min), and lower SC infusion volume with 
associated shorter infusion time as compared to HYQVIA.
The IGSC, 20% component of TAK -881 is a liquid immunoglobulin G (IgG) product purified 
from human plasma marketed as CUVITRU. The IgG subclass distribution for the final product 
is within the normal range for human serum and comprises antibodies to specific bacterial and 
viral pathogens. The preparation retains all Fab and Fc mediated functions of the IgG molecule.

The rHuPH20 component of TAK -881 is a highl y purified, recombinant human hyaluronidase 
thatde-polymerizes the gel -like hy aluronan in local SC tissue where it is infused. 
This localized effect results in a transient increase in permeability , allowing IGI to disperse and 
to reach the s ystemic circulation more readil y than without rHuPH20.
Extensive safety  data are available for the individual components of TAK- 881, rHuPH20 and 
IGSC, 20%, based on the safet y profiles of the approved products, HYQVIA and CUVITRU. 
Additionally , it was demonstrated through anal ytical and preclinical studies that the warming of 
IGSC, 20% did not influence critical qualit y parameters and local tolerability  and that warming 
and facilitation of IGSC, 20% allows higher flow rates than currentl y used for CUVITRU. 
Finally , the comb ination of rHuPH20 and warmed IGSC, 20% was well tolerated in preclinical 
studies, thereb
y supporting proof of concept clinical trials.
IGSC, 20% with or without rHuPH20 has previously  been administered to a limited number of 
humans without using a warmi ngdevice (TAK -881IB). 
The clinical development of TAK -881 is based on the development of HYQVIA and CUVITRU. 
The following sections provide an overview of HYQVIA and CUVITRU along with relevant 
data summarized from HYQVIA and CUVITRU studies .
2.1 Overview and Relevant Data of HYQVIA/HyQvia 
HYQVIA (also known as TAK -771) is an IGI (Human) 10% with a rHuPH20. IGI, 10% with 
rHuPH20 has been developed to enable the SC administration of large volumes of IgG. IGI, 10% 
with rHuPH20 is licensed in the European Union (EU) and United States (US) with licensed 
indications in each country  detailed in the corresponding national prescribing information. I n the 
EU, IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 is marketed as Hy Qvia and in the US, IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 is 
marketed as HYQVIA. Overall, IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 clinical data and post -marketing data 
obtained since first licensure are consistent with the known safety profile of IgG preparations and 
Immune Globulin I nfusion (Human), 10% (IGI, 10%) (
Baxalta US Inc., 2020) .
The rHuPH20 component of IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 is a highl y purified, recombinant 
hyaluronidase th
at de -polymerizes the gel -like hy aluronan in local SC tissue where it is infused. 
This localized effect results in a transient increase in permeability , allowing the IGI, 10% 
component to disperse and to reach the s ystemic circulation more readil y than wit hout rHuPH20.
The IGI, 10% component of IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 is a liquid IgG product purified from 
human plasma. The IgG subclass distribution for the final product is within the normal range for 
human serum and comprises antibodies to specific bacterial and viral pathogens. The preparation 
retains all antigen -binding fragment (Fab) and fragment cry stallizable region (Fc) mediated 
functions of the IgG molecule.

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
The safet y profile of IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 is not considered to be different from the 
individua l components. Since rHuPH20 acts locally with little sy stemic absorption, no impact on 
the sy stemic effects and safet y of IG I, 10% is anticipated. Nonclinical studies of IGI, 10% with 
rHuPH20 showed that rHuPH20 increases the dispersion and absorption of I GI, 10%, while 
mitigating induration and tissue damage after SC administration of large volumes of IgG. 
IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 revealed no toxicologically relevant adverse effects on local tolerability . 
PH20 is a testicular hy aluronidase and nonclinical stu dies have demonstrated no adverse effects 
from anti -rHuPH20 antibody  exposure from conception through adulthood and no evidence of 
toxicity  during fetal development.
The clinical program for IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 includes 7 completed interventional clinica l 
studies in primary  immunodeficiency  disease (PIDD) and healthy  volunteers, and 1 completed 
non-interventional registry  study  in women exposed to treatment before or during pregnancy  
(pregnancy  registry ). Together, these studies demonstrate the efficacy , pharmacokinetics (PK) , 
safet y and tolerability of IGI, 10% with rHuPH20. rHuPH20 increased the bioavailability of 
IG
I,10% administered subcutaneousl y by approximately 20%, thus reducing the clinically 
effective SC dose. IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 was shown to be effective in preventing infections in 
patients with PI DD with slightly  lower rates of validated serious acute bacterial infections and all 
infections for IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 compared to IgG administered SC (IGSC), and protection 
was maintained with lo ng-term treatment. IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 decreased the frequency , 
severit y, and duration of induration at the site of administration compared to controls. During the 
clinical studies, IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 was well tolerated at large volumes (>600 mL /site) and 
utilizing maximum flow rates significantl y higher than those used for intravenous (IV) infusions. 
The rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) per infusion obtained for IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 
compares favorably  with published data on IGSC, and the rate of systemic ADRs was lower with 
IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 than with IgG administered IV treatment, which is in agreement with 
published data on IGSC treatment. The incidence of treatment -emergent rHuPH20 -reactive 
binding antibodies was low, and neutralizing anti bodies have not been observed in an y subjects
in the completed clinical trials. I n addition, no clinical signs or s ymptoms have been associated 
with positive rHuPH20
-reactive binding antibod y titers. I n conclusion, the clinical program to 
date has shown th at IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 is safe and infusion of large volumes >600 mL /site 
are well tolerated, enabling treatment of pediatric and adult patients with PIDD at the same 
interval used for IGI, 10% administered IV.
Two clinical studies in subjects with chronic inflammatory  dem yelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy  (CIDP), aPhase 1 dose ramp -up study  in health y adult subjects, 
2post-authorization studies (1 global post-marketing commitment study and 1 post -authorization 
safet y stud y in the EU), and 2 studies in pediatric populations (a Phase 3 study in the US and 
1post-authorization study in the EU), are ongoing.

risk/benefit assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the metabolism, 
PK, efficacy , and safet y of HYQVI A (HYQVIA IB).
2.2Overview and Relevant Data of CUVITRU 
CUVITRU is an Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Solution (IGSC, 20%) that has 
been de veloped with the aim of providing a more concentrated product with a reduced required 
infusion volume for SC administration. I GSC, 20% is presentl y approved under the trade name 
CUVITRU in 17 EU countries and in the US, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Brazil.
It was developed based on Baxalta’s Immune Globulin I nfusion 10% (IGI, 10%). The 
manufacturing process for IGSC, 20% is essentially the same as for IGI, 10%, with the exception 
of the final ultra -/diafiltration and formulation steps. I GSC, 20% cont ains functionally  intact 
IgG. The IgG subclass distribution for the final product is within the normal range for human 
serum, and comprises antibodies to specific bacterial and viral pathogens. The preparation retains 
all Fab and Fc mediated functions of the native IgG molecule.
IGSC, 20% is derived from large pools of human plasma. To decrease the potential 
contamination with blood- borne viruses, each individual plasma donation is tested with approved 
tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to human immunodeficiency  virus 
(HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition, Baxalta has implemented a donation sample 
mini- pool strategy  to test for the presence of HIV- 1, HIV -2, HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), 
hepatitis A virus (HAV), and par vovirus B19 (B19V) nucleic acids. Onl y donation pools 
nonreactive in these tests, with the exception of B19V which must not exceed 
10000 International Units (IU)/mL, are qualified for manufacture into plasma derivatives.
The modified Cohn -Oncley  cold ethan ol fractionation process, followed by  cation and anion 
exchange chromatographies, are used for the manufacturing of IGSC, 20%. IGSC, 20% is 
processed using solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment as a dedicated virus inactivation step. 
Nanofiltration (35 nm) and low pH incubation with elevated temperature are included in the 
manufacturing scheme to enhance the virus safet y of IGSC, 20%.
Viral safet y studies used virus models and target viruses to evaluate the clearance of both 
lipid-enveloped and non -enveloped de oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
viruses by  the manufacturing steps specific for viral reduction. These studies demonstrated that 
the 3 dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps provide effective and robust clearance of HIV, 
West Nile 
virus (WNV), HAV, B19V, as well as model viruses for HCV, HBV, HAV, and 
B19V.

The safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of IGSC, 20% in PI DD have been demonstrated in 
2 Phase 2/3 studies in Europe (Protocol 170903) and in North America (Protocol 170904).
IGSC , 20% was also administered in a P hase 1 study  (Protocol 170901 Part 1) in healthy  
volunteers designed to investigate the safety  and tolerability  of IGSC, 20% administered with 
rHuPH20 as a permeation enhancer and to determine the optimal dose ratio. A tot al of 
14 infusions of IGSC, 20% (12 with and 2 without rHuPH20) were administered in 7 subjects, 
none of whom experienced serious or severe adverse events (AEs) after administration of 
IGSC, 20% or withdrew from the study  due to AEs.
Alway s refer to the la test version of the IB for CUVITRU for the overall risk/benefit assessment 
and the most accurate and current information regarding the metabolism, PK, efficacy , and safety  
of CUVITRU ( CUVITRU IB ).
2.3Risk/Benefit and Ethical Assessment
There will be no direct health benefit for health y participants in this study  from receipt of 
TAK -881. An indirect health benefit to the subjects screened/enrolled in this study  is the free 
medical tests received at screening and during the stud y.
The risks associated with dosing TAK -881 are anticipated to be similar to those previousl y 
documented in the product labels for HYQVIA and CUVITRU, please refer to the safet y 
information in HYQVIA IB andCUVITRU IB.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria, screening, and safet y monitoring practices employed in this 
protocol (ie, 12 -lead electrocardiogram [ECG], vital signs, clinical laboratory  tests, AE 
monitoring, and ph ysical examination) are adeq uate to protect the subject’s safet y.
2.4Compliance Statement
This study  will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Council for 
Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, 1996; ICH E6 R2, 2018),

3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE
3.1Rationale for the Study
TAK -881 (IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20) is a facilitated immune globulin subcutaneous 
(IGSC) infusion evolved from HYQVIA (IGSC 10%) and CUVITRU (IGSC 20%) . Both 
HYQVIA and CUVITRU have very  well -established efficacy  and safet y data . The higher 
concentration of TAK -881 (IGSC 20%) in comparison with HYQVIA (IGSC 10%) has the 
potential of reducing infusion volumes by 50%, decreasing infusion time, and potentially  lead ing
to improved tolerability . This Phase 1 study  is being conducted to assess the tolerability , safet y, 
and immunogenicit y of TAK- 881 at various SC infusion rates in health y adult subjects with a 
focus on evaluating key  dosing and administration parameters to support further clinical 
development.

3.2.2 Secondary Objective
To assess the safet y of TAK-881 at various SC infusion rates and immun ogenicity  of TAK -881 
in healthy  adult subjects.
3.2.3 Exploratory Objectives
To assess serum total IgG levels.
3.3Study Endpoints
3.3.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint corresponding to the primary  objective of the study  is the occurrence of 
tolerability  events rela ted to the infusion of TAK -881 per infusion site.
Definition: A tolerability event is considered to have occurred if an infusion was tolerable. An 
infusion is considered tolerable if the infusion rate was not reduced or the infusion was not 
interrupted or stopped, due to any  treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) related to 
TAK -881.

4.STUDY DESIGN
4.1Study Design
This study  is a Phase 1, single- dose, single -center, open -label, three-arm study  to evaluate the 
tolerability , safet y, and immunogenicit y of TAK- 881 at various infusion rates in healthy  adult 
subjects. 
Section 1.2provides a schematic of the stud y design. The overall study  design is presented in 
Figure 1and the sentinel dosing design in Figure 2.
This study  comprise s 3 treatment arms:
•Treatment Arm 1 - Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK-881 comprising of 0.4 g/kg 
(in-line 
warmed) IGSC, 20% at progressively  increased infusion rates and rHuPH20 dose 
of 80 U/g IgG on Day 1 of the study  treatment period.
•Treatment Arm 2 - Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK-881 comprising of 1.0 g/kg 
(in-line 
warmed) IGSC, 20% at progressively  increased i nfusion rates and rHuPH20 dose 
of 80 U/g IgG on Day  1 of the study  treatment period.
•Treatment Arm 3 - Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK-881 comprising of 1.0 g/kg 
(un-warmed) IGSC, 20% at progressivel y increased infusion rates and rHuPH20 dose of
80U/g IgG on Day  1 of the study  treatment period.
The infusion rates as presented in S ection 7.2.2 will be followed for the study .
A total of 24 subjects are pl anned with 8 subjects enrolled/treated in each of the 3 treatment arms.
Dosing will be first initiated at the lower dose level (Treatment Arm 1, 0.4 g/kg, in-line warmed ) 
followed by the higher dose level (Treatment Arm 2, 1.0 g/kg, in-line warmed )and then the 
un-warmed arm (Treatment Arm 3, 1.0 g/kg, un -warmed) . Subjects in all 3treatment arms will 
be dosed according to a sentinel dosing design with ongoing safet y monitoring b y the 
investigator to ensure optimal tolerability  and safety . Subjects in each treatment arm will be 
grouped into 4subgroups of 1, 1, 2, and 4 subjects, respectivel y. The subgroups will be dosed 
sequentially  to allow safety  and tolerability  evaluation prior toinitiating dosing of the following 
subgroup.
Dosing will start wi th Treatment Arm 1. Initially , 1 subject will be dosed at the lower dose level 
and the subject will be closely  observed by  the investigator during the infusion period and for the 
first 72 hours (or longer, per investigator’s discretion) following drug admi nistration. The s ubject 
will be discharged from the site after an overall assessment on Day 4. The investigator will 
evaluate the safet y and tolerability for the first subject from infusion 
start through 72hours and 
consult the sponsor as necessary , prior to dosing the next subject from Treatment Arm 1.

5.4Reproductive Potential
No clinical studies have been conducted with TAK- 881 or CUVITRU in pregnant women.
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TAK -881 or HYQVIA or 
CUVITRU. It is also not known whether IGI, 10% or 20% can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacit y. However, clinical 
experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects of IGI, 10% or 20% on 
fertil ity are to be expected.
A non- interventional pregnancy  registry  to collect long -term safet y data from women treated 
with HYQVIA was conducted (Study  161301) . None of the AEs reported was assessed as related 
to previous or current IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 trea
tment in the mother, or caused treatment 
changes (ie, dose reduction, interruption, withdrawal). A total of 2 SAEs (thrombocy topenia and 
pre-eclampsia) were reported in one mother in the IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 arm in the 
prospective cohort. A total of 2 SAEs (cleft lip without cleft palate and talipes calcaneovalgus) 
were reported in 2 infants in the I GI, 10% with rHuPH20 arm. None of these events was related 
to treatment with IGI, 10% with rHuPH20. 
No anti -rHuPH20 binding or neutralizing antibodies, or loc al and immunologic AEs were 
reported.
Five mothers continued IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 treatment during pregnancy  (2 mothers enrolled 
before delivery  and 3 mothers enrolled after delivery  with ongoing treatment at the screening 
visit) and all had live births, with normal APGAR scores. Five mothers in the Retrospective 
cohort were enrolled after the delivery  and therefore no data on anti -rHuPH20 antibodies during 
the pregnancy  was available in those mothers.

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK-881-1001 09 Jul 2021
IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 given during pregnancy was not associated with labor and delivery
complications. Two minor birth defects, ie,cleft lip without cleft palate and talipes calcaneovalgus, were reported in 2 infants in the IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 Arm. These 2 birth defects were not known to be related to one another, they were assessed as unrelated to treatment and, given the small sample size in this study, these events could be attributed to chance. The mothers of these infants did not report any known risk factors associated with cleft lip or talipes, although the mother of the infant with cleft lip, had reported a congenital double kidneyabnormality. 
Considering the small sample size and limited data collection in this study, the results should be 
interpreted withcaution (HYQVIA IB) .
Development and reproductive toxicology studies have been conducted with recombinant human 
hyaluronidase in mice and rabbits. No adverse effects on pregnancy were associated with anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. In these studies, maternal antibodies to recombinant human hyaluronidase were transferred to offspring in utero. In animal studies, exposure to antirHuPH20 antibodies at every stage of the reproductive and development lifecycle and from conception in one generation through conception in the following generation did not result in adverse effects on the developing fetus, pediatric/juvenile and young adult stages, adult male and female fertility, or after chronic exposure in juvenile and adult animals. Thus, theoretical risks associated with antirHuPH20 antibodies were extensively evaluated in nonclinical studies, no evidence of a safety signal or increased risk for fertility, embryofetal development, or pediatric development was observed.
The effects of antibodies to the rHuPH20 component of HYQVIA on the human embryo or on 
human fetal development are unknown.
5.4.1 Female Contraception
Sexually active females of child-bearing potential should be using an acceptable form of 
contraception. Females of child-bearing potential must be advised to use acceptablecontraceptives throughout the study period and for 90 days following the dose of IP. If hormonal contraceptives are used, they should be administered according to the package insert. Females of child-bearing potential who are not currently sexually activemust agree to use acceptable contraception, as defined below, if they become sexually active during the period of the studyand 90 days following the last dose of IP.

5.4.2 Male Contraception
From signing of informed consent, throughout the duration of the study , and for 90 day s after 
TAK -881 infusion, nonsterilized male subjects who are sexually  active with a female partner of 
child
-bearing potential must use barrier contraception (eg, condom with or without spermicidal 
cream or jelly ). In addition , they  must be advised not to donate sperm during this period.
5.5Discontinuation of Subjects
A subject may  withdraw from the study  at any  time for an y reason without prejudice to his/her 
future medical care b y the physician or at the institution or may  be wi thdrawn at any  time at the 
discretion of the investigator or sponsor (eg, in the interest of subject safety). The investigator is 
encouraged to discuss withdrawal of a subject with the medical monitor when possible.
If IP is discontinued, regardless of the reason, evaluations listed in Sect ion 1.3are to be 
performed as completel y as possible. Whenever possible, all discontinued subjects should also 
undergo follow -up evaluations. Comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made by  the 
subject must be recorded in the source documents. The reason for discontinuation, date of 
discontinuation of the I P, and the total amount of IP administered must be recorded in the s ource 
documents.
Subjects who withdraw or are discontinued may  be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor. 
Replacement of discontinued or withdrawn subjects due to any  reason will be assessed on a 
case-by-case basis.
5.5.1 Stopping Criteria for IP Administration

7.INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT
7.1Identity of Investigational Product (s)
Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Sol ution (I GSC, 20%) with R ecombinant 
Human Hy aluronidase (rHuPH20) (also referred to as IGSC, 20% with rHuPH20, or TAK -881). 
IGSC, 20% (human) will be supplied in 8 g/40 mL vials with rHuPH20 160 Units/mL  supplied 
separately  in 15 mL vials.
7.1.1 Immune Globulin S ubcutaneous 20% (Human) –IGSC, 20%
The IGSC, 20% (Human) is a read y-for-use, sterile, liquid preparation of highl y purified and 
concentrated IgG antibodies. The distribution of the IgG subclasses is similar to that of normal 
plasma. The Fc and the Fab fun ctions are maintained in the primary  component. Pre -kallikrein 
activator activity  is not detectable. The IGSC, 20% (Human) contains 200 mg/mL  (20%) protein. 
At least ≥98% of the protein is IgG, contains trace amounts of IgA (average concentration of 
80mcg/mL). The IGSC, 20% (Human) contains a broad spectrum of IgG antibodies against 
bacterial and viral agents. Gly cine (0.25 M) serves as a stabilizing and buffering agent. There is 
no added sugar, sodium, or preservatives. The pH is 4.6 to 5.1. The osmolalit y is 280 to 
292milli- osmoles/kg. The IGSC, 20% (Human) is manufactured from large pools of human 
plasma. IgG preparations are purified from plasma pools using a modified Cohn -Oncley cold 
ethanol fractionation process, as well as cation and anion exchange chromatograph y.
To further improve the margin of safet y, validated virus inactivation/removal steps have been 
integrated into the manufacturing and formulation processes, namel y solv ent/detergent (S/D) 
treatment, 35 nm nanofiltration, and a low pH incubation at elevated temperature (30°C to 32°C). 
The solvent/detergent process includes treatment with an organic mixture of tri -n-but yl 
phosphate, octox ynol 9 and polysorbate 80 at 18°C t o 25°C for a minimum of 60 minutes. 
Solvent/detergent treatment inactivates the lipid
-enveloped viruses investigated to below 
detection limits within minutes. The ethanol fractionation process provides an additional virus 
clearance capacit y.
7.1.2 Recombinant Hu man Hyaluronidase –rHuPH20
The rHuPH20 component of TAK -881 is produced from genetically  engineered Chinese 
Hamster Ovary  cells containing a DNA plasmid encoding for a soluble fragment of human 
hyaluronidase PH20. rHuPH20 is used in HYQVIA. The purified h yaluronidase gl ycoprotein 
contains 447 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 61,000 Daltons. This 
component is supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless, read y-for use solution and has approximate 
pH of 7.4 and an osmolality  of 290 to 350 milli -osmoles. Each vial contains 160 U/mL  of 
recombinant human h yaluronidase with the following excipients: sodium chloride, sodium 
phosphate dibasic dih ydrate, human albumin, edentate disodium dihydrate, calcium chloride 
dihydrate, and sodium hydroxide added for pH adjustment. I t does not contain preservatives.
For non-commercial use only
TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 50
Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
Due to comprehensive virus testing at the master cell bank, working cell bank ,and bulk harvest 
stages, effective virus reduction during the purification process and the use of pharmaceutical 
grade huma n albumin as an excipient with no other materials of human or animal origin involved 
in the manufacturing process, rHuPH20 provides for high margins of safety with respect to 
viruses.

Not applicable.
7.2Administration of Inve stigational Product(s)
7.2.1 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment
This is a Phase 1, single -dose, single -center, open -label, three-arm study  which plans to enroll 
8subjects in each of the 3treatment arms, and a minimum of 3 subjects in each of the 2 BMI 
groups (18.0to <25.0 kg/m2, ≥25 .0to 30 .0kg/m2) in each treatment arm.
A 4-digit subject number will be allocated immediately  prior to dosing after eligibility  has been 
determined. Subjects in the 18.0 to <25.0 kg/m2BMI group will be assigned numbers starting 
with 1001, 1002, 1003, 
etc. Subjects in the ≥25.0 to 30.0 kg/m2BMI group will be assigned 
numbers starting with 2001, 2002, 2003, etc. If a subject number is allocated incorrectly , the 
study  monitor must be notified as soon as the error is discovered. Once a subject number has 
been assigned, that number must not be used again if, for example, a subject is withdrawn from 
the study . For enr olled subjects, the subject number will be the identifying number used 
throughout the CRF.
7.2.2 Dosing
This study  comprise s 3 treatment arms:
•Treatment Arm 1 - Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK-881 comprising of 0.4 g/kg 
(in-line 
warmed) IGSC, 20% at progressively  increased infusion rates and rHuPH20 dose 
of 80U/g IgGon Day 1 of the study  treatment period.
•Treatment Arm 2 - Subjects will receive a single dose of TAK-881 comprising of 1.0 g/kg

Dosing will be first initiated at the lower dose level (Treatment Arm 1, 0.4 g/kg, in-line warmed ) 
followed by the higher dose level (Treatment Arm 2, 1.0 g/kg, in-line warmed )and then the 
un-warmed arm (Treatment Arm 3, 1.0 g/kg, un- warmed) . Subjects in all 3 treatment arms will 
be dosed according to a sentinel dosing design with ongoing safet y monitoring b y the 
investigator to ensure optimal tolerability  and safety . Subjects in each treatment ar m will be 
grouped into 4subgroups of 1, 1, 2, and 4 subjects, respectivel y. The subgroups will be dosed 
sequentially  to allow safety  and tolerability  evaluation prior toinitiating dosing of the following 
subgroup.
Dosing will start with Treatment Arm 1. Initially , 1 subject will be dosed at the lower dose level 
and the subject will be closely  observed by  the investigator during the infusion period and for the 
first 72 hours (or longer, per investigator’s discretion) following drug administration. The s ubject 
will be discharged from the site after an overall assessment on Day 4. The investigator will 
evaluate the safet y and tolerability for the first subject from infusion start through 72 hours and 
consult the sponsor as necessary , prior to dosing the next subject from Treatment Arm 1. The 
next 2subjects from Treatment Arm 1 (0.4 g/kg) will be dosed at least 3 days
(72hours) after

TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 52
Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
Mode of Administration: 
The TAK -881-1001 IP will be administered via a SC route of administration using a 
22to24-gauge SC needle set. TherHuPH20 solution will be administered first followed b y 
IGSC 20% using the same needle set.
The rHuPH20 solution will be administered subcutaneously  via a peristaltic infusion pump at a 
rate of 120mL/hour /site (2mL/minute /site) and infusion volumes of up to 30 mL/site.
The infusion site(s) can be either the abdomen (middle to upper abdomen )or the thighs (left or 
right) .
The SC infusion of theIGSC 20% solution will begin within 10 minutes of completion of the 
SC 
infusion of therHuPH20 solution via a peristaltic infusion pump with programmable infusion 
rates and infusion volumes of up to 300 mL/site and may  require 1 or 2 infusion sites. If 
2infusion sites are required, the doses will be administered sequentiall y;the infusion of up to 
300mL will be administere d first. A flushing step of normal saline will be required to ensure the 
total dose is administered due to the large priming volumes of the 2administration sy stems. 
Normal s aline will not be infused into the subject. For each infusion site, infusion rate ramp -up 
schedule will be followed as shown below.
If the infusion rate is reduced or interrupted due to an intolerability event, the infusion rate 
will stay at the maximally tolerable infusion rate (eg, if the maximum infusion rate is 300 mL 
and it is not tolerable ,the infusion rate will be decreased to the previous infusion rate of 180 mL 
assuming it was well tolerated) .
A step
-wise infusion rate escalation regimen as shown below will be followed for the stud y 
based on tolerabilit y of each incremental inf usion rate increase:

7.3Labeling, Packaging, Storage, and Handling
The pharmacy  will prepare and dispense the study drugs per the instructions in the Pharmacy  
Manual.
7.3.1 Labeling
Labels containing study  information and pack identification are applied to the I P(s) container.
Additional labels may  not be added without the sponsor’s prior full agreement.
7.3.2 Packaging
Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Solution is supplied in single -dose glass vials 
that nominally  contain 8 g of protein per vial.
Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is supplied in s ingle -dose glass vials that 
nominally  contain 160 Units/mL  in a 15 mL vial.
Changes to sponsor -supplied packaging prior to dosing may  not occur without full agreement in 
advance b y the sponsor.
7.3.3 Storage
The investigator has overall responsibility  for ensuri ng that IP is stored in a secure, 
limited -access location. Limited responsibility  may  be delegated to the pharmacy  or member of 
the study  team, but this delegation must be documented . IPis prepared by  the pharmacy  or 
nominated member of the study  team. Th e pharmacist/nominated team member will enter the 
unique subject identifier on the I P preparation as it isprepared prior to administration .
Investigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. 
Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the I P is maintained 
within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study  and that records are maintaine d; 
the temperature should be monitored continuously by  using either an in -house sy stem, a 
mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or b y manual means, such that 
both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time perio d can be recorded 
and retrieved as required. Such a device ( eg,certified min/max thermometer) would require 
manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must be notified immediately  upon discovery  
of an y excursion from the established range. Temperat ure excursions will require site 
investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of 
excursions on the I P and will provide supportive documentation as necessary . Under no 
circumstances should the product be dispense d to subjects until the impact has been determined 
and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor.
For non-commercial use only
TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 55
Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
IGSC 20% solutions for administration have to be prepared as instructed in the Pharmacy  
Manual . The stud y drug must only  be administered to study  subjects at the study  site 
immediately  following preparation .
If administration of pooled products will begin more than 3 h ours from preparation, they  must be 
kept at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46 °F). Pooled products should be taken out of the 
temperature -contr olled storage before administration to allow for equilibration to room 
temperature. It may  take 90 minutes or longer for the pooled products to reach room temperature. 
The infusion shall be started no later than 3 hours after removal from the temperature - controlled 
storage. 
All solutions for infusion will be labeled according to regulatory  requirements for clinical 
studies.
The sponsor should be notified immediately  if there are an y changes to the storage area of the IP 
that could affect the integrity  of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room.
7.3.4 Special Handling
The BIEGLER BW 685/BW 685 S is a warm ingsystem for infusions and operates on the basis 
of a continuous flow warmer with a range of +37°C to +41°C, where the heat from the heat 
exchanger is transferred via the Biegler extension tubing to the liquid flowing within it. The 
accessory  tube warmer Biegler Tubeflow is an active warming s ystem for infusions between 
BW685 S and the patient. The warmer sy stem will be set to 39°C for infusion of IGSC 20% 
(Treatment Arms 1 and 2 only) andtemperature of the IGSC 20% liquid will be warmed prior to 
the infusion delivery  into the subcutaneous tissue to decrease IGSC 20% viscosity .
7.4 Drug Accountability
The investigator will be provided with sufficient amounts of IGSC, 20% (Human) and rHuPH20 
to carry  out this protocol for the agreed- upon number of subjects. The investigator or designee 
will acknowledge receipt of the products, documenting shipment conten t (quantities, lot 
numbers) ,and condition received. Accurate records of all I P dispensed, used, returned, and/or 
destroy ed must be maintained as detailed further in this section.
The investigator has overall responsibility  for dispensing and administering IP. Where 
permissible, tasks may  be delegated to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmacist) who is adequatel y 
trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. This 
delegation must be documented in the applicable study  delegation of authority  form.
For non-commercial use only

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by  the investigator in the applicable study  
delegation of authorit y form) will dispense and administer I GSC, 20% (Human) and rHuPH20 
only to subjects included in this study  following the procedures set out in the study protocol. 
Each subject will be given only  IGSC, 20% (Human) and rHuPH20. All dispensed and 
administered medication will be documented on the CRFs and/or other IP record (including all 
lot numbers and expiration d ates) .
No IP stock or returned inventory  from a Takeda -sponsored study  may  be removed from the site 
without prior knowledge and consent b y the sponsor. If such transfer is authorized by  the 
sponsor, all applicable local, state, and national laws must be adhered to for the transfer.
The sponsor or its representatives must be permitted access to review the supplies storage and 
distribution procedures and records.
The disposition of all unused stock, empty /partially  used cartons and vials of IGSC, 20% and 
rHuPH20 will be decided by  the sponsor and site at the end of the study . 
Please refer to the current version of the Pharmacy  Manual that has been provided for an y other 
instructions or updates to this procedure. 
Based on entries in the site drug accounta bility  forms, it must be possible to reconcile 
IGSC, 20% and rHuPH20 delivered with those used and returned. All IGSC, 20% and rHuPH20 
must be accounted for and all discrepancies investigated and documented to the sponsor’s 
satisfaction.
7.5
Subject Compliance
Compliance must be assessed by  observation of dosing by  the investigator or designee. The 
investigator/nominated person will record details on the drug accountability  log(s) and/or source 
documents. In addition, details of the dosing time (time, date, dos e level) will be captured in the 
appropriate CRF.
Drug accountability  must be assessed at the container/packaging level for unused I P that is 
contained within the original tamper-evident sealed container (eg, bottles, vials) or at the 
individual count leve l for opened containers/packaging. The pharmacist/nominated person will 
record details on the drug accountabilit y form.

8.STUDY PROCEDURES
8.1Study Schedule
See Sect ion 1.3for stud y procedures.
8.1.1 Screening Period
Screening procedures must be completed within 21 days as appropriate prior to receiving the 
dose of IP. The CRC is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who 
provided informed consent. The log will also serve to document the reason for screening failure. 
All screening data for enrolled subjects will be collected and reported in CRFs. Screen failures 
will be reviewed according to the monitoring plan but will not be entered in the EDC system. All 
screening assessments and proce dures are to be performed b y the principal investigator (PI) or a 
qualified designee. See Section 1.3fora complete list of screening procedures to be performed.
Written, signed, and dated informed consent must be obtained by  the PI or a designee prior to the 
performance of an y study -related procedures. A copy  of the signed informed consent must be 
given to the subject or legall y-authorized representative for their re cords.
8.1.1.1 Screening Failure
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
criteria and/or met at least 1 of the exclusion criteria and has not been administered IP(s).
For purposes of data collection, all subjec ts who give consent to the study  but are not dosed will 
be reported as screen failures even if they  were otherwise full y eligible for the study (for 
example, alternates/reserve subjects). Screen failures will not be captured in the EDC sy stem or 
counted as “enrolled”.
8.1.1.2 Rescreening of Subjects
Subjects who fail to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will not be permitted to be rescreened 
for the stud y at an y point.
Eligible subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria but are unable to participate in the 
study  due to scheduling conflicts/timing may  be rescreened based on investigator discretion and 
sponsor approval should their availability  to participate fall outside the screening window. In 
these cases, a new screening number must be assigned for eac h subject who is rescreened, and a 
new informed consent form (ICF) must be signed.
For non-commercial use only

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
Subjects who discontinued from screening due to COVID- 19 positivity  but were otherwise 
qualified to participate in the trial may  be rescreened if they  were as ymptomatic and recovered 
with no known clinical sequelae. The f inal decision about the irpossible participation will be 
made after discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor .
8.1.2 Treatment Period 
All subjects will be admitted to CRC on Day  -1 prior to dosing and discharged on Day  4.
SeeSection 1.3for Schedule of Study Procedures .
8.1.2.1 Day 1
Subjects will receive a single dose of IGSC, 20% on Day 1 at dose levels 0.4 g/kg (in-line 
warmed) , 1.0 g/kg (in-line warmed), or 1.0 g/kg (un-warmed) with rHuPH20 80 U/g IgG with 
progressivel y increased infusion rate per the schedule presented in Section 7.2.2. 
The rHuPH20 unitswill be calculated as per the following:
•The dose of rHuPH20 is 80 Units × planned IGSC 20% dose in grams = total units to be 
infused ( eg, 80 U × 40 g = 3200 U).
•Then, to calculate the volume required, divide the prescribed units by  160 as each vial has 
a concentration of 160 U/mL , (eg, 3200 U ÷ 160 U/mL  = 20 mL).
Subjects must be well hydrated prior to drug administration.
All subjects will undergo safet y assessments ( infusion site evaluation, vital signs, and ECG ) on 
Day 1,as presented in Section 1.3.
8.1.2.2 Day 2 
and Day 3
Infusion site eva luation will be performed for all subjects on Day  2. Infusion site evaluation and 
Hgb assessment will be performed for all subjects on 
Day 3. 
8.1.2.3 Day 4
All subjects will be discharged from CRC on Day  
4after serum IgG sample collection and safet y 
assessments (vital signs, hemoly tic panel , infusion site evaluation [as clinically  indicated] ). 
8.1.3 Follow -up Period
8.1.3.1
Day 30 (±3 days) Ambulatory Visit
All subjects will visit CRC on Day  30 (±3 day s) for safet y assessments (vital signs, serum 
chemistry , drugs of abuse/alcohol screen, hematology , urinaly sis , infusion site evaluation [as 
clinically  indicated] ), serum IgG sample collection, and rHuPH20 immunogenicity  assessment 
(ADA and neutralizing anti- drug antibody  [nADA] blood collection).

The follow -up period for this study  is up to 12 (±1) weeks after TAK -881 infusion.
At the EOS/ET visit, final inquiries for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant treatments will be made 
including all the procedures/assessments as presented in Secti on 1.3. All AEs and SAEs that are 
not resolved at the time of this contact will be followed to closure (see Appendix 3.2 ).
8.1.5 Additional Care of Subjects After the Study
No after care is planned for this study .
8.2Study Evaluations and Procedures
The Schedule of Stud y Procedures (Section 1.3) summarizes the clinical procedures to be 
performed at each visit. Individual clinical procedures are described in detail below. Additional 
evaluations/testing may  be deemed necessary  by the investigator or designee and/or the sponsor 
for reasons related to subject sa fety.
Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safet y concerns take precedence 
over all routine scheduled procedures.
8.2.1 Informed Consent Procedure
The purpose of the study , the procedures to be carried out and the potential hazards will be 
described to the subjects in non- technical terms. Subjects will be required to read, sign, and date 
an ICF summarizing the discussion prior to screening, and will be assured that they  may  
withdraw from the stud y at an y time without jeopardizing their me dical care.
Subjects or legally -authorized representative will be given a cop y of their signed ICF.
8.2.2 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value before the dose of TAK
-881.
Demographic data, including sub ject number, gender, age, race, and ethnicity  will be recorded.
Body height (cm) and weight (kg) will be measured and reported as outlined in the Schedule of 
Study  Procedures (Section 1.3).
BMI will be calculated based on the height and weight measured at screening. Bod y weight will 
be measured again at Day - 1 for dose calculation. 
Abnormalities identified at the screening visit will be documented in the subject’s sou rce 
documents and on the medical history  CRF. Changes after the screening visit will be captured as 
AEs on the AE CRF page, as deemed b y the investigator.

8.2.3 Safety
The name and address of each third -party vendor (eg, clinical laboratory ) used in this study  will 
be maintained in the investigator’s and sponsor’s files.
Actual safety  assessment times will be monitored and recorded. The sponsor’s expectation is that 
the investigator will ensure that every  effort is made to perform all assessments at the precise 
protocol -scheduled time. 
8.2.3.1
Medical and Medication History
A complete medical and medication history , as well as demographic information, will be 
performed at the time points described in Section 1.3 by a qualified licensed phy sician, 
physician’s assistant, or a nurse practitioner. The medical history  will be reviewed and recorded, 
including:
•Date of birth
•Sex
•Race and ethnicity
•Recent ingestion of medication (30 day s prior to entering the screening period)
•History  of respiratory , cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, 
hematological, neurological, psy chiatric, and other diseases
•Smoking habits
8.2.3.2 Physical Examination (Including Height and Weight)
A complete ph ysical examination or a partial ph ysical examination will be performed as
described in Section 1.3by a qualified licensed phy sician, ph ysician’s assista nt, or nurse 
practitioner.
Abnormalities identified at the screening visit will be documented in the subject’s source 
documents and on the medical history  CRF. Changes after the screening visit will be captured as 
AEs on the AE CRF page, as deemed b y the i nvestigator.
8.2.3.3 Adverse Event Collection
At each stud y visit and during in -house confinement , subjects will be questioned in a general 
way to ascertain if AEs have occurred. Subjects will be encouraged to report any  AEs they  may  
experience during this time. A t the follow -up and EOS visits, subjects will again be questioned 
in a general way  to ascertain if AEs have occurred since the previous visit (eg, “Have you had 
any health problems since y our last visit?”). Adverse events are collected from the time inform ed 
consent is signed (refer to
 Appendix 3 for AE definitions, assessment, collection time frame, and 
reporting procedures) .

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
8.2.3.4 Vital Signs
Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at times specified in Section 1.3of this protocol. 
Additional blood pressure and pulse rate measurements may  be perfo rmed, as determined b y the 
investigator, in order to ensure appropriate monitoring of subject safety and accurate recording of 
vital sign measurements. Any changes from baseline which are deemed clinically  significant by  
the investigator are to be recorded as an AE.
The same method for obtaining blood pressure measurement (auscultatory  or oscillometric) 
should be used throughout the study  for all subjects (and documented). In addition, the 
conditions of vital sign measurements should be controlled and as co nsistent as possible 
during the study , in order to minimize external variability  of the readings. 
It is advised that measurements be collected at a comfortable room temperature with little to no 
background noise, using the same (appropriatel y sized) cuff placed at the same location of the 
same arm during the study. The bladder deflation rate should be deflated (calibrated for 
oscillometric method or manually  by auscultatory method) at a rate of 2-3 mmHg/s (and the first 
and last audible sounds recorded as systolic and diastolic pressure) after at least 5 minutes of rest 
in the assumed position.
The cuff should have a bladder length that is 80% and a width that is at least 40% of arm 
circumference (a length -to-width ratio of 2:1).
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of cuff placement. 
The subject should not have exercised or consumed caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine within 
30 minutes of collection. The subject should be instructed to relax as much as possible for at 
least 5minutes prior to collection. The subject should remain quiet during this time and through 
the measurement.
Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be performed with subjects in a seated position, 
except when they  are supine or semi -reclined beca use of study  procedures and/or AEs 
(eg,nausea, dizziness) or if deemed necessary  by the investigator or designee.
At the screening visit, blood pressure should be compared between both arms. When there is a 
consistent inter- arm difference confirmed over 3 consecutive measurements (>10 mmHg), the 
arm with the higher blood pressure should be used for inclusion at screening and the last 
measurement recorded in the CRF. The same (right or left) arm with the higher blood pressure 
will be used throughout the stu dy.
For details on blood pressure and pulse procedures for health y subjects, see Figure 3.

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
The use of automated devices for measuring pulse rate is acceptable, although, when done 
manually , pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least 30 seconds. When 
the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, blood pressure and pulse 
rate should be obta ined prior to the nominal time of the blood collection.
Respiratory Rate
The subject should be in a comfortable position. The observer should hold the extremity  of the 
subject as a distraction for the patient (ie, pretending he/she is taking the subject’s radial pulse) 
and count the respiration for 1 minute. 
Body Temperature
Oral temperature should be taken b y placing a digital thermometer under the tongue for at least 
30seconds and the temperature reported in degrees Celsius. Ty mpanic temperature may  also be 
used. 
8.2.3.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  tests will be performed according to the laboratory ’s standard procedures. 
Reference ranges will be supplied by  the laboratory  and used to assess the results for clinical 
significance and out -of-range changes which may be associated with, or constitute, an AE. The 
investigator should assess out -of-range clinical laboratory  values for clinical significance, 
indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically  significant or clinicall y significant. Abnormal 
clinical laboratory  values, which are unexpected or not explained by  the subject’s clinical 
condition, may , at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible 
until confirmed, explained, or resolved.
All tests listed be low will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Section 1.3). In addition, laboratory  safet y tests may be performed at various unscheduled time 
points, if deemed necessary  by the investigator or designee.
Samples for hematology  and clinical chemistry  assessments will be collected in the appropriate 
matrix as specified in the L aboratory  Manual. At any  time during the study , unscheduled 
hematology  and/or clinical chemistry  test(s) may  be performed as part of AE/safet y investigation 
or may  be repeated once in the event of abnormalities in test results due to errors.
Hematology  and clinical chemistry  assessments will be performed at the local laboratory  
following standardized assay  procedures.

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
The following clinical laboratory  assessments will be performed: 
Biochemistry
Blood samples for serum biochemistry  will be collected according to the timepoints provided in 
Section 1.3. Sample collection details are provided in t he Laboratory  Manuals.
Serum chemistry  tests will be performed after at least an 8 -hour fast (on the screening day  only ); 
however, in case of dropouts or rechecks, subjects may  not have fasted for 8 hours prior to the 
serum chemistry  sample being taken.
Section 1.3lists the parameters to be assessed in this study . At screening, creatinine clearance 
will be calculated using the following Cockcroft -Gault formula (Shrewsberry  et al., 2007 ).
Creatinine clearance = (140 − Age)×mass (kilogram weight)÷72× serum creatinine in (mg/dL) 
if “female”×85%
Hematology
Blood samples for hematology  will be collected according to the timepoints provided in 
Section 1.3. Sample collection details are provided in the L aboratory  Manuals. Section 1.3lists 
theparameters to be assessed in this study .
Hemolytic Panel 
The first hemol ytic panel will be measured at D -1. Refer Section 1.3for further details on 
baseline 
considerations and hemoly tic panel parameters. 
It is not necessary  to repeat the hemoly tic panel if the drop of ≥ 1 g/dL Hgb remains constant 
72hours after the full dose of the IP or aft er an unscheduled visit blood draw, unless it drops 
further. It is recommended that the investigator uses good medical judgment in assessing subjects 
with an unexplained decrease in serum Hgb as other medical conditions beside hemoly sis can 
cause this, and therefore may  require additional investigations. 
Hemoly tic tests will be performed at the local laboratory  or other laboratories as appropriate (eg, 
antibody  elution in the event of positive direct Coombs test). Complete hematology  and clinical 
chemistry assessments may  be performed in order to obtain laboratory  results required for a 
hemoly tic panel.
Urinalysis
A urine sample for urinaly sis will be collected according to the timepoints and parameters 
provided in Section 1.3. Sample collection details are provided in the Laboratory  Manuals.

Coagulation 
Samples will be collected according to the timepoints and tests provided in Section 1.3. Sample 
collection details are provided in the Laboratory  Manual. 
8.2.3.6 Pregnancy Test
Pregnancy  test will be done forall females. Serum pregnancy  test will be obtained at screening 
and whenever a pregnancy  is suspected. If the serum pregnancy  test at screening is older than 
7days, a serum pregnancy  test is required on D -1; otherwise urine pregnancy  test may  be 
performed on D -
1.Subjects must have a negative urine and/or serum pregnancy  test wit hin 
7days prior to IP administration. 
8.2.3.7 Drug and Alcohol Screen
A urine screen for drugs of abuse and alcohol will be performed asdescribed in Section 1.3. 
Additional drug and alcohol screens may
 be performed at the investigator’s discretion.
Results of urine drug and alcohol screens will be reviewed and verified b y the study monitor but
will no t be collected in the CRF database.
Any positive result for drugs of abuse or alcohol at screening or on Day  -1 will exclude the 
subject from further participation in the study .
8.2.3.8 Serology Screen
Blood samples will be drawn at timepoints listed in Section 1.3. Sample collection details are 
provided in the Laboratory  Manual. 
Section 1.3lists the parameters to be drawn for the virology  
screen.
The test results must be confirmed negative prior to enrollment in the study. If a test result is 
positive, the subject will be excluded from entering the stud y. Results of the virology  screen w ill 
be reviewed and verified by  the study  monitor but will not be collected in the CRF database.
8.2.3.9 Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening for the determination of eligibility  (eg, exclusion 
of clinically  significant cardiac abnormalities, such as unstable cardiac arrhy thmias, and 
detection of other clinically  significant cardiac abnormalities that may  indicate an underl ying 
condition that may impede the subject’s participation in the study , pose increased risk to the 
subject, or confou nd the results of the study ). ECG will be reviewed by  the investigator or a 
designee. ECG will be performed at the time points specified in Section 1.3.
The following parameters will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page: heart rate, PR, RR, 
QRS, and QT intervals. The QTcB and QTcF will be derived from the data in the database. 
For non-commercial use only
TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 66
Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
Theinvestigator’s assessment of the ECG tracing as normal or abnormal must be documented, 
and if abnormal, his/her determination of whether the abnormality  is clinically  significant or not 
will be documented on the tracing and recorded in the CRF.
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of lead placement. 
The subject should not have exercised or consumed caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine within 
30 minutes prior to collection. The subject must be resting in the supine position for at le ast 
5minutes prior to collecting the ECG. 
In some cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in or der to achieve precise ECG recordings. 
8.2.4 Serum Total IgG Levels and Immunogenicity Assessments
8.2.4.1 Blood Sample Collection and Handling Procedures
Blood samples will be collected at the time specified in Section 1.3to measure serum 
concentrations of total IgG and anti- rHuPH20 antibodies (ADA and nADA).
Blood samples will be drawn according to the time points specified in Section 1.3and processed 
as described in the Laboratory Manual. The actual time that the sample was obtained will be 
recorded in the subject’s source document and on the appropriate CRF page. In in stances where 
more than 1 blood collection tube is used, the time of the initial blood draw will be recorded for 
all tubes collected at that time point on the appropriate CRF page. After apply ing a tourniquet, 
venous blood will be drawn with a disposable n eedle. If a catheter is used, the first milliliter of 
blood on each sampling occasion will be discarded. Saline can be used to keep catheters patent.
Serum or K 3EDTA plasma sample tubes for bioanaly sis must be freezer -safe and identified with 
freezer -safe labels provided by  the specialt y laboratory. The labels will contain the following 
information:
•Study  number
•Subject identifier 
•Treatment 
•Period
•Nominal day
•Nominal time
•Matrix identifier (plasma)
•Split (primary  or back- up)

9.DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by  the study  
CRF Completion Guidelines or similar for all data requiring transcription of the source. A study  
monitor will visit the study site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the CRF data 
against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepanc ies between source data and 
data entered on the CRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy  
warrants correction, the correction will be made by  authorized site personnel. Data collection 
procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s 
meeting. Once a subject is enrolled, it is expected that site personnel will complete the CRF entry  
within approximately  3 business day s of the subject’s visit.
The study  will be monitored in a ccordance with the current GCP.
9.1.1
CRFs (Electronic and Paper)
Completed CRFs are required for each subject who signs an informed consent.
The sponsor or its designee will supply  investigative site with access to CRFs. The contract 
research organization (CRO) will make arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of 
the CRF. These forms are used to transmit the information collected in the performance of this 
study  to the sponsor and regulatory  authorities. eCRFs must be completed in English. Data a re 
transcribed directl y onto CRFs.
After completion of the entry  process, computer logic checks will be run to identify  items, such 
as inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may  be issued by  Takeda 
personnel (or designees) and w ill be answered b y the site.
Corrections are recorded in an audit trail that captures the old information, the new information, 
identification of the person making the correction, the date the correction was made, and the 
reason for change. Reasons for sig nificant corrections should additionally  be included.
The PImust review the CRFs for completeness and accuracy  and must sign and date the 
appropriate CRFs as indicated. Furthermore, the investigator must retain full responsibility  for 
the accuracy  and aut henticity  of all data entered on the CRFs.
After the lock of the clinical study  database, any  change of, modification of, or addition to the 
data on the CRFs should be made b y the investigator with use of change and modification 
records of the CRFs. The PImust review the data change for completeness and accuracy  and 
must sign and date. 
For non-commercial use only
TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 71

CRFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptability  at the CRC during periodic visits by  
study  monitors. The sponsor or its designee will be permitted to review the su bject’s medical and 
hospital records pertinent to the study  to ensure accuracy  of the CRFs. 
The completed CRFs are the sole propert y of the sponsor and should not be made available in 
any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of app ropriate governmental 
health or regulatory  authorities, without written permission of the sponsor.
9.2Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the Data Management Plan. Qualit y 
control and data validation proced ures are applied to ensure the validit y and accuracy of the 
clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarificat ion are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner.
9.3Data Handling
Data handling will be conducted b y the CRO. The full d etails of procedures for data handling 
will be documented in the Data Management Plan. AEs andmedical history  will be coded using 
the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities®(MedDRA®). Drugs will be coded using the 
World Health Organization Drug Di ctionary .
9.4Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by the CRO.
The Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the study  data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for su mmarizing other 
study  information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics, IP 
exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The SAP will also include a description of 
how missing, unused , and spurious data will be addressed.
To preserve the integrit y of the statistical anal ysis and study  conclusions, the SAP will be 
prepared and approved by the sponsor prior to the first study  visit of the first subject in this 
open -label stud y.
All statistical analy ses will be performed using Statistical Analy sis Software, SAS®(SAS 
Institute, Cary , NC 27513), Version 9.4 or higher.

9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee
There is no planned interim analysis, adaptive design, or Data Monitoring Committee inthis 
study.
However, before the dosing in Treatment Arm 2, the tolerability and safety data through Day4
of the last subject in Treatment Arm 1 will be reviewed by a safety review team consisting of the investigator, the Study Clinical Lead, the sponsor's StudyMedical Monitor(chair), and the sponsor’s Global Drug Safety Physician (Section 4.1).Similarly, the tolerability and safety data 
through Day 4 of the last subject in Treatment Arm 2 will be reviewed bythesafety review team before the dosing in Treatment Arm 3.
9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations
Assessment of tolerability to TAK-881 SC administration at various SC infusion rates is the 
primary objective of this study.
This study is not designed for statistical hypothesis testing; therefore,the sample size wasnot 
based on statistical considerations.
The planned total sample size for this study is 24subjects (8 subjects per treatment arm).Of the 24subjects to be enrolled, a minimum of 18subjects are expected to complete the study, 
assuming a conservative overall dropout rate of 25% in this healthy subject study (overall dropout rates assumed for HYQVIA patient studies are generally 10%-15%). The number of subjects expected to complete thestudy ( ≥18) is considered adequate for claiming tolerability 
and safety of TAK881 based on clinical judgment.
9.7 Statistical Analysis Sets
Safety Analysis Set:
The Safety Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who received a partial or a full dose of 
TAK-881. Analysis of tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity data will be based on the Safety Analysis Set.
PK Analysis Set:
The PK Analysis Set will consist of all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set who have at least one 
evaluable postdose serum concentration for total IgG. Analysis of serum total IgG levels will be based on the PK Analysis Set.For non-commercial use only;therefothere

9.8Methods of Analysis
Statistical analy sis for this study  will be descriptive in nature ; no statistical hy pothesis testing 
will be performed.
Tolerability , safet y, an d immunogenicit y endpoint data as well as serum total IgG levels will be 
analyzed using descriptive statistics. Continuous endpoints will be summarized using the 
following descriptive statistics: number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD ), 
minimum value, and maximum value. Categorical endpoints will be summarized in terms of 
number and percent of subjects and number of occurrences in each category, as appropriate. 
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value before the dose of TAK- 881.
Claim of tolerability /safety /immunogenicity  of TAK -881 will be based on clinical judgment on 
the totality  of evidence, with no predefined tolerability /safet y/immunogenicity  statistical margin 
or criteria.
9.8.1 Primary Endpoint
The number and percentage of su bjects with tolerability  events will be summarized per infusion 
site by  treatment arm and overall.
9.8.2 Secondary Endpoints
SC administration endpoints represent supportive tolerability  and safet y measures and will be 
summarized per infusion site by treatment a rm and overall using descriptive statistics.
The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs as well as the number of TEAEs will be 
summarized by  treatment arm and overall. TEAEs considered related to TAK- 881, serious 
TEAEs, local TEAEs, s ystemic TEAEs, t emporally associated TEAEs within 72 hours, TEAEs 
leading to stud y discontinuation, TEAEs by maximum severity , and TEAEs of special interest 
will be similarly  summarized. Additional TEAEs may  be specified in the SAP. In addition, the 
number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be categorized by  preferred term (PT) and 
summarized by  treatment arm and overall. The PTs will be grouped by  system organ class 
(SOC). Each TEAE will then be divided into defined severit y grades and relationship to 
TAK -881. Subject identifiers will be included within each PT. If the same subject experiences 
multiple TEAEs categorized under the same PT and relationship assessment, this TEAE is shown 
only once at its most serious severit y. 
Clinical laboratory  parameters, vital si gns, and immunogenicit y assessments will be summarized 
descriptivel y by treatment arm and overall as well as by stud y visit. In addition, shift tables from 
baseline to each post -infusion study  visit will be generated by  treatment arm and overall. Note 
thatclinically  significant treatment- emergent changes in clinical laboratory  measurements and 
vital signs will be recorded in the study  database as TEAEs.

Appendix 2.4Ethical Considerations
Informed Consent
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain written informed consent from all study  
subjects prior to an y study -related procedures including screening assessments. I nvestigators will 
choose patients for enrollment considering the study  eligibili
ty criteria. The investigator will 
exercise no selectivit y so that no bias is introduced from this source. All subjects must sign an 
ICFbefore entering into the study  according to applicable national and local regulatory  
requirements and ICH GCP . Before u se, the ICFwill be reviewed b y the sponsor and approved 
by the IRB and regulatory  authorit y(ies), where applicable. The ICFwill include: the objectives, 
potential benefits and risk, inconveniences, and the subject’s rights and responsibilities, a 
compreh ensive explanation of the proposed treatment without any  exculpatory  statements, in 
accordance with the elements required b y ICH GCP and applicable national and local regulatory  
requirements . Subjects will be allowed sufficient time to consider participati on in the study . Each 
subject or the subject’s legall y
-authorized representative, as applicable, is requested to sign and 
date the subject ICF or a certified translation if applicable, after the subject has received and read 
(or been read) the written subject information and received an explanation of what the study  
involves. By  signing the ICF, subjects agree that they  will complete all evaluations required by  
the study , unless they  withdraw voluntaril y or are terminated from the stud y for an y reason. A 
copy of the informed consent documentation (ie, a complete set of subject information sheets and 
fully  executed signature pages) must be given to the subject or the subject’s legall y
-authorized 
representative, as applicable . This document may  require transla tion into the local language. 
Signed consent forms must remain in each subject’s study  file and must be available for 
verification at an y time.
The PIprovides the sponsor with a copy  of the consent form which was reviewed by  the 
IRB/IEC and 
which received their favorable opinion/approval. A cop y of the I RB/IEC’s written 
favorable opinion/approval of these documents must be provided to the sponsor ,prior to the start 
of the study  unless it is agreed to and documented (abiding by  regulatory  guidelines and na tional 
provisions) prior to study start that another part y (ie, sponsor or coordinating 
PI) is responsible 
for this action . Additionally , if the IRB/IEC requires modification of the sample subject 
information and consent document provided b y the sponsor, t he documentation supporting this 
requirement must be provided to the sponsor
. 
Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable state and federal/local 
requirements of each participating region . Responsibility  for coordinating with I RBs/IECs 
isdefined in the clinical trial agreement . The sponsor or designee will require documentation 
noting all names and titles of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC.

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
If any member of the IRB or IEC has direct participation in this study , written notification 
regarding his or her abstinence from voting must also be obtained. Those American sites 
unwilling to provide names and titles of all members due to privacy  and conflict of interest 
concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide Assurance Number or comparable number 
assigned b y the Department of Health and Human Services. This protocol, the IB, a copy  of the 
ICF, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials and/or advertisements and other document s 
required b y all applicable laws and regulations, will be supplied by  sponsor or designee and must 
be submitted to a central or local IRB or IEC for approval
. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval 
of the protocol and subject informed consent must be obtaine d and submitted to the sponsor or 
designee before commencement of the stud y (ie, before shipment of the sponsor -supplied drug or 
study  specific screening activity )
. The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the study  by exact 
protocol title, number, and 
version date; identify  versions of other documents (eg, ICF) 
reviewed; and state the approval date. The sponsor will ship drug/notify  site once the sponsor has 
confirmed the adequacy  of site regulatory  documentation and, when applicable, the sponsor has 
received permission from competent authorit y to begin the study . Until the site receives 
drug/notification no protocol activities, including screening, may  occur.
Sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by  their respective IRB or IEC. This may  inclu de 
notification to the I RB or I EC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed consent 
form, recruitment materials intended for viewing by  subjects, local safety  reporting requirements, 
reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the stud y at intervals specified b y the 
respective IRB or IEC, and submission of the investigator’s final status report to I RB or IEC . All 
IRB and IEC approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be provided to the 
sponsor or its designee.
Subject inc entives should not exert undue influence for participation. Pay ments to subjects must 
be approved b y the IRB or IEC and sponsor.
IP supplied will not be released until the sponsor 
has received written IRB/IEC approval .
Prior to implementing changes in the study , the sponsor and the IRB/IEC must approve an y 
revisions of all informed consent documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a 
subject safet y issue. If required by local law, substantial amendments to the protocol must also 
be approved b ythe appropriate Regulatory  Agency  prior to implementation.
The investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/IEC appr isedof the progress of the study  and 
of an y changes made to the protocol, at least annually  or more frequentl y in accordance with the 
requirements, policies, and procedures established by  the IRB/IEC. The investigator must also 
keep the local I RB/IEC informed of any  serious and significant AEs as required by  IRB/IEC 
procedures .

APPENDIX 3ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFI NITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR 
RECORDING, EVALUATI NG, FOLLOW-UP, AND R EPORTING
Appendix 3.1Adverse Event Definitions
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily
 have a causal relationship with this I P or 
medicinal product. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicin al (investigational) 
product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995).
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y event emerging or manifesting at 
or after the initiation of treatment with an IP or medicinal product or an y existing event that 
worsens in either intensity  or frequency  following exposure to the I P or medicinal product.
Adverse Event of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) (serious or non- serious) is one of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the compound/program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by  the investigator to Takeda may be appropriate. Such events may  require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Takeda uses Targeted 
Questi onnaires (TQs) to collect additional data on specific safet y concerns. Takeda PV 
Operations team will send the appropriate TQ to the reporter based on the list of PTs or a 
Standard MedDRA Query  (SMQ) associated with certain Takeda compound/program. 
Thefollowing AESIs appl y to this compound/program;
•Allergy  
•Catheter l eakage 
•Thromboembolic events
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to IP or not) that at an y dose:
•Results in death
•Is life -threatening . Note: The term ‘life- threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers to 
an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe
For non-commercial use only
TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 86
Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . Note: 
Hospitalizations, thatare the result of elective or previously scheduled investigations 
procedures or surgery  for pre -existing conditions andhave not worsened after initiation of 
treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y 
scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, 
complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previously  scheduled 
surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s)
•Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
•Results in a congenital abnormality /birth defect
•Is an important medical event
. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may  be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of 
such medical events include bronchospasm associated with anaph ylaxisrequiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient ho spitalization; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse
Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Re ference Safet y Information 
(RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are not 
specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation.
The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using the IB as the RSI . This 
determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously  observed, but 
not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a product.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any  suspected 
adverse reaction to study  treatment (ie, including active c omparators) that is both serious and 
unexpected.
The event(s) must meet all of the following:
•Suspected adverse reaction
•Serious
•Unexpected
•Assessed as related to study  treatment

TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 87
Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect 
An unanticipated adverse device effect ( UADE) is any  serious adverse effect on health or safet y 
or an y life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously  identified in nature, severity , or degree of incidence in the 
study protocol or product labeling; or any  other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safet y, or welfare of subjects.
Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory  parameter, vital sign measure, or 12 -lead ECG 
assessment can represent an AE if the change is clinically  relevant or if, during administration of 
IP, a shift of a parameter is observed from a value in the normative range to a value that is 
outside the norm al range and considered clinicall y significant, or a further waning of an alread y 
clinically  significant value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the 
reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while c ontinuing 
administration or after the end of administration with the I P, and the range of variation of the 
respective parameter within its reference range, should also be considered.
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical labora tory results (such as 
hematology
 panel or clinical chemistry  panel), vital sign s, or 12- lead ECG values which were not 
present at the pretreatment evaluation observed closest to the start of study  treatment, further 
investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a 
plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease or expected disease evolution) is found for the 
abnormal values.
The investigator should assess, based on the above criteria and the clinical conditi on of the 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory  value, vital sign, or 12 -lead ECG parameter is 
clinically  significant and represents an AE.
Appendix 3.2Collection of Adverse Events
All AEs /SAEs and AESIs are collected fr om the time the informed consent is signed until the 
defined follow -up period stated in Section 8.1.3. This includes events occurring during the 
screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not IP is administered.
All AEs/SAEs and AESIs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to 
his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to baseline), regardless of whether the 
subject is still participating in the stud y. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, 
stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect an y further improvement or worsening 
ofthe event), or the event is otherwise explained.

Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
Appendix 3.3 A ssessment of Adverse Events
Severity Categorization
The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop 
dates for each change in severit
y. An event that changes in severity is captured as a new event. 
Worsening medical conditions, signs or sy mptoms present prior to initiation of I P, must be 
recorded as new AEs.
For example, if a subject reports mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to initiation of dosing with the 
IP, and the d yspepsia becomes severe and more frequen t after first dose of a new AE of severe 
dyspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be documented in the source.
All AEs and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Termi nology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ), 
Version 5.0, dated November 27, 2017 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017) . 
For an y term that is not specificall y listed on the CTCAE scale, intensity will be assigned a grade 
of 1 through 5 using the following CTCAE guidelines:
Grade 1: Mild; as ymptomatic or mild sy mptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only ; 
intervention not indicated.
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non- invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily  living.
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately  life-threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indi cated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily  living.
Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences .
Grade 5: Death related to AE.
Infusion Related AE Evaluation
Infusion related AE s will be evaluated per CTCAE v5.0 for an y potential systemic effects s uch 
as infusion related reactions or local infusion site events (ie, infusion site extravasation). Allergic 
reactions related to infusion, use injury , poisoning , and procedural complications should be 
reported as infusion related reaction. Do not report both. Photographs of infusions site(s) may be 
collected (optionall y)on Day 1 (prior to start of infusion , 1-hour [±15 min utes] after start of 
infusion, and within 15 minutesafter the end of infusion) , Day  2(24 hours post infusion 
[±4hours ]), Day 3(48 hours post infusion [±4 hours ]).

TAK -881 ( IGSC, 20% solution with rHuPH20 ) CONFIDENTIAL Page 89
Clinical Study Protocol: TAK -881-1001 09Jul 2021
The c atheter leakage at infusion site will be evaluated b y the investigator/designee based on the 
following scoring s ystem and will be reported as a mild AE if the leakage is readil y observable 
(Score 2) :
•Score 1 = Minimal leakage (ie, transient/ barel y observable leakage) . Score 1 will be 
considered equivalent to Grade 1 of CTCAE v5.0 evaluation scale.
•Score 2 = Readily  observable leakage (ie,continuous/ inability  to complete infusion at that 
site). Score 2 will be considered equivalent to Grade 2 of CTCAE v5.0 evaluation scale. 
No higher grading above Grade 2 will be applied to catheter leakage.
Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to I P for each AE. The 
investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the event may  have been caused by the I P. If there is no valid reason for 
suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related .” Otherwise, if there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the IP and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“related .” The causalit y assessment must be documented in the source.
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the adm inistration of the investigational 
product is compelling and/or follow s a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and 
the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical 
condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship 
exists between the investigational product and the event.
Outcome Categorization
The outcome of AEs must be recorded in the source during the course of the study . Outcomes are 
as follows:
•Fatal
•Not Recovered/Not Resolved
•Recovered/Resolved
•Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae
•Recovering/Resolving
•Unknown

drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF .
Appendix 3.4Safety Reporting
Reference Safety Information
The reference for safet y informa tion for this study  is the Investigator’s Brochure which the 
sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators.
Reporting Procedures
1.All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by  the investigator to Takeda PV 
Operations Department and the CRO/ Takeda Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event . Note: The 24- hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not 
apply  to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Appendix 3.9 ) unless 
they result in an SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Takeda Safet y Report Form and verify the 
accuracy  of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents 
(Note: Source documents are not to be sent un less requested) , and fax or e -mail the form to the 
Takeda PV Operations Department. 
Fax: +1-484-595-8155
E-mail: drugsafet y@shire.com
A cop y of the Takeda Safety Report Form must also be sent to the CRO/ Takeda Medical 
Monitor using the details specified in the emergency  contact information section of the protocol.
Appendix 3.5Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs and AESI s (regardless of relationship to 
IP) are collected from the time the subjec t 
signs the informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 8.1.3, and must be 
reported to the Takeda PV Operations Departmen t and the CRO/ Takeda Medical Monitor within 
24 hours of the first awareness of the event.
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related” to the I P and discovered by  the investigator at any  
interval after the stud
y has completed must be reported to the Takeda PV Operations Department 
within 24 hours of the first becoming aware of the event.

Append ix 3.6Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates
The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria . The resolution 
date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the 
event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge 
dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y.
In addition, any  signs or sy mptoms reported by the subject after signing the I CF or leading up to 
the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an 
AE, if appropriate.
Appendix 3.7Fatal Outcome
Any SAE that results in the subject’s death ( eg, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of 
death) must have f atal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date re corded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another IP action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action 
taken with the I P should be recorded as “dose not chang ed” or “not applicable” (if the subject 
never received IP or it is a single -dose study ).The I P action of withdrawn should not be selected 
solely  as a result of the subject’s death.
Appendix 3.8Pregnancy
All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined 
follow -up period stated in Section 8.1.3.
Any report o
f pregnancy  for any  female study  participant or the partner of a male study  
participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Takeda PV Operations Department using the 
Takeda Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy  of the Takeda Pregnancy  Report Form (and any  
applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/ Takeda Medical Monitor using the 
details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. The pregnant 
female stud y participant must be withdrawn from the study.
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately  30 calendar day sand
approximately 1-year post -partum.

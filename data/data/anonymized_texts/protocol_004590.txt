The

(c)

Thirty-eight
 
individuals
 
with
 
aMCI
 
will
 
be
 
enrolled
 
in
 
the
 
3-day
 
interleaved
 
TBS-fMRI
 
study.
 
Participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomly
 
assigned
 
into
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
TBS
 
groups:
 
active
 
TBS
 
or
 
sham
 
TBS
 
(Figure
 
1).
 
Participants
 
will
 
receive
 
3
 
TBS
 
sessions
 
on
 
day
 
2
 
with
 
each
 
TBS
 
session
 
separated
 
by
 
60
 
minutes
 
to
 
maximize
 
the
 
TBS
 
effect
5,6
.
 
Participants
 
in
 
the
 
active
 
TBS
 
group
 
will
 
receive
 
3
 
excitatory
 
TBS
 
sessions
 
(the
 
3
 
yellow
 
ovals
 
in
 
Figure
 
1).
 
Participants
 
in
 
the
 
sham
 
TBS
 
group
 
will
 
undergo
 
a
 
procedure
 
identical
 
to
 
the
 
active
 
TBS
 
except
 
that
 
no
 
TBS
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
(the
 
3
 
white
 
ovals
 
in
 
Figure
 
1).
 
Research
 
participants
 
and
 
outcome
 
assessors
 
will
 
be

for
 
participants’
 
allocated
 
group.
 
Outcome
 
measures
 
assessing

function,
 
hippocampal

task
 
will
 
be
 
acquired
 
on

1
 
(baseline),
 
day
 
2
 
(immediate

and
 
day
 
3
 
(lasting

We
 
hypothesize
 
that
 
active
 
spaced
 
TBS
 
will
 
enhance
 
memory
 
function,
 
strengthen
 
hippocampal
 
functional
 
connectivity,
 
and
 
increase
 
hippocampal
 
activation
 
compared
 
to
 
the

TBS
 
immediately
 
and
 
24
 
hours
 
after
 
the
 
last
 
TBS
 
session.
 
 
 
 

Outcome

Accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
face-name

(FNAME)
 
task
,
 
resting-state
 
hippocampal
 
functional
 
connectivity,
 
and
 
hippocampal
 
activation
 
pattern
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
primary
 
outcome
 
measures.
 
Participants
 
will
 
perform
 
the
 
FNAME
 
task,
 
which
 
was
 
adapted
 
from
 
previous
 
paradigm
7,8
,
 
inside
 
the
 
MRI
 
scanner.
 
The
 
FNAME
 
task
 
consists
 
of
 
both
 
encoding
 
and
 
retrieval
 
phases
 
(Figure
 
4).
 
During
 
the
 
encoding
 
phase,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
instructed
 
to
 
remember
 
the
 
name
 
that
 
goes
 
with
 
each
 
face
 
and
 
make
 
a
 
subjective
 
decision
 
as
 
to
 
how
 
well
 
each
 
name
 
fits
 
the
 
corresponding
 
face
 
(a
 
strategy
 
designed
 
to
 
augment
 
associative
 
encoding)
9
.
 
Encoding
 
phase
 
will
 
be
 
divided
 
across
 
4
 
functional
 
runs,
 
each
 
consisting
 
of
 
16
 
face-name
 
pairs
 
(display
 
duration
 
=
 
5.5
 
sec
 
for
 
each
 
pair),
 
interspersed
 
with
 
fixation
 
trials
 
(duration
 
=
 
0.5-12.5
 
sec),
 
yielding
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
64
 
face-name
 
pairs.
 
Following
 
encoding
 
with
 
a
 
5-min
 
break,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
presented
 
with
 
3
 
types
 
of
 
face-name
 
pairs
 
(correct
 
face-name
 
pairs,
 
incorrect
 
face-name
 
pairs,
 
or
 
new
 
face-name
 
pairs)
 
inside
 
the
 
MRI
 
scanner
 
during
 
the
 
retrieval
 
phase.
 
There
 
are
 
4
 
functional
 
runs,
 
each
 
consisting
 
of
 
10
 
correct,
 
6
 
incorrect,
 
and
 
6
 
new
 
face-name
 
pairs
 
interspersed
 
with
 
fixation
 
trials,
 
yielding
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
88
 
face-name
 
pairs.
 
Accuracy
 
will
 
be
 
measured
 
as
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
right
 
responses
 
(e.g.,
 
Figure
 
4
 
face-name
 
pairs
 
B-D)
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
face-name
 
pairs
 
shown
 
during
 
the
 
retrieval
 
phase.
 
We
 
created
 
8
 
versions
 
of
 
the
 
face-name
 
tasks.
 
Our
 
pilot
 
data
 
from
 
20
 
healthy
 
adults
 
indicated
 
excellent
 
parallel-forms
 
reliability
 
across
 
the
 
8
 
test
 
versions
 
(ICC
 
=
 
0.93,
 
95%CI
 
=
 
[0.88,
 
0.97]).
 
The
 
administration
 
order
 
of
 
different
 
versions
 
will
 
be
 
randomized
 
across
 
the
 
participants.
 
The
 
score
 
of
 
the
 
FNAME
 
task
 
has
 
been
 
found
 
to
 
be
 
correlated
 
with
 
beta
 
amyloid
 
burden
7
,
 
reduced
 
hippocampal
 
volume,
 
and
 
APO
Ε4
 
carrier
 
status
 
in
 
cognitively
 
normal
 
older
 
adults
10
.
 
The
 
FNAME
 
task
 
is
 
sensitive
 
to
 
longitudinal
 
clinical
 
decline
 
in
 
MCI
11
 
and
 
in
 
those
 
at
 
genetic
 
risk
 
for
 
AD
12-14
.
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical
 
design
 
and
 
analysis
 
 
 
This
 
study
 
employs
 
a
 
parallel
 
group
 
design
 
with
 
2
 
groups
 
(active
 
TBS
 
and
 
sham
 
TBS)
 
and
 
3
 
primary
 
data
 
collection
 
time
 
points
 
(day1,
 
day
 
2,
 
and
 
day
 
3).
 
Participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomized
 
to
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
2
 
groups
 
using
 
a
 
randomization
 
scheme
 
stratified
 
on
 
age
 
(50-65
 
vs.
 
66-80)
 
and
 
sex.
 
For
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
FNAME
 
task,
 
a
 
linear
 
mixed
 
effects
 
model
 
will
 
be
 
fit
 
to
 
the
 
accuracy
 
scores
 
from
 
the
 
FNAME
 
task
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
change
 
in
 
accuracy
 
over
 
time
 
for
 
both
 
the
 
active
 
and
 
sham
 
TBS
 
groups.
 
The
 
model
 
will
 
include
 
fixed
 
predictors
 
for
 
time
 
(3
 
levels:
 
day
 
1,
 
day
 
2,
 
and
 
day
 
3),
 
group
 
(2
 
levels:
 
active
 
TBS
 
and
 
sham
 
TBS),
 
their
 
interaction,
 
age,
 
sex,
 
and
 
education.
 
A
 

random
 
intercept
 
per
 
participant
 
will
 
be
 
included
 
to
 
account
 
for
 
the
 
potential
 
correlation
 
among
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
same
 
participant.

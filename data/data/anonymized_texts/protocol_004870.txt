LEUKEMIA 
 
1.0 Objectives 
 
1.1 Primary : Compare the response rates of t wo schedules of decitabine in patients 
with AML 60 and older t han 60 and/or unfit for  standard cytotox ic chemotherapy. 
1.2 Secondary : Compare response durations, survi vals and side effects of the  two 
schedules. 
1.3 Tertiary :  To examine the correlation o f a number of biological and 
pharmacodynamics correlates with response to therapy including global and 
gene-specific methylation, specif ic somatic gene mutations, mic ro-RNA, and 
immune effector function 
2.0 Background 
 
2.1  The Disease – Ac ute Myeloid Leukemia in the elderly 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is  the most common form of acute l eukemia in adults in 
the US, with an inci dence of approximat ely 12,000 per year.1 The median age at diagnosis is 
65-70 and the incidence rises wit h increasing age with the age- adjusted incidence being 17.6 
per 100,000 and 1.8 per  100,000 in those ol der and younger than  65, respectively. This 
problem is not unique to the US with an increase in the inciden ce of AML in the older 
population worldwide, likely due to  an overall increase in life -expectancy, increased application 
and success of chemotherapeutic agent s and radiation therapy in  cancer patients, and 
perhaps an overall increase in environmental toxin exposure as a result of industrialization.  
2.1.1 Attitudes towards tr eatment of older patients  
Despite the high incidence of A ML in the older population, unti l recently, many of the 
trials in this disease had been conducted in the younger popula tion and much of the available 
data was inapplicable to them. Thi s reflected reluctance by bot h patients and physicians to 
expose the older patients to the toxic effects of anti-leukemic  therapy. Such under-
representation of pat ients 65 years and older  in cancer treatme nt trials has been well 
documented but is probably more o f an issue in acute leukemias where the chemotherapeutic 
regimens are generally more in tensive than in other tumors.2 Furthermore, clinical trials 
conducted in the older populati on have been generally biased du e to the exclusion of patients 
with poor performance st atus and co-morbid medical conditions. Using the linked Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medica re database, Menzin and colleagues 
retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of approximately 3500 el derly patients with AML.3,4 
They reported that only about a t hird of the patients received induction chemotherapy, ranging 
from 7% of patients ≥ 85 years of age to 49% of patients 65-74 years of age. Tr eatment rates 
increased during the decade of anal ysis, ranging from 29% to 38 % of patients diagnosed in 
    2012‐1017

1991 and 1999 respectively but the increased rates were confine d to younger patients (those 
65-74 vs. 75-84 years of age).4  Median survival across all st udy population was 2.4 months 
with fewer than 7% of patients al ive at 2 years further emphasi zing the dismal outcome of 
these patients in the community with current strategies. Howeve r, the authors also 
demonstrated that patients who di d receive therapy benefited fr om a prolongation of survival, 
be it modest.3  
Clearly the decision making proc ess in treating elderly patient s with AML has been 
highly influenced by the attit udes of patients and their physic ians and their expectations of 
success. Juliusson and colleagues, using the Swedish Leukemia R egistry data, retrospectively 
evaluated the outcomes of 506 patients aged 70-79 with AML (Acu te promyelocytic leukemia-
APL excluded) from 6 Swedish heal th regions with known differin g attitudes towards remission 
induction.5 Although the 5-year survival o f the overall 70-79 year old pop ulation in these 
regions was similar, the survival  of 70-79 year-old AML patient s was significantly better in 
regions were more elderly pati ents were judged eligible for rem ission induction.5  
In a more recent study, the same  investigators and using data f rom the same registry 
reported an improvem ent in early death rates and long-term surv ival among elderly patients 
who received induction chemother apy as compared to those who re ceived palliation only.6 
Furthermore, long term survivors  were found in the group given intensive therapy despite poor 
initial performance status.6 This has also been reported by a  number of other studies that have 
compared chemotherapy (intensive or non-intensive) to palliatio n.7,8  Lowenberg and 
colleagues randomized 60 patients with AML aged 65 or older to receive either immediate 
intensive induction chemotherapy  or palliative treatment with o nly mild cytoreductive 
chemotherapy only for relief of progressive disease.7 They demonstrated a higher complete 
remission (CR) rate (58% vs. 0 %), and a higher survival duratio n (21 vs. 11 weeks, p=0.15) in 
patients treated more intensively.7 Results from the non-intensiv e chemotherap y arm of the 
AML14 trial showed that median surv ival significantly improved with low-dose cytarabine (20 
mg twice daily for 10 days, every  4 to 6 weeks) compared with h ydroxyurea.8 CR occurred in 1 
of 92 (1%) patients in the hydr oxyurea treatment arm and in 15 of 92 (17%) patients in the low-
dose cytarabine arm. Benefits were  limited to patients who had intermediate-risk karyotype. In 
another earlier study, Tilly and  colleagues randomized 87 patie nts 65 years and older to low 
dose cytarabine (20 mg/m2 daily for 21 days) or intensive chemotherapy wit h cytarabine a nd 
an anthracycline.9 Overall survival and CR duration was similar for the two group s with 
significantly higher CRs as well as significantly higher early death and severe infections in the 
in the intensively treated group.9. Clearly and considering the results from the hitherto 
mentioned studies, this populatio n benefits at least modestly f rom receiving chemotherapy as 
opposed to palliation only. The dec ision regarding the intensit y of the chemotherapy 
administered remains one of the most debated issues in AML ther apy. It is also clear that 
although age per se is an important predictor of the outcome, o ther factors (covariates) 
influence it. The heterogeneity of pat ients labeled “elderly” i s clearly masked by terms 
commonly used to describe this population such as “ineligible t o undergo intensive 
chemotherapy”. It is also worth noting here that the estimation s of response to intensive 
therapy may be highly divergen t between the patients and their treating physicians, further 
complicating the process of decision-making.10 
2.1.2 Predictors of outcome in elderly AML  
    2012‐1017 
    May 24, 2017 
   P a g e   5 of 29 
Age per se has been repeat edly shown to be a ssociated with an i nferior outcome when 
considering fairly uniformly treated populations of patients (F igure 1a).11,12 In a study by the 
German AML co-operative group, 4 -year survival in those younger  and older than 60 years 
was 37% vs. 16% (p 0.001).12 It can be argued that age should be  considered as a continuum 
with no clear demarca ting age above and belo w which patient is considered elderly. However, 
for practical purposes, age ≥60 y ears is a commonly accepted cr iterion for defining elderly. 
Appelbaum and colleagues analyzed data from 5 Southwest Oncolog y Group (SWOG) clinical 
trials which inc luded 968 patients.11 Increasing age was associat ed with less favorable 
cytogenetics, poorer performance st atus scores, lower white blo od cell counts, and a lower 
percentage of marrow blasts.11 Increasing age was also associat ed with a higher incidence of 
early death after induction ther apy, a lower CR rate, and short er survival.11 However, among 
the older population, t hose with a poorer per formance status at  presentation had a very high 
early mortality an indication o f the interaction between covari ates. 
Other factors that are clearly imp ortant predictors of outcome include patient-related 
factors such as organ function , and presence of uncontrolled in fection, and leukemia-related 
factors such as biological det erminants of resistance to chemot herapy. Cytogenetics has been 
clearly established as one of the most important predictors of outcome in AML.13-15 16 Although 
the overall outcome of older pat ients with AML is inferior to y ounger adults, survival is 
generally improved for patients with favorable and intermediate  cytogenetic aberrations 
compared to those with adverse kar yotype. Recent data confirm t he importance of pre-
treatment karyotype on the outcome of older patients.17-20 In a report examining the prognostic 
factors in older patients tr eated on the MRC AML11 and AML14 tr ials, the survival was very 
much dependent on the cytogenetic ri sk. In another study by the  German-Austrian AML study 
group high risk cytogenetics and age above 70 years were indepe ndent prognostic factors 
affecting overall survival.19 Stratification using  these parameters ident ified a large subgr oup 
(55%) of patients wit h very poor outcome despite intensive chem otherapy. Whether pre-
treatment cytogenetics should be  factored in the choice of ther apy in older AML patients 
remains a subject of debate. As ty pically the result of this an alysis may not be available for up 
to a week, it can be argued that cytogenetics should not influe nce the initial decision making 
process in selecting therapy. How ever, a recent study by Sekere s and colleagues 
demonstrated that accounting for ot her covariates available at the time of diagnosis, in patients 
older than 60 years and with white blood cell (WBC) less than 5 0 x 109/L, time from diagnosis 
to initiation of therapy did no t affect CR rate or overall surv ival suggesting that this population 
may not be harmed from a delay t o obtain the results of additio nal testing.21 Others have also 
recommended waiting until the cyt ogenetic results are available .22 Obviously, this is highly 
dependent on the availability of t reatment strategies that are clearly superior to standard in 
particular cytogenetic subgroups or  the recognition that patien ts with specific characteristics 
such as those described by Ma lfuson and colleagues are unlikely  to benefit from standard 
induction regimens.22 
More recently, it has been repor ted that younger patients with normal karyotype can be 
further characterized by the absenc e or presence of specific mo lecular aberrations that can 
affect their outcome.23 Few studies have examined the role of these molecular abnormal ities 
and their influence on the outcome  of elderly patients with AML . However, in a recent study, 
the investigators fr om the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) reported that mutations in 
the nucleophosmin (NPM 1) gene were associat ed with a better pro gnosis in cytogenetically

normal older patients and in par ticular in those ≥ 70 years.24 Other predictors of a worse 
outcome in the elderly have been  identified. A higher incidence  of intrinsic drug resistance in 
the leukemic blasts, mediated  b y expression of multidrug resis tance glycoprotein MDR1 (and 
other efflux pumps that activ ely extrude chemotherapeutic agent s from leukemic cells), has 
been reported in older patients with AML and has been associate d with a lower CR rate and 
increased resistance.25 Similarly, presence of anteceden t hematological disorders such  as 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)  and myeloprolifer ative disorder s (MPD) as well as co-
morbidity are well-known predi ctors of a poorer outcome.26 
2.1.3  Choice of therapy  
Therefore, although th e outcome of treatment for the older pati ents with AML is 
generally inferior to that in the younger patients, it is possi ble to identify subgroups of patients 
based on their disease biology and clinical condition who are l ikely to fare better with the more 
intensive standard regimens. Pre vious studies of traditional ch emotherapy in selected older 
patients have reported re latively high CR rates.27,28  Indeed, it may even be possible to further 
Intensify the treatment in select ed older patient s as was demon strated in the study by 
Lowenberg and colleague in which a mong patients 60- 65 years a h igher dose of daunorubicin 
at induction (90 mg/m2 vs. 45 mg/m2) was associated with a hi gher CR rate (73% vs. 51%), 
event-free survival (29% vs. 14% ), and overall survival (38% vs . 23%).29 In the study by 
Pautas and colleagues usi ng either daunorubicin 80 mg/m2 daily x 3 or idarubicin 12 mg/m2 
daily for 3 or 4 days in additi on to standard dose cytarabine i n patients aged 50  to 70 years, 
the overall CR rate was 77%.28 However, in the majo rity of these studies there is a selection  
against patients with poor performance stat us and poor organ fu nction and, in some, patients 
with history of antec edent hematological diso rder such as MDS o r MPD are excluded. in 
general, strategies to improve th e efficacy of the traditional cytarabine plus anthracycline 
regimens have largely benefited  the younger patients with less adverse characteristics.29,30  
A number of risk scores have been developed that can be used to  identify patients less 
likely to benefit from the traditi onal cytarabine containing in duction regimens.17,18,22 Kantarjian 
and colleagues were able to divid e 998 patients wit h AML or hig h-risk MDS  ≥ 65 years to 
favorable, unfavorable and inte rmediate subgroups with differen t expectations of CR, 8-week 
mortality, and survival.17 It is potentially possible to u se these scoring systems to sel ect 
patients with a low ex pectation of CR and a high likelihood of early mortality with such 
regimens for clinical trials o f investigational agents designed  against specific molecular targets 
or drugs thought to be more tolerable and/or convenient.31  
 
2.2   The Treatment - Decitabine  (5 aza-2'deoxycytidine, Decita bine) 
Decitabine is a deoxycytidine analog which is phosphorylated to  its nucleotide and 
incorporated into DNA.  Once inc orporated, it covalently binds to DNA-methyltransferases and 
traps the enzyme thus acting as an irreversible inhibitor of DN A-methyltransferase.  
Decitabine produces marked DNA hy pomethylation (superior to aza cytidine in this effect) via 
inhibition of DNA methyltransferase.32-34  At high doses, decitabine appears to cause DNA 
synthesis arrest due to the format ion of a DNA/DNA-methyltransf erase adducts, which results 
in cytotoxicity and apoptosis. At l ow doses, minimal cytotoxici ty is observed, and treated cells 
exhibit marked reduction in DNA-m ethyltransferases activity, re duced overall and gene-

specific DNA methylation and r eactivation of silenced genes. Th is is associated with tumor 
suppressor gene activation, inducti on of cellular differentiati on, and inhibition of clonogenic 
growth of leukemic progenitors. 
 
2.2.1. Clinical Experience with  Decitabine at standard doses at  MD Anderson 
 
A phase 2 trial of Decitabine in a ccelerated phase (CML-AP) and  blastic phase CML 
(CML-BP) was completed at MD A nderson. Initially, patients were  treated at 100 mg/m2 q12h 
for 5 days (1,000 mg/m2 per course) but the dose had to be reduced initially by 25% and  
eventually by 50% because of pro longed myelosuppression.  In CM L-BP, a total of 42 
patients were treated, with a complete hemat ologic response see n in 5%, partial hematologic 
response in 5% and hematologic im provement in 19%, for a total response rate of 29%. In 
CML-AP, a total of 39 patients were treated. CHR was seen in 18 %, PHR in 38% and HI in 
8%, for a response rate of 62%. U nique features of decitabine i n this setting were:(1) a slow 
pattern of reduction of blasts, ( 2) a rapid rise in platelets f ollowing therapy, and (3) occasional 
responses late into therapy (afte r 2 cycles). These suggested t hat responses to decitabine 
might involve a differentiati on component, similar to what was observed with other 
differentiating agents in leukemia . A subset analysis of older (>50 years) patients in CML-BP 
showed that decitabine  therapy resulted in better survival than  historical controls treated with 
combination chemotherapy.35,36  
 
2.2.2 Clinical Experience with  low-dose Decitabine at MD Anders on 
 
Based on in-vitro data suggesting  greater hypomethylating activ ity at lower doses, a 
phase I biological study of decit abine was initia ted at MD Ande rson. To maximize the 
hypomethylating effects of dec itabine, multiple low dose schedu les in patients with 
relapsed/refractory myeloid ma lignancies were tried.  Initially , patients were treated at 5 
mg/m2 IV over 1 hour daily for 10 days (dose 30 fold lower than the r eported MTD). The dose 
was then escalated to 10, 15 and 20 mg/m2 daily for 10 days. Final ly, a group of patients 
received 15 mg/m2 daily for 15 days then 20 days. A  total of 48 patients were en rolled on the 
study. Responses were seen at all dose levels, but 15 mg/m2 appeared to induce the most 
responses, with no further benefi t for increasing the dose or d uration of administration. There 
were 9 complete remissions (CR 18%) and 7 partial remissions (1 4%), for a response rate of 
32%.  Responses were seen in refra ctory/relapsed AML (8/37=22%) , MDS (4/7=57%), and 
CML (4/5=80%). In some patient s who responded, there was a grad ual diminution of blasts 
over 2-4 weeks, and eventual rec overy of normal hematopoiesis a t 5-6 weeks, suggesting a 
non-cytotoxic mode of action for  this regimen. Response duratio n ranged from 2 months to 
10+ months. DNA methylation stud ies are ongoing, but preliminar y data suggests that 
hypomethylation of Alu repeats wa s associated with response. Th erefore low-dose decitabine 
is an effective agent in myel oid malignancies, and appears to i nduce remissions in part 
through demethylation  rather than cytotoxicity.  The effective low dose administration 
schedule derived from this phase I study is 15 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour daily for 10 days.37  An 
ongoing study of low dose decitabi ne in imatinib resistant CML is confirming the good 
response rate of this regimen. H owever, in patients in chronic phase CML, grade III-IV

myelosuppression is universal a t the decitabine dose of 15 mg/m2 daily x 10. There were no 
other non-hematologic serious side- effects attributable to deci tabine in the first 18 patients 
treated. Therefore, in the current  study in MDS we propose to r educe the total dose per 
course from 150 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 to avoid excessive myelos uppressive complications. 
 
2.2.3 Decitabine in Myelody splastic Syndrome (MDS) 
 
The standard for MDS therapy is hypomethylating agents, decitab ine and azacytidine. 
The experience with 5-azacytidin e indicated this to be the firs t non-transplant modality to 
affect MDS prognosis.38 Decitabine is a hypomethylating  agent similar to 5-azacytidine  and is 
more effective in vitro.  Intens ive chemotherapy is associated with CR rates of 40% to 60% 
induction mortality rates of 10%  to 40% and no improvement in M DS survival.38     
 
Azacytidine, another hypomethy lating agent, was given subcutane ously to 99 patients 
with MDS and  compared with obser vation (n=92); 67% had advance d-stage disease by FAB.  
The response rate on the treatme nt arm was 60%: 7% CR and 16% P R, 37% HI. This was 
compared to 7% HI with observa tion (p<0.001).  The median time to leukemic transformation 
or death was 21 months on treatm ent and 13 months on observatio n (p=0.007).  Median 
survival was 20 months for aza cytidine and 14 months for the co ntrols difference (p=0.1).  
Quality of life measures were higher for azacytidine.  Azacytid ine was relatively  well tolerated, 
although side effects included cytopenias and one treatment-rel ated death.  The results of this 
study appear to confirm a role fo r hypomethylating agents in th e treatment of MDS.38 
 
Several studies have shown the activity of decitabine in MDS. Z agonel et al. reported 
on 10 patients with adv anced MDS treated wit h decitabine at 45- 50 mg/m2/day administered 
for three days.  The response ra te was 50% (CR and PR).  The me dian CR duration was 11 
months (10-14+ months), and the median number of courses to CR was 2.39 Serious 
infections occurred in 40%, m arrow hypoplasia in 50%.39 
 
Wijerman et al. reported on 66 pat ients treated with decitabine  (16 intermediate-1, 25 
intermediate-2, and 25 high risk) .  Their median age was 68 yea rs.  Decitabine was 
administered at 45 mg/m2/day given as a four-hour infusi on every eight hours for three days.  
The response rate was 49%: 20% CR, 5% PR, and 24% improvement.  Median response rate 
was 39 weeks.  Median survival w as 15 months.  Normalization of  abnormal karyotypes was 
seen.  Infectious episodes were co mmon (27% fever, 20% infectio n, and 11% sepsis).40,41   
 
Wijermans et al recently updated  the results of 169 patients wi th MDS treated on 
multiple studies with decitabine 45-50 mg/m2 IV (continuous infusion, or over 4 hours Q 8 
hours) daily x 3 (135-150 mg/ m2 per course) every 4-8 weeks.42  The CR rate was 20%, the 
overall response rate was 50%, t he induction mortality was 8%.  The median response 
duration was 9 months ; the median survival was 15 months. There  was no difference in 
response rate by risk group. 
In a pivotal study, a total o f 170 patients wit h MDS were rando mized to receive either 
decitabine at a dose of 15 mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days (at 
    2012‐1017 
    May 24, 2017 
   P a g e   9 of 29 
a dose of 135 mg/ m2 per course) and repeated every 6 weeks, or best supportive car e.43 
Response was assessed using the  International Working Group cri teria and required that 
response criteria be met for at l east 8 weeks. Patients who wer e treated with decitabine 
achieved a significantly higher o verall response rate (17%), in cluding 9% complete responses, 
compared with supportive care (0 %) (P < .001). An additional 12  patients who were treated 
with decitabine (13%) achieved  hematologic improvement. Respons es were durable (median, 
10.3 mos) and were associated wit h transfusion independence. Pa tients treated with 
decitabine had a trend toward a l onger median time to acute mye logenous leukemia (AML) 
progression or death compared wit h patients who received suppor tive care alone (all patients, 
12.1 mos vs. 7.8 mos [P = 0.16]; those with International Progn ostic Scoring System 
intermediate-2/high-risk disease , 12.0 mos vs. 6.8 mos [P = 0.0 3]; those with de novo disease, 
12.6 mos vs. 9.4 mos [P = 0.04]; and treatment-naive patients, 12.3 mos vs. 7.3 mos [P = 
0.08]). Decitabine was found to be clinically effective in the treatment of patients with MDS, 
provided durable responses, and improved time to AML transforma tion or death. The duration 
of decitabine therapy may improve  these results further. This s tudy led to the approval of 
decitabine for patients with MDS.43 
In a more recent trial, we inve stigated the clinical and pharma codynamic results of 
different dose schedules of decitabine.44 Adults with advanc ed MDS or chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were randomized to 1 of 3 decita bine schedules: (1) 20 
mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days; (2) 20 mg/m2 subcutaneously daily for 5 days; and (3) 10 
mg/m2 intravenously daily for 10 days . Randomization followed a Baye sian adaptive design. 
Ninety-five patients were treat ed (77 with MDS , and 18 with CMM L). Overall, 32 patients (34%) 
achieved a complete response (CR), and 69 (73%) had an objectiv e response by the new 
modified International Working  Group criteria. The 5-day intrav enous schedule, which had the 
highest dose-intensity, was selec ted as optimal; the CR rate in  that arm was 39%, compared 
with 21% in the 5-day  subcutaneous arm and 24% in the 10-day in travenous arm (P < .05). 
The high dose-intensity arm wa s also superior at inducing hypom ethylation at day 5 and at 
activating P15 expression at da ys 12 or 28 after therapy. We co ncluded that a low-dose, dose-
intensity schedule of decitabine  optimizes epi genetic modulatio n and clinical responses in 
MDS.44 
2.3 Studies of Decitabine in AML 
We have previously investigated whether treatment with hypometh ylating agents (5-
azacytidine /decitabine) leads to  an improved outcome in patien ts with AML who are older 
and/or have adverse cytogenetics.45 Between January 2004 and Dece mber 2007, 81 patients 
(37 [46%] with AML [>or=20% bla sts]; 44 [54%] with high-risk MD S) with chromosome 5 and 7 
abnormalities were treated with hypomethylating agents as their  initial therapy. These included 
68 patients with complex (>or =3) abnormalities and 13 with <3 a berrations. During the same 
period, 151 patients (126 with AML, 25 with MDS) with chromosom e 5 and 7 abnormalities 
(128 complex, 23 noncomplex) wer e treated with intensive chemot herapy (including 
cytarabine-based regimens in 72% and other regimes in 28%). The  median ages for the 2 
groups were 66 years and 61 year s, respectively (ranges, 37-85 years and 19-89 years). 
Thirty-three (41%) patients in t he hypomethylating group achiev ed complete remission (CR)

versus 53 (35%) in the chemot herapy group (P=.395). With a medi an follow-up of 51 weeks 
(range, 12-101 weeks) and 40 wee ks (range, 5-128 weeks), 22 of 33 patients in the 
hypomethylating group  and 33 of 53 patient s in the chemotherapy  group had developed 
disease recurrence. The median CR  duration was 45 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively 
(P=.153). The overall survival was  superior for the hypomethyla ting group compared with the 
chemotherapy group (P=.019). The in vestigators concluded that t reatment with 
hypomethylating agents may be s uperior to chemotherapy in patie nts with chromosome 5 and 
7 abnormalities.45  
In a multicenter, phase II study , patients olde r than 60 years who had AML (ie, > 20% 
bone marrow blasts) and no prior t herapy for AML were treated w ith decitabine 20 mg/m2 
intravenously for 5 consecutiv e days of a 4-week cycle. Respons e was assessed by weekly 
CBC and bone marrow biopsy after cycle 2 and after each subsequ ent cycle.46 Patients 
continued to receive decitabine until disease progression or an  unacceptable adverse event 
occurred. Fifty-five patients (m ean age, 74 years) were enrolle d and were treated with a 
median of three cycles (range, o ne to 25 cycles) of decitabine.  The expert-reviewed overall 
response rate was 25% (complete response rate, 24%). The respon se rate was consistent 
across subgroups, including in p atients with poor-risk cytogene tics and in those with a history 
of myelodysplastic syndrome. The overall median survival was 7. 7 months, and the 30-day 
mortality rate was 7%. The most c ommon toxicities were myelosup pression, febrile 
neutropenia, and fatigue. The invest igators concluded that deci tabine given in a low-dose, 5-
day regimen has activity as upfro nt therapy in older patients w ith AML, and it has acceptable 
toxicity and a lo w 30-day mortality.46 
In another phase II clinical trial with decitabine in older pat ients (>or=60 years) with 
previously untreated AML who were not candidates for or who ref used intensive 
chemotherapy, subjects received low-dose decitabine at 20 mg/m2 i.v. over 1 h on days 1 to 
10. Fifty-three patients were enr olled with a m edian age of 74 years (range, 60-85).47 Nineteen 
(36%) had antecedent hematologic d isorder or therapy-related AM L; 16 had complex 
karyotypes (>or=3 abnormalities) . The complete remission rate w as 47% (n = 25), achieved 
after a median of three cycles  of therapy. Nine additional subj ects had no morphologic 
evidence of disease with incompl ete count recovery, for an over all response rate of 64% (n = 
34). Complete remission was achieved in 52% of subjects present ing with normal karyotype 
and in 50% of those with complex  karyotypes. Median overall and  disease-free survival 
durations were 55 and 46 weeks, r espectively. Death within 30 d ays of initiation of treatment 
occurred in one subject (2%), dea th within 8 weeks in 15% of su bjects. They also examined 
the relationship of clinical res ponse and pretreatment level of  miR-29b, previously shown to 
target DNA methyltransferases. H igher levels of miR-29b were as sociated with clinical 
response (P = 0.02). They concl uded that this schedule of decit abine was highly active and 
well tolerated in this poor-risk cohort of older AML patients a nd suggested that levels of miR-
29b should be validated as a predi ctive factor for stratificati on of older AML patients to 
decitabine treatment.47 
Most recently a multicenter, r andomized, open-label, phase III trial compared the 
efficacy and safety of decitabine with treatment choice (TC) in  older patients with newly 
diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia  (AML) and poor- or intermediat e-risk cytogenetics.48 
    2012‐1017

   P a g e   11 of 29 
Patients (N = 485) age ≥ 65 y ears were randomly assigned 1:1 to  receive decitabine 20 mg/m2 
per day as a 1-hour intravenous inf usion for five consecutive d ays every 4 weeks or TC 
(supportive care or cytarabine 20 mg/m2 per day as a subcut aneous injection for 10 
consecutive days every 4 weeks) . The primary end point was over all survival (OS); the 
secondary end point was the comple te remission (CR) rate plus t he CR rate without platelet 
recovery (CRp). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. The primary  analysis with 396 deaths 
(81.6%) showed a nonsignificant  increase in median OS with deci tabine (7.7 months; 95% CI, 
6.2 to 9.2) versus TC (5.0 mont hs; 95% CI, 4.3 to 6.3; P = .108 ; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% 
CI, 0.69 to 1.04). An unplanned analysis with 446 deaths (92%) indicated the same median OS 
(HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99;  nominal P = .037). The CR rate  plus CRp was 17.8% with 
decitabine versus 7.8% with TC ( odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to  4.8; P = .001). Adverse events 
were similar for decitabine and cytarabine, although patients r eceived a median of four cycles 
of decitabine versus two cycles o f TC. The most common drug-rel ated AEs with decitabine 
were thrombocytopenia (27%) and neutropenia (24%). Therefore, i n older patients with AML, 
decitabine improved response rate s compared with standard thera pies without major 
differences in safety. An unplann ed survival analysis showed a benefit for decitabine, which 
was not observed at the time  of the primary analysis.48 
 
2.4 Study Rationale 
 
The current standard dose for dec itabine in MDS and AML is 20 m g/m2 daily x 5 days. A 
study conducted by the Ohio State  University has produced signi ficantly higher response rate 
when an extended schedule of decitabine 20 mg/m2 daily x 10 days was used. The objective of 
the study is to demonstrate w hether this extended 10 day schedu le is superior compared to 
the standard 5 days schedule in p roducing responses and at leas t comparable with regards to 
toxicity and response duration.

3.2 Mode of Action:   Hypomethylation of DNA followed by stimulation of gene 
expression and cell differentiati on. Inhibits DNA methyltransfe rase. Targets for latter 
mechanism are selected genes silenced by DNA methylation. Inhib its DNA synthesis 
 3.3 How Supplied:   Decitabine is supplied as a l yophilized white to almost white , 
finely crystalline, odorless powder  for injection in 20mL vial glass vials, containing 50 mg of 
decitabine, monobasic potassium phosphate, and sodium hydroxide . 
 3.4 Preparation:    When reconstituted with 10 mL o f sterile water for injection  each 
mL will contain 5 mg of decitabi ne, 6.8 mg of KH2PO4, and appro ximately 1.1 mg NaOH.  
The pH of the resulting solution is 6.5 - 7.5.  
 The reconstituted solution can be further diluted to a concentr ation of 1 mg/mL or 0.1 
mg/mL in cold infusion fluids (0. 9% Sodium Chloride Injection U SP, 5% Dextrose in Water 
Injection, USP, or Lactated Ringer's Injection USP). 
 3.5  Storage and Stability:   Vials should be stored at 25°C (77°F); excursions 
permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F  to 86°F). After reconstitution,  use decitabine within 15 
minutes. If diluted with cold (2 °C to 8°C) fluids, the diluted solution is stable fo r up to 7 hours if 
stored between 2°C and 8° C (36°F to 46°F).  
 
Reconstitution and dilution of t he powder for injection (with 1 0mL of sterile water for 
injection) results in a rapidl y decomposing solution. The conce ntration of decitabine in the 
reconstituted and diluted soluti on decreases about 10 % after 4  hours at 25°C or about 10% 
after 24 hours at 4°C. Since 10%  is the maximum allowable decom position, and the solution 
will also decompose during adminis tration (infusion), the solut ion should be prepared just prior 
to administration. If this is no t possible the solution should be prepared at least twice a day 
and kept in a refrigerator (2-8° C) until administration. Furthe rmore, the solution should be 
prepared only with cold infusion  fluids at a temperature of 2-8 °C; (36-46°F). This solution can 
be infused over a maxim um period of 3 hours. 
 
3.6  Route of Administration: Intravenous  
 
3.7 Precautions 
 
Drug handling precautions  will be strictly followed. Skin conta ct with the solution should 
be avoided and protective glove s should be worn. Drug spilling can be inactivated by 2 M 
sodium hydroxide solution. The skin should be treated with a bo rax buffer solution pH 10 and 
after that thoroughly was hed with water and soap. 
 
3.8 Drug supply and distribution:  Decitabine will be obtained from commercial 
source.

5.0 Therapy 
 
5.1 Protocol registration: 
 
All patients will be r egistered through the Protocol Data Manag ement System 
(PDMS) or Clinical Oncology R esearch (CORe).  The study chairma n must be notified 
before any patients are registered.   
 
5.2 Therapy 
  
The initial Decitabine courses should be given at MD Anderson C ancer Center (or Regional 
Cancer Centers), either as in-pat ient or as out-patient. Decita bine will be dosed based on 
actual body weight. However, at t he treating physician’s discre tion an adjusted body weight 
may be used, if actual body weigh t is >40% over ideal body weig ht. Adjusted body weight = 
((Actual body weight – Ideal body  weight) 0.4) + Ideal body wei ght. Decitabine may be 
subsequently administered at any  of the Regional Cancer Centers  (RCC) or at the patients’ 
local oncologist offices.  Pat ients will be assigned in a selec tive Bayesian design to one of two 
treatment arms.  
 
1)  Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily x 5. 
2)  Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily x 10. 
  Start at dose level 0 as shown below. There will be no dose esc alation of Decitabine.

   P a g e   15 of 29 
 
Patients will receive one course  every 4-8 weeks; however delay s of more than 8 
weeks may be allowed if determi ned by the investigator to be in  the best interest of the 
patient after discussion with t he PI and the discussion documen ted in the patient’s medical 
record.  Doses may be given as  close as 8 hours apart if approv ed by the PI.  If prolonged 
aplasia and/or a major infecti on is seen, may decrease 1 dose l evel after marrow 
regeneration. This will be rounded  to the following daily lower  dose (15, 10, 7.5, 5 mg/m2). 
Otherwise continue at the same dos e level every 4-8 weeks depen ding on recovery of 
counts and disease status.  If persistent diseas e, start next c ourse regardless of counts.  If 
marrow complete response is ach ieved with adequate cellularity,  start subsequent courses 
when granulocytes > 0.75 x 109/L and platelets > 50 x 109/L. 
 
Patients on the 10 day r egimen will receive 5 day dosing after achieving CR during 
consolidation/maintenance. The 5 day dosing may also be initiat ed in these patients after 
the first course, if it is though t to be in the best interest o f the patient after discussion with 
the PI and the discussion documen ted in the pati ent’s medical r ecord. Patients on the 5 day 
regimen will continue to receive  the 5 day regimen after the fi rst course whether in CR or 
not. 
 Modifications of dose schedule or dose level other than above a re allowed if felt to be 
in the patients best interest to optimize response or reduce to xicity.  These decisions should 
be documented in the pati ent’s medical record.

5.3 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment dela ys due to clinically significan t study drug related 
adverse events, treatment may  continue until one of the followi ng criteria applies: 
 
 Relapsed or clinically signific ant progressive disease; no res ponse after > 3 courses.  
Patients may continue therapy as long as they have stable disea se, as long as it is 
determined to be in the best i nterest of the patient. 
 
 Intercurrent illness that prev ents further administration of t reatment, 
 
 Patient decides to wit hdraw from the study, or 
 
    2012‐1017 
    May 24, 2017 
   P a g e   16 of 29 
 General or specific changes in  the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the j udgment of the investigator. 
 
 Up to a total of 24 courses of therapy; about 2 to 3 years. 
 
a. Patients who show no evidenc e of life-threatening infection or hemorrhage, or 
less than grade 2 clinically sig nificant drug related non-hemat ologic toxicity (vomiting 
included) may be given a subs equent course at the same dose as the previous course. If 
clinically significant drug-re lated grade 2 toxicity is observe d, the patient must have 
recovered to grade <1 before in stitution of the next course.  I f patients have clinically 
significant drug-related grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity, th ey may receive a subsequent 
course at one reduced dose level after resolution of toxicity t o < grade 1. 
 
b. Patients with a response (def ined under section 10.0) and pr e-course counts of 
granulocytes >109/L and platelets >50 x 109/L who have sustained low counts of 
granulocytes <0.5 x 109/L or a platelet count <30 x 109/L for more than 2 consecutive weeks 
in the current cycle, may recei ve a subsequent course at 1 dose  level reduction.  A reduction 
of 2 dose levels may be consid ered if the myelosuppression was deemed severe and life 
threatening by the treating physi cian, and if it is in the pati ent's best interest. 
 c. Patients may receive further  courses of therapy not earlier than 4 weeks from 
the previous course, provided the patient has recovered from my elosuppression considered 
to be related to chemotherapy. Pat ients with rapid increase in blasts may start additional 
therapy before 28 days from sta rt of the previous course. 
 d. A minimum of 1 full course ( or 4 weeks from the start of the rapy) will be 
required for a patient to be cons idered as having received an a dequate trial to evaluate 
efficacy.  All patients receivi ng at least one dose of decitabi ne will be considered evaluable 
for toxicity.  Patients achiev ing a partial res ponse or with st able disease may continue on 
therapy until definit e evidence of disease progression. 
 e. Patients who achieve CR or CRi  may be treated with addition al courses of 
decitabine every 4-8 weeks or l onger if approved by the PI.  Th e dose of decitabine can be 
adjusted down by one dose level for toxicity (see above). Patie nts may be taken off study or 
treated on other programs (e.g. bone marrow trans plantation) if  this is judged more 
appropriate for their therapy and overall outcome.  Delays of m ore than 8 weeks to 
subsequent course may be allowed if determined by the investiga tory to be in the best 
interests of the patient after discussion with the PI and the d iscussion documented in the 
patient’s medical record. Abnorma lities in chemistries includin g BUN, LDH (lactic 
dehydrogenase), alkaline phosphata se, magnesium, glucose, phosp horus, calcium and 
electrolytes will not be reported as adverse events.  These are  indications of disease process 
and not of toxicity, therefore c linically insignificant.  Delay ed recovery in patients post CR is 
common in MDS and AML not associat ed with significant clinical complications such as 
bleeding or infections.  Therefor e, delayed myelosuppression af ter a course in CR will be

reported as ADR only i f platelets < 20 x 109/L or granulocytes < 0.5 x 109/L 6 weeks after 
completion of treatment.  
5.4 Concomitant medications  
 
GCSF or other growth factors ar e permitted on therapy only as p er ASCO guidelines.  
Use of hydroxyurea with rapidly pr oliferative disease is allowe d for the first two weeks on 
therapy.   
6.0 Correlative studies 
 
One of the goals of this protocol is to measure the biological effect of epigenetic 
therapies.  Several correlative l aboratory studie s will be carr ied an attempt to assay the 
biological effect of decitabine .  Patient samples including per ipheral blood and bone marrow 
will be collected prior to, dur ing and after completion of trea tment. 
 
6.1 Gene-mutations effecti ng methylation machinery 
  
Mutations of several genes believ ed to be important in the meth ylation apparatus of the 
cell have been recently described  in patients with acute myeloi d leukemia (AML) but their 
presence has not been correlated with a worse or better outcome  using hypomethylating 
agents. We have previously evaluat ed the association of mutatio ns in IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A , 
and EZH2  with the outcome [complete resp onse (CR) rate, event free surv ival (EFS) and 
overall survival (OS)] among patients older th an 60 with AML (≥  20% blasts) treated with 
hypomethylating agents as their  first line of treatment. TET2  mutations were not evaluated due 
to lack of available material . Among the 68 patients (median ag e 72 years; range, 60 – 83) with 
available data, 11 patients (16%) had IDH1  or IDH2  mutations (mutually  exclusive) and 10 
patients (15%) had DNMT3A  mutations with 5 pati ents (7%) having both IDH and DNMT3A  
mutations. Cytogenetics was diploi d in 19 (28%), abnormal chrom osome 5/7 and/or complex in 
27 (40%), trisomy 8 in 5 (7%),  miscellaneous in 14 (21%), and i nsufficient in 3 (4%). Presence 
of IDH mutations was associated with a di ploid karyotype and the prese nce of NPM1 
mutations (p=.03 and p=.02, r espectively) but not with FLT3- ITD or RAS mutations (present in 
7 and 4 patients, respectively). DNMT3A  mutations were not associ ated with any specific 
karyotype or with the presence of NPM1 , 
FLT3 -ITD, or RAS mutations. None of the 68 patients 
had EZH2 mutations. All patients were tr eated with hypomethylating agent s [decitabine in 39 
(57%) and 5-azacytidine in 29 (43%)] with 42  patients (62%) rec eiving concomitant histone 
deacetylase inhibitor therapy (SAH A or valproic acid). Overall,  17 patients (25% ) achieved CR; 
the presence of IDH or DNMT3A  mutations or both was not asso ciated with achievement of 
CR.  With a median duration of foll ow-up of 60 m onths, the medi an EFS is 3.3 months (range, 
0.25 – 3.75 months) a nd the median overall survival is 6 months  (range, 0.25 – 90.5 months). 
Presence of IDH mutations was not associated wit h an impact on EFS (p=.29) or O S (p=.14). 
Similarly, DNMT3A  mutations were not associated wit h an effect on EFS (p=.21) or  OS 
(p=.58). The presence of both IDH and DNMT3A  mutations was also not associated with a 
better or worse response, EFS, o r OS as compared with patients with neither mutation. We 
    2012‐1017 
    May 24, 2017 
   P a g e   18 of 29 
were unable to detect an associ ation between presence of IDH1/2  and DNMT3A  mutations 
and outcome in this elderly popula tion of patients with AML tre ated with epigenetic modulators. 
In this study we propose to eval uate the potential effect of mu tations of 1DH1, IDH2, 
DNMT3A, TET2, EZH2 and other genes  believed to be in the DNA me thylation program 
prospectively by assessing the pat ients for the presence of the se mutations prior to the 
initiation of therapy. We will also  examine follow-up samples t o determine if the leukemic blasts 
harboring these genes re main after therapy.  
Using more sophisticated assessm ents of gene panels and whole e xome sequencing 
we will expand this prospective  evaluation and will determine i f certain gene signatures are 
associated with response. 
We will also evaluate the levels  of 2-hydroxyglutarate in patie nts with DNMT3A mutation 
and will determine if there is any  association with response to  therapy and outcome. 
 
6.2  Gene specific methylation.  
 
The proposed mechanism of action of hypomethylating agents such  as decitabine is 
through their action against DNA met hyltransferase enzymes resp onsible for methylation of 
promotor regions (and hence sil encing of) genes responsible for  differentiation. We will 
examine this hypothesis though t he examination of gene-specific  and global methylation of 
the leukemic cell genome pre and post therapy. Quantitative met hylation analysis of the p15 
promoter and other genes, inclu ding Alu element s will be perfor med using "COBRA" analysis 
(Combined Bisulfite and Restrict ion Analysis).  This technique takes advantage of the ability 
of bisulfite to selectively conv ert cytosine to uracil, but wit hout affecting 5-methylcytosine.  
Thus DNA can be treated with bisu lfite, amplified by PCR, and t he PCR product digested 
with restriction enzymes which  will quantitatively assess gene specific methylation depending 
on the converted DNA sequence. 
 6.2.1 Assessment of genome wide methylation.  Total genome DNA methylation 
can be measured using high pressure liquid chromatography and a ssaying directly for 5-
methylcytosine.  This technique however requires large amounts of DNA sample 
(approximately 50ug). 
 Therefore COBRA an alysis described above will be used to assess  methylation of 
genes and Alu repetitiv e elements in the patient samples.  Alu elements are short DNA 
repeats which litter the genome.  I t is estimated that there ar e one million Alu's in the human 
genome.  These elements are also heavily methylated, and theref ore allow the opportunity to 
simultaneously study demethyla tion of one million sites in the genome rather than a single 
gene. 
 
6.3 Micro-RNA analysis 
 
As mentioned previously, higher l evels of miR-29b were associat ed with clinical 
response. We will evaluate this prospectively by analyzing pre- treatment bone marrow 
samples for the relevant micro-R NAs in collaboration with the l aboratory of Dr . George Calin.

6.4 Assessment of immune func tion and effector cells 
 
The role of an intact immune effector cell function towards res ponse and eradication of 
minimal residual disease will be evaluated in collaboration wit h Dr. Katy Rezvani’s laboratory. 
Immune suppression is an unavoidab le consequence of current the rapeutic modalities and is 
associated with significant mor bidity and mortality due to oppo rtunistic infections.  We have 
developed sensitive la boratory methods that  allow the study of immune subset recovery (T cell, 
B cell and NK cell recovery).  At this time, careful studies of  immune recovery are not routinely 
performed in subjects with AML u ndergoing treatment with decita bine.  Such studies would allow 
us to better understand the effect s of the drug on the recovery  of immune function in AML50-53.  
We propose to systematically collect specimens of blood, bone m arrow and plasma from 
patients with AML undergoing ther apy with decitabine.  Samples may be collected prior to 
initiation of therapy, at the time of achieving complete remiss ion and suspected relapse and prior 
to every 3rd or 4th cycle of therapy; Omissions will not be considered as violatio ns.  Assays to be 
performed may include the follo wing:  1) T cell immunophenotypi ng (to define the recovery of T 
cell subsets associated with a “naïve” or “memory” T cell pheno type); 2) Functional studies of 
antigen-specific T cell respons es to pathogens and to leukemia- associated antigens (e.g., to 
defined epitopes that have been i dentified as potential maligna ncy-specific targets);1,2,3 3 )  
Studies examining the molecular diversity of the T cell reperto ire;5 4) Assays of plasma levels of 
cytokines (e.g., interleukin-7) that may be important in T cell  reconstitution; 5) Studies to assess 
the role of other immune subs ets involved in anti-pathogen and anti-leukemia responses 
including natural killer (NK) cells, B lymphocytes, antigen pre senting cells (e.g. dendritic cell 
subsets) and subsets involved in immunoregulatory pathways such  as macrophages and 
myeloid derived suppressor cells; 6) Molecular studies will be performed on total RNA or DNA 
extracted from PBMC to assess the role of immune-related genes in treatment outcome 
(infection and relapse). Some or  all of these studies may be pe rformed at the time  of collection.  
In most cases, cryopreserved PBMC or plasma samples will be use d for these assays.  
Cryopreserved cells in excess of  requirements for studies of im mune reconstitution will be 
banked to allow access of other i nvestigators to these specimen s.

11.0 Statistical Considerations 
 
11.1 General description 
    2012‐1017 
    May 24, 2017 
   P a g e   22 of 29 
 
This is a Phase II open-lab el, efficacy and toxicity study of t wo treatment arms (arm A: 
Decitabine 20mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days versus  arm B: Decitabine 20mg/m2 IV daily for 10 days) in 
subjects with AML > 60 or unfit for standard cytotoxic chemothe rapy.  Patients will be enrolled to 
evaluate the 2 dose schedules . For both arms, one course will c onsist of 4 weeks. An adaptive 
randomization design will be emp loyed to compare the efficacy b etween the two arms. The primary 
efficacy outcome is the complete response which is defined as t he complete remission (CR) or complete 
remission with incomplete recove ry (CRi) assessed after three c ycles. At the end of the trial, we will 
estimate the probability that one arm is superior to the other.  We will also evaluate toxicity on each arm. 
A maximum of 100 patients will be  accrued, at an expected accru al rate of 5 patients per month. 
 
11.2 Randomization 
 
The Department of Biostatistics  will provide and maintain a web site (“Clinical Trial Conduct”:  
https://biostatistic s.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct/) for  patients enrolled on this study. The 
Clinical Trial Conduct website re sides on a secure server, and access is gained through usernames and 
passwords provided to personnel responsible for enrolling patie nts and updating pa tient data.  The 
website is accessed through a brow ser using secure socket layer  (SSL) technology. Personnel 
responsible for enrolling patient s on trials, which includes th e principal investig ator(s), research 
nurse(s), and data coord inator(s), will be t rained by members o f the Department of Biostatistics 
(specifically the statistical c ollaborators on the study) in th e use of the trial website; the importance of 
timely updating of follow-up times  and recording of events will  be emphasized in training. 
 
11.3 Study Design 
 
A maximum of 100 patients will be a daptively randomized into tw o treatment groups: 
       Arm A:   Decitabine 20mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days 
      Arm B:   Decitabine 20mg/m2 IV daily for 10 days 
Patients will be assigned to recei ve different schedules of Dec itabine, using an adaptive 
procedure that bases assignme nt probabilities  on observed resul ts in preceding patients. At first, 20 
patients will be assigned to eac h arm with equal probability. A s efficacy data accrues, patient 
assignment to the two arms will  become unbalanced in favor of t he one that has the higher complete 
response rate (RR). The RR for both arms will be estimated with  a 95% CI (similar to Bayesian highest 
posterior density interval).
49 
 Based on previous studies, we e xpect a RR of about 30% in both arms. Therefore, we assume RR 
has a prior Beta distribu tion (0.6, 1.4) with mean 0.3. Let RRa  and RRb denote the response rates for 
arm A and arm B, respectively. Beginning with the 21
st patient in each arm and for each subsequent 
patient, we will compare RRa with RRb, incorporating data from all patients with evaluable response. In 
order to avoid favoring one arm earlier in a large trial, inste ad of assigning patients with posterior 
probability (Pa=Pr(RRa>RRb|data) and Pb=1-Pa), we use the follo wing formula to assign patients: 
    2012‐1017 
    May 24, 2017 
   P a g e   23 of 29 
Aa=
Pb PaPa
,  Ab=1-Aa, where Aa is the prob ability of assigning patients t o arm A,  Ab is the 
probability of assigning patients to arm B, Pa is the posterior  probability that arm A is superior to arm B 
and Pb is the posterior probability that arm B is superior to a rm A. 
 
If at any point during the trial Pr(RRa>RRb|data)>0.95(or <0.05 ) the schedule A(or B) will be 
selected as superior . If accruing informa tion gives strong evid ence that a RR of 30% or greater is 
unlikely to be true for any one of  the treatment arms (Pr(RRa o r RRb>0.3|data)<0.05), assignment to 
that arm will be stopped. If the  maximum of 100 patients is enr olled and evaluated and 
Pr(RRa>RRb|data)>0.9 (or <0.1), we will declare that arm A(or B ) has a higher RR rate than arm B (or 
A). Otherwise, the trial will be i nconclusive. We used simulati on (5,000 simulations p er scenario) to 
evaluate the performance of the  adaptive randomization procedur e under several different scenarios 
(Table 2). Adaptive Randomiza tion version 4.1 has been used for  the simulation. Adaptive 
Randomization version 4.1 has been  used for the simulation. 
  
11.4  Toxicity Monitoring 
 
Evidence of Toxicity will be monitored closely in all patients.  For each arm, treatment will be 
terminated if Pr(non hematologi cal grade 3 or higher clinically  significant study drug related Toxicity 
>0.3 | data)  >0.95.  We assume P
E ~ beta (0.3, 0.7).  Table 1 shows the simulation of the trial.   The 
treatment will be stopped accrual if the number of patients wit h clinically signifi cant study drug related  
toxicities equal to or greater th an indicated (i. e., #pts with tox) among the number of patients accrued 
(i.e., #pts):  2/2, 3/3, 4/5,  5/7, 6/9, 7/11, 8/14, 9/16, 10/19 , 11/21, 12/24, 13/27, 14/29, 15/32, 16/35, 
17/38, 18/40, 19/43, 20/46, 21/49, 22/52, 23/54, 24/57, 25/60, 26/63, 27/66, 28/69, 29/72, 30/75, 31/77. 
Multc99 version2.1 has been used f or the simulation and boundar y computation.

11.5  Analysis Plan 
Data analysis will be performed using SAS or S-plus, as appropr iate. All patients will be included 
in the intent-to-treat analysis for efficacy.  Demographic and disease characteristics of the patients at 
registration will be summarized using descriptive statistics su ch as mean, standard deviation (SD), median 
and range. The RR for both arms will be estimated by Bayesian p osterior estimates, along with the 95% 
credible intervals. The posterior  probability that one treatmen t is better than the other will be computed, 
and the 95% credible interval of  the posterior probability will  also be estimated. The time-to-event 
variables will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. The surviva l difference between the two treatment 
sch ed u les  w ill  b e  co m pared  b y  L o g -ran k  tes t.  T h e O S  is  d e f in ed  as the time period from the start of 
treatment till death or last follow-up whichever comes first. D uration of response (DoR) is for the patients 
who achieve CR or CRi, and it is defined as the time between th e date of response confirmed (CR or CRi) 
and the date of progression or d eath (whichever occurs first). DoR will be censored on the date of last 
follow-up.

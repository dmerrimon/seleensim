SV25T5, and SV25T6) , ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +2.5 D Multifocal  
(Model SV25T0) . 
The ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL 
(Models  SND1T3/ SND1T4/ SND1T5/ SND1T6) is intended for 
primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for the visual 
correction of aphakia secondary to removal of a cataractous lens and 
pre-existing corneal astigmatism in adult patients with and without 
presbyopia, who desire near, intermediate , and distance vision, 
reduction of residual cylinder and incre ased spectacle independence.  
The lens is an ultraviolet and blue light filtering foldable multifocal  
toric IOL. The optical portion consists of a high refractive index 
material with proprietary blue light filtering chromophore which 
filters light in a mann er that approximates the human crystalline lens 
in the 400 -475 nm blue light wavelength range. In addition to 
standard UV absorption, the blue  light filtering chromophore reduces 
transmittance of blue light wavelengths. The optical portion is 
biconvex and consists of a soft acrylic material capable of being 
folded prior to insertion, allowing placement through an incision 
smaller than the optic diameter of the lens. The biconvex optic 
contains an aspheric apodized diffractive structure on the anterior 
surfa ce. After surgical insertion into the eye, the lens gently unfolds 
to restore the optical performance. The anterior surfaces of the 
ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL is designed 
with negative spherical aberration to compensate for the positive 
spherical aberration of the cornea. The toric posterior surface is 
designed to correct pre -existing corneal astigmatism. Alignment of 
the toric axis marks with the post operative steep corneal meridian 
allows the lens to correct pre -existing corneal astigma tism.  
The ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOLs 
(Models  SV25T3, SV25T4, SV25T5, and SV25T6) are intended for 
primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for the visual 
correction of aphakia secondary to removal of a cataractous lens and 
pre-existing corneal astigmatism in adult patients with and without 
presbyopia, who desire reduction of refractive cylinder and near, 
intermediate, and distance vision with increased spectacle 
independence.

Alcon – Business Use Only  The lens is an ultraviolet and blue light filteri ng foldable multifocal 
toric IOL. The optical portion consists of a proprietary high refractive 
index hydrophobic acrylic material with a blue light filtering 
chromophore which filters light in a manner that approximates the 
human crystalline lens in the 4 00-475 nm blue light wavelength 
range. The optical portion is biconvex and consists of a soft acrylic 
material capable of being folded prior to insertion, allowing 
placement through an incision smaller than the optic diameter of the 
lens. After surgical in sertion into the eye, the lens gently unfolds to 
restore the optical performance. The biconvex optic contains an 
aspheric apodized diffractive structure with a central refractive zone 
on the anterior surface and a toric posterior surface. The apodized 
diffractive structure divides incoming light to provide a range of 
functional vision (defined as visual acuity of 20/40 or better) from 
distance to near. The anterior surface of the ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  
+2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL Models SV25T3 through SV25T6 is 
designed with negative spherical aberration to compensate for the 
positive spherical aberration of the cornea. The toric posterior surface 
is designed to correct pre -existing corneal astigmatism. Alignment of 
the toric axis marks with the post operative ste ep corneal meridian 
allows the lens to correct p re-existing corneal astigmatism. The 
effects of this aspheric design feature have not been clinically 
assessed. Compared to other Alcon ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  
Multifocal Toric IOL models (Models SND1T3 to SND1T6),  these 
IOLs (Models SV25T3 to SV25T6) provide an alternate option for 
clinicians to offer patients with astigmatism with the near add power 
of +2.5 D, with optimal vision at 53 cm and greater distance 
dominance in the energy distribution between near and f ar. 
The ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +2.5 D Multifocal IOL (Model 
SV25T0) is intended for primary implantation in the capsular bag of 
the eye for the visual correction of aphakia secondary to removal of a 
cataractous lens in adult patients with and without presbyopia , who 
desire reduction of near, intermediate, and distance vision with 
increased spectacle independence.

Safety data set  
Safety set includes all eyes with attempted test article implantation (successful or aborted 
after contact with the eye). The safety set will be used for all safety analyses including the 
primary safety endpoint analysis. Modified safety se t includes all eyes with successful test 
article implantation. The modified safety set will be used for a sensitivity analysis of the 
primary safety endpoint.  
Primary Safety:  
The rate of post -surgical intraocular inflammation (based upon the specified case  
definition) reported within a 180 -day post -surgical period following attempted 
implantation of an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  Toric IOL  or ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR IOL  
(Cohort 2) in the US  will be estimated along with the exact two -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI). The event rate (per 1,000 IOL implants) is  
Total # of reported events / Total # of implants  1,000.  
A subgroup analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed by age group 
(22-64 years vs. 65 years or older). If both eyes of a subject are enrolled in this study, full 
follow -up information for both eyes will be used in the primary analysis. As sensitivity 
analyses, two cumulative event rates at 180 days and the corresponding two -sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided using Kaplan -Meier estima tor: 
• Full follow -up information for both eyes is used

Alcon – Business Use Only  • If a subject has a second cataract surgery within 180 days of the occurrence of the 
first cataract surgery, the follow -up for the first eye will be censored at the time of 
second surgery  
Secondary Safety:  
The rates of Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome, acute postoperative endophthalmitis , 
chronic postoperative endophthalmitis , and uncategorized cases of  post-surgical intraocular 
inflammation  (based upon the specified case definition), respectively, re ported within a 
180-day post -surgical period following implantation of ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  Toric IOL

Alcon – Business Use Only  Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)  Adverse event that led to any of the following:  
• Death.  
• A serious deterioration in health that either resulted in:  
• a life -threatening illness or injury.  
Note: Life -threatening means that  the individual was at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, ie, it 
does not include an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• any potentially sight -threatening event or permanent 
impairme nt to a body structure or a body function.  
• in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.  
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, 
or a procedure required by the clinical investigation plan, 
without serious deterioration in hea lth, is not considered a 
serious adverse event. In general, hospitalization signifies 
that the individual remained at the hospital or emergency 
ward for observation and/or treatment (usually involving 
an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate  in 
the physician's office or an out -patient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If 
a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other 
serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospitaliza tion” occurred, the event should be 
considered serious.  
• a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b).  
• any indirect harm as a consequence of incorrect diagnostic 
test results when used within manufacturer's instructions 
for use.  
• Fetal distress, fe tal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect.  
Subject Number  A number assigned to each subject who enrolls in the study. When 
combined with the site number, a unique identifier is created for each 
subject in the study.  
Unanticipated 
Serious Adverse 
Device Effect 
(USADE)  Serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity 
or outcome has not been identified in the risk analysis.

7.1 Background  
The ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL and ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  
+2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL are  intended to provide astigmatic cataract patients  with a range 
of near, intermediate and distance vision as well as correct the pre -existing corneal 
astigmatism by combining multifocal and toric optical designs. ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +3.0 
D Multifocal Toric IOL Models SND1T3 – SND1T6 were a pproved in the United States on 
22 December  2016.  The ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL Models 
SV25T3 -T6 were approved in the United States on 21 March  2017 . The ACRYSOF IQ 
RESTOR +2.5 D Multifocal IOL Model SV25T0 was approved in the United States on 13 
April 2015.  
Multifocal IOLs are designed to provide improved overall vision at near and intermediate 
distances when compared to conventional monofocal IOLs (Javitt 2000 , Chiam  2006 , 
Kohnen 2006 , Souza 2006 , Vingolo 2007 , Alfonso  2009).  Toric intraocular lense s correct 
aphakia as well as any pre -existing or surgically induced corneal astigmatism (Horn 2007 , 
Bauer 2008). This provides a benefit to patients due to freedom from spectacles for distance 
vision which is an important consideration when choosing an int raocular lens (Lane 2006 , 
Larendeau 2009).  
A summary of known and potential risks and benefits to humans, as identified in the literature 
or through preclinical testing and/or prior clinical evaluations, for each investigational 
product can be found in the Package Insert for the corresponding model.  
Risks associated with participation in the clinical investigation including risks associated with 
the clinical procedure are described in the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Information on 
alternative treatments t hat may be available to the subjects is also addressed in the ICF.  
7.2 Clinical Study  Design  
This is a prospective, multi -center, active surveillance post-approval  study  designed to 
estimate the incidence of post -surgical intraocular inflammation (based upon a specific case 
definition) in approximately 3,000 eyes that have been implanted with an ACRYSOF IQ 
RESTOR  Toric IOL or ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR Multifocal IOL   
 for up to 180 days. Active survei llance will 
be conducted through systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of all reported cases 
of post -surgical intraocular inflammation over 4 visits ranging from 1 to 180 days post 
implantation of the ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  Toric IOL  or ACRYSOF IQ  RESTOR IOL in the

commercial ly available in the United States . This study  will include adults (≥ 22 years of age) 
with pr eoperative cataract in the study  eye(s). Potential subjects will be screen ed for 
enrollment into the study . Those qualifying will be considered enrolled  in the study  at the 
time the informed consent form is signed , and attend a total of up to 1 1 visits.  The subject 
will be considered exposed to treatment at the time of surgery when the investiga tional 
product touches the eye.  
The study includes two groups of subjects (Cohort 1, and Cohort 2).  
Cohort 1: Subjects implanted from November 2018 through July 2020  with an ACRYSOF IQ 
RESTOR  +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL (Models SND1T3, SND1T4, SND1T5 , or SND1T6) 
or an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL  (Models SV25T3, SV25T4, 
SV25T5, and SV25T6)  in at least one eye.   
Note: At time of Protocol Amendment  7, Cohort 1 enrollment , is complete.  
Cohort 2: Subjects implanted after July 2020 with an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +3.0 D 
Multifocal Toric IOL (Models SND1T3, SND1T4, SND1T5 or SND1T6) or an ACRYSOF 
IQ RESTOR +2.5 D Multifocal IOL (Model SV25T0)  in at least one eye.   
Note:  This Cohort will include subje cts enrolled under Amendment 7.  
Interim reports pertaining to the progress of the post -approval study will be submitted to the 
FDA for review every six months  up to the first 2 years, or as requested, starting fr om the 
date of approval of the ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +3.0 D Toric intraocular lens, and will 
continue to be submitted annually thereafter until study completion.  
 
7.3 Rationale  for Study Design  
This study is designed in accordance with Alcon ’s agreement with the United States FDA, 
subsequent to approval of the ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL.

9.1 Outline of Clinical Study  
This is a prospective, multi -center, active surveillance post-approval  study, designed to 
estimate the incidence of post -surgical intraocular inflammation (based upon a specific case 
definition) in approximately 3, 000 eyes that have been implanted with an ACRYSOF IQ 
RESTOR  Toric IOL  or ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  IOL (Cohort 2)  for up to 1 80 days.  
9.2 Study Design  
The study will include adults (≥ 22 years of age) who plan to have cataract extraction and 
subsequent implantation of an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +3.0 D Toric Multifocal  IOL (Models 
SND1T3, SND1T4, SND1T5 or SND1T6) or an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +2.5 D Toric IOL 
(Models  SV25T3, SV25T4, SV25T5, and SV25T6) or an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +2.5 D 
Multifocal  IOL (Model SV25T0) in at least one eye. Potential subjects will be screened for 
eligibility and enrollment into the study . In Cohort 1, 706 eyes were im planted, and 
approximately 3600 eye s will be screened, to  identify 3300 qualified eye s in Cohort 2 . Within 
40 days of screening, qualified subjects will receive cataract surgery followed by 
implantation at the surgery visit with one of the study IOLs for t heir Cohort as follows:  
Cohort 1: Subjects implanted from November 2018 through July 2020  with an ACRYSOF IQ 
RESTOR  +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL (Models SND1T3, SND1T4, SND1T5 , or SND1T6) 
or an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL (Models SV25T3, S V25T4, 
SV25T5, and SV25T6)  in at least one eye.   
 
Cohort 2: Subjects implanted after July 2020 with an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +3.0 D 
Multifocal Toric IOL (Models SND1T3, SND1T4, SND1T5 , or SND1T6) or an ACRYSOF 
IQ RESTOR +2.5 D Multifocal IOL (Model SV25T0)  in at least one eye.   
 
If a second eye will participate in the study, subjects will receive the second eye cataract 
surgery within 60 days of the screening Visit 0 . Four postoperative follow -up visits are 
planned to occur at 1-2 days, 7-14 days , 30-60 days , and 90-180 days , for each enrolled eye. 
Subject  participation in this study is expected to last up to  7 months, including a total of 6 
study  visits for subjects implanted in one eye  and up to 11 visits for subjects implanted in 
both eyes.  Upon completion of the 180 days  follow -up visit, subjects will be exited from the 
study .

Discontinued subje cts who have been implanted or in whom implantation failed will not be 
replaced. Notification of a subject ’s early discontinuation should be made immediately to the 
Sponsor and documented on the appropriate eCRF.  
If a subject exits the study before complet ion of the final, planned study visit 
(Visit  4/Visit  4A), the Investigator should make reasonable attempts to have the subject return 
to the site to perform early exit procedures. Early exit procedures are all study procedures to 
be cond ucted at Visit 4/Vi sit 4A (see S ection 12.1.3).  
12.5 Clinical Study  Termination  
The Sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study in its 
entirety at any time, for reasonable cause. The Investigator also may terminate the study at 
his/her site  for reasonable cause. Reasons for the closure of an investigational site or 
termination of the study may include:  
• The Investigator fails to comply with the protocol or GCP guidelines  
• Safety concerns  
• Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the Investigator  
If the clinical study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor will inform the 
Investigator and the regulatory authorities (where applicable) of the termination/suspension, 
and the reason for the termination/suspension. The Investigator should pr omptly notify the 
IRB of the termination or suspension and the reasons.

13.1 General Information  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered 
a clinical study  treatment (ie, implant with an investigational device) regardless of whether or 
not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any 
unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the clinical study  treatment, whether or not related to the 
treatment. Below are Figures that categorize AEs and SAEs.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is an AE that led to any of the following:  
• Death  
• A serious deterior ation in the health of the subject that either resulted in:  
a) a life -threatening illness or injury.  
Note: Life -threatening means that the individual was at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred, ie, it does not include an event which 
hypothe tically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe 
form.  
b) any potentially sight -threatening event or permanent impairment to a body 
structure or a body function.  
c) in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.  
Note: Planned hospital ization for a pre -existing condition, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the individual remained at the hospital or 
emergency ward for observation and/or treatment (usually involving  an 
overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's 
office or an out -patient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or 
fulfills any other serious criteria, the ev ent is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospitalization ” occurred, the event should be considered 
serious.  
d) a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b) or any ocular 
secondary surgical intervention (excluding posterior capsulotomy).  
e) any indi rect harm as a consequence of incorrect diagnostic test results 
when used within manufacturer ’s instructions for use.  
• Fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
Any othe r potentially sight -threatening events may also be consi dered serious based upon the 
judgment of the Investigator and should be reported appropriately as delineated in 
Section  13.3.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of an investigational product (test 
article). This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for 
use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; any malfunction; and use error or 
intentional misuse of the test article.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect  
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an ADE that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a SAE.  
Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  
An anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is a SADE which by its nature, 
incidence, severity, or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report.  
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE) is a SADE which by its nature, 
incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the risk analysis report.  
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. This definition includes malfunctions, use 
errors, and inadequate labeling. Malfunction is defined as a failure of a medical device to 
perform in accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance with the 
instructions for use or clinical investigation plan. Use error is defined as an act or omission of 
an act that results in a different medical device response than intended by manufacturer or 
expected by user; this includes slips, lapses, and mista kes. An unexpected physiological 
response of the subject does not in itself constitute a use error.  
A device deficiency may or may not be associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); 
however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due to a device deficiency. The Inv estigator should 
determine the applicable category for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report 
any patient harm separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specificatio ns (eg, incorrect IOL powe r) 
• IOL defect  
• Broken IOL optic

• Scratched IOL optic  
• Unsealed device packaging  
• Suspect IOL contamination   
• Lack of efficacy  
Return any IOL  associated with a device deficiency  to the S tudy Sponsor. Refer to the MOP 
for information on return  of study  IOLs . 
13.2 Specific Events Relevant to this Protocol  
In addition to reporting all AEs meeting the above definitions, the Investigator must report 
the following AEs:   
Exacerbated intraocular inflammation as indicated by:  
• ≥ 3+ aqueous cell within the fi rst 14 days  post-op (collected on Visit 1 or  2 or at an 
unscheduled visit between  Visit  00 and Visit  2), and/or  
• ≥ 2+ aqueous cell ˃ 14 days and ≤ 60 days post -op (collected on Visit  3 or at an 
unscheduled visit between Visit  2 and Visit  3), and/or  
• ≥ 1+ aqueous cell ˃ 60 days post -op or later (collected on Visit  4 or at an unschedul ed 
visit between Visit 3 and Visit  4).  
Note: Cases of exacerbated intraocular inflammation should be categorized by the 
Investigator according to Section 8.4.2.  
Subject r eported symptoms should be assessed to determine if they meet the definition of an 
AE per  Section 13.1 of the protocol . Symptoms associated with an AE should be captured as 
part of the AE in the narrative as appropriate.  
13.3 Procedures for Recording and Report ing 
All AEs will be documented on the Adverse Event case report form (CRF) and collected on a 
routine basis at monitoring visits. Surgically -related postoperative conditions that are normal 
consequences of the ocular surgery and not clinically relevant wil l only be reported as 
adverse events at the discretion of the Investigator.  
In addition, the Investigator must document all ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies with 
details including the date of occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, an d 
assessments of the seriousness and causality. All available information must be submitted to

Alcon – Business Use Only  the study Sponsor immediately (ie, within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s knowledge 
of the event) as follows:  
• ADEs, SAEs, or device deficiencies must be  entered immediately into the EDC 
system.  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting should be updated in the 
EDC system as soon as it becomes available.  
Study Sponsor contact information is provided in the Manual of Procedures (MOP) .  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
Sponsor may request copies of applicable portions of the subject ’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could hav e led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
For every AE and device deficiency, the Investigator must assess the causality as Related or 
Not Related to the medical device or test p rocedure in the study. An assessment of causality 
will also be performed by a study Sponsor physician utilizing the same definitions, as shown 
below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE or device deficiency classified as related may be either definitely 
related or pos sibly related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the 
medical device or test procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a 
reasonable possibility that the AE or device deficiency was caused by the 
medical device or test procedure.  
Not R elated  An AE or device deficiency classified as not related may either be definitely 
unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (ie, there are other more likely 
causes for the AE or device deficiency).  
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the in tensity (severity) of the AE as mild, 
moderate, or severe, based upon medical judgment with consideration of any subjective 
symptom(s), as defined below:  
Document ID:

Alcon – Business Use Only  Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign o r 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
The Investigator must document any action taken (ie, medication, intervention, or treatment 
plan) and outcome of the AE or device deficiency when applicable.  
13.4 Unmasking of the Study Information  
Not applic able; this study is open -label.  
13.5 Follow -Up of Safety Information  
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study. Any additional data from these follow -up proced ures must be 
documented and available upon the study Sponsor ’s request.

applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been 
proces sed correctly.   
16.5 Subject C onfidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that the subject ’s anonymity is maintained throughout the 
course of the study. In particular, the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with 
confidential identifying information that c orresponds to the subject numbers and initials of 
each study participant. At the end of the clinical study, the Study Sponsor will collect a copy 
of the enrollment log without any identifying subject information . All documents submitted 
to the Study Sponso r will identify the subjects exclusively by number and demographic 
information. No other personally identifying information will be transmitted to the Study 
Sponsor.  
The Study Sponsor may release anonymized study data to external researchers for purposes 
of future research directly related to the study objectives, or future research that is beyond the 
scope of the current study objectives. The Informed Consent Form explains this to study 
subjects. Anonymization means that all identifiable information will b e removed from the 
dataset and all links to the subjects in the study will be removed. Anonymization of the data 
will maintain confidentiality of the subjects who participate in the study so that they cannot 
be identified by external researchers. The anony mized data set will contain records from all 
of the subjects in the current study, but the anonymization process might change the data set 
in some ways, so external researchers will be informed that they might not be able to 
duplicate some of the results f rom this study.  
16.6 Regulatory Documentation and Records Retention  
The Investigator is accountable for the integrity, retention and security of all study -related 
data. The Investigator must maintain accurate, complete, and current records relating to the 
clinical study. The Investigator must maintain the required records during the clinical study  
and for a period of time specified by local law or per the Clinical Study Agreement, 
whichever is longer. If the Investigator retires, relocates, or for any other reas on withdraws 
from responsibility of keeping the study records, the Sponsor must be notified and suitable 
arrangements made for retention of study records and source documents needed to comply 
with national and international regulations.

iv PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Evaluating the Feasibility of a Mobile Coac hing 
Intervention to Improve HPV Vaccine Delivery  
Summa ry:  
The pur pose of this study is to examine the feasibility of 
using Checkup  Coach, a mobile coaching intervention, to 
improve the way that primary care providers recommend 
HPV vaccination to adolescent patients and their  parents. 
To conduct this feasibil ity study, w e will deliver the 
Checkup Coach  intervention to Kaiser Permanente 
Washington primary care providers  who routinely 
recommend HPV vaccine to adolescent patients. We will 
use a  single -arm, pre- post design. Participating primary 
care providers will attend  a 1-hour virtual communication 
workshop and then use a mobile phone app to receive 
additional coaching for 12 weeks. P roviders will complete 
surveys at three time points: before the communication 
workshop, immediately after  the workshop, and at  12-week 
follow- up. Surveys will assess changes in providers' self -
reported HPV vaccine recommendation practices and 
beliefs  about  HPV vaccine , as well as the acceptability of 
the intervention. We hypothesize that providers' HPV 
vaccine  communicat ion will improve  between  baseline and 
12-week follow -up. 
Objectives:  
 To evaluate whether  the Checkup Coach intervention 
improves providers ’ HPV vaccine recommendation quality . 
Primary  outcome measure : The change in providers ’ 
composite score on a 5- item index of self -reported use of 
HPV vaccine communication practices from baseline to 12-
weeks post -intervention.  
Sample : Primary care p roviders who treat 11- 12 year old patients in 
participating Kaiser Permanente Washington pediatric and 
family medicine practic es. 
Phase:  Not appl icable  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
v Study Duration:  June 21, 2021 through January 14, 2022  
Participation Duration:  Providers will attend a one- hour communication training 
workshop and use the Checkup Coach mobile phone app 
at their discretion for 12 weeks . 
Description of 
Interventi on:  
The Checkup Coach intervention is  a 1-hour virtual 
workshop on HPV vaccine communication,  followed by 12 
weeks of access to a mobile app that provides additional 
coaching .

3 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND 
SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
 
HPV is a highly prevalent sexually transmitted infection associated with over 34 ,000 
cancers  in the US  each year.  The an nual cos t of screening and treatment for HPV -
related diseases totals $8 billion.  Widespread HPV vaccination could prevent the 
infections that lead to most of these diseases, making the vaccine a powerful tool for 
cancer prevention.  
 
Nation al recommendations are for the completion of the 2- dose HPV vaccine series at 
ages 11- 12. Timely completion is critical for protecting youth before HPV exposure and 
may enhance immune response.  On-time vaccination, however, is not the norm in the 
US, with coverage at just 39% for 13-year-olds in 2017.  This coverage is far below the 
Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% for ages 13 -15, and suggests that interventions are 
urgently needed to improve uptake.   
 
The present study seeks to improve healthcare providers ’ communication about HPV 
vaccine which  is critical to increasing uptake. A provider ’s recommendation is among 
the strongest predictors of HPV vaccination.  Adolescents who receive a high- quality 
recommendation versus none have over 9 times higher odds of ser ies initiation.  
Additionally, interventions that include provider communication training improve HPV 
vaccination  coverage.  
 
Mobile apps are a promising way to extend provider training. Most providers use mobile 
devices  professionally, and apps are an incr easingly common v ehicle f or provider  
educ ation. Whether app- based coaching could improve providers’ HPV vaccine 
communication is unknown. However, the approach has been successfully piloted in 
other contexts (e.g., crit ical care), suggesting promise.   
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
Our study seeks to evaluate the feasibility of Checkup Coach, a quality improvement 
(QI) coaching intervention, including a mobile app, that we have developed to deliver 
HPV vaccine communication training. At the provider level, Checkup C oach is designed 
to imp rove HPV  vaccine communication via ongoing assessment and tailored feedback. 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
4 At the clinic level, the app will provide  quality improvement  tools, including graphs  of 
clinics’ and providers’ HPV vaccine coverage  (i.e., % of patients v accinated) , for 
trackin g shared  goals for improvement. We will conduct this study to evaluate the 
feasibility of us ing the QI coaching intervention to i mprove HPV vaccine communication 
in primary car e settings. If successful, this study will inform the future development of a 
randomized  controlled trial to examine the impact of the Checkup Coach intervention on 
HPV vaccine up take.  
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1  Potential Risks  
Potential short -term risks associated with participation include healthcare pr oviders’ loss 
of time and slight risk of embarrassment  or discomfort in answering questions  about 
their HPV vaccine recommendation prac tices. However, because t he communication 
workshop is brief ( <1 hour) and app use i s discretionary , we expect loss  of tim e to be 
minimal.  Addition ally, provide rs will ha ve the option to refuse to answer any surv ey 
ques tions and can decline to use the mobile app. All answers to survey questions  and 
data entered into the app will be kept confidential. Thus, the risk of embarrassment is 
anticip ated to be very slight.  
We do not anticipate immediate or long- range risks associated with participation.   
2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
By participating in this study t here is  a potential to i ncrease provider knowledge and 
confidence for  recommending HPV  vaccina tion as a routine preventive service for 
adolescents . This study will also help inform a future larger randomized trial of the 
Checkup Coach intervention.  The goal of that trail would be to develop a quality 
improvement tool that w ill help increase  HPV vac cination coverage which could reduce 
the future incide nce of HPV -related cancers.   
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
5 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of using Checkup Coach, a QI 
coaching intervention,  to improve primary car e provid ers’ use of evidence- based 
communication  practices to support  routine HPV vaccination.  
3.2 Study Outcome Measures 
Outcome measures  will be  changes in provider s’ HPV vaccine recommendation 
practices a nd the feasibility of the Checkup Coach quality i mprovement intervention.  
Data will come from provider surveys at three time points  and mobile app usage  data.  
3.2.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
For each p articipating provider, we will assess the change in composite score on a 5-
item index of  self-reported HP V vaccin e recommendation quality from baseline to 12-
week post -intervention . Scores rang e from 5 -25 (5 indicating the lowest quality score to 
25 indicating the highest quality score).  
3.2.2  Other Measures  
We w ill assess the feasibility of the Checkup Coach intervention by evaluating:  
• Use of the Checkup Coach mobile coaching app (measured as % of providers  
who use the Checkup Coach mobile app, assessed using app an alytics; and 
measured as the mean number of times that app users  access the app, 
assessed using app analy tics). 
• Intervention acceptability  (measured as mean  ratings for intervention 
convenience , organization, helpful ness , and whether participants would 
recomme nd it to a colleague,  assessed using 5-point survey items) . 
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
6 4 STUDY DESIGN  
This study will evaluat e the Checkup Coach intervention using a single -arm, pre -post 
design  with approximately 20 primary care providers at Kaiser Permanente 
Washington (KPWA) . The intervention has two main components . In the first part of the 
interventi on, participants attend a communication training workshop  via a virtual 
conferencing platform . The w orkshop  will be conducted by study staff  and the KPWA 
Director of Preventive Care . The brief (<1 hour) workshop review s evidence on HPV 
vaccinatio n, model s guideline -consistent reco mmendation practices,  trains providers to 
address common parent concerns , and facilitates discussion of shared g oals for 
improving.  Workshop content is evidence- based and reflects communication practices 
supported by rese arch evidence and recommended by th e Centers for D isease Control 
and Prevention.  At the end of the workshop , providers are asked to download and 
practice using the Checkup Coach mobile app.  
In the second part of th e intervention, which starts after the co mmunication training,  
providers are  invited to use the Checkup Coach mobile app  for 12 weeks.  The app is a 
QI tool designed to  provide tips and tools for improving HPV vaccine communication. 
App functions include: (a) provider  self-assessment of HPV vaccin e recommendation 
practices ; (b) fee dback on  their HPV recommendation quality  in the form of a 
“recommendation goal score” ; (c) research- tested messages for addressing parent 
concerns  that are tailored to in-app self-assessments;  and (d) a dashboard with gr aphs 
of provider - and clinic -level HPV vaccination coverage ( i.e. % of 11-12 year old 
adolescents vaccinated).

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
9 6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
6.1 Study Intervention  Description  
 
The Check up Coach intervention offers two main components to primary care 
providers  who care for adolescent patients : a webinar com munication workshop  and 
use of the Checkup Coach mobile app.  
 
1. Communication Workshop. The Checkup Coach intervention begins with a 
brief (<1 hour), communication training workshop. Using a script and slides,  the 
KPWA Director for P reventive Care and the st udy PI  will meet with participating 
providers  over a web- based meeting platform  to: review evidence on HPV 
vaccination; model high- quality, guideline -consistent  recommendations; train 
providers to address parent concerns; and facilitate discussion of shared goals 
for improving.  
 
At the end of the training, providers will be asked to download and begin using 
the Checkup Coach app. Downlo ading and using the app will be voluntary, and 
providers can consent to participate in the webinar training but decline al l other 
study activities.   
 
2. Checkup Coach  app. Providers will be invited to use the Chec kup coach mobile 
app at their discretion for t he 12 week study period.  If they have push 
notifications enabled, p roviders will be sent push notifications remind ing them  to 
use the app up to six times over the 12 week period.  Providers will complete the 
in-app self-assessment s and receive tailored feed back every time they use the 
app. 
A detailed description of the Checkup Coach self-assessment and tailored 
feedbac k is as follows : 
 
• Self-assessment  of recommendation quality . Providers complete a very 
brief in-app self -assessment  to determine how often in the last week they 
used 5 practices effective for recommending HPV vaccine according to 
national guidelines. Guide lines include delivering recom mendations on 
time (i.e., ages 11 -12), consistently to all eligible patients, and offering 
same -day vaccination services when possible. The app adds 5- point 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
10 response options to give an overall score and to identify areas for 
improveme nt. 
• Recommendation Go al Score. The app displays a bar chart of providers’ 
overall self-assessed recommendation quality score in refere nce to the 
goal of 5 (i.e., “almost always” using all 5 practices).  
• Dashboard.  The app presents line graphs of aggregate HPV vaccination 
cover age (i.e., % of patients vaccinated) over the study period for both the 
individual provider and their clinic.  
• Tips for addressing HPV vaccine communication challenges . Providers 
complete an in -app 5-item self -assessment to identify par ent concerns 
they “of ten” or “almost always” find difficult to ease. The app pulls from a  
library of 1 5 messages to suggest a research- tested response tailored to 
each concern (called “ Tips for Talking to Parents” in the app). Those who 
indicate no  concern receive randomly s elected messages with 
encouragement to keep up their good work.  
6.2 Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Study  
Intervention  
Each  primary care provider will attend one com munication wor kshop which will last less 
than one hour . They w ill then be able to use the mobile app,  at their discretion, for up to 
12 weeks.

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
12 8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Hypotheses  
The Checkup Coach intervention will increase providers ’ HPV vaccine recommendation 
quality score.  
8.2 Sample  Size Considerations  
 
We will test our hypoth esis that Checkup Coach  will increase providers’ overall 
recommendation quality  over the 12- week study period with approximately 20 providers . 
We acknowledge that our trial is underpowered to detect small differences or control for 
multiple testing. T he purpose of a feasibility study is to estimate effect sizes for 
powering a large- scale RCT. By piloting our intervention in 5 or more  different clinic s, 
our study is designed to provide the data needed to lay this groundwork.  
8.3 Planned Interim Analyses (if applicable)  
Not applicable.  
8.4 Final Analysis Plan  
To assess change  in providers’ HPV vaccine  recommendation behavior , we will 
compa re providers ’ mean recommendation quality index scores  between baseline and 
12-week  follow- up using Wilcoxon signed- rank tests . To assess  changes in providers’ 
cognitions and perceptions of their social  environments, we will use Wilcoxon signed-
rank tests to compare  mean scores for each survey item and the knowledge index item 
(scores ranging from 1 -5) between the baseline and post -workshop  surveys and the 
baseline and 12 -week  follow- up surveys.

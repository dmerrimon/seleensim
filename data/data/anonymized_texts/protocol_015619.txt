CONFIDENTIAL4.0 OBJECTIVES
4.1 Primary Objectives
The primary objective of the study is: 
∀To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-906 in subjects with gastroparesis (GP).
4.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of the study are:
∀To assess the prolactin pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) relationship in
subjects with GP.
∀To demonstrate the effect of TAK-906 on 13C-Spirulina gastric emptying breath test (GEBT).
4.3 Exploratory Objectives
Exploratory objectives of this study are: 
4.4 Study Design
This is a randomized, double blind and open-label, placebo and active-comparator controlled 
trial to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD for TA K-906 in subjects with diabetes mellitus and 
gastroparesis (DG), or idiopathic gastroparesis (IG). The trial will consist of 2 parts and is 
designed to allow all enrolled subjects to participate in each part of the study, at the discretion of 
the investigator. Subjects may decline participation at any time during the study. 
In Part 1, approximately 48 subjects will be randomized into 1 of 3 active treatment arms (ie, 
orally [PO] TAK-906 maleate 5 mg twice da ily [BID], 25 mg BID or 100 mg BID) or a 
matching placebo BID arm in a double-dummy manner and a 1:1:1:1 ratio for 9 consecutive 
days, for a total of 17 doses (ie, BID Days  1 to 8 and morning dose on Day 9). Subject 
randomization w ill be stratified by the underlying condition, ie, DG versus IG. All trial drug 
dosing will be under fasted conditions. Gastrointestinal (GI) emptying will be evaluated 
following a test meal using a 13C-Spirulina GEBT, and GI emptying and motility will also be 
evaluated using SmartPill technology. Bl ood samples for assessment of TAK-906 concentrations 
will be collected at scheduled time points from predose on Day 1 to 48 hours after Day 7 dose. 
Blood samples for assessment of prolactin concentr ations in serum will be collected at Screening 
and scheduled time points from Day -2  to 48 hours after Day 7 dose.

CONFIDENTIALApproximately 18 subjects who completed Part 1 of the study (and following a minimum 7-day 
washout from the last dose in Part 1) will be enrolled into Part 2, the open-label period of the 
study. At the discretion of the investigator approximately 6 subjects will receive TAK-906 
maleate 25 mg with and without food in an open-label crossover design over 2 periods (ie, fed, 
fasted). Blood samples for assessment of TAK 906 concentrations w ill be co llected from predose 
to 48 hours after each dose of TA K-906 maleate. Furthermore, up to an additional 12 subjects 
who completed Part 1 of the study will be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator to 
participate in the evaluation of TAK-906 vs active comparator metoclopramide to confirm the 
responsiveness of the GEBT test. Subject will be blinded to treatment until all subjects have 
completed Part 1. Blood samples for assessmen t of TAK 906 or metoclopramide concentrations 
will be collected at scheduled time points from predose on Day 1 to 48 hours postdose. 
Key safety and tolerability will be asse ssed during Parts 1 and 2 through physical examinations, 
vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory assessments, as well as 
collection of serious and nonserious adverse events (AEs). 
After completion of the trial (or following subject withdrawal), all subjects will return for a 
Follow-up Visit 10 to 14 days after their last dose of study medication.

CONFIDENTIAL6.0 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
Assuming a standard deviat ion (SD) of 20% for the percent change fro m Baseline in GEBT 
gastri c half -empt ying time, a total of approximatel y 48 subjects (12 per treatment group) is 
sufficient to achieve around 80% power to detect a difference of 25% between TAK -906 doses 
and placebo in the GEBT by  a 2-sample t-test wi th a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05.

CONFIDENTIAL7.0 METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATIO N
7.1 General Principles 
Study data will be analyzed and presented separately for Part 1, Part 2 group E ( Food Effect ) and 
Part 2 group F ( metoclopramide ) unless otherwi se indicated. In general , Part 1 data will be 
analyzed by treatment , Part 2 group E data w ill be analyzed by regimen (fed vs fasted), and Part 
2 group F data will be analyzed overall. 
Categorical data will be summarized as the number and percentage of subjects in each category .
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statist ics, including the number of 
subjects, mean, standard deviat ion (SD), m edian, minimum, and maximum. The coefficient of 
variat ion (%CV) and geometric mean will be included in the summary o f continuous data where 
indicated.
Arithmetic means, geometric means, and medians will be presented to 1 more decimal place than 
the recorded data, and SDs will be presented to 2 more decimal places than the recorded data, 
where appropriate. Where applicable, confidence intervals about a parameter estimate will be 
presented using the same number of decimal places as the parameter estimate and p -values will 
be rounded to 3 decimal places prior to assessment of statist ical significance.
All statistical tests and confidence intervals (CIs) will be 2 -tailed at α=0.05 level for significance
unless otherwise stated.
All study -related raw data for enrolled subjects, including derived data, will be presented in data 
listings. In addit ion, the actual day relat ive to the first dose will be presented, where applicable.
All statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS Sy stem  Versi on 9.4.
7.1.1 Definition of Study Days , Baseline and Study Visit Windows
Study  Day  1 is defined as the date of the first dose of study  drug, as recorded on the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) study  drug adm inistration page. Other study  days are defined relat ive to 
Study  Day  1, wi th Day  1 being Study  Day  1 and Day  -1 being the day  prior to Study  Day 1. 
Study  days pri or to the first dose of study  drug will be calculated as: [date of assessment/event –
date of first dose of study  drug ]. Study  days on or after the first dose of study  drug will  be 
calculated as: [date of assessment/event –date of first dose of study  drug + 1 ].ForPart 2 group 
E, period day  will be calculated relat ive to the date of first dose fo rthat treatment period.
Unless specified otherwise , for all  PD, symptom  assessment, and safet y endpo ints from Part 1, 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing measurement prior to the first dose of study  drug.
For PD and safety  endpoints from  Part 2 group F, B aseline is defined as the last non -missing 
measurement prior to the first dose of study  drug in Part 2 .
For safet y endpo ints from Part 2 group E, Baseline is defined as the last non -missing
measurement prior to first dose of study  drug for the re spect ive treatment period in Part 2 .
TAK-906-1002 Page 13 of 37
Statistical Analysis Plan Final 15 March 2018
CONFIDENTIALIn Part 1, for GEBT and SmartPill, a ±1 study day window is defined for Day 7 visit.  
 
 
More than 1 result for a parameter may be obtained  in a visit window. In such an event, the result 
with the date closest to the scheduled visit day will be used in the summary and analysis. In the 
event of 2 observations equidistant to the scheduled visit day, the later of the observations will be 
used.
7.1.2 Missing Data
There will be no imputation of incomplete or missing data unless otherwise indicated. Plasma concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero in
the summarizing concentration values and deriving of PK parameters. These values will be
flagged in the data listings.
7.2 Analysis Sets
∀Safety Set : The safety set will consist of all sub jects who are randomized (Part 1) or enrolled
(Part 2) and receive at least 1 dose of study dru g in the respective part. Subjects in this 
analysis set will be used for demographic, baseline characteristics, and safety summaries.
∀PK Set : The PK set will consist of all subjects who are randomized (Part 1) or enrolled
(Part 2) and receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 measurable plasma 
TAK-906 or metoclopramide concentration. All subjects with valid PK parameter estimates 
will be included in the summaries and analyses for that parameter.
If any subject is found to be noncompliant with the dosing schedule or has incomplete data, a 
decision will be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether that subject should be included 
in the PK analyses; however, data for all subjects will be presented in the data listings.
∀Full Analysis Set (FAS) : The FAS will consist of all subjects who are randomized (Part 1) 
or enrolled (Part 2), receive at least 1 dose of study drug, have a baseline value, and have at 
least 1 valid postbaseline value for assessment of at least one of the PD measurement.
∀Per-Protocol Set (PPS) : The PPS will include all FAS subjects who had no major protocol 
violations. The major protocol violation criteria will be defined as part of the blinded data review prior to the unblinding of subject's treatment assignment. The categories of major 
protocol violations include: 
a) not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria defined in the Protocol Amendment 04 [1], 
b) receiving an incorrect study medicatio n that leads to a treatment change,
c) other major protocol violations that may be identified during blinded data reviews.
For Part 1, analyses using the Safety Set and PK Set will be based on the actual tr eatment the 
subject received. Analyses using the FAS will be based on the randomized tr eatment the subject 
was assigned. Co

in serum prolactin concentrations will be summarized at each scheduled time point by treatment
group, in overall population and by underlying disease condition (DG and IG). Figures for mean 
serum prol actin concentrations (linear and semi-log scale) and ratio of postbaseline serum 
prolactin concentr ation relative to baseline versus time will be generated, in overall population 
and by underlying disease condition (DG and IG).
Baseline is defined as the predose concentration on Day 1 and Day 7.
PD parameters, including AUC (using exact method) and C max, for Day 1 and Day 7 will be 
derived. PD parameters will be summarized by tr eatment and day, in ove rall population and by 
underlying disease condition (DG and IG). The change in serum prolactin from Baseline to 
Day 1 at time of first occurrence of C max(tmax) will be quantified by a ratio of C maxrelative to 
baseline concentration, and will be assesse d using pairwise comparison from an ANCOVA 
model, in overall population and by underlying dis ease condition (DG and IG) if applicable. The 
model will include treatment and underlying disease condition (for analysis in overall 
population) as fixed factors, natur al logarithm of baseline as covariate, and natural logarithm of
ratio between C maxand baseline as the response. The appropriate estimates for the differences 
and the associated CIs will be exponentiated to evaluate the ratios under the original scale. 
Geometric mean and geometric mean %CV will be included in the summary of PD parameters. 
AUC will be analyzed in a similar manner with natural logarithm of the AUC as the response. A 
sensitivity analysis based on the PPS will be performed on PD parameters.

if applicable. In case there is a significant departure from the assumptions underlying the linear 
model, non-parametric analysis method described in Section  7.8.6 will be applied. 
For Part 1, figure of mean change from baselin e in GEBT gastric half-emptying time over time 
(study day) will be generated by treatment.
Another GEBT metric, the percent dose excreted at time t multiplied by 1000 ( kPCD) [4], will be 
summarized at each scheduled time point by treatment group for both Part 1 .
For Part 1, figure of mean change from baseline in kPCD over time (minutes) will be generated 
by treatment for both Day 1 and Day 7.
Change from day 1 to day 7 in gastric half-emptying time and kPCD will be summarized.
Primary analysis of GEBT parameters will be based on FAS and will exclude subjects who is 
non-compliant to the test meal or test procedure, which is defined as consuming < 90% of the 
test meal (for both gastric half-emptying time and kPCD) or having any incomplete breath 
sample post 30 minutes and not equals 60 minutes (for gastric half-emptying time). 
Two sensitivity analyses will be performed on GEBT parameters:
1. Analysis based on the PPS excluding subjects who is non-compliant to the test meal or 
test procedure as described in the primary analysis.
2. Analysis including all subjects in the FAS regardless whether they are fully compliant to 
the test meal/procedure, unless the parameters are not evaluable.
7.9.2.3 Analysis of SmartPill Motility 
SmartPill will be administered in Part 1 onl y to assess GE and GI motility. Baseline and 
postbaseline GE time (Gastric Transit Time), Small Bowel Transit Time, and Colonic Transit 
Time measured by SmartPill will be summarized and listed. Percent Change from Baseline to 
Day 7 of these parameters will be analyzed in a manner similar to GEBT, in overall population 
and by underlying disease condition (DG and IG ) if applicable. A sensitivity analysis based on 
the PPS will be performed.
In addition, exposure-response relationships may be investigated. A separate analysis plan will 
be prepared prior to the analysis, should it be necessary.

VAULT EVALUATION  AFTER  IMPLANTATION OF AN IMPLANTABLE COLLAMER LENS 
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
The i mplantable collamer lens (ICL) is  a lens designed to correct mid to high degrees of refractive error 
that is implanted in the posterior chamber of a phakic eye .  ICLs are a better alternative than older 
lenses designed to be placed in the  anterior chamber because they pose a lower risk of endothelial cell 
loss and are also more cosmetically appealing, since they are less visible externally.  
 Collamer lenses are made off a blend of a polymer and collagen making it highly permeable to oxygen and nutrients to prevent the lens from interfering with the exchanges of nutrients between the crystalline lens and the aqueous and therefore prevent the ca taract formation after implantation. Over 
the years , it became clear that the permeability of the lenses was not enough to prevent potential 
complications such as pigment dispersion, peripheral anterior synechia, pupillary block, glaucoma and 
the cataract formation
1, which would also occur as the result of the contact between the ICL and the 
crystalline lens.  In order to further avoid the cataract formation, specially the ASCC1 – considered to be 
typical of this type of lenses2 - the lenses went through design modifications and the latest model had 
the posterior face concavity increased aiming to completely vault the anterior crystalline lens capsule, resting only on the anterior zonular fibers.
3  
 
To succeed when performing surgery with the implantation of these lenses it is crucial to be able to 
accurately predict not only the postoperative refraction but also the correct lens size and specially the ICL lens vault, to preclude the afore mentioned p ossible complications. Although nowadays we can 
predict the vault size more objectively, with the use of devices such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS -OCT), Pentacam or ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), still there is no gold 
standard  to do so, and studies have already shown that indeed the measurements can differ among 
different techniques.
4,5   
 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the vault after implantation of an implantable collamer lens (ICL) with the use of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS -OCT), Pentacam and ultrasound 
biomicroscopy (UBM) to assess the following measurem ents: anterior chamber depth (ACD), horizontal 
white to white (WTW), sulcus to sulcus (STS ), and angle to angle (ATA).

Potential subjects will be identified from the patients presenting at the clinic. Additionally, an ad will be placed in social media and in the practice website , if deemed necessary . Once 
identified as a study candidate, the patient will be asked if he/she would like to participate. The 
sub-investigator, study coordinator or an appropriately trained staff member will answer any 
and all questions and will obtain informed consent. A co py of the signed informed consent 
document will be given to the subject. Th e principal investigator will be available if the subject 
wants to discuss further details with him.  Any testing that is part of the investigative site’s 
standard preoperative ICL  evaluation may be performed prior to the informed consent being 
signed, provided these tests are conducted within 6 months of surgery. The patient will 
understand that participation in the study, or declining to participate, will not affect his/her 
quality of care.  
 
No subject will be enrolled into the study that does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
does not sign the current approved informed consent document. Informed consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original sign ed documents will be 
maintained by the investigator as a permanent part of the subject's research records . 
 
B. Surgery Procedures:  
Surgeries would be completed following the surgeon’s standard of care.

CONFIDENTIAL  CEP 23-003 Version   1.2 19Dec2023  
 
documented.  These study patients are considered to have completed the study and will not be 
replaced.  
 
D. Study Termination: The investigator with appropriate notification may terminate the study.  If, 
after clinical observations, the investigator feels that it may be unwise to continue the study, he 
may stop the study.  
 
E. Study Completion: The study will be complete when all enrolled patients have completed Visit 4 
or have been terminated from the study.  
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
A. Sample  size 
 In order to  calculate the sample size, we need to know an accurate estimate of the standard 
deviation of the outcome measure which we do not know; therefore, we consider this study a 
pilot trial.  When estimating the sample size for a pilot study, the simplest method  is to apply a 
sample size rule of thumb. Browne6 suggests a general flat rule to ‘use at least 30 subjects or 
greater to estimate a parameter’.  Allowing 10 % for an assumed dropout rate , a total of 33 
subjects will be enrolled.  
 
B. Statistical Analysis  
All data will be collected by the site and entered into a database.  Subjects will be assigned an 
ID number. Data analysis will be performed without patient identification. Statistical analysis 
will be performed using standard descriptive statistics and other tests as deemed appropriate 
based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed. All statistical tests will be two -sided and 
interpreted at a 5% significance level.  Data analysis will be conducted by a third -party  
consultant.  
  
C. Study Endpoints:  
1. Primary Endpoints:  
• Mean difference between predicted and actual central vault at 1 -month after ICL 
implantation  
 
2. Secondary Endpoints:  
• Mean predicted central vault   
• Mean predicted peripheral vault  
• Mean preoperative angle measurement  
• Mean difference between predicted and actual peripheral vault  at 1-month visit  
• Percentage of eyes within ± 100 µm of predicted vault  at 1-month visit  
Central vault is defined as the perpendicular distance between the posterior surface of 
the ICL and anterior surface of the crystalline lens while pe ripheral vault  is defined as  
the distance measured perpendicularly to the surface of the crystalline lens at the level 
 
Solomon KD, Sandoval HP   8 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  CEP 23-003 Version   1.2 19Dec2023  
 
of the edge of the optical zone of the phakic lens . Predicted vault will be assessed using 
different diagnostic tools.  
 
D. Safety Analyses  
The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be tabulated 
for each group.  Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered treatment related .   
 6. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
A. Confidentiality  
To ensure confidentiality in this study, records of the participants will be examined only by the 
principal investigator and research staff involved in the study.  Study records will be kept on file at the site.  Any statistical analysis and publication will not include any subject identifiers.  Medical 
records will be made available only for review by the investigators, the IRB, and other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies, if necessary.  All information  in these records will be kept confidential.  
 
B. Records Retention  
The PI is accountable for the integrity, retention and security of all study related data. The 
investigator must maintain accurate, complete and current records relating to the clinical  
study. The investigator must maintain the required records during the investigation and for a period of 3 years  after the date on which the investigation is terminated or completed.  
 
7. STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING  
 The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data  
required to complete the case report forms (CRFs) exist and are accessible for verification by the 
project manager.  If  electronic source records are maintained, these records must be 21 CFR Part 11 
compliant and will be printed and certified . 
 The required  examination must be recorded on the CRFs. Provided CRFs can be used as source 
document.  All data reported must have corresponding entries in the source documents. The principal investigator or sub -investigator must review the reported data and certify th at the CRFs 
are accurate and complete. No subject identifiers should be recorded on the CRFs beyond subject number, subject initials and study specific identifiers.  
 
Designated study personnel will  enter collected d ata from CRFs  into a database  created for the 
purpose of this study.  Additionally, monitoring be made by the study manager or her designee 
throughout the study . 
 
Upon completion of the CRFs, the data will be reviewed by study manager and statistician for  
accuracy and completeness. If corrections and/or any additions to the data are deemed  
necessary, queries will be generated. Designated research staff are expected  to respond to data 
queries in a timely manner and ensure that the corrections and changes made to the data in the 
 
Solomon KD, Sandoval HP   9 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  CEP 23-003 Version   1.2 19Dec2023  
 
database are reflected in the subjects’ source documentation. Any changes will need to be initialed 
and dated by the authorized personnel making such changes.  
Data will not be sold to or shared with third parties but could  be used for future research.  
Electronic data may  be stored and accessed on a portable device. The laptop is password protected 
and only the study manager has access to it.  
 
8. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 A. Description  
The already FDA approved EVO ICL and EVO TICL lens es (Implantable Collamer® Lens) are  intraocular 
implant s manufactured from Collamer®,  a proprietary hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)/porcine 
collagen containing biocompatible polymer material. The EVO  ICL lens contains a UV absorber made 
from a UV absorbing material. The lens features a plate -haptic design with a  central convex/concave 
optical zone and a 0.36 mm diameter central port; the lens incorporates a forward vault to  minimize 
contact of the ICL with the central anterior capsule.  While the parent devices (non -EVO/non -central 
port Visian MICL lens and Visian TICL lens) require preoperative  peripheral iridotomies (PIs) to 
facilitate aqueous flow, the EVO/EVO+ ICL lenses include a central port that allows the  flow of 
aqueous humor through the lens, thus eliminating the need for PIs prior to implantation.   
 The EVO ICL lens features an optic diameter that varies with the dioptric power; the smallest optic diameter being  4.9mm and the largest 6.1mm. The EVO ICL lens is capable of being folded and 
inserted into the posterior chamber  through an incision of 3.5mm or less. The EVO ICL lens is 
intended to be placed entirely within the posterior chamber  directly behind the iris and in front of 
the anterior capsule of the human crystalline lens. When correctly positioned, the EVO ICL lens 
functions as a refractive ele ment to optically reduce moderate to high myopia with or without 
astigmatism.  
 
B. Treatment/Dosing Regimen 
The EVO non -toric ICL is  indicated to correct  myopia with spherical equivalent (SE) ranging from - 3.0 
D to ≤ -15.0 D with less than or equal to 2.5 D of astigmatism at the spectacle plane , and for  the 
reduction of myopia with SE ranging from greater than - 15.0 D to - 20.0 D with less than or equal to 
2.5 D of astigmatism at the spectacle plane .   Additionally, t he EVO toric ICL (TICL)  is indicated for 
the correction of myopic astigmatism with SE ranging from - 3.0 D to ≤- 15.0 D (in the spectacle 
plane) with cylinder (spectacle plane) of 1.0 D to 4.0 D. 2. for the reduction of myopic astigmatism 
with SE ranging from greater than - 15.0 D to - 20.0 D (in the spectacle plane) with cylinder (spectacle 
plane)1.0 D to 4.0 D. 3.  
 
Both lenses are intended to be used in patients ( between 21 and 45 years of age ) with an anterior 
chamber depth (ACD) of 3.00 mm or greater, when measured from the corneal endothelium to the anterior surface of the crystalline lens and a stable refractive history (within 0.5 D for both spherical equivalent and cylinder for 1 year prior to implantation).  The lenses are intended to be  placed in 
the posterior chamber (ciliary sulcus) of the phakic eye.

D. Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Since the ICL  is implanted at the time of surgery, subject compliance will not be an issue in this 
particular study.  
 
E. Packaging, Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return 
ICLs will be ordered, received, stored and dispensed following the current ASC standard procedures 
and the manufacturer’s recommendations.  
 
9. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION  
 
This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and Good clinical practice.  The Investigator and all clinical trial staff will conduct the clinical trial in 
compliance with this protocol. The Investigator will ensure that all personnel involved in the conduct 
of the clinical trial are qualified to perform their assigned duties through relevant education, 
training, and experience. Deviations from the clinical protocol must be documented in each subject ’s study records including the dates and reasons for each deviation. The PI must ensure that 
all aspects of the trial are in compliance with the applicable regulatory laws and conditions of approval imposed by the IRB.  
 
10. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
 
The risk of being in the study is not greater than the risk of undergoing routine ICL  surgery. 
However, there is always the risk that uncommon or previously unknown side effects may occur.  
The study includes additional postoperative examinations at no cost.  
 
11. IN CASE OF AN INJURY RELATED TO THIS RESEARCH STUDY  
 Every effort to prevent study -related injury will be taken by the study doctor and staff. In the event 
a patient is injured as a direct result of the study while following the study instructions and requirements, the patient will be instructed to immediately contact the principal investigator and/or study staff.  Treatment will be provided as needed for those injuries caused directly by this research study. In the event of injury or illness caused by or occurring during the participation in this study, all charges for medical care provided will be billed to the patient’s insurance company. The medical 
care costs for injuries or illnesses that are not caused directly by the research study will not be 
covered.  
 
12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY

GTx, Inc. SUI Protocol; Version 1.0  07 August 2015      CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 76 Statistical 
Considerations :  This is a proof of concept feasibility study, so no power calculation is 
needed. Therefore, up to 35 subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be recruited until 30 subjects have completed treatment. Descriptive 
statistics will be performed to explore changes in primary and secondary 
outcomes measures between baseline and end of treatment. The primary 
efficacy measure will be a reduction in the number of stress incontinence 
episodes/day . Secondary efficacy measures wi ll include reduction in 
number of voids per day, volume of voids, 24 hour pad weight , responses 
to validated questionnaires, changes in UPP measures,  changes in 
sexual function, and changes in pelvic  floor muscle s as measured by 
MRI.  
  
Safety will be determined by the number and type of adverse events 
reported during treatment.  Various imputation methods may be explored.  
Study 
Intervention/Treatment :  Participation in this study includes 5 in person study visits and two 
telephone and/or mailed questionnaire  visits. Additional in person and/or 
telephone visits may be added as needed.  
 
Study subjects will receive 3 mg of GTx-024 orally daily.

SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1 BACKGROUND/RATIONALE  
Stress urinary incontinence (SUI), the involuntary leakage of urine during activities that 
increase abdominal pressure (e.g. coughing, sneezing, physical exercise), affects up to 35% of adult women (Luber, 2004). Urinary incontinence and pelvic floor disorders are major health problems for women especially as they age.  
There are a variety of treatments that may be used to treat SUI in women (Rovner, 2004). Behavioral modification and pelvic floor physical therapy are common initial treatment approaches even though surgical procedures (e.g. sling ; bladder  neck 
suspension) are often ultimately t he most effective. Biological and other materials for 
injection into the urethra have also been marketed for treating intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD), a cause of SUI symptoms. In a study of autologous fat injected into the urethral sphincter only 22% of patients improved compared to 21% after placebo injection (Lee, 2001). However, the injection of muscle derived stem cells (AMDC) is a promising new therapy for SUI currently being tested in clinical trials. In a dose escalation study of AMDC, injected into the urethral sphincter, all dose groups had significantly fewer diary stress leaks at 12 months, but only patients who received the highest dose of AMDC had statistically significant reduction in mean pad weight (Peters, 2014). Pharmacologic therapies  for SUI also have been tested with varying results. In a 
study of duloxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), the median incontinence episode frequency decreased 41% in the placebo group compared to 54% receiving duloxetine 20 mg/day, 59% for duloxetine 40 mg/day, and 64% for duloxetine 80 mg/day (Norton, 2002). Dmochowski and colleagues also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in incontinence episode frequency with duloxetine therapy compared with placebo (50% vs 27%, respectivel y) (Dmochowski, 2003).  
 
Pelvic floor muscle relaxation has been found to correlate with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Muscles of the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract are crucial for supporting the pelvic organs and micturition, however damage t o the muscles or lack of 
hormonal stimulation are thought to contribute to prolapse and urinary incontinence. As such, efforts have been made to improve pelvic floor muscle strength and function especially in post -reproductive and elderly women, to improve, if not cure, LUTS 
(specifically urinary incontinence,  urinary frequency and nocturia).  However, pelvic floor 
physical therapy (PT) is often less effective than more aggressive treatment such as surgery (Labrie, 2013).  A prospective randomized trial of PT  vs. surgery showed that 
49% of women in the PT group crossed over to surgical treatment. Others have shown that after 3 to 15 years, 25 to 50% of women initially treated with physiotherapy have proceeded to surgery (Cammu, 2004; Lamers, 2007; B. K, Kvarstein, 2005). Yet, 
surgery is much more invasive and is associated with risk and complications (Brubaker

GTx, Inc. SUI Protocol; Version 1.0  07 August 2015      CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 76 et al, 2011).  Treatments with better outcomes than pelvic floor PT or those that augment 
the response to pelvic floor PT, are clearly needed.  Androgen supplementation may be 
a novel treatment to augment pelvic floor muscle response and improve objective and 
subjective outcomes for SUI. Basic science literature indicates that smooth muscle cells in various female urogenital tissues have expressed androgen r eceptors (Berman, 
2003) and that the levator ani and urethral sphincter, both containing large numbers of androgen receptors (Copas, 2001; Celayir , 2002), are sensitive to androgens (Nnodim, 
1999; Nnodim , 2001).  
 In addition to the use of instruments to m easure the efficacy of therapeutic approaches 
to SUI, MRI measurements of the pelvic floor have been utilized as tools to determine the impact on the supporting pelvic floor muscles (Tunn et al, 1999).  Measurements of the levator hiatus, including the area , as well as , the anteroposterior and transverse 
diameters , have been demonstrated to be reproducibly measured and correlative with 
pelvic floor damage (Lammers et al., 2013).  Similar measurements have been made to examine the recovery of levator ani mus cle after vaginal delivery (Tunn et al, 1999).  
Therefore, MRI based measurements can provide for a non- invasive quantitative 
assessment of pelvic floor muscles and their potential response to therapeutic approaches with additional value to that provided by symptomatic assessments alone. MRI will also be used in this study to assess endometrial thickness at baseline. An endometrial stripe > 5 mm may exclude the subject from participating  (Stanislavsky, 
Weerakkody, et al., 2015; Nakamura et al., 2014) . 
 Andr ogen receptors in the pelvic floor/urethra  
The para -urethral extracellular matrix is a target for sex steroid hormones, however the 
effects are not well known. Androgens stimulate collagen synthesis and inhibit degradation leading to increased collagen fibre compactness (Shin, 2005;  Berger, 
2005). Androgen receptors are densely expressed in both muscle and stromal cells of the levator ani muscle and fascia in women (Copas, 2001) and the levator ani muscle is considered to be one of the most androgen sensit ive tissues in the body.   
 Impact of anabolic steroids  
The effect of testoterone on urodynamic findings and histopathomorphology of the pelvic floor muscles has been studied in rat models of SUI. Testosterone was found to 
improve leak point pressures and s ignificantly increase the size of myofibers in treated 
rats, suggesting that testosterone has both preventative and curati ve effects on rat 
models of SUI  (Mammadov,2011). Since free testosterone levels were also higher in the 
treated group, there is potent ial for concerns regarding side effects of supplemental 
steroidal testosterone in women with SUI.  
 The anabolic effects of androgens in men have been widely studied, but less is known about the role and use of androgens in women. Prior studies have found that urinary levels of androgens were significantly higher in postmenopausal patients with SUI than in postmenopausal patients without incontinence (Jung, 2001). Furthermore, concentrations of androgen metabolites in urine of these patients were related positively

Aizawa K et al. and others have published data demonstrating that increases in muscle 
mass due to resistance training or exercise is due, at least in part, to increases in local androgen concentrations and expression of androgen- synthesizing enzymes (Aizawa K, 
2011). These findings support the notion that pelvic floor muscle strengthening exercise improves SUI symptoms by increasing androgen levels locally.  These and other studies 
suggest that androgens may play a substantial role in SUI and that androgen metabolites might be involved in the relaxation of bladder muscle (b_Bai, 2003). This relaxation effect on the bladder may be related to the up regulation of nitric oxide synthase by androgens to produce more nitric oxide. The action of androgen on the lower urinary tract and pelvic floor is complex and may depend on anabolic effects, hormonal modulation, receptor expression, nitric oxide modulation, or combination of  
these factors (Ho MH, 2004).  
 Intriguing data come from studies conducted in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hyper -androgenic disorder (>70 ng/dL compared to 15-
50 ng/dL in normal pre -menopausal women) and clinical studies have demonstrated 
that PCOS can eliminate the increased risk for UI observed in obese women. Furthermore, obese women with PCOS have a similar prevalence of UI as those considered to have a normal body mass index (Montezuma T, 2011).  In a separate 
study, none of the women with PCOS (18.6% with UI) suffered from UI compared to 
matched controls,even though pelvic floor muscle strength was not different (Antonio FI, 2013). These studies support the hypothesis that women with higher androgen levels, or potentially wom en treated with a selective androgen receptor modulator  
(SARM) will show improvements in UI symptoms.  
  
Selective androgen receptor modulators  
Although anabolic steroids may increase muscle mass and strength, lack of oral bioavailability and known potent ial risks have limited their use.  Selective androgen 
receptor modulators (SARMS) have great potential to achieve similar benefits of anabolic steroid therapy (improved muscle mass, cholesterol/triglyceride levels, glucose metabolism, and bone density) with fewer adverse effects, such as hirsuitism and acne, 
in women.  
 SARMS may provide a new therapeutic option for pelvic floor and lower urinary tract disorders,  as both testosterone and its more potent metabolite converted by 5- a 
reductase, dihydrotestoster one (DHT), have anabolic effects on muscle. The potential 
for SARMS as a treatment for SUI is strengthened by studies showing that urethral closure pressure is the factor most strongly associated with SUI  (Delancey, 2007;  
Delancy, 2008). This finding is s upported by both morphological and electromyographic 
(EMG) evidence. In imaging studies, the striated urethral sphincter has been found to be smaller in women with SUI compared to continent controls (Athanasiou, 1999;  
Morgan ; 2009). In EMG studies, the st riated urethral sphincters of women with SUI 
exhibit smaller EMG amplitudes and shorter motor -unit-potential durations, with more 
phases, than continent controls (Kenton, 2011; Takahashi, 2000), indicating primarily

GTx, Inc. SUI Protocol; Version 1.0  07 August 2015      CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 76 myogenic changes. Furthermore, it is wel l accepted that pelvic floor muscle (PFM) 
rehabilitation is an effective treatment for SUI (Hay -Smith, 2009). PFM rehabilitation 
may be effective because it strengthens not only the pelvic floor but may also 
strengthen the striated urethral sphincter. This  idea is supported by a recent publication 
that reported, based on ultrasound (US), a 12- week PFM exercise program produced a 
significant increase in the cross -sectional area of the urethra, at the level of the striated 
urethral sphincter, in middle- aged w omen (McLean, 2013). Because of limits in the 
resolution of US images, the authors were not able to determine which part of the urethra hypertrophied. The investigators suggested that PFM rehabilitation in older women with SUI could condition the striated urethral sphincter leading to measurable 
hypertrophy, observable on MRI.  
 In a later study, Madill extended the findings of the McLean group (Madill, 2014). Using MRI, they were able to differentiate between smooth and striated sphincter muscle layers and determined that changes occurred primarily in the striated urethral sphincter of older women. These findings suggest that not only does the striated urethral sphincter contract synergistically with PFMs during voluntary and automatic contractions [Nnodim, 1999 ; Nnodim, 2001; Celayir, 2002], but also that PFM rehabilitation stresses 
the striated urethral sphincter sufficiently to produce a muscular hypertrophy training effect (Madill, 2014).  
 Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMS) are currently in de velopment for 
patients with muscle wasting secondary to cancer diagnosis. This class of drugs has been shown to stimulate the growth of skeletal muscle, similar to traditional anabolic 
steroids, but without undesirable side effects. SARMS, such as GTx -024, are orally 
bioavailable and tissue -selective, whereas testosterone and other anabolic steroids also 
have limited oral bioavailability and are only available in transdermal and intramuscular 
formulations potentially leading to skin reactions and fluctuations in serum concentrations of testosterone. SARMS may exhibit the beneficial effects of anabolic agents without the known associated risks (Mohler, Bohl, 2009).  
 Recently utilizing an ovariectomized rat model to miminc SUI by disrupting urethral continenc e,  investigators demonstrated that the use of a SARM (GSK2849466A) was 
able to increase urethral baseline pressure (UBP) and the amplitude of urethral responses during sneezing (AURS) by 64% and 74%, respectively, as compared with the vehicle control.  Fu rther, all of the rats (8/8) in the vehicle treated group experience 
fluid leakage during sneezing whereas only one of the rats (1/8) in the SARM treated group experience such leakage upon similar challenge.  Histologically, the SARM treated animals had a reversal of the atrophy in urethral muscle observed in the control group.  This preliminary in vivo study provides further support to the potential use of SARMs for the treatment of SUI.  (Kadekawa et al, AUA Annual Meeting 2015, New Orleans, LA.  PD27- 11)

Preliminary studies related to stress urinary incontinence  Extensive clinical data related to the use of GTx -024 are described below ;  however, 
there are both pre- clinical and clinical data supporting the specific investigation of GTx -
024 for the treatment of SUI.  Among the preclinical findings are that GTx -024 has 
androgenic and anabolic activity in male and female rat models (Preclinical Reports n030105GTx024 and n112012.1).  GTx-024 has consistently been observed to increase 
body weight, specifically muscle, in female rats.  In a male rat model,  with castrate levels 
of serum testosterone (similar to what might be expected in females), GTx -024 has the 
ability to induce hypertophy of the levator ani muscle to approximately 120% of an intact male.  These studies together provide an approximation of the expected effect of GTx -
024, since currently there are no data in female models regarding levator ani hypertrophy or  stress urinary inconcentince (Preclinical Report n112012.1).  In two 
phas e 3 studies (G300504 and G300505), 3 mg daily GTx -024 results in a mild increase 
(approximately 1.7%) in lean body mass with no differential effect in males and females.  
Based upon these preclinical and clinical analyses, we anticipate significant growth/b ulking of the levator ani in females with SUI, which may also result in 
improvements in associated symptoms, and are therefore the focus of the study outlined herein.

ULN. The ALT levels returned to normal with continued exposure to GTx -024 in most 
cases and, further, in instances when dosing was not continued, levels returned to normal. No significant increases in total bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, or lactate dehydrogenase have been observed in subjects with elevated ALT levels. Consistent with the effects of other orally administered anabolic agents, GTx-024 causes a dose dependent reduction in high -density lipoprotein (HDL), the 
clinical significance of which is unknown at this time. The proposed mechanism for reduction in HDL is due to stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport and increased HDL catabolism by hepatic lipase. Reductions in HDL are temporary and typically return 
to baseline 12 months after treatment initiation.  
 The effect of GTx -024 on a fetus has not been evaluated; therefore, the subjects in the 
current investigation will be post -menopausal.

2.2.3  METHODS  TO MINIMIZE  RISK 
 Subjects will be monitored at each visit for chang es since last visit and adverse effects 
of treatment. Since elevations in ALT are possible, serum liver function tests will be monitored during treatment. (Refer to Section 9.4 Halting Rules)  
 Subjects will receive a prophylactic antibiotic at visits where catheterization/UPP occur 
to decrease risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). Any infection will be appropriately treated.

4.1 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a single site, proof of concept feasibility study to describe the effect of GTx -024  
3 mg in postmenopausal female subjects with SUI. Postmenopausal will be defined as clinically confirmed female s ubjects who have undergone the onset of spontaneous, 
medical or surgical menopause prior to the start of this  study. Durability of treatment will 
also be explored by evaluating validated measures at 4 weeks after last dose. Up to 35 
subjects will be enrolled in this study.  
 Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from Beaumont’s Human Investigations Committee w ill be obtained prior to beginning any study activity. Once IRB approval is 
obtained, potential participants will be identified from existing medical records, or physician or other referrals.   Potential subjects may be prescreened by telephone prior to the first in person study visit (initial screening visit). At the first in person study visit, subjects will be seen in the Urology Clinical Research space and informed consent will be obtained prior to any study activity. At Study Visit, 2, inclusion/exclus ion criteria will be verified, study data will 
be collected, and consented participants may  begin treatment.  
 Enrolled subjects will agree to maintain on a stable dose of any medication known to affect lower urinary tract function, including but not limit ed to anticholinergics, tricyclic 
antidepressants, or alpha- adrenergic blockers, throughout the treatment and follow -up 
period. Subjects enrolled in the study will agree to not start any new treatment (medication or otherwise)  that is known to affect lower  urinary tract function throughout 
the treatment and follow up periods. Subjects will also agree to refrain from performing 
any Kegal exercises and maintain current dietary habits throughout the treatment and follow up periods.  
 
4.2 MEDICAL MONITORING  
 
A Medi cal Monitor will be responsible for monitoring the safety and data of this trial. The

Please see Table1 Schedule of Measures for an outline of the timing of the study procedures. Please see Appendix A, B, C, D, E for outcomes measures.  
 Interview with Vital Signs  
All potential subjects will be interviewed/assessed to confirm inclusion/absence of exclusion criteria. A review of systems will be completed, concomitant medicati ons will 
be assessed, and vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respirations) will be assessed. Laboratory results will also be reviewed at specified time points as outlined in Table 1.  
 
History  
A detailed history will include review of gravi da, prior abortions,, parity, deliveries, and 
history of gynecological conditions and/or cancer.  
 
Focused Physical Exam  
A standard brief physical exam will be done. This will include a gynecological pelvic exam and visual skin exam with specific attention to androgenic  changes.  
 Urinalysis  
A clean catch midstream voided urine specimen wil l be obtained, and evaluated by  
urine dipstick. If results or clinical symptoms indicate, the specimen will be sent for culture and the patient will receive appropriate tr eatment for UTI per standard of care.  
  
24 Hour Pad Weight Test  
The 24 -hour pad test should be completed during 1 day of each scheduled 3 -day diary . 
Subjects will be instructed to record pad weight on a day that is typical for them in terms 
of activity lev el and fluid intake. Subjects should be given one type of incontinence pad 
at the clinic. They may choose from a “light” pad or a “heavy” pad, but the pads dispensed MUST be used for the 24-  hour test. Subjects should receive 8 incontinence 
pads for use during each 24- hour test period.  
 Urethral Pressure Profile (UPP) and Bladder Stress Test  
To conduct the UPP and Bladder Stress Test, a urodynamic catheter will be placed and the bladder will be filled with 300 ml of fluid, such as saline.  UPP will be perfor med.  
Subjects will be instructed to perform a provocative maneuver to increase abdominal pressure (cough, Valsalva, or similar event). Urine loss during this even indicates a positive stress test.  
 Ultrasound Bladder Scan  
Subjects will be asked to void, a nd the volume of urine remaining in the bladder after 
voiding (post void residual) will be measured via bladder ultrasound scan.

Mammography is the process of using low -energy X -rays to examine the human breast, 
which is used as a diagnostic and  screening tool. The goal of mammography is the 
early detection of breast cancer, typically through detection of characteristic masses 
and/or microcalcifications . 
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)  
MRI will be done at baseline and end of treatment to observe changes in pelvic floor 
muscle s along with the thickness of the endometrium (mm) . Quantiative assessments 
may include the area of the levator , the anteroposterior and transverse diameters , 
and/or  other relevant parameters.  Endometrial thickness can accurately be assessed by 
MRI (Stanislavsky, Weerakkody, et al. , 2015; Nakamura et al., 2014); therefore, it is  
being used as a safety assessment in this study.  
 Medical, Epidemiological and Social Aspects of Aging (MESA) Questionnaire  
The MESA questionnaire measures severity of specific types (stress, urgency, mixed) of urinary incontinence (UI). Two subscales, the urgency UI (6 items) and the stress UI (9 items). Test- retest reliability on “any incontinence” is high (agreement coefficient = .89). 
Validity (agre ement between self -report on the MESA and clinician’s assessment) = 
87% in women. The MESA questionnaire has demonstrated agreement on incontinence = 79% and 69% and 72% accuracy in predicting urodynamic diagnosis of stress UI and uninhibited detrusor cont raction (Herzog, 1990a ; Herzog , 1990b).  
 3 Day Voiding Diary  
Subjects will record each episode of urinary leakage and record its severity. Subjects will also be asked to record urinary frequency, and urgency. Urine volume will also be 
recorded. 3 day blad der diaries are reliable measures of mean number of UI 
episodes/day, UI type, mean voids/24 hours, and mean voids during sleeping hours.  2-
week test -retest results correlate with diurnal micturition (r=.89, p<0.001) and UI 
episodes (r=.91, p<0.001). Compar ed to participant recall of the previous week, 
Spearman rank correlation = .57 for voiding frequency and .70 for UI episodes (Brown, 2003: Locher, 2001; Wyman, 1988). For this study, any episode of vaginal discharge or 
spotting will also be recorded on the  diary.  
 Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI -I) 
PGI-I is a global rating of improvement using 7- point scale. Construct validity was 
established in two randomized controlled studies (n=1,133 subjects) of drug treatment for predominant stress incontinence (Wagner, 1996; Yalcin , 2003).  
 Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) 
PGI-S is a global rating of symptoms severity using a 7 point scale (Yalcin, 2003).  
 
UDI-6 and IIQ-7 
The Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI -6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ -
7) assess symptom distress and the impact of urinary incontinence on daily life. The

GTx, Inc. SUI Protocol; Version 1.0  07 August 2015      CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 76 urogenital distress inventory (UDI) and incontinence impact questionnaire (IIQ) were 
both developed to assess the impact of UI on HRQoL (Shumaker, 1994; W yman , 1987). 
Short versions of the UDI and IIQ, UDI - 6, and IIQ- 7, were developed to reduce the 
respondents’ burden. The UDI -6 and IIQ -7 are both ‘‘A grade’’ recommended by the 
Fourth International Consultation on Incontinence (Shumaker, 1994; Wyman , 1987;   
Uebersax, 1995; Staskin, 2008).  
 Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)  
The FSFI is a 19 -question validated tool evaluating sexual function in several domains : 
libido, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain (Rosen et al, 2000). Each subdomain is scored separately and the total score is calculated.  
 
 
9. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
 
9.1 METHODS  AND  TIMING  FOR  ASSESSING,  RECORDING,  AND  
ANALYZING  SAFETY  PARAMETERS 
 
9.1.1  ADVERSE  EVENTS 
 
ICH E6 defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal 
relationship to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
 The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a st udy subject presenting for medical care, or upon review by a 
study monitor.  
 The period of observation for which AEs are to be collected begins after the subject has signed the ICF, throughout the study intervention period, and for 28 days post treatment.   
 All AEs, whether reported by the subject  or noted by study personnel, will be recorded 
in the subject’s medical record and captured on the appropriate CRF.  
 Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, Investigator’s assessment  of severity, Investigator’s assessment of relationship to study drug, and 
time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship to study drug. All AEs will be followed t o adequate resolution as per Section 9.3 TYPE AND DURATION OF 
FOLLOW -UP OF SUBJECTS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS .

GTx, Inc. SUI Protocol; Version 1.0  07 August 2015      CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 76  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered as baseli ne and not reported as an AE. However, if the condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
All AEs must be graded for intensity and relationship to study drug.  
 
9.1.2  INTENSITY  OF EVENT   
 
All AEs will be assessed by the Inv estigator according to NCI -CTCAE, Version 4.0. For 
any AE that is not specifically covered in NCI -CTCAE, Version 4.0, the criteria from  
 Table 1  should be used:  
 
Table 1: Description of Gra des According to the CTCAE  
Grade  Description  
0 No AE or within normal limits  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms ; clinical or diagnostic observations only ; intervention not 
indicated  
2 Moderate ; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated ; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening ;  hospitalization or prolongation 
of hospitalization indicated ; disabling ;  limiting self -care activities of daily li ving 
4 Life threatening consequences ; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
 If the intensity changes within a day, the maximum intensity should be recorded. If the intensity changes over a longer period of time, the changes should be recorded as separate events (having separate onset and stop dates for each change in intensity).  
Changes in the intensity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. AEs characteri zed as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  
 
9.1.3  DRUG  – ADVERSE  EVENT  RELATIONSHIP  
 
Classification of Relationship/Causality of Adverse Events (AE/SAE) to study drug:  The investigator will determine the relationship between the study drug administration and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as defined below:  
 Not Related:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event is determined to be Not Related to study drug administration.  
 Possibly Related:  The temporal relationship of t he adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship possible. Other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a probable explanation for the observed event.

GTx, Inc. SUI Protocol; Version 1.0  07 August 2015      CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 76 Probably Related:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal  relationship.  
 
Probable:  Other medications, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a possible explanation for the observed event.  
 Related:  The temporal relationship of  the adverse event is determined to be Related to 
study drug administration.  
 Unable to Determine:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal  relationship unable to determine or unknown.  
  
9.1.4  SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions :  
• Death  
• Life-threatening event (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time 
of the event)  
• An event requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 All SAEs will be :  
• Recorded on the appropriate CRF  
• Reported to the designated Safety department/pharmacovigilance contractor using a SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness  
• Followed through to resolution by a study Investigator  
• Reviewed and evaluated by a study Investigator

9.2.1  SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENTS   
 
All SAEs, including death due to any cause, which occur after the subject signs the ICF and within 28 days following the last administration of study drug, whether or not related to the study drug, must be reported immediately to t he designated Safety 
Department/pharmacovigilance contractor within 24 hours  by e-fax, e -mail, or 
telephone (see contact information below). At the very least, the following information must be reported:  
• Date and time of report  
• Reporter’s name and phone number  
• Investigator’s name and site number  
• Subject number  
• SAE information : event term, onset date, causal relationship  
• Study drug : start date of study drug and whether or not study drug has been 
withheld or discontinued

US Safety Toll- Free Unmanned Hotline: 1 866 966 8429  
Safety E -mail: sae@cmedresearch.com   
 Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the SAE Report Form. The Investigator must assess the relationship of any SAE to study drug, complete the SAE Report Form,  and send the completed, signed form by e- fax or e- mail within 24  hours to 
the assigned drug safety group. As a back -up, the site may report SAEs using  the 
unmanned safety hotline, with a completed SAE Report Form forwarded to the assigned 
drug safety group within 24 hours following notification on the hotline. The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the e- fax confirmation sheet must be kept with th e case 
report form documentation at the study site.  
 Follow -up information must also be sent to the same assigned drug safety group by e-
fax or e- mail using either a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the 
previously reported SAE (givi ng the date of the original report), or by using a follow -up 
query form.  
 If an SAE is not previously documented (new occurrence) in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and is thought to be related to the relevant Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), the assigned drug safety group may urgently require further information from the 
Investigator for Regulatory Authority reporting. The drug safety group may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all Investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the regulatory/competent

• A significant hazard to the subject population such as lack of efficacy of an IMP 
used for the treatment of a life- threatening disease  
• A major safety finding from a newly completed animal study (such as carcinogenicity)  
 These events/observations are not to be reported as SUSARs, but they might require other action, such as urgent safety measures and their notificat ion, substantial 
amendments, or early termination of the trial, and shall be reported in accordance with applicable local regulations and guidelines.  
 
All serious events designated as expected and/or “not related” to study drug(s), will be reported to the applicable Regulatory Authorities and IECs/IRBs at least annually in a summary format”.  
 
9.3 TYPE  AND  DURATION  OF FOLLOW- UP OF SUBJECTS  AFTER  
ADVERSE  EVENTS 
 
AEs will be collected up until 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, and will 
continue to be followed up until one of the following occurs :  
 Resolved or improved to baseline  
Death  
Investigator confirms that no further improvement can be expected  
 
9.4 HALTING  RULES  
 
If in the opinion of the Investigator, the participation in the study is or is becomi ng 
detrimental to the well -being of a particular subject, this issue should be discussed with

10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Since this is a proof of concept feasibility study, no power calculation is needed. Based 
on Dalton, 2011, 10- 20% of patients may withdraw from the study before completing 
treatment. Th erefore, we will recruit up to 3 5 patients meeting incl usion/exclusion 
criteria until 3 0 subjects have completed treatment. Descriptive statistics will be used to 
explore changes in primary and secondary outcomes measures between baseline and end of treatment. Although the primary efficacy measure will be a change in freque ncy 
of daily stress leaks between Baseline and Week  14 weeks , response to treatment will 
also consider secondary efficacy measures ( change in frequency of voids per day, urine 
volume per void , change in 24 hour pad weight , responses to validated questionnaires, changes in UPP measures,  changes in sexual function) , and change in pelvic floor 
muscles as measured by MRI . Safety will be reported by the number and type of 
adverse events reported during treatment.  No imputations for m issing data will be 
conducted. There will be no adjustment for multiple testing.  
 
10.1 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 Primary end point  
 
• The average number of episodes  per day  of leaking (SUI) will be calculated by 
summing the number of episodes over the 3 day period and dividing by 3, the 
change from Bas eline  to Week 1 2 will be computed and this change will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline  using the Exact 
Wilcoxon sign rank test .  
 
Secondary end point s 
• The average number of voids per day  will be calculated by summing the number 
of voids  over the 3 day period and dividing by 3 , the change from Baseline  to 
Week 1 2 will be computed and this change will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline using the Exact Wilcoxon sign rank test .  
 
• The average volume per void  will be calculated by summing the total urine 
amount  over the 3  day period and dividing by the tot al number of voids recorded 
over 3 days , the change from Baseline to Week 1 [2 will be computed and this

• Change in 24 hour pad weight from Baseline to Week 1 2 will be computed and 
this change will be summarized with descriptive statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline using the Exact Wilcoxon sign rank test.  
 
• Change in total score on the stress incontinence section of the MESA Urinary 
Questionnaire from Baseline  to Week 12  will be computed and this change w ill 
be summarized with descriptive statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard 
deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline  using the Exact 
Wilcoxon sign rank test.  
 
• Change in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) Scale from Base line to 
Week 1 2 will be computed and this change will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline using the Exact Wilcoxon sign rank test  
 
• Patient Global Impress ion of Improvement (PGI -I) Scale at Week 1 2. Descriptive 
statistics, (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) will summarize these scores.  
 
• Change in total score on the Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI -6) from Baseline  to 
Week 1 2 will be computed and this change will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline using the Exact Wilcoxon sign rank test.  
 
• Change in total score on the Incontinence Impact Questionnai re (IIQ -7) from 
Baseline  to Week 12  will be computed and this change will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline using the Exact Wilcoxon sign rank test.  
 
• Change in total score on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) as well as the 
change in subdomain scores : libido, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, 
and pain from Baseline  to Week 12  will be computed and these changes will be 
summarized with desc riptive statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard 
deviation) and analyzed for a significant change from Baseline  using the Exact

• Changes in pelvic floor muscles  from Baseline  to Week 12  will be summarized 
with descriptive stati stics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation) and 
analyzed for a significant change from Baseline  using the Exact Wilcoxon sign 
rank test.  
 
• Qualitative changes in pelvic muscles will be described as decreased, increased 
or no change at Week 1 2 relativ e to Baseline.  
 
Exploratory Analyses  
 Changes from baseline to each of the assessment times prior to Week 1 2 for the above 
endpoints will be explored, described and tested for significance using the same analytical methods noted for the primary and secondary objectives above.  Durability   
treatment will be assessed by evaluating changes in study measures between week 1 2 
and 16  (end of study) . There will be no adjustment for multiple testing, nor will any data 
be imputed.  
 Repeated measures (mixed models) w ill be used to examine the change over time by 
incorporating all available assessment times to test for a significant non- zero slope over 
time and estimate that slope and its standard error.  
 Various imputation methods may be explored if any of the above a nalyses indicate 
promise for the compound in the treatment of SUI.  These imputation methods may allow 
for better estimation of effect size and consequently sample size estimation in future trials.

GTx, Inc. SUI Protocol; Version 1.0  07 August 2015      CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 76 Study records will be maintained in locked offices with access limited to authorized 
individuals. Each participant will be given an identification number that will be used to enter the data into a password protected database and for the analysis.  
  
13.1 DATA  CAPTURE  METHODS  
 
13.1.1  DATA  COLLECTION   
 
Study specific data will be collected on paper case report forms (CRFs).  Completed 
questionnaires and voiding diaries will be used as source documents, and these 
documents will be kept in the study files.  Blank data fields should be noted as unknown 
(UNK) or not applicable (NA) if source information is not available or data not collected.  
While completing the questionnaire, if a subject leaves a question blank, it will be deemed permanently missing.  All CRFs will be m aintained at the study site for the 
length of time as determined by the IRB and federal regulations and as provided in the site’s clinical study agreement. Data will be entered into a password protected electronic database that does not contain subject identifiers. Identifiers linked to unique Study ID will be kept separately from the study data. Data entry will be reviewed for accuracy.  
 
13.2 STUDY  SITE  RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
All data requested on the CRF must be recorded. Data will be transcribed by authorized 
personnel at the study site from the source documents into the CRF for enrolled 
subjects. All information on the CRF must be traceable to these source documents. All electronic entries (including any changes or updates) will be traceable through the system. O nly the PI or authorized staff may enter or modify data in the database using 
their unique password. The Investigator must certify that the data entered in the CRFs are complete and accurate by electronically signing the CRF.  
 
13.3 CRF  TIMING/REPORTS  
 
A final r eport for the study will be completed upon completion of the study and the 
analysis of data. Please see information concerning publication policy (Section 14).  
 
13.4 STUDY  RECORDS  RETENTION 
 Study documents must be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigat ional product. These 
documents will be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of GTx, Inc., if applicable. It is the responsibility of GTx, Inc. to inform the PI when these documents no longer need to be retained.

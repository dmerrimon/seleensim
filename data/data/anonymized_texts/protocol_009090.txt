Study Design:   
This is a  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel group, 
flexible dose  study of SPN -812 in adults diagnosed with ADHD per Diagnos tic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – 5th Edition (DSM -5™) criteria. Approximately 
366 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (183 subjects per arm) : SPN-812 (200 
mg to 600 mg ) or placebo. Following up to 5 weeks of screening, subjects will be 
treated with study medication (SM) for 6 weeks .  
At the Screening V isit (Visit 1), a fter informed consent is obtained, subjects will 
undergo initial screening evaluation s/scales , and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
reviewed to confirm  the subject’s  eligibility . Subjects taking  ADHD medication at 
screening will undergo  a washout of at least 1 week (or 5 half -lives of the medication, 
whichever is longer) before the B aseline  Visit (Visit 2; Day 1 ). At the B aseline Visit, 
subjects who meet inclusion/exc lusion criteria will be randomized. The  Treatment 
Period  will consist of 6 weeks  of treatment with dosing starting Day 2 (morning  after 
Visit 2) until Day 43  (Visit 7; end of study, EOS)  (Section 4.2). Subjects will undergo 
efficacy and safety evaluations, return the previous dosing card, and receive the next 
card.  
Subjects who complete the study may enroll in a separate open -label extensi on (OLE) 
safety study . Those subjects who do not enroll in OLE safety study will receive a phone 
call 1 week following EOS visit for safety.   
Duration of Subject’s Participation:  
Following up to 5 weeks of screening, subjects will be treated with SM for 6 weeks . The 
total study duration from the Screening Visit to the end of the treatment period is up to 
11 weeks .

Statistical Methodology  
Sample Size : 
Assuming an effect size of 0.407 , 128 subjects per treatment group ( 256 total subjects 
for 2 arms) in the Full Analysis Set ( FAS) will yield 90% power at a significance level of 
0.05 (two -sided) to reject the equality of treatment means between the placebo and the 
SPN-812 treatment group . Assuming approximately 30% of subject s drop out before 
the completion of the study, an adjusted  sample size of 366 subjects ( 183 per arm) will 
be randomized to obtain 128 subjects per arm in the FAS at the completion of the 
study . 
Analysis Populations : 
The Randomized Population  is all subjects who complete the Baseline Period, meet 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are randomized . 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  is a s ubset of subjects in the Randomized Population  
who took at least one dose of study medication, and had a Baseline and at least one 
post-Baseline assessment of AISRS. Subject s in the FAS will be analyzed according to 
the treatment to which they were randomized. The efficacy analyses will be conducted 
using the FAS.  
The Per Protocol (PP) Population  is a subset of  subjects in the FAS who complete all 
7 visits  through EOS  with no  missing AISRS assessments and no major protocol 
violations. Subjects in the PP Population will be analyzed according to the treatment 
received . 
The Safety Population  is all subjects randomized into the study who receive at least 
one dose of SM. Subjects i n the Safety Population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment received.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Statistical Methods : 
Efficacy  
 The primary  efficacy variable,  change from baseline in AISRS total s core to 
Week  6 (EOS), will be analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM ), which assumes that missing data are missing at random ( MAR ). The 
model will include fixed e ffect terms for basel ine AISRS total s core, treatment, 
visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as independent variables. The model 
parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood  (REML)  
method with unstructured variance -covariance matrix and Kenward -Roger 
approximation to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.  In case there is a 
convergence problem in the MMRM model with the unstructured variance -
covariance matrix, the first (co)variance structure that does not have 
convergence problem will be used for the analysis from the following ordered 
list: 1) Toeplitz, 2) A utoregressive of order 1, and 3) Compound symmetry.  The 
adjusted mean ( least square mean [ LS mean]) of CFB at  EOS for AISRS  total 
score for each treatment arm (p lacebo and SPN-812) will be presente d, along 
with the corresponding standard error. The SPN -812 treatment arm will be 
compared with placebo. The LS means  of the treatment groups , differences 
between the LS treatment means and placebo, and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the treatment differences with p -values will be computed . 
 
 The sensitivity analy sis assumes that missing AISRS total s cores are missing 
not at random ( MNAR ). Placebo -based multiple imputation will be used to fill -in 
missing values. This approach may b e considered “worst -case” sensitivity 
analyses as it assumes that after discontinuation, subjects from the SPN-812 
treatment arm would adopt the outcome model estimated from the placebo arm. 
The placebo -based imputation will be implemented as described in the 
statistical analysis plan . 
 
 The secondary analyses will be based on the FAS with missing values imputed 
using multiple imputation assuming MAR.  All secondary analyses  will use 
analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) (except categorical CGI, 50% responder and 
30% responder which uses Pearson’s Chi -square d test or Fisher exact test  on 
the absolute value at Week 6  (EOS) ) on the change from baseline at Week 6  
(EOS) (except CGI -I which uses the absolute value)  with treatment and 
baseline  (baseline CGI -S will be use d for CGI -I) as fixed effect. The SPN -812 
treatment arm will be compared with the placebo arm . The LS means of the 
treatment groups, differences between the LS treatme nt mean  and placebo 
(SPN -812 minus placebo ), and 95% CIs for the treatment differences with p -
values will be computed.  
 
 The primary and key secondary analyses will be repeated for the PP Population 
as supplemental  analyses.

1.1 Background 
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric condition 
characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Epidemiological data suggest 
that ADHD affects up to 8% of children in the United States, while the estimated 
prevalence in the adult population is between 0.3% and 5% ( McCann and Roy-Byrne, 
2004 ). The standard pharmaceutical treatments for ADHD include psychostimulants, 
non-stimulants, and antidepressants. Stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate, amphetamine) 
are the first-line pharmacotherapies for the treatment of ADHD. However, 10% to 30% of 
patients do not adequately respond to stimulants or experience intolerable adverse 
events (AEs; e.g., decreased appetite, sleep problems, headaches) ( Briars and Todd, 
2016 ).  
SPN-812 (extended-release viloxazine) is a structurally distinct, bicyclic, Serotonin 
Norepinephrine Modulating Agent (SNMA). The active substance in SPN-812 is 
viloxazine, whose mechanism of action is multimodal with antagonistic activity observed 
at 5-HT2B and agonistic activity at 5-HT2C receptors, as well as weaker antagonistic 
effects at ADRα1B, ADRβ2 and 5 -HT7 receptors. Additionally, SPN-812 acts as a 
modulator with inhibitory effects at the norepinephrine reuptake transporter. Viloxazine 
was previously marketed in several European countries as an antidepressant as an 
immediate-release (IR) product . An extended-release (ER) formulation of viloxazine, 
SPN-812, has been developed by Supernus to prolong the release and absorption of 
viloxazine post-administration, thereby minimizing fluctuations in plasma drug levels and 
allowing longer dosing intervals for a drug with a relatively short half-life. SPN-812 was 
developed for potential use in the treatment of subjects with ADHD , based on the 
pharmacological properties and favorable safety profile and the current unmet medical 
need for effective long-acting, nonstimulant ADHD treatment in children and 
adolescents. SPN-812 is being evaluated in the current study for potential use in the 
treatment of ADHD  in adults based on the pharmacological properties and favorable 
safety profile of viloxazine. 
1.2 Clinical Information 
The safety, pharmacokinetics ( PK) and drug-drug interactions for the IR and ER 
formulations of SPN-812 have been evaluated in multiple Phase 1 studies in healthy 
adults. As of April 2019, a number of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
SPN-812 treatment for ADHD in pediatric and adult populations have been completed, 
including one Phase 2 study in adults (18 to 65 years of age; 812P201), one pediatric 
Phase 2 in children (6 to 12 years of age; 812P202), and four pediatric Phase 3 studies, 
two in children (6 to 11 years of age; 812P301 and 812P303) and two in adolescents 
(12 to 17 years of age; 812P302 and 812P304). In addition, there is an ongoing pediatric 
open-label extension (OLE) safety study in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years of 
age; 812P310). Key findings from the completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are 
summarized below. Additional details are provided in the SPN- 812 Investigator ’s 
Brochure.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Phase 1 Studies 
Phase 1 studies include comparison of single and two-bead SPN-812 extended release 
(ER) formulations to an SPN-812 immediate release (IR) formulation at single and 
multiple doses (812P102 and 812P103, respectively), evaluation of food and sprinkling 
effects (812P105), drug-drug interactions (DDIs) on CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 substrates 
with evaluation of SPN-812 ER metabolism in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers vs. CYP2D6 
extensive metabolizers (812P113.1), DDI with d-amphetamine (812P113.2), DDI with 
methylphenidate (812P113.3), evaluation of the effect of alcohol on SPN-812 
metabolism (812P115), evaluation of the effect of renal impairment on SPN- 812 
metabolism (812P112.1), evaluation of multiple dose SPN-812 on QT Interval 
(812P117), evaluation of maximum tolerable doses and cardiac safety in a single and 
multiple-ascending dose study (812P120) have also been evaluated. In addition, a 
[14C]-labelled oral IR solution was used to examine human absorption, metabolism, and 
excretion (812P111). 
Results from these studies demonstrated that 200 mg single dose of an extended 
release SPN-812 formulation resulted in a mean maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of 1.33 µg/mL, area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to 
infinity (AUCinf) of 27.3 hr*µg/mL, median time to maximum concentration (tmax) of 5 
hours, and a half-life of approximately 7 hours (812P103). Lower mean Cmax was 
observed for SPN-812 as compared to SPN-812 IR and by 48 hours overall viloxazine 
exposure was comparable between the two formulations. The rate of absorption of 
viloxazine was formulation dependent; SPN-812 exhibited a slower absorption rate than 
SPN-812 IR. Following multiple-dose administration of SPN-812 on consecutive days, 
steady-state was achieved by the second day of multiple dosing. Little systemic 
accumulation of viloxazine was observed as no major increase in pharmacokinetic (PK) 
parameters was observed following multiple administration of SPN-812 compared to 
single dose administration, during the same time interval.  
Food and sprinkling did not affect the relative bioavailability of viloxazine following 
administration of SPN-812 capsules (812P105). SPN-812 interacted as a strong inhibitor 
of CYP1A2, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4; and displayed no 
significant differences in metabolism within CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and CYP2D6 
extensive metabolizers (812P113.1). There was no DDI between SPN-812 and d-
amphetamine (812P113.2) nor SPN-812 and methylphenidate (812P113.3). In addition, 
there was no dose dumping observed with co-administration of alcohol with SPN-812 
(812P115). Renal impairment resulted in a 1.09-fold, 1.3-fold, and 1.9-fold increase in 
AUC for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment subjects receiving 400 mg SPN-
812 as compared to healthy subjects (812P112.1). Multiple doses of 1800 mg 
(supratherapeutic) SPN-812 did not affect cardiac repolarization as measured by QTcI 
and QTcF or other electrocardiographic parameters (812P117). In the single 
ascending/multiple ascending dose study, SPN-812 was well tolerated up to 2100 
mg/day as a single dose and up to 1800 mg/day as multiple doses given once daily for 5 
consecutive days. Intolerable adverse events (AEs) were not observed at doses of up to

repolarization or other electrocardiographic parameters, other than slight increase in 
heart rate consistent with the known anticholinergic effect of viloxazine (812P120).  
In the human absorption, metabolism, and excretion study, absorption of the isomers, R- 
and S-viloxazine, was rapid with a median Tmax of 1.0 hour and showed a 2:1 
concentration ratio, respectively. Nearly 100% of the radioactive dose was recovered 
with approximately 90% being recovered within 24 hours of administration, 
demonstrating complete absorption of the drug followed by rapid elimination. The 
primary circulating form was SPN 812; the only metabolite found above 10% total 
radioactivity was de-activated hydroxylated glucuronide.   
The most common AEs in the Phase 1 studies in healthy adults were somnolence and 
headache. Most AEs were mild; none were severe or serious. No clinically significant, 
study medication-related findings were observed for laboratory or electrocardiogram 
(ECG) tests in any study. In general, SPN 812 is considered to be well tolerated with no 
safety events observed that would be unexpected for viloxazine. 
Phase 2 Studies 
The randomized, blinded, proof- of-concept Phase 1/2 study 812P201 compared an IR 
formulation of SPN-812 and placebo administered three times a daily in a dose range of 
150 to 300 mg/d ay in 52 adults (26 per treatment) with ADHD. In addition to assessing 
the safety and tolerability of SPN-812 IR, scores of both the Investigator-rated and 
patient-rated Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) were collected at weekly 
intervals during the 6-week treatment period. Treatment with SPN-812 IR showed a 
statistically significant reduction in median CAARS total ADHD symptom score 
compared to placebo. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 23 (88.5%) subjects in 
the SPN-812 IR group and in 18 (72.0%) subjects in the placebo group . The most 
common AEs in SPN-812 IR group were nausea, decreased appetite, headache, and 
insomnia. There were no clinically significant ECGs, clinical laboratory test results, vital 
signs, or physical examination findings in either group during the study. No serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ) or deaths occurred during the study. 
The 812P202 study in children with ADHD assessed the effect of SPN- 812 in reducing 
the symptoms of ADHD as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD- RS-IV). 
Subjects aged 6 to 12 years were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio of placebo or active 
treatment (SPN- 812 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg) and received 3 weeks of titration at 
100 mg/week followed by 5 weeks of maintenance dosing for a total of 8 weeks of 
treatment. Mean ADHD- RS-IV Total Scores improved throughout treatment in all groups. 
Differences in change from baseline to end of study between SPN- 812 and placebo 
were statistically significant at the three higher SPN- 812 doses (p ≤ 0.0310) but not at 
the 100- mg dose. The treatment effect compared to placebo increased with the dose; 
however, pairwise comparisons among the four active treatment groups showed no 
statistically significant differences among the SPN- 812 doses. All doses of SPN-812 
were well tolerated with no serious or severe AEs and no clinically significant effect on

were somnolence, decreased appetite, and headache. 
Phase 3 Studies 
Four pivotal Phase 3 studies of SPN- 812 for the treatment of ADHD have been 
completed in the pediatric population: two studies in children 6 to 11 years of age 
(evaluating 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg ) and two studies in adolescents 12 to 17 years 
of age (evaluating 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg). As of April 2019, preliminary results 
are available for all four studies .  
Children (6 to 11 years of age) 
Study 812P301 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy 
and safety of S PN-812 at 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day for the treatment of ADHD in 
children 6 to 11 years of age. The primary endpoint of the study was the change from 
baseline in ADHD- RS-5 Total Score at end of study. Treatment for 6 weeks (1 week of 
titration followed by 5 weeks of maintenance at a fixed dose) with SPN-812 100 mg/day 
or 200 mg/day led to a statistically significant improvement in ADHD- RS-5 Total Score 
compared to placebo.  
Throughout treatment, AEs were reported in 47 (29.6%), 74 (48.1%), and 
77 (47.8%) subjects in the placebo, SPN-812 100 mg/day, and SPN- 812 200 mg/day 
treatment groups, respectively. The most frequently reported AEs were somnolence, 
decreased appetite, and headache . AEs were considered to be at least possibly 
treatment related in 16 (10.1%), 41 (26.6%), and 56 (34.8%) subjects in the placebo, 
SPN-812 100 mg/day, and SPN- 812 200 mg/day treatment groups, respectively. AEs 
led to permanent study medication discontinuation (and study withdrawal) in 2 (1.3%), 
5 (3.2%), and 2 (1.2%) subjects in the placebo, SPN- 812 100 mg/day, and SPN- 812 
200 mg/day treatment groups, respectively. SAEs were reported in 3 subjects: 2 in the 
SPN-812 100 mg/day treatment group and 1 in the SPN- 812 200 mg/day treatment 
group. All SAEs were considered unlikely related or not related t o study medication. No 
deaths occurred during the study. 
Study 812P303 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy 
and safety of SPN- 812 at 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day for the treatment of ADHD in 
children 6 to 11 years of age. T he primary endpoint of the study was the change from 
baseline in ADHD- RS-5 Total Score at end of study. Treatment with SPN- 812 
200 mg/day or 4 00 mg/day for 8 weeks (3 weeks of titration followed by 5 weeks of 
maintenance at a fixed dose) led to a statistically significant improvement in ADHD- RS-5 
Total Score compared to placebo.  
Throughout treatment, AEs were reported in 47 ( 45.6%), 56 (52.3%), and 
58 (58.0 %) subjects in the placebo, SPN-812 200 mg/day, and SPN- 812 4 00 mg/day 
treatment groups, respectively. The most frequently reported AEs were somnolence, 
headache, decreased appetite, and fatigue . AEs  were considered to be at least possibly 
treatment related in 22 (21.4%), 42 (39.3%), and 51 (51.0%) subjects in the placebo, 
SPN-812 2 00 mg/day, and SPN- 812 400 mg/day treatment groups, respectively. AEs

6 (5.6%), and 4 (4.0%) subjects in the placebo, SPN- 812 2 00 mg/day, and SPN- 812 
400 mg/day treatment groups, respectively. SAEs were reported in 3 subjects: 1 in the 
SPN-812 2 00 mg/day treatment group and 2 in the SPN- 812 400 mg/day treatment 
group. No deaths occurred during the study. 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) 
Study 812P302 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy 
and safety of SPN- 812 at 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day for the treatment of ADHD in 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. The primary endpoint of the study was the change 
from baseline in ADHD- RS-5 Total Score at end of study. Treatment with SPN- 812 
200 mg/day or 4 00 mg/day for 6 weeks (1 week of titration followed by 5 weeks of 
maintenance at a fixed dose) led to a statistically significant improvement in ADHD- RS-5 
Total Score compared to placebo.  
Throughout treatment, AEs were reported in 38 (36.5%), 43 (43.4%), and 
56 (53.3 %) subjects in the placebo, SPN-812 200 mg/day, and SPN-812 400 mg/day 
treatment groups, respectively. The most frequently reported AEs were somnolence, 
decreased appetite, headache, fatigue and nausea . AEs  were considered to be at least 
possibly treatment related in 20 (19.2%), 32 (32.3%), and 41 (39.0%) subjects in the 
placebo, SPN-812 200 mg/day, and SPN-812 400 mg/day treatment groups, 
respectively. AEs led to permanent study medication discontinuation (and study 
withdrawal) in 0 , 4 (4.0%), and 2 (1.9%) subjects in the placebo, SPN-812 200 mg/day, 
and SPN-812 400 mg/day treatment groups, respectively. SAEs were reported in 
2 subjects, both in the SPN- 812 200 mg/day treatment group. No deaths occurred during 
the study. 
Study 812P304 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy 
and safety of SPN- 812 at 400 mg/day and 600 mg/day for the treatment of ADHD in 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. The primary endpoint of the study was the change 
from baseline in ADHD- RS-5 Total Score at end of study. Treatment with SPN- 812 
400 mg/day for 7 weeks (2 weeks of titration followed by 5 weeks of maintenance at a 
fixed dose) led to a statistically significant improvement in ADHD -RS-5 Total Score 
compared to placebo; however , ADHD -RS-5 Total Score during treatment with SPN- 812 
600 mg/day did not showed a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo. 
Throughout treatment, AEs were reported in 39 (40.2 %), 58 (58.0%), and 
55 (55.6 %) subjects in the placebo, SPN-812 400 mg/day, and SPN-812 600 mg/day 
treatment groups, respectively. The most frequently reported AEs were somnolence, 
fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, and nausea. AEs were considered to be at least 
possibly treatment related in 18 (18.6%), 44 (44.0 %), and 45 (45.5%) subjects in the 
placebo, SPN-812 400 mg/day, and SPN-812 600 mg/day treatment groups , 
respectively. AEs led to permanent study medication discontinuation (and study 
withdrawal) in 1 (1.0%), 4 (4 .0%), and 5 (5.1 %) subjects in the placebo, SPN- 812 
400 mg/day, and SPN-812 6 00 mg/day treatment groups, respectively. SAEs were 
reported in 2 subjects, both in the SPN-812 400 mg/day treatment group. No deaths 
occurred during the study.

In the 812P201 study, the change from baseline in CAARS total score at end of study 
(EOS) was significantly reduced with SPN-812 IR 150 to 300 mg/day compared to 
placebo in adults (ages ≥ 18 y ears of age) with ADHD. The efficacy and safety of 
SPN-812 showed positive results in three separate trials assessing efficacy of 
200 mg/day and two separate trials assessing efficacy of 400 mg/day SPN- 812. The 
proposed doses of SPN- 812 200 to 600 mg/day in the current adult study are expected 
to provide similar exposure in adults compared to that provided by 200 to 400 mg/day in 
children and adolescents. These doses fall well within the range of doses where a low 
number of AEs to no AEs were observed in Phase 1 trials (single and multiple dose), 
and those AEs that were observed were mild to moderate in severity. In addition, the 
current study is intended to expand the indication of SPN-812 treatment of ADHD in 
children/adolescents (6 to 17 years of age) to also include treatment of ADHD in adults 
(18 to 65 years of age). 
In addition to assessing the effect of SPN-812 treatment on ADHD symptom in adults 
(AISRS), the study aims to explore treatment response within other domains of the 
disorder, including functional impairment and executive functioning ( Becker et al., 2011 ; 
Wiener et al., 2016 ). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for regulating so-called 
executive functions and for controlling attention and behavior.  Regulation of behavior is 
accomplished through networks of interconnected pyramidal cells, which serve to store 
goals and rules guiding an individual’s actions. These networks interact with each other 
and are highly dependent on their neurochemical environment. A change in the 
neurochemical environment can affect these networks and result in PFC dysfunction 
(Arnsten, 2006 ; Arnsten, 2009 ). ADHD is a chronic, debilitating disorder that affects 
many aspects of daily life and has a substantial burden on personal and professional 
functioning. A person with ADHD can exhibit a number of functional impairments, and 
the motivation in seeking medical treatment typically stems from the need to address 
dysfunction in social, emotional, academic, and/or familial domains ( Epstein and Weiss, 
2012 ). Optimal medical and behavioral management should ideally incorporate 
treatments that do not just improve symptoms of ADHD, but improve the broader 
functioning of a patient, especially in the areas of self-esteem, educational achievement, 
executive function and relationships with peers, teachers, and family. In addition, the 
impact of reducing ADHD symptoms and improving executive function may have an 
impact on the presence and severity of anxiety  in adults, 
 
Therefore, executive function (BRIEF-A), the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms 
(GAD- 7),  
) will be also assessed during the current study. 
In summary, the rationale for studying adult ADHD with SPN-812 is the efficacy and 
tolerability observed in the results from the four Phase 3 pediatric studies and the 
encouraging results in the Phase 2 adult ADHD study.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel group, 
flexible dose study of SPN-812 in adults diagnosed with ADHD per Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – 5th Edition ( DSM -5™) criteria. Approximately 
366 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (183 subjects per arm) : SPN- 812 (200 mg 
to 600 mg) or placebo. Following up to 5 weeks of screening, subjects will be treated 
with study medication (SM) for 6 weeks. Upon completion of the 6-week treatment 
period, subjects will be either enrolled in a separate OLE study or followed for 1 week 
after EOS for safety. The total study duration from the screening visit to the end of the 
treatment period is up to 11 weeks.  
Screening Period (Visit 1) : The screening period is a minimum of 7 days and a 
maximum of 35 days. After informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo initial 
screening evaluations and be administered the screening scales, and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to confirm the subject’s  eligibility. Subjects taking ADHD 
medication at screening will undergo a washout of at least 1 week (or 5 half-lives of the 
medication, whichever is longer) before the Baseline Visit (Day 1). 
Baseline and Randomization (Visit 2):  At the Baseline Visit, inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be reviewed to confirm eligibility, including pregnancy testing for females of 
childbearing potential (FOCP) and urine drug screen . Subjects with positive drug screen 
will be excluded. Subjects will also be administered the AISRS scale and CGI-S. Those 
with a Visit 2 AISRS total score of ≥ 26 and a CGI-S score of ≥ 4 will be eligible for 
randomization, and those with an AISRS total score of < 26 or a CGI-S score of < 4 will 
be excluded from study participation . On Day 1 , eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 
to SPN- 812 200 mg to 600 mg or matching placebo; initial dose should be taken Day 2 .  
Treatment Period (Visits 3 to 7): This period of the study will consist of 6 weeks of 
treatment with dosing starting Day 2 (morning after Visit 2) until Day 43 (Visit 7/EOS). 
The subject’s SM compliance will be assessed throughout the Treatment Period, and 
subjects who are noncompliant may be discontinued. 
Study Medication Treatment ( Visits 3 to 7) :  
All subjects should dose for 6 weeks starting on Day 2 (morning after Visit 2) throug h 
Day 43 (Visit 7/EOS) ( Section 4.2). All subjects will take 2 capsules (SPN-812 200 
mg/day and/or matching placebo) daily starting on Day 1 for the first week (Week 1) 
and 2 capsules (SPN-812 400 mg/day or matching placebo) daily for the second week 
(Week 2) . From Week 3 through Week 6 per the discretion of the Investigator, the 
subject’s dose may be titrated up (maximum 600 mg/day) or tapered down (minimum 
of 200 mg/day) in increments of 200 mg based on the subject’s clinica l response and 
tolerability to SM. Subjects will return to the clinical site for weekly visits during this 
period of the study (except between Visits 6 and 7) to undergo efficacy and safety 
evaluations, return the previous dosing card, and receive the next card. For AEs or 
risks that cannot be managed using permitted concomitant medications ( Section 4.6)

discontinued ( Section 3.4) and an Early Termination (ET) Visit conducted. SM dosing 
will otherwise continue until Visit 7 (Week 6) .  
End of Study (Visit 7) :  
Subjects will return for final study assessments. Subjects terminated from the study 
prior to Visit 7 will also undergo safety evaluations at the time of study withdrawal at 
ET visit, however, if subject’s Early Termination (ET) visit occurs:  
 >7 days after the date of subject’s last dose, efficacy assess ments should not  
be performed/collected at ET visit  
 ≤7 days after the date of subject’s last dose, efficacy assessments should be 
performed/collected at ET visit;  
 
Unscheduled visits may be conducted at the discretion of the Investigator throughout the 
study. AEs will be assessed at all scheduled and unscheduled visits. 
Follow-up/Open-label Extension Period:  Subjects who complete the 6-week treatment 
period may be eligible for an OLE safety trial. Subjects who do not enter the OLE trial 
will be contacted by tele phone for safety follow-up 1 week after the EOS Visit .  
3.2 Rationale for Study Design 
A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of 
an investigational product .  
Dose levels of SPN-812 200 to 600 mg were selected based on the efficacy results from 
the Phase 3 pediatric trials, as well as the low number and low intensity (mild or 
moderate) of AEs observed at doses from 300 to 900 mg in Phase 1 single dose and 
multiple dose studies. 
The AISRS is a validated, robust tool that measures ADHD symptoms and demonstrates 
responsiveness to change with medication in adults ( Spencer et al., 2010 ). Change in 
AISRS total score was selected as the primary outcome measure because AISRS is a 
clinician/investigator structured interview assessing the existence and severity of ADHD 
symptoms per the DSM-IV criteria. The CGI-S was selected as a key secondary 
outcome measure because it is commonly used as a reliable measure of severity of a 
disease/disorder in clinical research, as well as a measure of change in severity over 
time during an experimental treatment.

This document is confidential . It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Any 
viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited . 
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. All reasons for screening failure will be recorded. If the subject passes screening but 
fails eligibility at Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), the reason(s) will also be recorded. 
The Site Investigator(s) or subjects themselves may stop SM treatment at any time for 
safety or personal reasons . A subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time for 
any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the 
institution . The Sponsor may also withdraw the subject at any time in the interest of 
subject safety . The withdrawal of a subject from the study should be discussed where 
possible with the Medical Monitor and Clinical Research Associate (CRA) before the 
subject stops SM . Subjects removed from the study for any reason will not be replaced. 
Reasons for a subject ’s early discontinuation may include: 
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Noncompliance 
 Occurrence of unmanageable AEs 
 Lost to follow- up 
 Other 
The primary reason for the subject ’s early discontinuation, including specific reason why 
subject withdrew consent or PI ended subject’s study , must be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and on the electronic case report form (eCRF) . If the subject withdraws 
consent or the Investigator discontinues the subject’s participation in the study, the 
reason for the subject’s withdraw al or Investigator ’s discontinuation of the subject should 
also be documented and captured on the eCRF. If a subject is withdrawn for more than 
one reason, each reason should be documented in the source document and the most 
medically significant reason should be entered on the eCRF. 
If a subject misses doses of SM during this study, the Investigator shall counsel the 
subject on the importance of compliance . If the subject has consistently missed doses, 
he or she may be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator and in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor; all procedures for discontinuation will be followed.

4.1 Study Medication Identity, Packaging and Labeling 
Study medication is supplied as capsules packaged in a double-blind configuration and 
supplied by the Sponsor in labeled blister cards. Each SM blister card will include 
identical-looking capsules that contain 2 00 mg of SPN- 812 or matching placebo to 
provide daily dose levels of 0 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg of SPN- 812.  
Each blister card will supply a subject with 7 days of dosing plus 2 extra days if needed . 
Each card will be labeled with the protocol number, at a minimum. 
4.2 Study Medication Administration 
Study medication will be administered orally once daily (QD) as intact capsules, with or 
without food. Daily dosing should occur in the morning. Splitting the daily dose (e.g., 
taking part of the daily dose in the morning and the remainder of the daily dose in the 
evening) is not permitted. Study medication will be dispensed to subject following 
randomization on Day 1 (Visit 2), however, subject should take initial dose of study 
medication the next morning on Day 2. During the first 2 weeks of the Treatment Period, 
regardless of treatment arm, subjects will take 2 caps ules QD. During the remaining 4 
weeks of the Treatment Period, subjects may take a minimum of 1 capsule daily up to a 
maximum of 3 capsules QD as follows: per the Investigator’s discretion based on the 
subject’s clinical response and tolerability, the dose of SPN -812 can be titrated up or 
tapered down in increments of 200 mg/day per week to a target dose within the range 
between 200 and 600 mg/day ( Table 1 ). However, it is recommended that subjects 
continue to take 2 capsules during Week 3.

Each SPN- 812 capsule contains 200 mg SPN- 812. 
4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Arm 
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio at Visit 2 (Baseline) to receive placebo 
or active SPN-812.  
Treatment A : Placebo 
Treatment B : SPN- 812 (200 mg to 600 mg)

This document is confidential . It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Any 
viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited . 
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Allocation of study treatment will occur centrally via an interactive web response system 
(IWRS) using a randomization schedule to determine the SM assignment for each 
subject being randomized. A dosing card(s) will be given to the subject at each study 
visit starting at Visit 2. 
4.4 Blinding 
The subject and all personnel involved with the conduct and interpretation of the study, 
including the Investigators, study site personnel, the Sponsor and contract research 
organization ( CRO ) clinical staff, including the Medical Monitor, will be blinded to study 
medication .  
 
 
 
 Randomization schedule data will be kept 
strictly confidential, filed securely by the IWRS vendor, and accessible only to authorized 
persons until the time of unblinding. 
4.5 Study Medication Handling and Accountability 
All SM will be supplied by the Sponsor to the Investigator . SM supplies must be stored in 
an appropriate secure area (e.g., locked cabinet) and stored according to the conditions 
specified on the SM label. 
Following Sponsor instructions and in compliance with International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) E6 as well as local, state, and federal regulations, t he Investigator 
and study staff will be responsible for the accountability of all clinical supplies (receiving, 
shipment, dispensing, inventory, and record keeping) in a SM accountability log, a copy 
of which will be collected by the Sponsor at the end of the study. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator allow the SM to be used other than as 
directed by this protocol . Clinical supplies will not be dispensed to any individual who is 
not enrolled into the study. 
An accurate and timely record of the receipt of all clinical supplies; dispensing of SM to 
the subject; collection of unused supplies; and subsequent return of unused SM to the 
Sponsor must be maintained with dates. This SM accountability log includes, but may 
not be limited to: (a) documentation of receipt of clinical supplies, (b) SM inventory log, 
(c) SM accountability log, and (d) all shipping service receipts. Forms may be provided 
by the Sponsor . Any comparable forms that the study site wishes to use must be 
approved by the Sponsor.  
The supplies and inventory records must be made available, upon request, for 
inspection by the designated representative of the Sponsor, or a representative of the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . The assigned CRA will review these documents 
along with all other study conduct documents at specified intervals once SM has been 
received by the study site . All used, partly used, and unused clinical supplies, including

unless provision is made by the Sponsor for destruction of supplies and containers at the 
study site. Upon completion of SM accountability and reconciliation procedures by study 
site personnel and documentation procedures by Sponsor personnel, SM is to be 
returned to the Sponsor with a copy of the completed SM disposition form. 
4.6 Concomitant Medications  
Subjects may not be on any prohibited medication as indicated in the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. SPN-812 is a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor. Substrates with a narrow therapeutic 
window are prohibited during the study. Specific prohibited concomitant medications for 
this study include known CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, melatonin). Subjects 
receiving prior ADHD medication at screening will undergo a washout period of at least 
1 week (or 5 half-lives of the medication, whichever is longer) before the Baseline Visit 
(Day 1).   
No concomitant medications are allowed during the study, with the following exceptions: 
 Nutritional supplements (e.g., multivitamins, fish oil) (herbal supplements are 
prohibited) 
 EMLA® or other numbing cream for venipuncture 
 Common over-the-counter therapies for minor transient ailments (e. g., 
acetaminophen for headache, ibuprofen for fever). 
Additional concomitant medications are allowable on a case- by-case basis at the 
discretion of the Investigator and sponsor approval. 
All concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Caffeine use is permitted during the study and will be recorded in the eCRF.  
5 STUDY METHODS 
5.1 Study Visits and Procedures 
All subjects who are randomized and take the initial dose of SM will be followed 
according to the protocol regardless of the number of doses of SM taken, unless consent 
for follow- up is withdrawn. The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee must be notified of all 
deviations from the protocol visit or procedures, except as noted, and these procedures, 
if applicable, will be rescheduled or performed at the nearest possible time to the original 
schedule. Subjects will be instructed to call study personnel to report any abnormalities 
during the intervals in between study visits and to come to the study site if medical 
evaluation is needed and as the urgency of the situation indicates . For emergency and 
other unscheduled visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records 
will be obtained by the Investigator or qualified designee as source data for study 
follow- up. 
The Schedule of Events and Assessments for the study is shown in Table 2 .

5.1.7 Future Research 
If the subject consents to have samples used for future research, including but not 
limited to PGx testing, this additional research may not start immediately and may start 
at any time during the sample storage period.  
Subjects who have provided consent for PGx testing will have a blood sample taken at 
baseline . If PGx testing is performed, results from individual tests will be used for 
research purposes only, and a report separate from the clinical study report will be 
generated. Samples will be identified only by the study subject number to maintain 
confidentiality. If a given subject’s  safety data warrant evaluation of PGx, DNA will 
be extracted from that subject’s PGx blood sample and tested for any genetic variations 
associated with CYP2D6 enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of 
viloxazine and genetic variation may affect the PK of SPN-812. Samples will be stored 
for up to 10 years for potential future research purposes such as possible testing of 
genes involved in the efficacy of the drug and possible association with particular 
adverse events of the drug (i.e., to facilitate an understanding of non-responders to 
treatment and/or individuals who show an unusual safety profile). The DNA analysis will 
not be used for individual genetic characterization, and the subject ’s identity will be kept 
confidential.  
Data from samples will not have diagnostic value and will not be used for individual 
genetic characterization or development of a commercial product. At the end of testing 
or 10 years, any remaining samples will be destroyed. The subject may withdraw 
consent for PGx testing at any time; if consent is withdrawn, the subject’s sample will be 
destroyed.

6.1 Efficacy Assessments 
6.1.1 Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) 
The adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) was developed to better 
measure the presence and severity of ADHD symptoms based on DSM-IV diagnostic 
criteria in adult patients ( Spencer et al., 2010 ; Appendix 11.1.1 ). It is a semi-structured 
clinical interview with suggested prompts for each item to improve interrater reliability. 
The scale consists of 18 items that directly correspond to the 18 symptoms of ADHD and 
are further subdivided into two subscales: Inattention (9 items) and 
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (9 items). During the interview with the subject, the 
clinician/investigator rates the frequency and severity of each symptom on a 4-point 
Likert-type scale, where 0 = N one, 1  = Mild, 2 = Moderate, and 3 = Severe, with a 
maximum total score of 54 points and maximum subscale score of 27 points. The scale 
allows the assessment of functional impairments linked to each symptom dimension. 
The AISRS total score is the sum of the Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity 
subscale scores.  
The AISRS is used to assess drug efficacy in the treatment of ADHD in adults, and the 
AISRS total score is the primary outcome measure for this study.  
6.1.2 Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI-S)  
The CGI scale was developed to provide a brief, stand-alone assessment of the 
clinician’s view of a subject’s global functioning prior t o and after administration of SM 
(Guy, 1976 ). The Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S ; Appendix 
11.1.2 ) is a single item clinician rating of the clinician’s assessment of the severity of the 
ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician’s total experience with patients with ADHD . 
The CGI- S is evaluated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = Normal , not at all ill , 
asymptomatic , 2 = Borderline Ill, 3 = Mildly Ill, 4 = Moderately Ill, 5 = Markedly Ill, 6 = 
Severely Ill, and 7 = Extremely Ill . Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overal l 
score in subsequent testing. 
6.1.3 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7)  
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 scale (GAD-7) is a self-reported 7-item questionnaire for 
screening and measuring the severity of generalized anxiety disorder ( Spitzer et al., 
2006 ; Appendix 11.1.4 ). The GAD- 7 measures the severity of various symptoms of 
generalized anxiety disorder over the past 2 weeks according to reported response 
categories with assigned points. The patient scores each GAD-7 item on 4-point Likert 
scale , where 0 = N ot at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = Over half the days, and 3 = Nearly 
every day. The clinician/investigator can obtain the total score by summating all 7 items. 
GAD-7 total scores range from 0 to 21, where a total score of 1 to 4 = None/Minimal 
anxiety, 5 to 9 = Mild anxiety, 10 to 14 = Moderate anxiety, and ≥  15 = Severe anxiety. It 
takes less than 5 minutes to complete the GAD-7.

The CGI scale was developed to provide a brief, stand-alone assessment of the 
clinician’s view of a subject’s global functioning prior t o and after administration of SM 
(Guy, 1976 ). The Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale (CGI-I ; Appendix 
11.1.3 ) is an assessment of how much the patient’s illness has improved or worsened 
relative to a baseline state at the beginning of treatment. The CGI-I is evaluated by the 
investigator at each post- baseline study visit during treatment relative to the subject’s 
condition at baseline on a 7-point scale where 1 = Very much improved, 2 = Much 
improved, 3 = Minimally improved, 4 = No change, 5 = Minimally worse, 6 = Much 
worse, and 7 = Very much worse . Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overal l 
score in subsequent testing. The CGI- S assessment obtained at the baseline visit should 
serve as a basis for the investigator’s CGI -I assessment of improvement in the subject’s 
conditions at each post-baseline study visit during the treatment period. 
6.1.5 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function –Adult (BRIEF- A) 
The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function –Adult Version (BRIEF-A ; Self 
report ) is a standardized rating scale that captures views of an individual’s executive 
functions into everyday behaviors in adults ages 18 to 90 years ( Roth et al., 2005 ; Roth 
et al., 2013 ; Appendix 11.1.5 ). It has been utilized in clinical trials to assess changes in 
executive function with treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders, including 
ADHD ( Adler et al 2014 ). The BRIEF-A is 75-item in nine non overlapping scales and 
two summary index scales that assesses aspects of executive function and problems 
with self-regulation from the perspective of the individual. The subject rates each item on 
a 3-point Likert scale (Never, Sometimes, or Often) based on their experienced within 
the last month. Higher scores indicate poor er executive function. The BRIEF-A takes 15-
20 minutes to complete. The self-report provides th e insight of the individual’s viewpoint 
of their own difficulties in self-regulation.  
Description of the nine BRIEF-A scales ( Roth et al., 2013 ) by summary index scale: 
1. The Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) captures the ability to maintain 
appropriate regulatory control of one’s own behavior and emotional responses. 
The BRI is broken down into the following four scales within the BRIEF- A: 
 Inhibit: Control impulses; appropriately stop verbal, attentional, physical 
behavior at the proper time 
 Shift: Move freely from one situation, activity, or aspect of a problem to 
another as the situation demands; think flexibly to aid problem-solving 
 Emotional control: Modulate one’s emotional responses appropriately  
 Self-Monitor: Recognize the effect of one’s own behavior on others  
2. The Metacognitive Index (MI) reflects the individual’s ability to initiate activity and 
generate problem-solving ideas, to sustain working memory, to plan and 
organize problem-solving approaches, to monitor success and failure in problem

into the following four scales within the BRIEF- A: 
 Initiate: Begin a task or activity without external prompting; independently 
generate ideas 
 Working memory: Hold information in mind in order to complete a task; stay 
with, or stick to, an activity 
 Plan/organize: Anticipate future events; set goals; develop steps ahead of 
time to carry out a task; organize information and behavior to achieve and 
objective; carry out tasks in a systematic manner 
 Task Monitor: Assess performance during or after finishing a task for 
mistakes 
 Organization of Materials: Keep workspace and living areas in an orderly 
manner; keep track of materials needed for tasks 
6.1.6 Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) 
The Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) is designed to measure the severity 
of symptoms across several subtypes of depression and was developed (items chosen) 
on the basis of the most current knowledge of depressive symptoms and Major 
Depressive Disorder (MDD) subtypes ( Pedrelli et al., 2014 ; Appendix 11.1.6 ). The SDQ 
is a 44-item self-report depression scale that inquires about an extensive number of 
depressive symptoms. Items reflect a broad and heterogeneous collection of depression 
related symptom features, and it includes several items that inquire about anxiety 
symptoms. The SDQ has been utilized in clinical trials along with other commonly used 
scales like the Montogmery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) assessing 
potential treatments in patients with depression ( Fava et al., 2016; Papakostas et al., 
2019 ).  The subject self-rates/scores each item on a 6-point scale (1-6) as it pertains to 
the past month. Each item is rated based on a subject’s perception of what is normal for 
the individual (score = 2), what is better than normal (score = 1), and what is worse than 
normal (scores = 3 –6). A SDQ average (mean) score greater than 3.5, which is 
equivalent to a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of 25, is 
consistent with severe depression ( Fava et al., 2016 ). The clinician/investigator 
generates a total score (SDQ-T) by summated all 44 scores. SDQ total scores can range 
from 44-264. SDQ -T refers to the total score of the SDQ. SDQ-1 subscale includes items 
related to lassitude, mood, and cognitive functioning; SDQ-2 subscale includes items 
related to anxiety, agitation, irritability, and anger; SDQ-3 subscale includes items 
related to suicidal ideation. SDQ-4 subscale assesses disruptions in sleep quality. SDQ-
5 subscale includes items on changes in appetite and weight. The SDQ takes less than 
10 minutes to complete.

6.2 Safety Variables and Assessments  
Safety assessments include monitoring, evaluation, and recording of all concomitant 
medications, and the evaluation of AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and 
12-lead ECGs, C- SSRS , and the performance of physical examinations as detailed in 
the Schedule of Events and Assessments. 
Investigat ors are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this 
study and for alerting Supernus or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if 
this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subjects.  
6.2.1 Adverse Events  
As defined by the ICH Guideline for G ood Clinical Practice (GCP), an adverse event 
(AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with treatment. 
An AE can be, for example: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
• Any new disease, intercurrent injuries, or exacerbation of an existing disease.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. • Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in 
symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation from SM. 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline. 
Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
require surgery . The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period.  
6.2.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are defined as seizure or AEs that might 
represent a seizure. This includes, but is not limited to syncope/syncopal episode, 
pseudoseizure, myoclonus, and severe muscle spasms. 
6.2.3 Causality 
Adverse events may be categorized as either Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected 
Adverse Drug Reactions based on their relationship to SM and the degree of certainty 
about causality. 
Suspected adverse drug reactions (SADRs) are a subset of adverse events for which 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, i.e., 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event .  
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a subset of all SADRs for which there is reason to 
conclude that the drug caused the event. 
6.2.4 Recording and Evaluation of Adverse Events 
All subjects who are screened (Visit 1) will be questioned regarding any current and prior 
medical health status or diagnoses, which will be documented as medical history . At 
each contact with the subject following first dose of SM (post-Visit 2) , the Investigator 
must seek information on AEs by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by 
examination . Information on all AEs should be recorded immediately in the source 
document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the eCRF . All clearly 
related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
recorded in the source document, though they may be grouped under one diagnosis . For 
example, fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest X-ray, etc., can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”.  
All AEs occurring after Visit 2 and throughout the study period must be recorded . A 
treatme nt-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with a start date on or 
after the first dose of study medication is taken, or that worsened following first 
administration of study medication . All AEs in this study will be recorded after 
administration of SM, therefore all will be treatment-emergent . The clinical course of 
each AE should be followed for at least 30 days following the date of last dose of SM 
(either due to EOS or ET) or until resolution, or until, in the medical judgment of the 
Investigator, the event has stabilized or is assessed as chronic.

This document is confidential . It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Any 
viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited . 
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. The Investigator is responsible for evaluating AEs and determining the following: 
• Serious vs. Non-serious: Is the event a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)? 
• Causality: Was AE related or possibly related to the SM? 
• Severity: How pronounced is the incapacity/discomfort caused by an AE? 
6.2.5 Criteria for Assessing Severity 
The Investigator will evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to 
treatment in order that he or she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE . 
Severity refers to the accumulated intensity of discomfort/impairment of health since the 
last recording of AEs and will be assessed according to the following criteria: 
• Mild:  Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated 
• Moderate: Discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity and may 
warrant intervention 
• Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly 
affects clinical status and warrants intervention 
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness. 
6.2.6 Criteria for Assessing Causality 
The Investigator is responsible for determining the relationship between the 
administration of SM and the occurrence of an AE as not suspected or as a suspected 
reaction to SM . These are defined as follows: 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a 
causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying 
conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• Not related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is missing or 
implausible, or there is an evident other cause. 
• Unlikely related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable; and other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations. 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal  
relationship possible , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying 
conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• Possibly related:   Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, but 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals could also explain event . 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear . This will be 
reported as a Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) . 
• Definitely related : Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, 
and concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain event . The 
response to withdrawal of the medication (dechallenge) should be clinically 
plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary . 
This will be reported as an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) .

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 6.2.7 Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious . An AE or ADR is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in one of the 
following outcomes:  
 death 
 life-threatening AE (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE 
as it occurred . This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.) 
 in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may 
jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above . For example, drug overdose or abuse, blood dyscrasias, a 
seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization or intensive treatment for allergic 
bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be considered serious. 
6.2.8 Investigator Responsibilities for Reporting SAEs 
The Investigator must immediately report to the Sponsor all SAEs, regardless of whether 
the Investigator believes they are drug related. 
All SAEs must be reported to the Drug Safety Contact within 24 hours of first becoming 
aware of the SAE . The Investigator must complete an SAE Form and include a detailed 
description of the SAE, as well as other available information pertinent to the case (e.g., 
hospital records, autopsy reports and other relevant documents) . The Investigator will 
keep a copy of this SAE Report form on file at the study site. 
The Investigator or study physician, after thorough consideration of all facts that are 
available, must include an assessment of causality of an AE to SM in the report to the 
Sponsor. 
SAEs should be followed until resolution or until no further/additional information can be 
obtained regarding the event. Follow-up information, or new information available after 
the initial report, should be actively sought and reported to the Sponsor, as it becomes 
available, using the SAE Report Form. 
The Drug Safety Contact for SAE reporting is:

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 6.2.9 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting 
The Investigator must report a pregnancy that occurs in a subject during a clinical study 
to the Drug Safety Contact within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event . 
Subjects who become pregnant during the study should be discontinued from study 
medication immediately. Pregnancy should be reported on a Pregnancy Report Form . 
The Investigator should discuss the case with the Medical Monitor; the Investigator must 
follow any pregnant subject for 3 months after the child is born . Any AEs concerning the 
pregnancy of the subject during pregnancy or the child after birth must be documented 
and reported to the Sponsor. 
Acute suicidal crisis or clinically significant suicidal behavior or ideation should be 
reported to the Drug Safety Contact within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event. 
6.2.10 Sponsor Responsibilities for Reporting SAEs 
The Sponsor will inform Investigators and regulatory authorities of reportable events, in 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis (i.e., within 
specific timeframes) . For this reason, it is imperative that study sites submit SAE 
information to the Sponsor in the manner described above. 
Investigators must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) . Investigators must also submit 
the safety information provided by the Sponsor to the IRB unless the country legal 
regulation requires that the Sponsor should be responsible for the safety reporting to the 
IRB. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to notify all participating Investigators, in a written 
IND safety report, of any SADR that is both serious and unexpected . The Sponsor will 
also notify participating Investigators of any findings from other sources (other studies, 
animal and in vitro testing, etc.) that suggest a significant risk for human subjects . Such 
findings will typically lead to safety-related changes in the study protocol, Informed 
Consent, and/or Investigator ’s Brochure.  
6.3 Treatment-Emergent Suicidal Ideation 
Prospective assessment of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior is a mandatory part of 
the safety evaluations for any drug developed for a psychiatric indication ( FDA, 2012 ). In 
this study, the initial evaluation of subjects will be conducted prior to enrollment to 
assess lifetime suicidal ideation and to identify subjects who must not participate in the 
trial due to pre-existing suicidality risk . The assessment will then be repeated at each 
subsequent study visit to monitor the occurrence of new suicidal and self-injurious 
tendencies. 
6.3.1 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior will be conducted using the Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)  (Posner et al., 2 011; [Baseline]  Appendix 
11.1.10 ; [Since Last Visit] Appendix 11.1.11 ). The C-SSRS is an FDA-recommended 
prospective assessment instrument that directly classifies suicidal ideation and behavior

suicidal behavior, and the category of self-injurious behaviors with no suicidal intent .  
The instrument has been validated used successfully in adult patients with various 
psychiatric disorders that do not involve cognitive impairment . The C-SSRS outcomes 
that can be used for clinical management and safety monitoring are suicidal lethality 
rating, suicidal ideation score, and suicidal ideation intensity rating. 
6.3.2 Suicide Risk Management Plan 
The protocol procedures related to clinical care of patients with treatment-emergent 
suicidal ideation and behavior must be implemented to ensure proper management of 
the event and protection of subject’s safety . If a disclosure of suicidal ideation is 
revealed as part of the C-SSRS questionnaire or when a subject spontaneously 
expresses that he/she may be a threat to him/herself, the study team should be 
prepared to quickly evaluate the event and to determine the appropriate course of 
action. 
6.3.2.1 Assessment of Suicide Risk 
Any indication of suicidal ideation should be evaluated as soon as possible by 
appropriately trained staff. The Investigator is responsible for making the final judgment 
regarding potential suicide risk and need subsequent action.  
6.3.2.2 Acute Suicidal Crisis 
A person evaluated as being at high risk should be transferred to an immediate care 
facility. The Investigator will guide intervention as clinically indicated and follow up with 
the subject within 1 week and/or refer him/her to a qualified mental health professional. 
6.3.2.3 Non-acute Suicidal Risk 
The Investigator will conduct safety planning with the subject and will follow up within 
1 week. 
Reference materials for subjects and caregivers should include lists of mental health 
organizations and professionals, outpatient behavioral services, local crisis and peer 
support groups and Suicide/Crisis Hotlines. 
6.4 Clinical Measurements 
6.4.1 Screening and Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a central laboratory as specified in the 
reference binder. 
Details for collecting, handling, and shipping samples (including shipment addresses) 
will be detailed in a separate clinical laboratory manual . The Schedule of Events and 
Assessments ( Table 2 ) shows the time points at which blood and urine samples will be 
collected. Table 3  presents the clinical laboratory tests to be performed. At Screening

Physical examinations and measurement of height will be obtained at the time points 
shown in the Schedule of Events and Assessments ( Table 2 ). The physical examination 
conducted at screening will include assessments of all body systems except 
genitourinary . Any findings during screening will be recorded as medical history and any 
clinically significant abnormal findings during treatment will be recorded as a n AE. At the 
EOS physical examination, only changes from baseline (Screening Visit) will be noted.  
6.4.4 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
A 12-lead ECG will be obtai ned at the time points shown in the Schedule of Events and 
Assessments ( Table 2 ). Additional ECGs may be performed at other times if deemed 
necessary by the Investigator. 
The ECG will be recorded while the subject is resting in a supine position for at least 
10 minutes . The ECG will electronically measure the PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, 
and heart rate . All ECG tracings will be reviewed within 24 hours by the Investigator or 
qualified Sub-investigator . PR intervals will be determined for each of these ECGs from 
a single reading . Invalid measurements will be repeated . QTc will be reported as QTcF 
(QT corrected using Fridericia's method).  
  
 
 
 
6.6 Screening Scales and Assessment Tools 
6.6.1 Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 - Clinical Trials (SCID-5-CT) 
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) is a semi-structured interview 
guide for making the major DSM-5 diagnoses ( Spitzer et al., 1992 ; First et al., 2015 ; 
Appendix 11.1.8 ). It is administered by a clinician or trained mental health professional 
who is familiar with the DSM-5 classification and diagnostic criteria. The Clinical Trials 
version (SCID-5-CT) is an adaptation of the Research version (SCID-5-RV) that has 
been reformatted, streamlined, and optimized for use in clinical trials that incorporate 
typical inclusion and exclusion criteria. The SCID is broken down into separate modules 
corresponding to categories of diagnoses, including ADHD. Most sections begin with an 
entry question that would allow the interviewer to "skip" the associated questions if not 
met. For all diagnoses, symptoms are coded as present, subthreshold, or absent. A 
diagnosis of ADHD is made following the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnostic 
algorithm.  
6.6.2 Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM- A) 
The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a rating scale developed to 
assess/measure the severity of an individual’s anxiety ( Hamilton, 1959 ; Appendix 
11.1.9 ). The HAM-A is used to assess severity of anxiety in children, adolescents and 
 dacted

Borkovec et al., 1993 ). The HAM-A consists of 14 items or parameters, each defined by 
a series of symptoms. It measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and 
psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). The 
HAM-A does not provide any standardized probe questions. The HAM-A is a clinician-
rated evaluation. Each item on the HAM-A is rated/scored on a 5-point Likert scale, 
where 0 = Not present, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe, and 4 = Very severe. The 
ratings/scores of all 14 items are summated to yield a total score (ranging from 0 to 56) , 
where ≤  17 indicates “mild anxiety severity ,” 18 to 24 indicates “moderate anxiety 
severity, ” 25 to 30 indicates “moderate to severe anxiety severity ,” and ≥  31 indicates 
“severe anxiety .” It take 5 to 10 minutes to complete the HAM- A.

6.7 Subject training video module  
Study subject perceptions of clinical research can affect response to study treatments, 
including placebo ( Leuchter et al., 2014 ).  In order to provide education and thereby 
reduce aspects of placebo response which may be associated with expectation of 
therapeutic benefit, all participants will view a brief training module which reviews key 
topics including (a) their role in the trial, (b) the difference between medical care and 
research, (c) the use of placebo and (d) the importance of accurate reporting of 
symptoms throughout the trial. These will be organized into short segments of ~2- 3 
minutes each and will be delivered in non-technical language to help encourage 
comprehension. Site personnel will help facilitate viewing throughout the trial at the 
screening and baseline visits and predetermined study visits thereafter (see Schedule of 
Events; Table 2 ) in an appropriate location and be available to answer any questions 
that the study participant may have.

7.1 General Considerations 
All statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.2 or higher either by 
Supernus or a designated CRO. A unique program will be developed for each created TLF 
report. All corresponding programs will be delivered to Supernus at the completion of the 
study if a designated CRO is used. 
All tabulations of analysis results will include summaries for treatment arms of SPN-812 
and placebo. 
In this study, estimands will be estimated using appropriate statistical methods 
appropriate model (MMRM, ANCOVA, etc.) as described Section 7.8 for the efficacy 
analyses.  
Where appropriate, variables will be summarized descriptively (frequency count and 
percentage for categorical variables; number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables).  
Categorical variables will be analyzed using categorical response methods such as 
Pearson’s Chi -square test.  If expected frequencies are too small for asymptotic 
assumptions, exact testing techniques will be used. 
The data summaries will be accompanied by individual subject data listings, as specified 
in Sections 16.2 and 16.4 of ICH Guidance E3, sorted by unique subject identifier . All 
data available from the eCRFs will be listed. Unscheduled measurements will be 
excluded from the descriptive statistics and statistical analysis but will be included in 
listings. 
Complete details of the statistical analysis will be provided in a separate statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). The statistical analysis methods described in the SAP will 
supersede the statistical methods described in this protocol. 
7.2 Handling of Missing Data 
With respect to the primary analysis, missing AISRS Total Scores will be assumed to be 
missing at random (MAR), that is, given the observed data, the reason for the missing 
data does not depend on the unseen data. The mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) method, implemented via SAS® PROC MIXED (SAS/STAT Software), will be 
used for handling missing AISRS Total Scores under MAR assumption. Under MAR, the 
propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data, but is related 
to some of the observed data.  
The sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be performed by assuming that 
missing AISRS Total Scores are missing not at random (MNAR) meaning that the 
probability that an observation is missing may depend on its underlying unobserved 
value.  
For analysis of secondary endpoints, missing values will be assumed as MAR.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. For safety analyses, missing dates for AEs and non-study medication use will be 
imputed as described in the SAP. Missing data for all other safety endpoints will not be 
imputed. 
7.3 Analysis Populations 
The Randomized Population  is all subjects who complete the Baseline Period, meet 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are randomized. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  is a subset of subjects in the Randomized Population who 
took at least one dose of study medication, and had a Baseline and at least one post-
Baseline assessment of AISRS. Subjects in the FAS will be analyzed according to the 
treatment to which they were randomized. The efficacy analyses will be conducted using 
the FAS. 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population  is a subset of subjects in the FAS who complete all 
7 visits through EOS with no missing AISRS assessments and no major protocol 
violations. Subjects in the PP Population will be analyzed according to the treatmen t 
received. 
The Safety Population  is all subjects randomized into the study who receive at least 
one dose of SM. Subjects in the Safety Population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment received. 
 
 
7.4 Demographics and Baseline Analysis 
Demographic/baseline variables including age, age group, sex, ethnicity, race, height 
and weight at screening, and BMI will be summarized using descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables and using counts and percentages for categorical variables. The 
descriptive summary will be presented by treatment group  for the Randomized 
Population, FAS, and Safety Population.  
Baseline comparability among the treatment groups will be summarized using a chi-
square test for categorical variables and F-test for continuous variables. P-values will be 
used for descriptive purposes only. 
7.5 Subject Disposition 
A disposition of subjects will include the number and percentage of subjects in each of 
the following categories: 
 Subjects in the Randomized Population 
 Subjects in the FAS 
 Subjects in the PP Population 
 Subjects in the Safety Population 
Within each of the previous categories, the number and percentage of subjects who 
completed and discontinued from the study and primary reason for early discontinuation 
will be summarized. The reason for early discontinuation may include any of the 
following: 
 Withdrawal of consent

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study.  Noncompliance 
 Occurrence of unmanageable AEs 
 Lost to follow- up 
 Other 
7.6 Study Medication Exposure and Compliance 
Duration of exposure is defined as the total number of days a subject is exposed to any 
SM. This will be calculated for each subject by taking the difference between the date of 
last dose minus the date of the first dose, plus 1 (date of last dose minus date of first 
dose +1). 
Duration of treatment exposure will be summarized by duration category and will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum). 
Percent of SM compliance is defined as {(number of capsules dispensed minus number 
of capsules returned) / X × (date of last dose minus date of first dose + 1)}* 100%, where 
‘X’ is equal to 1 (200 mg) or 2 (2X200 mg), or 3 (3x 200 mg) (the number of capsules 
that the subject was instructed to take daily during the treatment period (i.e, between 
visits)). 
% 𝑆𝑀 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = [(no.of capsules dispensed) − ( no.of capsules returned)
X × [(date of last dose) − (date of first dose )+ 1]] ×100  
For each treatment, SM compliance will be summarized by compliance category (<80%, 
80-120%, and >120%) and number of subjects in each compliance category . Study 
medication compliance will also be summarized as a continuous variable using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) for each 
treatment. 
7.7 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11-digit code using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODD) drug codes . Concomitant medications will be 
further coded to the appropriate Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) code indicating 
therapeutic classification . A tabular summary of concomitant medications by drug class 
will be presented for the Safety Population. 
7.8 Efficacy Analysis 
7.8.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in AISRS total score to Week 6 
(EOS), will be analyzed using MMRM, which assumes that missing data are MAR. The 
model will include fixed effect terms for baseline AISRS total score, treatment, visit, and 
treatment- by-visit interaction as independent variables. The model parameters will be 
estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method with unstructured 
variance-covariance matrix and Kenward-Roger approximation to estimate denominator

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. degrees of freedom. In case there is a convergence problem in the MMRM model with 
the unstructured variance-covariance matrix, the first (co)variance structure that does 
not have convergence problem will be used for the analysis from the following ordered 
list: 1) Toeplitz, 2) Autoregressive of order 1, and 3) Compound symmetry. The adjusted 
mean (least square mean [LS m ean]) of change from baseline to EOS for AISRS total 
score for each treatment arm (placebo and SPN-812) will be presented, along with the 
corresponding standard error. The SPN-812 treatment arm will be compared with 
placebo. The LS means of the treatment groups, differences between the LS treatment 
mean and placebo, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the treatment differences with 
p-values will be computed. 
7.8.1.1 Sensitivity Analysis 
The sensitivity analysis assumes that missing AISRS total scores are MNAR. Placebo-
based multiple imputation will be used to fill-in missing values. This approach may be 
considered “worst -case” sensitivity analyses as it assumes that after discontinuation, 
subjects from the SPN-812 treatment arm would adopt the outcome model estimated 
from the placebo arm. The placebo-based imputation will be implemented, which will be 
described in the SAP. 
7.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary analyses will be based on the FAS with missing values imputed using 
multiple imputation assuming MAR. 
All secondary analyses will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) [except categorical 
CGI, 50% responder and 30% responder, which use Pearson’s Chi -squared test or 
Fisher exact test on the absolute value at Week 6 (EOS)] on the change from baseline at 
Week 6 (EOS) (except CGI-I, which uses the absolute value) with treatment and 
baseline (baseline CGI-S will be used for CGI- I) as fixed effect. The SPN-812 treatment 
arm will be compared with the placebo arm. The LS means of the treatment groups, 
differences between the LS treatment means and placebo (SPN- 812 minus placebo), 
and 95% CIs for the treatment differences with p-values will be computed. 
7.8.2.1 Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The analysis of the key secondary objective will be conducted on the CFB at EOS in the 
CGI-S score  
To preserve the overall type I error rate at 0.05 for the key secondary endpoint, a 
sequential testing procedure will be used with the following features. The key secondary 
endpoint will only be test ed if SPN-812 treatment is significantly different from placebo 
for the primary endpoint.   
7.8.2.2 Additional Secondary Analyses 
Additional secondary analyses of the secondary efficacy variables will include: 
1. Percentage of subjects with a CGI-S score of 1 or 2 weekly and at EOS.

each treatment group. The 2-sided 95% CI around the difference in 
proportions (SPN-812 minus placebo) and the p- value from Pearson’s Chi 
squared Test or Fisher’s  Exact Test will be presented.  
2. CGI-I score at EOS    
 The absolute value of CGI- I weekly and at EOS (Week 6) will be analyzed 
using ANCOVA with treatment as a fixed classification variable and baseline 
CGI-S as a covariate. To compare the treatment groups, the difference in LS 
means (SPN- 812 minus placebo) will be presented along with the 95% CI 
around the difference and p-value. 
3. Percentage of subjects with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 weekly and at EOS  
 The proportion (%) of responders (CGI-I score of 1 or 2) will be presented for 
each treatment group. The 2-sided 95% CI around the difference in 
proportions (SPN-812 minus placebo) and the p- value from Pearson’s 
Chi-squared Test or Fisher’s Exact Test will be presented.  
4. CFB biweekly and at EOS (Week 6) in the G AD-7 total score 
5. CFB weekly (Week 6) in the AISRS Inattention subscale score and the 
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale score at EOS

AISRS total score) weekly and at EOS 
 The proportion (%) of responders will be presented for each treatment group. 
The 2-sided 95% CI around the difference in proportions (SPN- 812 minus 
placebo) and the p- value from Pearson’s Chi -squared Test or Fisher’s Exact 
Test will be presented.

7.9 Sample Size and Power Considerations 
Assuming an effect size of 0.407 , 128 subjects per treatment arm ( 256 total subjects for 
2 arms) in the FAS will yield 90% power at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) to 
reject the equality of treatment means between the placebo and the SPN-812 treatment 
group .  
Assuming approximately 30% of subject s drop out before the completion of the study, an 
adjusted sample size of 366 subjects ( 183 per arm) will be randomized to obtain 
128 subjects per arm in the FAS at the completion of the study . 
7.10 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis will be performed. 
 
 
 
 
7.12 Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will be performed by treatment arm based on the Safety Population.  
The incidence rate of AEs will be calculated by treatment arm for each system organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) . The severity of the AEs and the relationship to SM 
will be summarized by treatment arm for each SOC and PT. 
AEs will be summarized using discrete summaries at the subject and event level by SOC 
and PT, and by severity and relationship separately for each treatment arm . Verbatim 
description and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) SOCs and PTs 
for all AEs will be contained in the subject data listings. 
Clinical laboratory values will be summarized by visit by treatment arm using descriptive 
statistics . For quantitative laboratory parameters, both actual values and change from 
screening values will be summarized. 
Vital signs will be summarized by visit by treatment arm using descriptive statistics . Both 
actual values and change from baseline will be summarized. 
ECG results will be summarized by visit by treatment arm using descriptive statistics (for 
quantitative ECG parameters) and frequency tables (for qualitative ECG parameters, 
including the overall ECG finding). 
C-SSRS outcomes will be summarized using number and percent of subjects by 
categories for suicidal ideation only, suicidal behavior only and suicidality (ideation and 
behavior combined). The summary will be presented by treatment arm.

8.1 Adherence to the Protocol 
The Investigator agrees, when signing the protocol, to adhere to the instructions and 
procedures described within and to the principles of ICH GCP as well as all governing 
local regulations and principles for medical research. 
The protocol, ICF, and appropriate related documents must be reviewed and approved 
by an IRB constituted and functioning in accordance with ICH E6 and any local 
regulations. Documentation of IRB compliance with the ICH and any local regulations 
regarding constitution and review conduct will be provided to the Sponsor. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB must be sent to the Investigator with a 
copy to the Sponsor prior to study start and the release of SM to the site by the Sponsor 
or its designee . If the IRB decides to suspend or terminate the study, the Investigator will 
immediately send the notice of study suspension or termination by the IRB to the 
Sponsor. 
8.2 Changes to the Protocol 
Changes to the protocol will not be made without written approval from the Sponsor. 
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative 
change that must be approved by the Sponsor before implementation . Amendments 
specifically affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the 
scientific quality of the study require additional approval by the applicable IRB, and in 
some cases, filings to the regulatory authority . These requirements should in no way 
prevent any immediate action from being taken by the Investigator, or by the Sponsor, in 
the interest of preserving the safety of all subjects included in the study . If an immediate 
change to the protocol is felt by the Investigator to be necessary for safety reasons, the 
Medical Monitor, and IRB must be notified promptly. 
Changes to the protocol which are administrative in nature do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB approval, but the IRB must be kept informed of such changes . In 
these cases, the Sponsor or CRO will send a letter to the IRB detailing such changes. 
8.3 Data Quality Assurance 
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, 
standard operating procedures (SOPs), working practice documents, and applicable 
regulations and guidelines . Site visit audits may be made periodically by the Sponsor’s

be documented and returned to the study site for resolution . Only authorized personnel 
will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections will be documented in 
an audit trail.  
8.3.4 Bioanalytical Sample Handling 
Viloxazine and 5-hydroxy-viloxazine glucuronide concentrations in plasma samples will 
be determined using a validated chromatographic method. Viloxazine concentrations will 
be reported as viloxazine free base. Details on the analytical methodology, the method 
of validation, and the analytical within-study quality control procedures will be included in 
the clinical study report.  
8.4 Retention of Records 
The Investigator has the responsibility to retain all study “essential documents”, as 
described in ICH E6 for at least two years after approval of a marketing application or 
after formal discontinuation of the clinical program . Essential documents include but not 
limited to the protocol, eCRFs, source documents, laboratory test results, SM inventory 
records, Investigator's Brochure, regulatory agency registration documents (e.g., FDA

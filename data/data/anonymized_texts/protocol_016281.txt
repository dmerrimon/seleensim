Objectives:   The primary objective of the study is as follows:  
• To determine if TD -9855 has an acute  (Part s A and B)  and sustained (Part C) pressor 
response and  improves symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in subjects with nOH due to 
MSA, PAF , or Parkinson’s disease.  
The secondary objective(s) of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with nOH. 
• To evaluate the PK  and PD  (NE and DH PG) of TD -9855 after single and  multiple doses 
in subjects with nOH.  
Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, 3 part, single -blind  (Part A) , double- blind (Part B), and 
open- label multiple dose extension (Part C)  study  of TD -9855 versu s placebo in subjects 
with nOH.   However, beginning with Amendment 2 of this protocol, Part B of the study has 
been discontinued.  Therefore, any new subjects enrolled after Amendment 2 will not be 
enrolled in Part B.  Details regarding Part B are still  included in this document but where 
appropriate the reader is referred to prior version of this protocol for more specific 
information related to Part B.  
This study now consist s of 2 Parts, A  and C.  Part A follows a daily, single , escalating dose 
design starting with placebo on Day 1, followed by a dose of  TD-9855 
on Day 2, and 
proceedi
ng to escalating higher doses of TD -9855 on a daily basis up to a max imum  dose of 
 based on safety, tolerability, and determination of a pressor effect.  In Part C, 
subjects who demonstrate a pressor effect in Part A , who complete Part  A, and remain 
otherwise eligible will have the option to receive open- label TD -9855 b y tablet daily for up to 
  
Study P
rocedures:  
Part A – Dose Escalation 
On Da y -2 of Part A, e ligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research center ( CRC) , 
where they will remain during the entire dose escalation period.  On Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of placebo in a single -blind manner  (ie, subject  remai ns blinded) .  This 
will be followed by daily single -blind dose escalations, beginning with of TD -9855 on 
Day 2 .  On each subsequent day, subject s will receive a single escalating dose of TD -9855

stopping criteria described below , which ever occurs first.  The stopping criteria are: 
• A determination from the Investigator (in collaboration with the Sponsor) that 
administration of the subsequent dose may pose a safety co ncern  
• SBP ≥ 180 mm or DBP ≥ 110 mm in the sitting position replicated 2 more times over 
an hour  
• Intolerable  side effects  as determined by the Investigator  
• Received maximum dose of study medication specified by the protocol  
Once the subject meets any of the above criteria, no further dose escalation will be 
performed .  However, based on the daily evaluation of tolerability, the Investigator 
(in collaboration with the Sponsor), may decide to not escalate the dose, but rather 
re-administer the previous dose from the prior day.  Once the decision has been made to 
not escalate the dose, the subject may remain at the current dose through Day  5 of dosing . 
Following  a post dosing observation day in the clinic,  the subject will have d ischarge 
procedures  completed and will be released from the CRC.   
Subjects who d o not demonstrate a clinically meaningful pressor effect  based on 
Investigator determination (in collaboration with the Sponsor) , or who discontinue study drug 
prior to reaching the stopping criteria , should have disch arge procedures completed, but will 
not continue to study Part C. 
Washout Period 
Following the completion of Part A, eligible subjects will be discharged from the CRC and 
undergo a washout period (   On a daily basis during  the first 72 hour s from 
discharge, and then weekly  for the first 4 weeks after discharge from Part A  during the 
washout period, the Investigator or designee will contact the subject by telephone to review 
the subject’s health status.  Any adverse events report ed by phone will be recorded and 
followed as medically appropriate  determined by the Investigator.  Under the direction of the 
Investigator , subjects will manage  their nOH symptoms using  fludrocortisone  as prescribed.  
Part B – Randomized , Double- blind, Parallel Design 
Beginning with Amendment 2 of this protocol, Part B of the study has been discontinued.  
Refer to prior versions of this protocol for specific details regarding Part B.  
Part C – Open Label Extension  
In Part C , subjects who demonstrate a pressor effect in Part A , who complete Part  A and 
remain otherwise eligible will have the option to participate in Part C and receive open- label 
TD-9855  by tablet once daily for up to    
The dose level administered on Day 1 in Part  C will be  equal to  of the highest tolerated 
dose level (rounded- up to the nearest 1  mg) administered during Part  A for that subject (or a 
lower dose at the discretion of the principal investigator to manage individual subject safety). Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 2, and continue at the same 
dose level as Day 1 of Part  C.  At the subsequent scheduled visits  until Day 29 , the 
Investigator has the option to double the subject’s dose level at their discretion, if in their 
opinion the subject will benefit from, and can tolerate, a higher dose level. After Day 29, 
dose increases will need to be discussed with the Sponsor.  It is recommended that the subject receives at least 7 daily doses of TD -9855 at any single dose level before escalation 
to a highe r dose to allow  TD-9855 exposure to reach steady state  at the lower  dose .

In the case where a subject develops the presence or worsening of supine hypertension 
(as determined by the Investigator with agreement from the Sponsor) or other adverse 
event s suggesting intolerability , the dose can be  withheld for 3 days and resumed at a dose 
level 50% (rounded up to the nearest 1  mg) of the prior dose level.  If supine hypertension 
or other adverse events  persist  after the dose has been reduced, dosing in that subject 
should be discontinued and appropriate alternative  therapy and care provided to the subject 
as determined by the principal investigator.  
In Part C, s ubjects  will enter the research center on Day -2 and remain resident in the 
research facility  to undergo safety, PD, PK and diseases assessments  through  the morning 
of Day 2 of Part C, after which they will be discharged home.  Subjects w ill return on an 
outpatient basis and undergo safety, PK /PD and disease assessments as described in the 
schedul e of assessments . In addition, telephone assessments  for safety and disease 
assessment will be performed  on a weekly ( during Month 1) and monthly basis (Months 
2 through 5) where no clinic visit is scheduled.   In such a case that the dose is reduced, the 
subject should be scheduled for a clinic visit to occur within  approximately  2 week s of the 
dose reduction. Following completion of the  dosi
ng period, or in the case of early 
disconti
nuation from the study , subjects will return 2 and 4 weeks after the final dose for 
follow -up visit s to undergo safety, PK /PD and diseases assessments  and end of study 
procedures . In cases where the subject is unable to return to the clinic due to significant 
physical or geographic limitations, or at the Investigator’s disc retion, a nurse may be sent to 
the subject’s home and the study visit procedures performed in the subject’s home, except 
for the day 29 visit which must be done within the research center . 
Adverse ev
ents will be assessed throughout the study  duration in each Part  and will be 
recorded in the case report form when reported.  
Study procedures  are further described in Table 1  for Part A and Table 2  for Part C and in 
Section  6. 
Duration of Study  Participation:    
The duration of study involvement for each subject will be up to approximately 36 days for 
Part A (including up to 30 days for screening) , and 169 days for Part C .

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  d. Body weight will be measured daily during Days -1 through 5 in the AM (predose) and PM (approximately 12 hours post dose), and the AM of Day 6 (or on 
discharge).  The Day -1 “postdose” weight assessment should be prospectively calculated, based on the target Day 1 dosing time. Measurements will occur at 
approximately the same time each day ( ± 15 minutes) using the same scale and without clothing (or where necessary with the same light clothing).  
e. Where appropriate, a utonomic function testing will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis of autonomic dysfunction.   
f. During Day -1 through Day 6, the orthostatic standing test will be performed in the morning at approximately the same time of day for each test, under fasting 
condition s after midnight to avoid the confounding effect of post -prandial hypotension. Additionally, d uring Days 1 through 5, the standing test will be repeated 
at 4, 7, 9 and 12 hours after dosing. At each time point, BP and HR measurements will be recorded with automated (or manual) sphygmomanometer while 
supine at 5 and 10 min (with the torso and head elevated 30 degrees from horizontal), after seated at 5 and 10 min and after 1, 3, 5, and 10 min while 
standing. The standing time will be measured with a chronometer and the duration of standing will be recorded.  Additionally at each time point, the standing 
time will be measured with a chronometer  and the duration of standing will be recorded.    
g. Additional supine (30 degree head up)  blood pressure readings will be measured at 14, 16, 18, and 20 hours after dosing each day in Part A for  safety 
assessment.   All times have a window of ± 15 minutes.  
h. Electrocardiogram (12-lead) will be collected  at Screening, on Day -1, predose and between 6 and 8 hours post dose on Days 1 through 5, and on Discharge.  
i. Physical examinations after the Screening Visit may be abbreviated, focusing on abnormalities identified on the Screening examination and as related to adverse events.  
j. For women of child bearing potential a serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening.  
k. Where feasible, beginning with the morning void on Day -1, all urine will be collected and the volume measured and recorded at each void or as a total daily 
volume through discharge.  
l. Blood s amples  for assessment of TD 9855 plasma concentration will be taken before dosing (within 30 minutes before the dose) and again between 6 and 
9 hours post dose on dosing Days 3 and 5 as appropriate. One additional PK sample will be taken at 24 hours post dose following the last administered dose 
after the subject has reached the stopping criteria or at the end of the dose escalation sequence .   
m. Blood samples for analysis of PD (NE and DHPG ) will be collected once before dosing ( after sitting for 10 minutes ) and once again between 6 and 9 hours 
post dose (after sitting for 10 minutes ) on dosing Days 1 (placebo) , 3 and 5 (2 0 mg)  as appropriate. One additional P D sample will be taken at 24 hours post 
dose (after sitting for 10 minutes) following the last administered dose after the subject has reached the stopping criteria or at the end of the dose escalation 
sequence. Please refer to the PK manual for more specific information related to sample handling, labeling, storage and shipping.

SCHEDUL E OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS (CONTINUED)  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  a. Subjects will admit to the research unit on Day -2 and remain resident through the completion of study procedures on the morning of Day 2.  
b. The timing  of Day -1 “postdose” assessments should be prospectively calculated, based on the target Day 1 dosing time (eg, orthostatic standing test and 
Clinical Impression and OHQ assessments). Study Day 1 is defined as the day of first study dosing with TD -9855 in Part C .  On Day 2 subjects are 
discharged from the research facility after all study procedures are completed the morning of Day 2.  
c. History update, if any changes since participation in Part A (and B  if appropriate)  of the study.  
d. The orthostatic standing test will be performed in the morning  before eating breakfast at approximately  the same time of day each visit  under fasting 
conditions after midnight to avoid the confounding effect of post-prandial hypotension.  In addition, at least 4 hours after dosing (but no more than 7 hours) 
and before lunch, the standing test will be repeated.  At each time point, BP and HR measurements will be recorded with automated (or manual) 
sphygmomanometer while supine at 5 and 10 min (with the torso and head elevated 30 degrees from horizontal), after seated at 5 and 10 min and after 1, 
3, 5, and 10 min while standing. The standing time will be measured with a chronometer and the duration of standing will be recorded.   More details related 
to the sequence of dosing and orthostatic assessments are described below.  For the Day 155 and 169 assessments, the timing of the “postdose” 
orthostatic test should be calculated based on the Day 1 dosing time . 
e. On Days 8, 22, 57 and 113, supine blood pressures will be collected  twice in the morning before eating (after 5 and 10 minutes resting at 30° elevation) , 
and twice again at least 4 hours after dosing (but no more than 7 hours and before lunch) after 5 and 10 minutes resting at 30° elevation .  On Day -2, 
supine blood pressures should be measured  (after 5 and 10 minutes resting at 30°  elevation).  
f. In Part C, at sites where ambulatory blood pressure monitoring equipment is available, on Day -1, beginning approximately 24 hours before dosing on 
Day 1, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring equipment will be attached to the subject and blood pressure monitored during the 24 hour period before 
dosing.  In addition, approximately 72 to 48 hours before a subject returns to the clinic for the Day 15, Day 29, Day 85 and Day 169 visits, subjects will put on the 24 hour blood pressure monitoring equipment and initiate the recording.  Once the 24 hour session is complete subjects  will remove and return the 
equipment to the research center during the next visit.  During each 24 hour session, the blood pressure monitoring device will be programmed to automatically measure blood pressure every 2 hours beginning at the top of the hour.  In addition, subjects should be instruc ted to manually initiate 2 
recordings to occur approximately 30 and 20 minutes before eating each morning after sitting supine (30 degree elevation) for  at least 10 minutes.  During 
each 24-hour session subjects should also maintain a log of their posture at the time of each blood pressure measurement.  For sites where ambulatory 
equipment are not available, desk top blood pressure devices may be used and provided to the subject for home use.   Subjects will be instructed to 
measure and record blood pressure on the days and time points described above and in  Table 2 .  More details regarding the ambulatory monitoring will be 
provided in a separate manual.  
g. Physical examinations after the Day -1 visit may be abbreviated, focusing on abnormalities identified on the Day -1 examination and as related to adverse 
events.  
h. For women of child bearing potential a urine pregnancy test will be performed at screening.  If urine pregnancy test is positive, confirm with serum 
pregnancy test.  
i. Blood coll ection for PK analysis will be collected on Day  1 (within 30 minutes before dosing  and again between 6 and 9 hours post dose), predose Day 2, 
and upon return to the clinic on Days 29, 85, and 155 . Please refer to the central laboratory  manual for more spec ific information related to sample 
handling, labeling, storage and shipping.  
j. Blood collection for DHPG analysis will be collected on Day  1 (within 30 minutes before dosing and again between 6 and 9 hours post dose), predose on  
Day 2, and upon return to t he clinic on Day 29. Please refer to the central laboratory  manual . 
k. Blood collection for NE analysis will be collected on Day 1 (within 30 minutes before dosing)  and upon return to the clinic on Day 29. Please refer to the 
central laboratory  manual .

recorded on standardized paper forms  (See  Appendix  4). In addition while at home, the Clinicia n’s/Subject’s Global Impression and OHQ  will be completed 
by telephone with the study coordinator.   On all visit days the OHQ and Global Impression assessments should be completed at least 4 hours after dosing 
(but no more than 7 hours) and before lunch.   For the Day 155 and 169 assessments, the timing of the “postdose” questionnaires should be calculated 
based on the Day 1 dosing time.  
m. On the study visit days marked above, subject s will receive a dose of study medication in the morning after supine blood pressures and the orthostatic 
standing test has been completed.  On non- study visit days the subjects should take their dose of study medication in the morning at approximately the 
same time of day.  On study days where the subject is traveling to the clini c, the subject should take their dose of study medication at home before 
traveling to the clinic.   Subjects will return to the clinic on the day of their final dose.  Day 140 is the day of the last dose received at the end of 5 months 
(20 weeks).

1.4 Ri
sks and Benefits 
 
 
 suggesting that TD -9855 has the potential to provide a novel treatment option for 
nOH.  
While it is not known whether TD -9855 will provide clinical efficacy, this study will provide a 
number of beneficial services to subjects. These include autonomic evaluations, 
neurohumoral evaluation and information on new research developments in the field.  
Subjects will have access to routine autonomic follow up that may improve orthostatic 
symptoms. They will have symptom rating testing performed that may assist in educational planning.  
During the conduct of the TD -9855 clinical development program, the following have been 
recognized as important potential risks, with none characterized as identified risks associated with the administration of TD 9855:  
• Increase in heart rate  
• Increase in BP  
• Syncope  
 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 26  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Possible risks to subjects participating in this study include adverse events associated with 
other SNRIs, such as nausea, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, syncope, seizures, constipation, hyponatremia, hyperhidrosis, 
urinary retention, and decrease appetite. 
Furthermore, subjects may experience adverse effects as a result of study procedures, such 
as repeated blood sampling and associated procedures.  
To help ensure subject safety, subjects will be closely monitored during this study.  The 
study will be conducted in the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Centers (CTSAs) of the respective participating institutions comprising the Autonomic Disorders Consortium whenever possible. When a CTSA is not available, study visits will be conducted in the 
Investigator’s autonomic disorders clinic or appropriately  qualified research facility.  The 
schedule of procedures conducted during the open- label out -patient extension requires 
subjects to return to the clinic on a regular basis during the dosing and follow up periods and participate in telephone based evaluations on a weekly basis.  If subjects are unable to 
return to the clinic as indicated by the schedule of procedures, home visits will be conducted 
by protocol -trained nurses.  If any participant should incur any unexpected and untoward 
event during the testing procedure, the emergency caregivers (cardiologists, anesthesiologists, social workers, and psychologists) would become available on an immediate basis to provide necessary emergent management.  
A summary of known and potential risks to human subjects is provided in the IB in the Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator.

The primary objective of  the study is as follows:  
• To determine if TD -9855 has an acute  (Part s A and B) and sustained (Part C)  
pressor response and improves symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in subjects  with 
nOH due to MSA, PAF , or Parkinson’s disease.   
The secondary objective(s) of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with nOH. 
• To evaluate the PK and PD (NE and DHPG) of TD -9855 after single and multiple 
doses in subjects with nOH.  
3 STUDY D ESIGN 
3.1 Overview  
This is a multicenter, randomized, 3 part, single- blind (Part A), double- blind (Part B), and 
open- label multiple dose extension (Part C) study of TD 9855 versus placebo in subjects 
with nOH.  However, beginning with Amendment 2 of this protocol, Part B of the study has 
been discontinued.  Therefore, any new subjects enrolled after Amendment 2 will not be enrolled in Part B.  Details regarding Part B are still included in this document but where appropriate the reader is referred to the prior version of this protocol for more specific 
information related to Part B.  
This study now consist
 s of 2 Parts, A  and C.  Part A follows a daily, single, escalating dose 
design starting with placebo on Day 1, followed by a dose of  TD -9855 on Day 2, and 
proceeding to escalating higher doses o f TD-9855 on a daily basis up to a maximum dose of 
 based on safety, tolerability, and determination of a pressor effect.  In Part C, 
subjects who demonstrate a pressor effect in Part A, who complete Part A, and remain otherwise eligible will have the option to receive open- label TD -9855 by tablet daily for up to

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  3.2 Rationale for  Study Design  
This study is designed to evaluate the  acute  (Part A and B) and sustained (Part C)  efficacy 
and safety of TD -9855 in improving BP and reducing orthostatic symptoms  in subject s with 
nOH.  The study should provide important information between BP, orthostatic symptom 
relief and the potential correlation with changes in NE and dihydroxyphenylglycol ( DHPG ) 
release. The information to be learned could be useful in optimizing diagnosis and clinical management.   Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study treatment period 
via laboratory measurements (eg, hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and monitoring of AEs. 
3.3 Selection of Doses and Regimen  
This study  aims to evaluate the effects of single and multiple doses of TD- 9855 on systolic 
blood pressure, symptoms associated with nOH, safety, and tolerability.  The current doses of TD 9855 for this trial were chosen using pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynami c 
(PD) modeling to achieve a range of NET inhibition and to determine a minimum dose required to yield an increase in sitting systolic blood pressure.  An ascending dose design was chosen in Part A to allow the subjects to start at a low dose because of the intrinsic hyper adrenergic responsiveness in these patients. The maximum dose levels (  single dose or  multiple doses QD) were selected to provide maximal steady state NET 
inhibition in all subjects despite inter -individual PK variability.  A single dose of  and 
multiple doses QD of  are below  or equal to  doses examined and tolerated in single 
and multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers  respectively . The maximum dose in Part C 
 QD) is equal to the well -tolerated  dose tha t was studied in two Phase 2 trials 
in patients with ADHD and FM where  was administered over 6 to 8 weeks.  
3.4 Study Endpoints  
3.4.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
For Part  A, the primary study endpoint is the change from time-matched placebo in seated 
systolic blood pressure at 6 to 8 hours after drug administration. For Part C, the primary 
endpoint is the improvement from baseline in the Likert scale “dizziness, lightheadedness, 
feeling faint, or feeling like you might black out” (OHSA, question 1) at week 4. 
 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 30  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  The secondary endpoints for Part A include:  
• Improvement in the Likert scale for “dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or 
feeling like you might black out” (OHSA, question 1). 
• The composite OHSA score.  
• Change from time-matched placebo in standi ng SBP  
• Change from time-matched placebo in seated SBP (area under the curve for 
0-12 hours following drug administration).  
• Duration of standing during the orthostatic standing test 
The secondary endpoints for Part C include: 
• The composite OHSA and OHDAS s core.  
• Change from time-matched placebo in standing SBP  
• Change from time-matched placebo in seated SBP (area under the curve for 
0-12 hours following drug administration).  
• Duration of standing during the orthostatic standing test 
3.4.2 Safety Endpoints 
For all Parts of the study, safety and tolerability assessments will include adverse events, 
laboratory abnormalities, ECGs, and vital sign measurements including supine blood pressure. Exploratory PK and PD assessments will also be made in all parts of the study as 
indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
3.5 Minimization of Bias  
Bias will be minimized through the use of randomization and blinding.  
3.5.1 Blinding  
In Part A, study subjects will be blinded to dose levels and escalation. Pre-defined stopping 
rules will be used to guide procedures.   For Part B , which has been discontinued, refer to 
previous versions of this protocol.  Part C will be an open- label extension study and therefore 
blinding considerations are not applicable. 
3.5.2 Treatment Assignment  
Subjects in Part A will begin by receiving placebo in a single- blind manner (ie, subject  
remains blinded). This will be followed by daily dose escalations, beginning with  of 
TD-9855 on Day 2. On each subsequent day, subjects will receive a single escalating dose 
of TD -9855  until Day 5 or until reaching the preset stopping criteria 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 31  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  (Section 5.2). However, based on the daily evaluation of tolerability, the Investigator 
(in collaboration with the Sponsor), may decide to not escalate the dose, but rather 
re-administer the previous dose from the prior day.  Once the decision has been made to 
not escalate the dose, the subject should remain at the current  dose  through Day  5 of 
dosing.  
The dose level administered on Day 1 in Part C will be equal to 50% of the  highest tolerated 
dose level (rounded up to the nearest 1 mg) administered during Part A for that subject (or a 
lower dose at the discretion of the principal investigator to manage individual subject safety). Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 2 and continue at the same dose level as Day 1 of Part C .  At the subsequent scheduled visits  until Day 29 , the 
Investigator has the option to double the subject’s dose level  at their discretion,  if in their 
opinion the subject will benefit from, and can tolerate, a higher dose level.  After Day 29, 
dose increases will need to be discussed with the Sponsor.  It is recommended that the 
subject receives at least 7 daily doses of TD -9855 at any single dose level before escalation 
to a higher dose to allow  TD-9855 exposure to reach steady state  at the lower  dose. Due to 
the half -life of TD -9855 multiple dose increases within a 7 day period might lead to greater 
than 2 -fold increase in TD -9855 exposure and are not recomm ended.  The maximum dose 
administered to any subject is  The schedule for dose increases is shown in 
Table 3.

In the case where a subject develops the presence or worsening  of supine hypertension 
(as determined by the Investigator with agreement  from the Sponsor)  or other adverse 
events suggesting intolerability, the dose can be withheld for 3 days and resumed at a dose 
level 50% (rounded up to the nearest 1 mg) of the prior  dose level.  If supine hypertension or 
other adverse events persists after the dose has been reduced, dosing in that subject should be discontinued and appropriate alternative therapy and care provided to the subject as determined by the principal investigator.

5 STUDY DRUGS 
All study drug supplied by the Sponsor  must be stored in a secure location accessible only 
to designated study personnel.  
5.1 Description of Study Drugs 
In Part A (and previously in Part  B of the study  which was discontinued) , TD-9855 will be 
provided by the Sponsor as a bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), appearing as a white powder.  Doses for individual subject administration will be prepared as a solution in 
filtered apple juice by the designated unblinded pharmacist at the CRC.  In Part C, TD-9855 
will be provided as a packaged in open- labeled 40- count high density 
polyethylene bottles.  Detailed storage and preparation instructions will be provided in a 
separate pharmacy manual. 
5.2 Dosage and Administration  
Part A Dose Escalation  
On Day -2 of Part A, eligible subjects will be admitted to the CRC, where they will remain 
during the entire dose escalation period.  On Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of 
placebo in a single- blind manner (ie, subject  remains blinded).  This will be followed by daily 
dose escalations, beginning with  TD-9855 on Day 2.  On each subsequent day, 
subjects will receive a single escalating dose of TD- 9855  [Day 3] , [Day 4] , and 
[Day 5]) until Day 5 or until reaching the preset stopping criteria described below , 
whichever occurs first.   
The stopping criteria are:  
• A determination from the Investigator (in collaboration with the Sponsor) that 
administration of the subsequent dose may pose a safety concern  
• SBP ≥ 180 mm or DBP ≥ 110 mm in the sitting position replicated 2 more times 
over an hour  
• Intolerable side effects as determined by the Investigator 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 36  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  • Received maximum dose of study medication specified by the protocol  
Once the subject meets any of the above criteria, no further dose escalation will be 
performed . However, based on the daily evaluation of tolerability, the Investigator 
(in collaboration with the Sponsor), may decide to not escalate the dose, but rather 
re-administer the previous dose from the prior day.  Once the decision has been made to 
not escalate the dose, the subject should remain at the current  dose  through Day  5 of 
dosing. Following  a post dosing observation day in the clinic, the subject will have discharge 
procedures completed and will be released from the CRC.  
Subjects who do not demonstrate a clinically meaningful pressor effect  based on 
Investigator determination (in collaboration with the Sponsor), or who discontinue study drug 
prior to reaching the stopping criteria, should have discharge procedures completed, but will not continue to Part C of the study . 
Washout Period 
Following the completion of Part A, subjects will be discharged from the CRC and undergo a washout period (minimum 8 days ).  On a daily basis following the first 72 hours fr om 
discharge, and then at least weekly during the first 4 weeks after discharge , the Investigator 
or designee will contact the subject by telephone to review the subject’s health status.  Any adverse events report ed by phone will be recorded and followed as medically appropriate  
determined by the Investigator.  Under the direction of the Investigator, subjects will manage 
their nOH symptoms using fludrocortisone as prescribed.  
Part B – Randomized Parallel Design  
In Part B, refer to prior versions of this Protocol for specific information related to Part  B 
which was discontinued in Amendment  2. 
Part C – Outpatient Extension  
The dose level administered on Day 1 in Part C will be equal to 50% of the highest tolerated dose level (rounded- up to the nearest 1 mg) administered during Part  A for that subject (or a 
lower dose at the discretion of the principal investigator to manage individual subject safety). Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 2, and continue at the same dose level as Day 1 of Part -C.  At the subsequent scheduled visits  until Day 29 , the 
Investigator has the option to double the subject’s dose level at their discretion, if in their opinion the subject will benefit from, and can tolerate, a higher dose level.  After Day 2 9, 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 37  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  dose increases will need to be discussed with the Sponsor.  It is recommended that the 
subject receives at least 7 daily doses of TD -9855 at any  single  dose level before escalation 
to a higher dose to allow  TD-9855 exposure to reach steady state  at the lower  dose.  
 
  The maximum dose 
administered to any subject is   The schedule for potential dose increases is

In the case where a subject develops the presence or worsening of supine hypertension 
(as determined by the Investigator with agreement from the Sponsor) or other adverse 
events suggesting intolerability,  the dose can be withheld for 3 days and resumed at a dose 
level 50% (rounded up to the nearest 1  mg) of the prior dose level.  If supine hypertension or 
other adverse events  persist after the dose has been reduced, dosing in that subject should 
be discontinued and appropriate alternative therapy and care provided to the subject as 
determined by the principal investigator. 
In Part A, s ubjects will be administered study drug by qualified study personnel under the 
supervision of the Investigator . Study personnel will observe and record date and time of 
dosing and in the event any deviations or incomplete administrations will be noted in the 
source records.  
In Part C, subjects will be administered study drug by qualified study personnel under the supervision of the Investigator on Day 1 and Day 2.  On all other dosing days, subjects will record the date and time of their daily dose in a dosing diary. Any dose increases, missed 
doses , or issues with dosing should be noted in the dosing diary. Site staff will also record 
any dose increase in the subject’s source documents.  Subjects are expected to bring the

return visits.  
5.3 Drug Accountability and Reconciliation  
The unblinded pharmacist or designee is responsible for maintaining accountability records for all study drug(s) received from the Sponsor, in accordance with applicable government regulations and study procedures. The accountability records for study medication 
(TD-9855) will be maintained in a secure location, accessible only to authorized staff 
members. The accountability record will include entries for receipt, distribution or dispensing, and destruction of the material(s).  
The pharmacist must retain all unused, and expired product until the site monitor has confirmed accountability data. No study drug (used, partially used, and unused bottles) may 
be destroyed without prior approval from the Sponsor. Compliance with the dosing regimen 
will also be assessed by reconciliation of used and unused study drug.  
Unused and expired study drugs will be disposed of in accordance with written instructions 
from the Sponsor. Copies of the study medication accountability records will be provided to the Sponsor at completion of the study and will be made available for review by the site monitor during the course of the study.

Table 2  for Part C  of the study .  Study procedures listed in each row of the table should be 
performed at the visits designated in each column where an “X” is marked, and as indicted 
in the footnote, where applicable.   Further information related to each study procedure type 
are described in Section 6.3.3 .  
The calendar day of the first study drug administration is designated as Day 1; subsequent 
calendar days are Days 2, 3, etc.  Note that each parts of the study (Parts A and C) has 
their own unique numbering of calendar days.  
Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific 
procedures. After providing full informed consent, subjects will undergo a medical screen to determine their eligibility for participation based on the criteria outlined in this protocol. Part C, which is an optional long -term extension study will require subjects to si gn a 
separate informed consent form from that in Part A.  
The site should make every effort to perform procedures at the scheduled times, and the actual time should be recorded in the source documents and on the case report forms.   
Acceptable deviations fr om the timing of assessments are as follows:  
• Day 8 through Day 29: ± 3 days  
• Day 57 through Day 169: ± 7 days  
Additional safety tests, such as vital signs (BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature), physical exams, ECGs, and laboratory safety tests, may be obtained during 
the course of the study on the basis of newly available data to ensure appropriate safety 
monitoring.   
In Part C, i n cases where the subject is unable to return to the clinic for a clinic visit for 
reasons due to significant physical or geographic limitations, or at the Investigator’s 
discretion, a protocol -trained nurse may be sent to the subject’s home and the study visit 
procedures performed in the subject’s home .  The only exception to this is for the day 29 
visit of Part C which must be done at the research center.

participation based on the criteria outlined in this protocol. Part C, which is an optional long-term extension study will require subjects to sign a separate informed consent form 
from that in Part A.  
6.3.2 Overnight Residency, Standardized Meals, and Restrictions  
Subjects will be admitted and remain resident in the clinical research center (CRC) 
beginning Day -2 through the morning of Day 6 in Part A, and Day -2 through the morning of 
Day 2 for Part C.  
 
 
   
 
 
Should there be a clinically significant change between Screening and Day 1 of either Part A  
or Part C  such that subjects no longer meet the eligibility criteria, they will no longer be 
eligible for the study and should be listed as a screen failure.  
6.3.3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Section 4 provides a listing of inclusion criteria which subjects must meet to be eligible.  Any 
subjects meeting exclusion criteria should not be enrolled in the study.

gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, lymphatic, hematol ogic, 
immunologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, genitourinary, substance abuse, surgical history, or 
any other diseases or disorders. If any worsening in severity or frequency occurs for an existing condition or a new event occurs after signing of the informed consent, this must be recorded as an AE.  Prior to initiating Part C, the medication and medical history should be 
reevaluated and updated accordingly.   Any events occurring < 30 days since the last dose of 
study drug in part A (or Part B) should be recorded as an AE.  Any event that occurs ≥ 30 days since the last dose of study drug in Part A (or Part B) but prior to Part C should be 
recorded as medical history (unless the Investigator deems the event related to prior study drug use).  
6.3.5 Body Height, Weight  and BMI  
Body height and weight will be measured at the time points described in Table 1  for Part A 
and Table 2  for Part C. Care will be taken to ensure the measurements  for weight  occur at 
approximately the same time each day (± 15 minutes) using the same scale and without 
clothing (or where necessary with the same light clothing).  BMI will be automatically 
calculated in the EDC system once weight and height are entered.  
6.3.6 Temperature and Respiratory Rate 
Temperature and respirator y rate are to be measured at the time  points described in Table 1  
for Part A . 
Temperature is to be measured at time points described in Table 2  for Part C.

standing will be recorded.  The total duration of standing may occur  in between the 
timepoints (ie,  1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes) for the standing  test, or the subject may be able to 
stand for longer than the 10- minute standing test.  In either case, the total duration should 
be recorded.  More details related to the sequence of dosing and orthostatic assessments 
are described in Table 1  for Part A and  Table 2  for Part C .  
Blood pressure  and HR collected after 10 minutes supine and seated  from the orthostatic 
standing test will be used for safety vital sign assessment . 
6.3.8 Supine Blood Pressure  
Supine blood pressure will be measured at specified time points in the Schedule of 
Procedures / Assessments Table 1  for Part A and  Table 2  for Part C.  
In Part C, o n Days 8, 22, 57 and 113, supine blood pressures will be collected twice  in the 
morning before eating (after 5 and 10 minutes resting at 30° elevation) , and twice again at 
least 4 hours after dosing (but no more than 7 hours and before lunch ) after 5 and 
10 minutes resting at 30° head and torso elevation ( Table 2 ). On Day -2, supine blood 
pressures should be measured after 5 and 10 minutes resting at 30°  head and torso 
elevation.  
6.3.9 Autonomic Function Testing  
Where appropriate, autonomic function testing will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis of 
autonomi c dysfunction and will include the following assessments. Note that the results of 
this testing will be recorded in the subject source notes but will not be collected in the case report form.   
• HR will be monitored by ECG and BP continuously with tonometry  or finger 
plethysmography and intermittently with an oscillometric device. These tests include sinus arrhythmia and Valsalva maneuver.  
• Deep breathing- vagally -mediated sinus arrhythmia (SA) is assessed during controlled 
breathing (pattern of 5 seconds inhalation and 5 seconds exhalation repeated over 90 seconds).  

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 43  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  • Valsalva maneuver. The subject will exhale against a 40 mm Hg pressure. Changes in 
intrathoracic pressure produce autonomically modulated transient changes in HR and BP. 
6.3.10 24-Hour Blood Pressure Monitoring 
In Part C, a t sites where ambulatory blood pressure monitoring equipment is available, on 
Day -1, beginning approximately 24 hours before dosing on Day 1, ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring equipment will be attached to the subject and blood pressure monitored during the 24 hour period before dosing.  In addition, approximately 72 to 48 hours before the subject returns to the clinic for the Day 15, Day 29, Day 85 and Day 169 visits, subjects 
will put on the 24 hour blood pressure monitoring equipment and initiate the recording.  
Once the 24 hour session is complete subjects will remove and return the equipment to the 
research center during the next visit.  During each 24 hour session, the blood pressure monitoring device will be programmed to automatically measure blood pressure every 2 hours beginning after the monitoring device is powered on.  In addition, subjects should be 
instructed to manually  initiate 2 recordings to occur approximately 30 and 20 minutes before 
eating each morning after sitting supine (30 degree elevation) for at least 10 minutes.  During each 24 -hour session subjects should also maintain a log of their posture at the time 
of each blood pressure measurement.  For sites where ambulatory equipment are not 
available, desk top blood pressure devices may be used and provided to the subject for 
home use.  Subjects will be instructed to measure and record blood pressure on the days 
and time points described above and in Table 2 .  More details regarding the ambulatory 
monitoring will be provided in a separate manual. 
6.3.11 Electrocardiogram  
At time points specified in the Schedule of Study Procedures / Assessments ( Table 1  for 
Part A and Table  2 for Part C) subject  will have a 12- lead ECG following a 10 minute rest 
period. QTc corrections will be made using the Fredericia correction formula.

7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Regulatory Definition of an Adverse Event  
In the International Council for Harmonization (ICH)  E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 
Section 7.2 defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational)  product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal (investigational)  product.  
7.2 Adverse Event Definition for the Purposes of This Study 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs will be defined as follows:  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who has signed an informed consent form and is participating in a clinical investigation. An AE can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, whether or not considered related to the study drug (investigational product ). 
Pre-existing events that increase in frequency or severity or change in nature during or as a 
consequence of participation  in clinical studies will also be considered as adverse events . 
An AE may also include pre- or post -treatment complications that occur as a result of a 
protocol -mandated procedure (such as a biopsy).  
Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory  abnormality with an onset date prior 
to the time the subject signed the informed consent form is considered to be preexisting and should be documented in the medical history CRF, if applicable for the study . 
Whenever possible, the diagnosis (rather than a series of terms related to a diagnosis) should be recorded as the AE term.  

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 50  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  An AE does not include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event  
• Preexisting diseases or conditions present or detected before signing an informed consent form that do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (such as hospitalization for elective surgery or social and/or convenience admissions)  
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms, unless the subject is hospitalized for observation 
7.3 Assessment of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed by the Investigat or and recorded in the case report form, including 
the dates of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action 
taken with study medication.  
Clinical severity should be recorded and graded using  mild, moderate or severe as 
described below.  
Mild = Aware ness  of sign s or symptom s, but easily tolerated  
Moderate = Discomfort sufficient  to cause interference with usual activities  
Severe = Incapacitati on with inability to work or perform usual activities  
The relationship to study drug therapy should be assessed using the following definitions:  
• Not Related:   Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the 
study drug (such as a preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).  
• Possibly/Probably Related:  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset 
and administration of the study drug. It cannot be readily explained by the subject’s 
clinical state or concomitant therapies and appears with some degree of certai nty to be 
related based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions of the drug . In case 
of cessation or reduction of the dose, the event abates or resolves and reappears upon 
rechallenge . It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should no t be considered 
as causally related in the context of adverse event reporting.  
These criteria in addition to good clinical judgment should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment . If it is felt that the event is not related to study drug 
therapy, then an alternative explanation should be provided.

TD-9855 Page 51  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  7.4 Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (excluding those for 
study therapy or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other 
serious events)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug 
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately 
life-threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such events are as follows : 
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Additional Considerations for Serious Adverse Events 
• Death is an outcome of an adverse event and not an adverse event in itself . In reports of 
death due to disease progression, where no other information is provided, the death will 
be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease being treated with the 
study drug(s).  
• All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for subjects if the death occurs while the subject is participating in the study.  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the time of the event ; dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted 
temporarily before  the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event.  
• “Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had 
occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs . If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization, it is an SAE.  
• “Inpatient hospitalization” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital for 
medical reasons, for any length of time . This may or may not be overnight . It does not 
include presentation and care within an emergency department.  
• The Investigator  should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms , and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  7.5 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings (such as clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (such as electrocardiograms [ECGs], X -rays, or vital signs) that are 
associated with signs and/or symptoms  or are considered clinically significant in the 
judgment of the Investigator must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if  they meet the definition of 
an adverse event or serious adverse event, as described in Sections  7.2 and 7.4, 
respectively . 
If there are any AE questions, the Investigator  is encouraged to contact the Sponsor  to 
discuss. 
7.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Any SAE that occurs after a subject signs an informed consent form  through the follow -up 
visit (or at the time a subject is determined to be ineligible for the study or who does  not 
enroll in the study), regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the Sponsor  within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event . To report an SAE, complete and fax 
the Serious Adverse Event Report Form to the following: 
Theravance Biopharma Clinical Drug  Safety  
Fax: (  
For medical questions regarding an SAE, contact the Sponsor  medical monitor by telephone 
as follows:  
Sponsor Medical Monitor Contact Information:  
 
Telephone : (  
For fatal or life -threatening events, also fax copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, 
and other documents when requested. Additional information may be requested from the 
Investigator to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
An SAE may qualify for reporting to regulatory authorities if the SAE is possibly attributable 
to the study drug and is unexpected/unlisted based on the current  Investigator’s Brochure . 
In this case, all Investigators will receive notification of the event . The Investigator  is 
responsible f or notify ing the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee and 
documenting the notification, as required by local regulatory authorities and in accordance 
with the local institutional policy.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  7.7 Adverse Event Follow-up 
A subject experiencing an AE or SAE will be followed by the Investigator  or his/her trained 
delegate(s) through the follow -up visit or until the Investigator and/or the Sponsor  has 
determined that the AE or SAE has resolved or a stable clinical endpoint is reached , 
whichever is longer . The Sponsor  may request follow -up of  certain adverse events until 
resolution and documentation of assessments made during this period. 
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of an SAE. 
Any medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded in the concomitant 
medication section of the case report form.

9.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before beginning study -specific researc h, the Investigator  will obtain written confirmation 
that the IRB , IEC, or REB is properly constituted and compliant with ICH and GCP 
requirements, applicable laws , and local regulations . A copy of the confirmation from the 
IRB/IEC/REB will be provided to the Sponsor  or its designee. The protocol, informed 
consent form (ICF), IB, and any other appropriate written information provided to the 
subjects  that the IRB/ IEC/REB may require to fulfill its responsibilities will be submitted to 
the IRB/IEC /REB  in advance of the study . The Sponsor  or its designee  must approve the 
ICF and all subject recruitment materials before they are submitted to the IRB/ IEC/REB . The 
study will not proceed until appropriate documents from the IRB/ IEC/REB confirming 
unconditional approval of the protocol and the ICF are obtained by the Investigator and 
copies are received by the Sponsor  or its designee. If possible, t he approval document 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 61  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  should refer to the study by study protocol title and the Sponsor  study number, identify the 
documents reviewed, and include the date of the review and approval . The written approval 
of the IRB/IEC/REB will be retained as part of the study file. The study may proceed before 
approval of consent forms and other study documents translated to a language other than 
the native language of the clinical site, provided that written IRB/IEC/REB approval of the 
translated documents is obtained before they are used. Any amendments to the protocol 
should be reviewed promptly. 
The Investigator  must provide the appropriate periodic reports on the progress of the study 
to the IRB/ IEC/REB and the Sponsor  in accordance with local IRB/ IEC/REB requirements 
and applicable governmental regulations, whichever is strictest.  
9.3 Informed Consent  
A properly written and executed ICF, in compliance with ICH E6 (GCP  Guideline, 
Section 4.8), 21 CFR §50, and other applicable local regulations, will be obtained for each 
subject before  enrollment of  the subject into the study . The Investigator  will prepare the ICF 
or revise the template ICF a nd provide the documents to the Sponsor  (or designee)  for 
approval before submission to the IRB/ IEC/REB . The Sponsor  and the IRB/ IEC/REB  must 
approve the documents before they are implemented.  
The Investigator  will provide copies of the signed ICF to each subject (or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative) and will maintain the original in the subject’s record file.  
9.4 Data Recording and Quality Assurance  
As used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either  a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used.  
Electronic data capture (EDC) technology will be used for this study . All clinical information 
requested in this protocol will be recorded on the electronic c ase report forms approved by 
the Sponsor, or via other data collection methods, eg, electronic laboratory data transfer . 
Study site personnel will enter (in English)  study data into the CRFs for each randomized 
subject . Training on the EDC application will be completed and documented before access 
to the EDC system is given.  

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 62  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  In the event of a CRF data change (eg, correction of an error or addition of new information), 
corrections will be made to the CRF. Corrections to the CRFs, including the reason for 
change, will be automatically documented through the EDC system’s audit trail.  
The Investigator  is responsible for reviewing all CRFs, verifying them for accuracy, and 
approving them via an electronic signature . The Investigator  is designated as the signatory  
coordinating Investigator . 
An electronic copy of the CRF casebooks will be sent to the site for retention with other 
study documents after full completion of the study, i e, after database lock.  
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining accurate, authentic, complete, and up -to-date 
records for each subject . The Investigator  is also responsible for ensuring the availability of 
any original  source documentation related to the study (including any films, tracings, 
computer discs, tapes, and worksheets ). In most cases the source is the subject’s medical 
record . Data collected on the CRFs must match the source document s. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document . In these cases, a 
document should be available at the I nvestigator’s  site and clearly identify those data that 
will be recorded in the CRF and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.  
9.5 Document Retention  
Until otherwise notified by the Sponsor , an investigative site must retain  in a controlled 
manner  all study documents  required by the Sponsor  and by the applicable regulations . The 
investigative site must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation 
of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study records (eg, subject charts) and any original source documents that are electronic, as required by applicable regulations. 
The Investigator must consult the Sponsor  repres entative before disposal of any study 
records and must notify the Sponsor  of any change in the location or disposition of the study 
files. If an Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping the study documents, custody must be transferred to a person who 
will accept the responsibility . The Sponsor  must be notified in writing of the name and 
address of the new custodian and must approve this transfer of responsibility.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  9.6 Confidentiality  
The Investigator or designee must explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that, for evaluation of study results, the subject’s confidential medical information obtained 
during the study may be shared with the study Sponsor , the study Sponsor’s affiliated 
companies, the study Sponsor’s designated service providers, regulatory agencies, and the 
institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee ( IEC). The Investigator 
(or designee) is responsible for obtaining written permission to use confidenti al medical  
information in accordance with country -specific regulations (such as the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act in the United  States) from each subject or, if appropriate, 
the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use confidential medical  
information is withdrawn, the Investigator is responsible for documenting that no further data 
from the subject will be collected.  
Subject medical information obtained during this study is confidential , and disclosure to 
unauthorized third parties is prohibited. The pertinent sections of data protection laws w ill be 
complied with in full . Study r ecords containing subject information will only be identified by 
the subject identification number, subject initials, date of birth, and study number , and  not by 
the subject’s  full name , except the subject consent form, which is archived at the study 
center only . The subject’s name will not be used in any public report of the study. 
During the course of the study , a confidential subject  identification list will be maintained by 
the Investigator  and archived at the investigative site.  
Before and during the conduct of the study, no study -related details may be disclosed, 
ie, placed on the internet, published, or otherwise publiciz ed, or provided to a third party  
without prior written permission from the Sponsor . The policy for publication of data after 
completion of the study is described in Section  9.9 (Publication).  
9.7 Access to Data and Documents  
Upon receipt of  the subject’s permission, medical information may be given to his or her 
personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for his or her welfare.  
Study data recorded  on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data . All original 
recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records generated by this study must be 
available to the Sponsor, representatives of the Sponsor , the IRB/IEC /REB , and applicable 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 64  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  regulatory authorities, and they may be used for submission to regulatory authorities . In 
addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated), consistent with local 
medical practice. The Investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source 
data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representatives) must al so allow access to their 
medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when 
giving informed consent.  
9.8 Quality Control: Study Monitoring and Auditing 
Qualified individuals designated by the Sponsor will monitor all a spects of the study 
according to GCP and standard operating procedures (SOPs)  for compliance with 
applicable government regulations . The Investigator  agrees to allow these monitors direct 
access to the clinical data and supplies, dispensing, and storage areas and, if requested, 
agrees to assist the monitors . The Investigator  and staff are responsible for being present or 
available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by the Sponsor  or 
its designees.  
Members of the Sponsor ’s GCP Quality Assurance Department or designees may conduct 
an audit of a clinical site at any time during or after completion of the study. The Investigator 
will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit . 
Inspections and audits are typically carried out during the clinical and reporting phases of 
this study to ensure that the study  is conducted and data are generated, documented, and 
reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, written SOPs  and applicable laws, rules, and 
regulations.  
Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies, including IRB/IEC representatives may also conduct an audit of the study . If informed of such an inspection, 
the Investigator should notify the Sponsor  immediately . The Investigator will ensure that the 
auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, laboratory and all data (including original source documentation) and all study files are available, if requested.  
Noncompliance with the protocol, ICH, GCP , or local regulatory requirements by an 
Investigator, institution, institution staff, or representatives of the Sponsor  will lead to prompt 
action by the Sponsor  to secure compliance. Continued noncompliance may result in 
termination of the Investigator ’s involvement in the study . The IRB/IEC /REB  and relevant 
regulatory authority will be informed.

Patient Instructions:  
 
We are interested in measuring the symptoms that occur because of your problem with low bl ood 
pressure (orthostatic hypotension) and the degree that those symptoms may interfere with your daily activity.  It is important that we measure the symptoms that are due ONLY to your low blood pressure, and not something else (like diabetes or Parkinson’s disease). Many people know which of their 
symptoms are due to low blood pressure.  Some people who have recently developed problems with 
low blood pressure may not easily distinguish symptoms of low blood pressure from symptoms caused by other conditions.  In general, symptoms of your low blood pressure problem will appear either upon standing or after you have been standing for some time, and will usually improve if you sit down or lie down.  Some patients even have symptoms when they are sitting which might improve after laying down. Some people have symptoms that improve only after sitting or lying down for quite 
some time.

Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 4 13 June 2018 1. SYNOPSIS
Name of Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product: Lurasidone injectable suspension  
Name of Active Ingredient: Lurasidone ( DSP-1349M)  
Proposed Indication: Schizophrenia  
Title of Study: A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Single Ascending Dose Study with 
Lurasidone Injectable Suspension  to Evaluate Saf ety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics in Subjects 
with Schizophrenia  
Study Centers:  1 site  in the United States  
Study Objectives:  
Safety Objective  
•To assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of lurasidone
injectable suspension  in subjects with schizophrenia.
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Objectives  
•To assess the PK for the metabolites of lurasidone in serum (ID-14283, ID -14326,
ID-11614, ID -20219 and ID-20220) and in urine ( ID-14283, ID-14326, and ID-11614) after
a single dose of lurasidone injectable suspension .
•To assess Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in subjects with schizophrenia
after a single dose of lurasidone injectable suspension.
Study Design  
This is a single -center,  randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, inpatient, single ascending dose 
(SAD) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of lurasidone injectable suspension in 
subjects with schizophrenia. This study will determine the minimum intolerable dose (MID), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lurasidone injectable suspension, and characterize the PK profiles of 
lurasidone and its metabolites in serum (ID-14283, ID -14326, ID- 11614, ID -20219, and ID-20220) and 
urine (ID-14283, ID -14326, and ID-11614) in this subject p opulation. The potential effects of gender on 
the PK of lurasidone injectable suspension and its metabolites will also be evaluated when applicable.  
The study is planned to  include up to 5 cohorts. A total of 8 subjects (6  active and 2  placebo) will be 
dosed in each cohort. Lurasidone injectable suspension  dosing will be initiated at 30  mg given as an 
intramuscular (IM) injection at the ventrogluteal site. Subsequent cohorts are planned to be dosed at 75, 
150, 300, and 450 mg IM at the ventrogluteal site. Dose strengths after the first dose level may be 
modified based on safety assessments and exposure to lurasidone injectable suspension.  
All 5  planned dose cohorts may not be used, depending on the dose escalation strategy employed. 
Additional cohorts may be included in this study, as necessary, and determined following a review of 
safety and exposure of lurasidone injectable suspension . Planned dose levels may be modified or 
repeated based on the overall safety profile of the current and/or previous cohorts. 
A study schematic is provided below; the schedule of study procedures and as sessments is provided in 
Table 2 .

Study Schematic  
a Eligible subjects must be washed out/tapered off of their current antipsychotic medications 5 to 6  half-lives prior 
to Day  -8 (may begin as early as Day -19). Subjects are required to be inpatient from Day -12 to Day  15 (for 
treatment and observation) and Day  29 to Day  33 (for restabilization to previous medications).  Subjects may 
remain  inpatient up to Day  33 (at the Investigator’s discretion).  
b Subjects will receive 2  oral lurasidone 80 mg doses (Days - 7 and -6) and be assessed for safety and tolerability 
for 5  days (Days  -5 to -1) and to allow appropriate time to washout of the oral lurasidone dose.  
c Randomization occurs on Day 1. Cohort 1 will receive a single lurasidone injectable suspension  dose of 30 mg or 
a single placebo injection dose; thereafter, single lurasidone injectable suspension  doses of 75, 150, 300, and 
450 mg may be administered (cohorts  2-5). 
d Subjects will be monitored for safety after the single lurasidone injectable suspension  or placebo injection dose 
until Day  29. Subjects may be discharged on Day 15 at  the Investigator’s discretion.  
e Subjects  will restart prior medications (including antipsychotics) on Day  29 under observation of clinical site 
staff.  
Subjects with schizophrenia who provide informed consent to participate in the study will undergo 
screening procedures and assessments between Days -35 to -13 to determine study eligibility.  
Eligible subjects will be washed out/ tapered off of their current antipsychotic medications over 
5 to 6 half -lives prior to Day  -8 (may begin  Day  -19). Subjects will be monitored for safety during 
tapering/washout. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical site on Day -12 and are required to be 
inpatient until Day  15. 
Subjects will receive oral lurasidone 80 mg tablets on Day  -7 and Day  -6 (one dose per day) , and be 
monitored for 5 days to ensure the subject is able to tolerate lurasidone (ie, absence of moderate adverse 
events). Subjects who tolerate dosing with oral lurasidone 80  mg will be eligible for randomization to 
receive a single lurasidone injectable suspension or placebo injection on Day 1. 
For Cohort 1, a sentinel group of 2 subjects will be dosed in a 1:1 ratio (lurasidone injectable 
suspension: placebo injection ). A 7 -day clinical assessment of safety and tolerability (including AEs, 
vital signs, and other clinically relevant findings) for the sentinel subjects will be made by the 
Investigator  (ie, Day  2 to Day  8). The remaining subjects will be randomized in a 5:1 ratio (lurasidone 
injectable suspension: placebo injection ). A sentinel group may not be required for future dose cohorts : 
absence of an immune response wi ll obviate the need for sentinel dosing after Cohort 1. 
Subjects who are discharged after Day  15 will check into the clinical site again on Day s 22 and 29 for 
scheduled assessments. Subjects will follow protocol procedures to remain in -clinic through Day 33 as 
they restart their prior medications (including antipsychotics), under observation of the Investigator/clinical site staff (ie, restabilization period).  
Subjects who remained in- clinic through Day  29 will remain inpatient through Day 33 as they restar t 
their prior medications (including antipsychotics) under observation of the Investigator/clinical site staff

(ie, re stabilization period).  
The restabilization period may be longer and subjects may remain in- clinic, as deemed necessary by the 
Investigator . 
Subjects who discontinue the study prior to Day 29 will undergo assessments scheduled for Day 29 at 
the time of discontinuation (see Table 2 ). Subjects who discontinue the study after Day 29 but prior to 
Day 61 wi ll undergo assessments scheduled for Day  61 at the time of discontinuation (se e Table 2) . 
Subjects who complete the study per protocol will return to the clinic for a follow -up safety assessment 
on Day 61 (± 2). 
Dose Escalation/Safety Cohort Review  
After e ach cohort, a review of safety data (eg, AE [including potential psychotic symptoms and 
behavior], vital signs, laboratory data, standard 12- lead ECG, etc.) and lurasidone injectable suspension 
exposure data for all subjects (or at least 5 lurasidone and 1 placebo subjects completed) in each cohort 
will be performed. Subsequent dosing at the next dose level/cohort will not occur until safety and 
exposure data (from at least 14 days after the single lurasidone injectable suspension dose) have been 
evaluated by the Safety Review Team (SRT). The SRT consists of the PI, the Sponsor's Responsible Physician or designee, the Sponsor’ s Project Medical Lead, the Sponsor’s Head of Translational 
Medicine and Early Development team or designee and the Medical Monitor. The SRT will also 
determine if sentinel subject dosing is required for study cohorts after Cohort 1. 
The decision to proceed to the next dose level/cohort and at what dose level will also be made by the 
voting members of the SRT, based on a review of the cl inical observations, laboratory data, and 
exposure data, and will require a majority agreement concerning acceptable safety and tolerability of 
lurasidone injectable suspension. Based on these safety reviews, a more conservative dose escalation 
may be used  that will be less than the planned dose escalation, or subsequent cohorts may repeat a dose 
level or de -escalate. For each  cohort, the SRT will monitor and review AE and exposure data 14 days 
and 28 days after the injection dose.  
Treatment assignments for  a particular cohort may be unblinded during a safety review meeting, but 
only after a blinded review of the safety data has been completed. PK exposure data will be utilized in the safety review; thus, it will be necessary for the bioanalytical laboratory to be unblinded to treatment 
assignment for the subjects.  
Determination of the Minimum Intolerable Dose (MID) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The MID will be defined as the dose of Lurasidone injectable suspension  at which dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT) oc curs. Dose- limiting toxicity is indicated by the occurrence of intolerable AEs, which are not 
fully defined a priori, but will be determined from the study data at the SRT meetings. Adverse events, 
including SAEs, which start prior to the study drug injection, will not be considered for stopping criteria. 
Dose stopping criteria are provided in Section  9.3. 
Once a safety stopping criterion is reached, the study will be terminated at that dose level. If none of the 
stopping criteri a has been attained, the study will proceed to the next higher dose level. Dosing of an 
additional cohort or cohorts at a dose between the identified MID and the highest dose below the MID 
may be conducted. The highest tolerated dose below the MID will be defined as the MTD for a single 
lurasidone injectable suspension dose.  
If the MTD is not established, additional dose cohorts may be commenced until the MTD is reached.  
Safety, Pharmacokinetic, and Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Safety will b e assessed throughout the study by monitoring AE (including injection site reactions),

physical examinations, vital signs ( pulse  rate, respiration rate, and body temperature), clinical laboratory 
tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel,  coagulation panel, and thyroid panel), 
standard 12 -lead ECGs, and the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  
Blood samples will be collected for serum  PK profiling of lurasidone and its metabolites in serum 
(ID-14283, ID- 14326, ID -11614, ID-20219 and ID-20220) and urine ( ID-14283, ID -14326, and 
ID-11614) in this subject population after injection  dosing at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments (see Table 2 ). Serum and urine samples collec ted for PK assessment may also be used for 
the additional characterization and/or bioanalytical method development of putative metabolites of 
lurasidone and for biomarker measurement . 
The pharmacodynamic impact of lurasidone injectable suspension  will b e assessed using the P ositive 
and N egative Schizophrenia Symptoms S cale (PANSS).  
Number of Subjects (planned):  
Approximately  8 subjects will be randomized per cohort for a total of up to 40 subjects and up to 
5 cohorts. 
Alternate subjec ts may  be admitted to the clinical site  in order to ensure that 8 subjects are dosed in each 
cohort. Subjects who are randomized but not dosed will be replaced by the alternate subject( s). 
Once  8 subjects per cohort are dosed, alternate subjects who are not needed to complete enrollment of a 
cohort will be discharged  following reintroduction of their prior medication if they are clinically stable 
(in the Investigator’s opinion) . 
Main Diagnosis and Criteria for Enrollment 
Adult male and female subjects 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive with a diagnosis  of schizophrenia as per 
DSM -IV-TR criteria, which in the opinion of the Investigator  has been clinically stable for the 6  months 
prior to Screening. Subjects must also be able and willing to remain off of prior antipsychotic 
medicat ion until the protocol -specified restabilization period. Subjects must also have  a stable living 
arrangement for at least 3  months prior to Study Day -12 and agree to return to a similar living 
arrangement after clinic discharge.  Chronically homeless su bjects should not be enrolled. The Medical 
Monitor should be consulted for individual cases as needed. 
Subjects will not be eligible if they have a k nown history of severe reaction to a previous antipsychotic 
(in the Investigator’s opinion) including up to 80 mg/day of oral lurasidone, or a h istory of drug -
dependence (per DSM -IV-TR) criteria during the 6-month period prior to Screening, or if they answer 
“yes” to “Suicidal Ideation” Items 4 or 5 on the C- SSRS at Screening or at any point prior to 
randomization or history of suicidal behavior within the last two years . Subjects will not be eligible if 
they have  had an acute exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms requiring change in antipsychotic 
medication (with reference to drug or dose) within 3 months (90 days)  before screening. 
The complete listing of study eligibility  criteria is provided in Section  7. 
Investigational Product, Dos age and Mode of Administration

Prior and Concomitant Medications  
In accordance with the approved product labeling for Latuda (see approved product labeling), lurasidone 
should not be used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, 
ritonavir, voriconazole, mibefradil). Lurasidone should not be used concomitantly with a strong 
CYP3A4 induce r (eg, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort , phenytoin, carbamazepine). A l ist of strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers included in Section  23, Appendix V). 
All prior antidepres sants and mood stabilizers (eg , lithium, divalproex/valproic acid, carbamazepine) 
must be discontinued as tolerated and clinically appropriate starting on Day -12. All other psychotropic medication (except as described in Section  9.5.3), including antipsychotic medication, must be 
discontinued as tolerated and clinically appropriate starting on Day -12 in a manner that is consistent 
with labeling recommendations and conventional medical practice.  
Non-psychotropic medications used to treat mild, chronic medical conditions may be used during 
Screening and after assignment of a subject number,  if the dose and regimen have been stable (±  25%) 
for at least 30  days prior to Screening. The concomitant medication dose may change as needed after a 
subject number is assigned (or be discontinued). In addition, use of nonprescription pain medications ar e 
allowed during all phases of the study provided these medications do not have a propensity for 
psychotropic effects and do not interfere with the evaluation of study medication. Medications for 
short-term treatment of a medical condition (no more than 10 days) are allowed with consultation with 
the Medical Monitor, provided that the medications are not drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (see Section  22, Appendix IV and  Sectio n 23, Appendix V, 
respectively).  
During the washout, treatment and post-treatment periods, t reatment with benztropine (up to 6 mg/day) 
will be permitted as rescue medication and as treatment for movement disorder s. In cases where 
benztropine is not available or a subject has had an inadequate response or intolerability to benztropine treatment, the following medications may be used to treat acute extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS) : 
biperiden (up to 16 mg/day) or trihexyphenidyl (up to 15 mg/day) or diphenhydramine (up to 100 mg/day). Treatment with amantadine (up to 300 mg/day) will be permitted as needed for akathisia. 
Medications used to treat movement disorders should not be given prophylactically. Medications used 
for movement disorders should be tapered and discontinued prior to a subject number is assigned but

may be reinstituted if symptoms emerge . 
In situations where anticholinergic agents or any other agents that may cause sedation are administered, 
these should be taken at the same time each day and should not be taken within 12  hours of scheduled 
assessments. When the specified drugs are not available, similar drugs at equivalent dosages will be substituted in consultation with the Medical Monitor. Concomitant use of lorazepam, temazepam, or 
zolpidem is permitted with the following restrictions: lorazepam is permitted for clinically significant anxiety/agitation or as a sedative/hypnotic up to a maximum daily dose of 6 mg/day. Intramuscular 
lorazepam is permitted up to 4 mg/day for acute anxiety/agitation, as clinically indicated. Lorazepam should be used sparingly, when clinically required, per Investigator judgment. Zolpidem (≤ 10  mg in any 
24-hour period) and temazepam (≤ 30 mg in any 24-hour period) may be administered, as needed, as 
sedatives/hypnotics. Hypnotic agents should be administered no more than once nightly and should not be used in combination. 
Medications used for the as -needed (PRN) treatment of anxiety/agitation and insomnia (eg, lorazepam 
and zolpidem) should not be used in close temporal proximity (defined as administration within 2 hours 
of each other). When lorazepam or zolpidem or other specified medications are not available, another 
similar agent at equivalent doses will be permitted as specified by the Medical Monitor. Opiates may be allowed in rare cases for a limited period of time with prior authorization from the Medical Monitor. 
Subjects who require treatment with one or more of the medications listed  in Section  22, Appendix IV or 
Section 23, Appendix V should be excluded or discontinued (as appropriate) from the study. Since these 
lists of drugs are not comprehensive, Investigators should use medical judgment when a subject presents 
with a medication not on the list or consult with the Medical Monitor for clarification.  
A complete listing of permitted medications and therapies, including rescue medications, as well as a 
complete listing of prohibited medications are provided in Section  9.5.

Statistical Methods  
Safety Analyses  
The safety anal ysis will be conducted by the treatment received using the Safety population, which will 
consist of all subjects who are randomized and receive study drug. AEs and all other safety data will be 
listed and summarized descriptively by treatment group (dose l evel of Lurasidone injectable suspension  
and placebo) in tabular or graphical formats, as appropriate. Subjects dosed with placebo will be 
analyzed as a pooled group. Observed  values , as well as change from basel ine for clinical safety 
laboratories, vital signs, and ECGs will be listed and summarized descriptively in tabular or graphical 
formats, as appropriate.  Any clinical ly significant results  in clinical safety laboratories , vital signs, and 
ECGs will be listed and summarized. Frequency and severity of suicidality, based on the C- SSRS, will 
be summarized . 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The PK analysis will be conducted on the PK population, which will consist of all subjects who are 
randomized and receive Lurasidone injectable suspension , have at least one measurable postdose 
concentration , and have had no relevant protocol deviations or documented reason that a PK profile was 
unreliable. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received. Serum  and urine concentrations

and PK parameters for Lurasidone i njectable suspension  and its metabolites will be listed and 
summarized descriptively by dose level and subdivided by gender in tabular or graphical formats, as 
appropriate. Descriptive summaries will include number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, 
coefficient of variation (CV%), minimum, median, maximum, geometric mean, and geometric CV%. 
Cmax, tmax, AUC 0-last, and AUC 0-inf for Lurasidone injectable suspension  will be the primary PK 
parameters and all others will be secondary PK parameters.  
Dose proportionality of Lurasidone injectable suspension  will be assessed using a power model for C max, 
AUC 0-last, and AUC 0-inf of Lurasidone injectable suspension  with a formula of ln (PK 
parameter) = α + β ⋅ln (dose level).  
The estimate of the slope (β), together w ith its 90% co nfidence interval (CI) will be calculated from the 
model. Dose proportionality assessment will be performed for the dose range studied. 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Analyses  
The pharmacodynamic variable is change from baseline in PANSS total score. T he pharmacodynamic 
variable will be analyzed by mixed model for re peated measures (MMRM) method. The MMRM model 
will include treatment, time, baseline score, and treatment -by-time interaction . 
Sample Size:  
There will be no formal estimation for the sample size as no previous human PK data are available for 
Lurasidone injectable suspension and the  primary endpoints are safety. The sample size of 8 subjects per 
cohort (6 Lurasidone injectable suspension  subjects and 2  placebo subjects) is selected based on clinical 
and practical considerations for a study of this design.

Note: Subjects who discontinue the study prior to Day  29 will undergo assessments scheduled for Day  29 at the time of discontinuation . Subjects who 
discontinue the study after Day  29 but prior to Day  61 will undergo assessments scheduled for Day  61 at the time of discontinuation . 
a Eligible subjects must be washed out/tapered off of their current antipsychotic medications within 5 to 6  half-lives prior to Day  -8 (may begin Day -19). 
Mandatory inpatient periods are Day  -12 to Day  15 (for treatment and observation) and Day  29 to Day  33 (for restabilization to previous medications ; 
restabilization begins Day  29). Subjects may remain inpatient until Day  33 at the Investigator’s discretion . 
b Vital signs  = Blood pressure (supine and standing), pulse  rate (supine and standing), respiration rate, and body temperature  will each be collected at the 
following times  
• Day -12 and Day -8: once daily  
• Days  -7 and -6: predose and 2 hours postdose  
• Day -1 
• Day 1 pre-injection  dose and 6 and 12 hours post -injection dose  
• Days  3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 ( time-matched to the predose timepoint on Day  1), and Days  22, 29, and 33 ( approximately time-matched to  the predose 
timepoint on Day  1), and Fo llow-up. 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 14 13 June 2018 Note: Supine blood pressure and pulse  rate should be collected at the same time as 12 -lead ECG (when 12 -lead ECG is collected for the same timepoint). A 
window of ±  10 minutes of scheduled time is allowed . After Cohort  1, timepoints for vital signs may be chan ged based on observed t max of Lurasidone 
injectable suspension and its metabolites . 
c Standard 12- lead ECGs will be collected at Screening and during the washout/taper period on Days  -12 and -8. On Days  -7 and -6, standard 12- lead ECGs will 
be collected pr edose and 2 hours postdose. Standard 12- lead ECGs will be collected predose and  6, and 12 hours post injection  dose on Day  1 and on Days  3, 
5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 (time -matched to the predose timepoint on Day  1), and Days  22, 29, and 33 (approximately time-matched to the predose timepoint on 
Day 1), and Follow -up. A window of ±  15 minutes of scheduled time is allowed  for ECGs performed up to and including Day  15. After Cohort  1, these 
timepoints may be changed based on observed t max of Lurasidone injectabl e suspension  and its metabolites . 
d Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Urinalysis, Lipid Panel, Coagul ation Panel, and Thyroid Panel.  
•Subjects are to fast ≥ 8 hours prior to blood sample collection for clinical laboratory tests .
•Blood samples will be collected f or Hematology and Serum Chemistry at screening, Day -8, Day  1 injection  predose , Days  8 and 15 (time -matched to
the predose timepoint on Day  1), and Days  22, 29, and 33 (approximately time-matched to the injection  predose sample on Day 1), and follow -up. A
window of ±  10 minutes is allowed for clinical laboratory test sample collection. Samples will be obtained at the same time that other blood  and urine
samples are taken whenever possible.
•Blood samples for thyroid panel, coagulation panel, and lipid pane l will be collected  at Screening, Day -8 , Day 1 injection  predose ,  Day 15
(time -matched to the predose timepoint on Day  1), and Day 29 (approximately time-matched to the injection  predose sample on Day 1).
•Urinalysis will be collected at screening, Day -8, Day  1 injection  predose (time -matched to the predose timepoint on Day 1), Days  8 and 15
(time -matched to the predose timepoint on Day  1), and Days  22, 29, and 33 (approximately time-matched to the injection  predose sample on Day 1),
and follow -up.
e Serum Prolactin levels will be blinded, except at screening and Day 1. Designated unblinded medical site staff will be notified if prolactin concentrations are 
> 200 ng/mL . Blood samples will be collected on Day -8, Day  1 injection predose,  Days  8 and 15 (time-matched to the predose timepoint on Day  1), and 
Days  22, 29, and 33 (approximately time-matched to the injection predose timepoint on Day 1), and follow -up. 
f Blood samples for serum  PK assessment will be collected at predose and 2  hours postdose on Days  -7 and -6, and  then at 0 hour (predose), 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 
72, 96, 120, 144,  336, 504, 672, and 1440 (± 48) hours after the injection  dose given on Day  1. A window of ±  5 minutes of scheduled time (up to 8  hours 
postdose), and ± 10 minutes of scheduled  time (from 12  hours postdose onward) is allowed. Blood sampling timepoint s for PK assessment for subsequent 
cohorts may be modified based on serum  concentration data from initial cohort(s). Evaluation of the relationship between the timing of below limit of 
quantification (BLQ) and the elimination half -life will be used to justify the revised blood sampling for PK and safety assessment schedule.  
g Urine samples for PK assessment will be collected at the following intervals: -0.5 to 0 hour (predose); 0 to 24, 24 to 48, 48 to 72,  72 to 96, 96 to 120, and 120 
to 144 hours  after the injection  dose given on Day 1 , and record ing of  the volume of urine sample at each time interval. Urine samples collected for PK analysis 
may also be used for the additional charact erization and/or bioanalytical method development of putative metabolites of DSP-1349M  and for biomarker 
measurement, if needed.  
h Tapering  of patient’s psychotropic medications prior to entry to the study has been done routinely in previously conducte d studies with lurasidone. The exact 
timing and method of taper will depend on the subject ’s medication regimen, but the tapering process will typically start approximately one week prior to 
Day -12 admission. However, for some subject s, the tapering process w ill begin sooner than one week and some may begin later than one week from Day  -12 
admission  based on PI’s evaluation . 
i Restabilization’ refers to the reintroduction of each subject ’s prior medications that were taken prior to entry into the study includi ng their psychotropic  
medications. The inpatient restabilization for reintroduction of prior medications including psychotropics may be longer, if needed . For early termination 
patients who received lurasidone dosing, following follow -up procedures they wi ll need to be restabilized following the restabilization procedures.  
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00  Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 15  13 June 2018 j The C -SSRS will be administered at Screening, during the Treatment/Observation period on Day  -8 (ie, pre -oral dosing), Da y -7 (postdose), Day  -1 
(pre-injection dose), Day  1 (postdose), and Days  7, 15, 22, and 29, at the end of restabilization on Day  33, and at follow -up Day  61 ± 2. The Screening/Baseline 
and Since Last Visit Versions  of the C -SSRS will be utilized in this study . 
k PANSS will be administered  once during Screening, and on Days  -7, 1 (predose) , 8, 15, 22, and 29.  
l Lunch will be provided  ≥ 4 hours postdose  on Days  -7, -6 and 1. Standard meals will be provided during the inpatient period and outpatient clinic return visits 
on when applicable . 
m Subjects will fast overnight for at least 8  hours on Day - 8 and Day  -7. On Days  -7 and -6, standard breakfast (minimum 350 calories) will be served 30  minutes 
prior to the planned dosing time. Dosing of l urasidone 80 mg orally will take place 30  minutes after the start of bre akfast. Subjects will receive dose 
administration at approximately the same time on each day of dosing during the study. L urasidone 80 mg will be administered with approximately 240-m L 
water  on Days  -7 and -6. Water intake is restricted for one hour before and two ho urs after dose administration; after which water will be allowed ad libitum . 
Subjects will fast for 4 hours after dosing on Day  -7 and on Day  -6. 
n Investigator  injection site safety assessment will include a rating of 1 -4 on each of 4  items (pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, and induration/swelling ). 
Assessments will be made on D ay 1 (immediately after injection , and 6 hours and 12 hours  after injection), Day 2 (24 hours after injection), D ays 3-15 (daily  
during the inpatient period), Day  22, and D ay 29. A window of +1 minute is allowed for the immediately after injection timepoint, and a window of ± 5 
minutes is allowed for the 6 and 12  hour timepoints  on Day 1 . In addition subjects will be monitored for potential allergic reaction for 15  minutes after 
injection.  A window of 0-5 minutes is allowed for the evaluation of potential allergic reaction . 
o Subjects will assess their injection site pain using a rating of 0-10 on a Likert Scale  (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain) . This assessment will be completed prior to 
the Investigator injection site assessment on D ay 1 (immediately after injection , and 6 hours and 12 hours  after injection ), Day  2 (24 hours after injection), 
Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, and Day 29. A window of +1 minute is allowed for the immediately aft er injection timepoint, and a window of ± 5 minutes is allowed 
for the 6 and 12 hour timepoints on Day  1. 
p Alternate subjects not included in the study cohort will be discharged following re introduction of their prior medication if they  are clinically sta ble (in the 
Investigator’s opinion) , subjects who received study drug will be eligible for discharge on Day  15 (but may remain inpatient at the Investigator’s discretion up 
to Day  33), and early withdrawal subjects will be discharged after follow -up assess ment procedures.  
q Concomitant medications will be recorded prior to and after oral and injection dosing.  
r In addition to any untoward medical occurrences in the subject  (pre and postdose on dosing days), assessment of the injection site and monitoring of  prodromal 
symptoms for seizures will be performed. If prodromal symptoms for seizure are found, additional neurological assessments will be done, as needed .

Confidential and Proprietary 25  13 June 2018 3. INTRODUCTION 
3.1. Background  
Lurasidone injectable suspension (DSP -1349M) is a novel compound synthesized by Sumitomo 
Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., as a candidate psy chotropic agent for the treatment of patients with 
schizophrenia. It possesses high affinities for dopamine D2, serotonin 5 HT2A, 5 HT7, 5 HT1A 
and noradrenaline α2C receptors. Compared with other atypical antipsychotics, lurasidone 
demonstrates similar binding affinities for the D2 and 5  HT2A receptors, but greater affinity for 
serotonin 5 HT1A receptors. Lurasidone displays no affinity for histamine H1  or acetylcholine 
M1 receptors.  
Lurasidone has a unique chemical structure that differs from conventional antipsychotic therapies such as the phenothiazine, butyrophenone, and benzamide classes of antipsychotic 
agents. The chemical name is (3aR ,4S,7R,7aS)-2-{(1R,2R)-2- [4-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3 
yl)piperazin -1-ylmethyl]cyclohexylmethyl}hexahydro -4,7- methano -2H-isoindole-1,3-dione 
hydrochloride. Due to its serotonin 5 HT2 blocking actions, lurasidone is associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than conventional antipsychotic therapeutic agents and is 
effective in ameliorating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In preclinical 
pharmacological studies, lurasidone has been shown to be effective in various animal models of 
schizophrenia and to have weak potential for inducing EPS. 
In general, the slow release characteristics (pharmacokinetics) of several current long acting 
injectable antipsychotics is attributed to either the rate of hydrolysis of the ester form of the 
antipsychotic molecule by esterases in muscle or to the slow rate of diffusion of the esterified 
antipsychotic from an oil vehicle. In contrast, injectable lurasidone is the free base of lurasidone 
hydrochloride that is placed in an aqueous solution as a suspension. Free base lurasidone has 
very low solubility in aqueous solution, so when injected into muscle, dissolution of freebase 
lurasidone in a limited aqueous surrounding governs the clearance from muscle into serum . 
Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric diso rder that has a profound effect on both the individuals 
affected and society ( Owen,  2016). Schizophrenia occurs at an incidence of roughly 15 men and 
10 women per 100,000 populations per year, a point prevalence of 4.6 per 1,000, and a lifetime morbid risk of around 0.7% ( McGrath,  2008). A coherent body of evidence from 
pharmacological and brain -imaging studies implicates dysfunction of dopaminergic 
neurotransmission in the genesis of psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations (Howes,  2014).  
Unemployment in people with schizophrenia is 80% to 90% ( Marwaha,  2004), and in 2013, the 
estimated societal economic burden of schizophrenia was estimated to be approximately $156 billion in the US ( Cloutier,  2016).  
Mortality from most natural causes, espec ially cardiovascular disorders, is the strongest 
contributor to the 10 to 20 year reduction in life expectancy ( Chesney, 2014). There is a clear 
need to develop antipsychotic compounds with reduced side effects, particularly those affecting 
metabolic processes that result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes ( Miyamoto, 2012). 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 26  13 June 2018 3.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
Non-adherence in medication- taking remains one of the major challenges in the treatment of any 
chronic illness such as schizophrenia. Numerous studies have found high levels of 
non-adherence in medication taking in patients with schizophrenia. One potentially valuable 
approach to enhancing adherence is the use of long- acting injecta ble antips ychotic medications. 
This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intramuscular 
(IM) injection of lurasidone injectable suspension (DSP -1349M) in adult subjects. This study 
will also determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of lurasidone and its metabolites in 
serum and urine after single IM dose administration of lurasidone injectable suspension. 
3.3. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The potential risks anticipated based on lurasidone clinical studies and lurasidone injectable 
suspension nonclinical studies conducted to date are amenable to detection via safety monitoring 
in this study (consisting of adverse event reporting, injection site reactions, vital sign assessments, electrocardiograms monitoring, clinical laboratory evaluations, physical 
examinations, and discontinuation summaries). The 28-day observation period after injection 
dosing is considered clinically appropriate for monitoring safety and tolerability. Similarly, the 28-day observation/follow-up period after restabilization (ie, subjects re- starting their prior 
medications) is considered clinically appropriate for safety monitoring and to ensure subjects are clinically stable.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a single -center, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, inpatient, single ascending 
dose (SAD) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of lurasidone injectable 
suspension in subjects with schizophrenia. This study will determine the minimum intolerable 
dose (MID), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lurasidone injectable suspension, and 
characterize the PK profiles of lurasidone metabolites in serum (ID-14283, ID -14326, ID -11614, 
ID-20219, and ID-20220) and urine ( ID-14283, ID -14326, and ID-11614) in this subject 
population. The potential effects of gender on the PK of lurasidone injectable suspension and its metabolites will also be evaluated when applicable.  
A study schematic is presented in Figure 1. Details of the s tudy assessments and other 
procedures to be performed at each visit are presented in Table 2 , Schedule of Assessments, and 
Section  10, Study Assessments. The maximum duration for study participation for each subject 
will be up to approximately 96 days. If necessary, subjects may return to the clinic at any time 
for an unscheduled visit. 
Figure  1: Study Schematic  
 
a Eligible subjects must be washed out/tapered off of their current antipsychotic medications 5 to 6  half-lives prior to 
Day -8 (may begin as early as Day  -19). Subjects are required to be inpatient from Day  -12 to Day  15 (for 
treatment and observation) and Day  29 to Day  33 (for restabilization to previous medications).  Subjects may 
remain inpatient up to Day  33 (at the Investigator ’s discretion).  
b Subjects will receive 2  oral lurasidone 80 mg doses (Days - 7 and -6) and be assessed for safety and tolerability for 
5 days (Days  –5 to -1) and to allow appropriate time to washout of the oral lurasidone dose.  
c Randomization occurs on Da y 1. Cohort 1 will receive a single lurasidone injectable suspension dose of 30  mg or a 
single placebo injection dose; thereafter, single lurasidone injectable suspension doses of 75, 150, 300, and 450 mg 
may be administered (cohorts  2-5). 
d Subjects will be monitored for safety after the single lurasidone injectable suspension or placebo injection dose 
until Day  29. Subjects may be discharged on Day  15 at  the Investigator’s discretion.  
e Subjects will restart prior medications (including antipsychotics) on  Day 29 under observation of clinical site staff.  
Subjects with schizophrenia who provide informed consent to participate in the study will 
undergo screening procedures and assessments between Days -35 to -13 to determine study 
eligibility.  

Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 29  13 June 2018 Eligible subjec ts will be washed out/tapered off of their current antipsychotic medications over 
5 to 6 half -lives prior to Day -8 (may begin Day  -19). Subjects will be monitored for safety 
during tapering/washout. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical site on Day  -12 and are 
require d to be inpatient until Day  15. 
Subjects will receive oral lurasidone 80  mg tablets on Day -7 and Day -6 (one dose per day), and 
be monitored for 5 days to ensure the subject is able to tolerate lurasidone (ie, absence of 
moderate adverse events). Subjects who tolerate dosing with oral lurasidone 80 mg will be 
eligible for randomization to receive a single lurasidone injectable suspension or placebo 
injection on Day 1. 
Subjects who are discharged after Day  15 will check into the clinical site again on Days 22 and 
29 for scheduled  assessments. Subjects will follow protocol procedures to remain in- clinic 
through Day 33 as they restart their prior medications (including antipsychotics), under observation of the Investiga tor/clinical site staff (ie, re stabilization period).  
Subjects who remained in-clinic through Day 29 will remain inpatient through Day 33 as they 
restart their prior medications (including antipsychotics) under observation of the 
Investigator/clinical site staff (ie , restabilization period). 
The restabilization period may be longer and subjects may remain in- clinic, as deemed necessary 
by the Investigator. 
Subjects who discontinue the study prior to Day 29 will undergo assessments scheduled for 
Day 29 at the time of discontinuatio n (see Table 2 ). Subjects who discontinue the study after 
Day 29 but prior to Day 61 will undergo assessments scheduled for Day 61 at the time of 
discontinuation (se e Table 2).  
Subjects  who complete the study per protocol will return to the clinic for a follow -up safety 
assessment on Day  61 (± 2).  
6.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
6.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
The treatment schedule will be generated by a non -study biostatistician.  
For each cohort, the randomization number will be sequentially assigned as subjects qualify for 
the study. Once 8 subjects per cohort are dosed, alternate subjects  who are not needed to 
complete enrollment of a cohort will be discharged following reintroduction of their prior 
medication if they are clinically stable (in the Investigator’s opinion). 
Once a randomization number has been assigned, it cannot be reused. 
Prior to dosing, all eligible subjects will be given a randomization number that assigns them to 
one of the two treatments. Randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially in the order the 
subject became eligible to participate in the study. The treatment schedule, a list consisting of the 
randomization numbers and their corresponding treatment assignment will be generated according to appropriate standard operating procedure(s). 
Subjects will receive single oral lurasidone 80  mg doses on Days -7 and -6, and be monitored for 
5 days to ensure the subject is able to tolerate lurasidone (ie, absence of moderate adverse 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 30  13 June 2018 events). Subjects who tolerate dosing with oral lurasidone 80 mg will be eligible for 
randomization on Day 1. 
The study is planned to include up to 5 cohorts. A total of 8 subjects (6  active and 2  placebo) will 
be dosed in each cohort. Lurasidone injectable suspension dosing w ill be initiated at 30  mg given 
as an intramuscular (IM) injection at the ventrogluteal site. Subsequent cohorts are planned to be 
dosed at 75, 150, 300, and 450 mg IM at the ventrogluteal site. Dose strengths after the first dose 
level may be modified based on safety assessments and exposure to lurasidone injectable suspension. 
All 5  planned dose cohorts may not be used, depending on the dose escalation strategy 
employed. Additional cohorts may be included in this study, as necessary, and determined 
follow ing a review of safety and exposure of lurasidone injectable suspension. Planned dose 
levels may be modified or repeated based on the overall safety profile of the current and/or previous cohorts. 
For Cohort 1, a sentinel group of 2 subjects will be dosed in a 1:1 ratio ( lurasidone injection: 
placebo) . A 7- day clinical assessment of safety and tolerability for the sentinel subjects will be 
made by the Investigator (including AEs, vital signs, and other clinically relevant findings ), the 
remaining 6 subjects  will be randomized in a 5:1 ratio (active: placebo). A sentinel group may 
not be required for future dose cohorts. If less than 6  subjects in a cohort complete through Day 29, additional subjects will be enrolled 
and randomized in a 1:1 ratio (active: placebo) until at least 6  subjects have completed the cohort. 
If additional subjects need to be enrolled in a cohort, up to 6 additional randomization numbers 
will be provided in a 1:1 ratio.   
6.2.2. Blinding  
This is a double-blind study. 
All study drug (active or p lacebo) will be dispensed according to the randomization schedule 
supplied by the Sponsor or its representative, using a method that will assure that subjects and 
blinded study site personnel remain blinded to the treatment (ie, active or placebo) being 
administered.  
Provided doses will be clearly labeled with a unique subject identifier and verified during 
preparation and at the time of administration to mitigate any possibility of dosing/randomization 
error.  
During the conduct of the cohorts, in order to maintain the blind during the time of study drug 
administration, up until a safety review of AEs and other safety data for a cohort is conducted, an 
unblinded clinical site pharmacist/nurse will dispense study drug in a manner that will protect the 
blind upon administration . All study drug (lurasidone injectable suspension or placebo) will be 
dispensed according to the randomization schedule supplied by the Sponsor or its representative, 
using a written study drug dispensing procedure that will assure that subjects remain blinded to 
the treatment being administered.  
Subjects, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical operations personnel, 
data analysts, and personnel at clinical laboratories will remain blind to the identity of the 
treatment from the time of randomization until database lock and unblinding, with the exception 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 31  13 June 2018 of the documented safety review process, using the following methods; (1) randomization data 
are kept strictly confidential (eg, sealed envelopes kept in a locked filing cabinet or placed in a 
safe) until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study 
with the following exceptions: bioanalytical lab personnel involved in the analysis of PK samples, safety data review team mem bers involved in regular review of safety data when it is 
determined that data need to be unblinded, (2) the identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of study drugs that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, administration, and appearance; (3) subjects will be dosed by an unblinded site staff member 
who is not part of the study team and will not conduct any other study related procedures. 
Preliminary PK concentration data transfer from the bioanalytical lab to the Sponsor’s 
bioanalytical manager and from the Sponsor’s bioanalytical manager to the PK scientist (for PK 
analysis) for each cohort safety review can only be handled with dummy IDs for study subjects. 
Final PK concentration data transfer can only be performed after the clinical database lock.  
Treatment assignments for a particular cohort may be unblinded during a safety review meeting 
but only after a blinded review of the safety data has been completed.  
Potentially unblinding laboratory results (prolact in) will be reviewed by an unblinded medical 
monitor and be blinded to the Subjects, site staff, and clinical team , as described in the study 
Medical Monitoring Plan . Results reaching pre -specified criteria will be provided to sponsor 
and SRT.  
6.2.3. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
Subject specific unblinding information (eg, individual envelopes) will be generated and stored in secured area in a tamper evident container. The blinded randomization information is to be 
broken only in an emergency when knowledge of such treatment may have an impact on further treatment decisions or aid in the emergency treatment of the subject. Every effort must be made 
to contact the Medical Monitor ( Table 1 ) prior to any unblinding of the st udy drug. The 
circumstances that lead to the unblinding of treatment assignment are to be promptly 
communicated via telephone and in writing to the Medical Monitor. Any subject for whom the 
blind is broken should undergo final evaluation procedures, in accordance with the follow-up 
visit on Day 61 (± 2) as described in Section  10.5.5. 
6.3. Rationale  
6.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
The SAD study design is appropriate for a first- in-human evaluation of the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of lurasidone injectable suspension. 
6.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
Dosing for the lurasidone injectable suspension formulation is based on the amount in mg of 
lurasidone present at the injection site following IM administration, which was ~60 mg at the 
lowest dose of 7.5 mg/kg in the dog. There was no no-observed- adverse effect level determined 
in the dog; therefore a 2-fold reduction in the amount of lurasidone at the injection site was recommended, which is equal to 30 mg. At the clinical formulation’s fixed concentration of 
150 mg/mL, this dose will be an in jection volume of 0.2 mL.  
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 32  13 June 2018 A 2-fold reduction is considered appropriate because the primary finding of granuloma is 
common following IM administration of an irritating substance. Clinicians are familiar with 
appropriate monitoring. This finding is reversible and non- lethal. The pharmacology of 
lurasidone is well known, and systemic findings in humans have been characterized over a range 
of serum  concentrations. 
After the lurasidone injectable s uspension starting dose of 30 mg, dose escalation will be as 
follows: 75, 150, 300, 450 mg for a single IM injection . A 6  week monitoring period for adverse 
events will be employed in this study. In animals, the injection site findings were apparent within  
1 week and findings persisted for an additional week before beginning to resolve. Therefore, if no injection site findings are seen within 2 weeks and no other stopping criteria are met, dose escalation may proceed.  
Projection of PK following each cohort indicates that C
max will not exceed 348 ng/mL. This 
value is the C max at 400 mg orally , which is the MTD (Study D1050217, Day 6). It is unlikely 
that IM administration will exceed this concentration as the depot will absorb more slowly than 
following oral administration. Therefore, routine safety monitoring will be utilized to determin e 
stopping criteria. 
In order to ensure subjects who are unable to tolerate lurasidone do not receive the lurasidone 
injectable suspension formulation, subjects will be evalua ted for tolerability after administration 
of oral lurasidone 80 mg for 2  days (ie, two doses) prior to lurasidone injectable suspension 
administration.  
The oral lurasidone 80 mg dose was previously established as the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) in healthy  subjects. In subjects with schizophrenia, an oral lurasidone dose of 
400 mg/day was previously established as the MTD.  
6.3.3. Rationale for the Study Population 
The subject population includes males and females ranging from 18 to 65 years of age, and in accord  with standard practice guidelines, will be required to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia 
(by DSM -IV-TR). 
6.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who withdraw consent prior to study completion, the number of visits and assessments has been limited to those required to collect the information needed to address the objectives of the study. Evaluation of safety and tolerability is essential for 
this study population, therefore, at the Investigator’s discretion, subjects may be inpatient d uring 
the washout/taper period as well as after the treatment /observation period. Obtaining PK samples 
postdose is an essential component of the study; therefore, subjects will remain in the clinic for the duration of the blood samples collection for serum  PK assessment, and a concerted effort by 
the clinical site will be made to enroll and randomize subjects with good venous access. In 
addition, every effort will be made to have subjects complete  follow- up safety contact . 
Refer to Section  14.3.9 for statistical considerations related to missing data.

Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 39  13 June 2018 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Study Drug  
Lurasidone 80 mg will be provided as the commercially available oral tablet formulation 
(Latuda®). 
Lurasidone and placebo for injection will be supplied as defined in Section  8.2. 
Subjects will receive oral lurasidone 80  mg on Days - 7 and -6, and be monitored for 5 days to 
ensure the subject is able to tolerate lurasidone (ie, absence of moderate adverse events).  
Subjects who tolerate dosing with oral lurasidone 80 mg will receive lurasidone or placebo 
injection on Day 1. 
9.2. Dose Escalation/Safety Cohort Review 
After each cohort, a review of safety data (eg, AE [including potential psychotic symptoms and 
behavior], vital signs, laboratory data, standard 12- lead ECG, etc.) and lurasidone injectable 
suspension exposure data for all subjects (or at least 5 lurasidone and 1 placebo subjects completed) in each cohort will be performed. Subsequent dosing at the next dose level/cohort will not occur until safety and exposure data ( from at least  14 days after the single lurasidone 
injectable suspension dose) have been evaluated by the Safety Review Team (SRT). The SRT consists of the PI, the Sponsor’s Responsible Physician or designee, the Sponsor’ s Project 
Medical Lead, the Sponsor’s Head of Translational Medicine and Early Development team or 
designee and the Medical Monitor. The SRT will also determine if sentinel subject dosing is 
required for study cohorts after Cohort 1. 
The decisi on to proceed to the next dose level/cohort and at what dose level will also be made by 
the voting members of the SRT, based on a review of the clinical observations, laboratory data, 
and exposure data, and will require a majority agreement concerning acceptable safety and tolerability of lurasidone injectable suspension. Based on these safety reviews, a more 
conservative dose escalation may be used that will be less than the planned dose escalation, or 
subsequent cohorts may repeat a dose level or de- escal ate. For each cohort, the SRT will monitor 
and review AE and exposure da ta 14  days and  28 days after  the injection dose.  
Treatment assignments for a particular cohort may be unblinded during a safety review meeting, but only after a blinded review of the s afety data has been completed. PK exposure data will be 
utilized in the safety review; thus, it will be necessary for the bioanalytical laboratory to be 
unblinded to treatment assignment for the subjects. 
9.3. Determination of the MID and MTD  
The MID will be defined as the dose of Lurasidone injectable suspension at which dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) occurs. Dose- limiting toxicity is indicated by the occurrence of intolerable AEs, 
which are not fully defined a priori, but will be determined from the study data a t the SRT 
meetings. The following criteria will be used as a guide:  
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 40  13 June 2018 • If 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug have either multiple moderate 
AEs and/or a severe AE possibly related to study drug as determined by the SRT – 
MID may have been reached , and safety data will be unblinded. 
• If more than one subject but less than 50% of the subjects receiving study drug have 
either multiple moderate AEs and/or a severe AE possibly related to study drug as determi ned by the SRT – a dose level/ cohort may be r epeated or a modified 
escalation may be employed, and safety data of the subject(s) in question will be 
unblinded. 
The SRT may decide to stop dose escalation, repeat a dose, or de- escalate if the number, 
severity, or type of AEs indicates that higher doses would not be tolerated. In addition, the following stopping criteria for dose-escalation will also be used to assess whether to proceed to a 
higher dose level in the next cohort. Dose escalation will not occur, although a dose cohort may 
be repeated or de- escalate if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Adverse Events  
- A SAE associated with the use of the study drug with a reasonable possibility that 
the event may have been caused by the study drug occurs in any subject on 
active drug.  
• Cardiac Parameters  
- A confirmed value of QTcF interval > 500 ms or >  60 ms change from baseline, 
based on cardiologist over read ECGs occurs in any 2 subjects on active drug. 
• Hepatic Parameters  
- Liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST], or total bilirubin [TBL]) >  3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) occurs in any 
3 subjects on active drug. 
- Any one of Hy’s law criteria are met for any subject on active drug.  
- ALT or AST >  8 x ULN.  
- ALT or AST >  5 x ULN for more than 2 weeks.  
- ALT or AST >  3 x ULN and (TBL >  2 x ULN or international normalized ratio 
[INR]  > 1.5). 
- ALT or AST >  3 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).

Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ,” 2007.  
Adverse events, including SAEs, which start prior to study drug injection , will not be considered 
for stopping criteria. 
Once a safety stopping criterion is reached, the study will not escalate beyond that dose level. If 
none of the stopping criterion has been attained, the study will proceed to the next higher dose 
level. Dosing of an additional cohort or cohorts at a dose between the identified MID and the 
highest dose below the MID may be conducted. The highest tolerated dose below the MID will be defined as the MTD for a single lurasidone injectable suspension dose. 
If the MTD is not established, additional dose cohorts may be commenced until the MTD is 
reached.  
9.4. Treatment Compliance  
This is a single -dose study. Study drug will be administered at the clinical site. The date and time 
of study dru g administration will be recorded.  
9.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
The following information on a ll concomitant medication  administered will be recorded on the 
CRF  and will include m edication  name, dose, dose unit, frequency, route, start date, stop date, 
and indication. Any medication or non- pharmacological therapy that is taken by or administered 
to the subject at any point during the course of this study must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Information on the format and version of coding dictionary is provi ded in the Data Management 
Plan. All medications will be coded using WHO- DD. 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 42  13 June 2018 9.5.1. Prior Medications  
All prior antidepressants and mood stabilizers (eg, lithium, divalproex/valproic acid, 
carbamazepine) must be discontinued as tolerated and clinically appropriate starting on Day -12. 
All other psychotropic medication (except as described in Section  9.5.3), including antipsychotic 
medication, must be discontinued as tolerated and clinically appropriate starting on Day -12 in a manner that is consistent with labeling recommendations and conventional medical practice.  
These prior medications will not be allowed until subje cts have completed Day  30. 
Initiation of new psychotherapeutic interventions (eg, a new course of psychotherapy) will not be permitted during the study through the restabilization period. Subjects who have participated in 
ongoing psychotherapy treatment for at least 12 weeks prior to screening will be permitted to 
continue t his treatment during the study.  
Additional medication use as specified in the exclusion criteria is prohibited prior to the study . 
9.5.2. Concomitant Nonpsychotropic Medications 
Non-psychotropic medications used to treat mild, chronic medical conditions may be used during 
Screening and after assig nment of a subject number, if the dose and regimen have been stable 
(± 25%) for at least 30  days prior to S creening. The concomitant medication dose may change as 
needed (or be discontinued) after a subject number is assigned. In addition, use of 
nonprescription pain medications are allowed during all phases of the study provided these medications do not have a propensity for psychotropic effects and do not interfere with the 
evaluation of study medication. Medications for short- term treatment of a medical condition (no 
more than 10 days) are allowed with consultation with the Medical Monitor provided that the 
medications are not drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers 
(see Section  22, Appendix IV and Section  23, Appendix V, respectively ). 
9.5.3. Concomitant Psychotropic Medications  
During the wash -out, treatment and post-treatment periods, treatment with benztropine (up to 
6 mg/day) will be permitted as rescue medication and as treatment for movement disorders. In cases where benztropine is not available or a subject has had an inadequate response or 
intolerability to benztropine treatment, the following medications may be used to treat acute EPS: biperiden (up to 16 mg/day) or trihexyphenidyl (up to 15 mg/day) or diphenhydramine (up 
to 100 mg/day). Treatment with amantadine (up to 300 mg/day) will be permitted as needed for akathisia. Medications used to treat movement disorders should not be given prophylactically. Medications used for movement disorders should be tapered and discontinued prior to a subject 
number is assigned but may be reinstituted if symptoms emerge . 
In situations where anticholinergic agents or any other agents that may cause se dation are 
administered, these should be taken at the same time each day and should not be taken within 12 hours of scheduled assessments. When the specified drugs are not available, similar drugs at 
equivalent dosages will be substituted in consultation w ith the Medical Monitor. Concomitant 
use of lorazepam, temazepam, or zolpidem is permitted with the following restrictions: 
lorazepam is permitted for clinically significant anxiety/agitation or as a sedative/hypnotic up to 
a maximum daily dose of 6  mg/day . Intramuscular lorazepam is permitted up to 4 mg/day for 
acute anxiety/agitation, as clinically indicated. Lorazepam should be used sparingly, when 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 43  13 June 2018 clinically required, per Investigator judgment. Zolpidem (≤ 10 mg in any 24 -hour period) and 
temazepam (≤  30 mg in any 24-hour period) may be administered, as needed, as 
sedatives/hypnotics. Hypnotic agents should be administered no more than once nightly and 
should not be used in combination. 
Medications used for the as- needed  treatment of anxiety/agitation and insomnia (eg,  lorazepam 
and zolpidem) should not be used in close temporal proximity (defined as administration within 
2 hours of each other). When lorazepam or zolpidem or other specified medications are not available, another similar agent at equivalent doses will be permitted as specified by the M edical 
Monitor. Opiates may be allowed in rare cases for a limited period of time with prior authorization from the Medical Monitor. Subjects who require treatment with one or more of the medications listed in Section  22, Appendix IV or Section  23, Appendix V should be excluded or 
discontinued (as appropriate) from the study. Since these lists of drugs are not comprehensive, 
Investigators should use medical judgment when a subject presents with a medication not on the list or consult with the Medical Monitor for clarification.  
9.5.4. Prohibited Medications  
In accordance with the approved product labeling for Latuda (see approved product labeling), lurasidone should not be used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, voriconazole, mibefradil). Lurasidone should not be used 
concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (eg, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort, 
phenytoin, carbamazepine). A list of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers included in Section  23, Appendix V).  
The use of herbal supplements or other complementary or alternative medications during the trial is not permitted . 
9.6. Contraception Requirements  
Female Subjects  
1. Female su bject must be using and willing to continue using a highly effective form of 
birth control for at least 28 days prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, during the treatment period, and 2 months (60  days) after completion or premature 
disco ntinuation from the study drug. Highly effective forms of contraception include: 
• Combined estrogen and progestogen containing hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal or transdermal) associated with inhibition of ovulation. 
• Progestogen -only hormonal cont raception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated 
with inhibition of ovulation. 
• Intrauterine device.  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Bilateral tubal ligation.  
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 44  13 June 2018 • Male sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence 
of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male 
partner should be the sole partner for that subject. 
• True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject. P eriodic abstinence (eg , calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Women using hormonal contraception must use an additional form of contraception (eg, 
condom with spermicide). 
2. A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: 
a. Non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, 
including any female who is pre-menarchal or post-menopausal); 
- Postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for greater than 2 years (or 
confirmed by FSH level) with an appropriate clinical profile. 
- Women who have not been confirmed as postmenopausal should be advised to 
use contraception as outlined below. 
- Women who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy (as determined by subject’s medical history).  
b. Child -bearing potential (all females ≤ 65 years of age), has a negative pregnancy test 
at screening and agrees to satisfy one of the following requirements: 
- Compl ete abstinence from intercourse (as part of an abstinent lifestyle) a 
minimum of 2  months prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, 
throughout the Treatment Period, and for a minimum of 3 months after 
completion or premature discontinuation from the study drug; or, 
- Established use of highly effective methods of contraception from 1 month prior 
to administration of the first dose of s tudy drug, during the Treatment Period, and 
2 months after completion or premature discontinuation from the s tudy drug. 
Highly effective methods of birth control are listed above in number 1).  
Because of the unacceptable failure rate of barrier (chemical and/or physical) methods, the barrier method of contraception must only be used in combination with a highly eff ective 
method. Post-coital methods of contraception are not permitted. 
Male Subjects  
Male subject with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must ensure that his partner(s) uses 
the methods of contraception as outlined for female subjects above. 
9.7. Guid ance for Overdose  
Refer to the approved product labeling for guidance for overdose with lurasidone oral tablets.

which water will be allowed ad libitum. Lunch will be provided ≥ 4 hours postdose on Days -7, -6 and 1. Standard meals will be provided 
during the inpatient periods and outpatient clinic return visits when applicable. 
10. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
A study schematic is presented in Figure  1. A summary of assessments to be conducted at each 
visit is  presented in  Table 2 . 
Assessments will be conducted within the time frames specified. All times are relative to the time of dosing for individual subjects  unless otherwise specified . If no time window is specified, 
assessments should occur ± 1 hour of schedule. 
10.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject self -report will be acceptable for listing all prior and concomitant medication use, 
demographics, medical history, psychiatric history, and evaluation for inclusion/exclusion except 
where specific protocol procedures are mandated to ensure appropriate enrollment (eg, certain baseline laboratory values). All medications taken with in the 30 days before screening will be 
recorded.  
Demographics (date of birth, sex, ethnicity, race), prior and current medications, and medical and psychiatric history will be collected.  
10.2. Safety Assessments  
The Investigator or appropriate designee will rev iew results of safety assessments as they 
become available.  The Sponsor must be kept fully informed of any clinically significant findings 
either at Screening or subsequently during study conduct through appropriate adverse event reporting and/or escalatio n to the Medical Monitor. Please also refer to the dose escalation 
stopping criteria Section  9.3).

Confidential and Proprietary 46  13 June 2018 10.2.1. Pretreatment Events and Adverse Events  
Pretreatment events will be recorded from the time informed consent is pro vided at screening 
until the time of first lurasidone oral tablet dose administration at Day  -7. 
Adverse events will be collected for each subject from immediately after the first lurasidone oral 
tablet dose administration at Day -7 until the follow -up vis it at Day  61 (±  2). 
Subjects should be queried in a non-leading manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there 
been any change in your health status since your last visit?”). See Section  11, Safety Reporting. 
AEs and SAEs will be monitored throughout the study at all visits. 
10.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by protocol are listed in Section  20, Appendix II . 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests. All clinical laboratory 
tests will be performed locally . For clinical laboratory procedures, sampling, and shipping, the 
site w ill follow their standard procedures. All clinical laboratories will be C ollege of American 
Pathologists  and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA) (or equivalent) 
certified.  
Any point of care kits that are performed on site by study personnel rather than in a lab must be 
CLIA waived and the study center  must possess a CLIA cer tificate of Waiver.  
A window of ± 10 minutes is allowed for clinical laboratory test sample collection. Samples will be obtained at the same time that other blood and urine samples are taken whenever possible. 
Serum Prolactin levels will be blinded, except at screening and Day 1. Investigator will be 
notified if prolactin concentrations are > 200 ng/mL  
10.2.3. Physical Examinations 
Complete physical examinations will be performed. Worsening or changes in findings will be 
recorded as pretreatment events (prior to dosing) or as adverse events ( after dosing ). 
10.2.4. Injection Site Assessment s 
10.2.4.1. Investigator Injection Site Assessments  
The Investigator will assess the injection site using a  rating of 1 -4 on each of the 4 items (pain, 
tenderness, erythema/redness, and induration/s welling ). A window of + 1 minute is allowed for 
the immediately after injection timepoint, and a window of ± 5 minutes is allowed for the 6 and 
12 hour injection site assessments on Day 1. 
In addition subjects will be monitored for potential allergic reaction for 15 minutes after injection . 
A window of 0-5 minutes is allowed for this assessment.  
10.2.4.2. Subject Injection Site Assessments  
The subject will assess their injection site pain using a rating of 1-10 on a Likert scale (0 = no 
pain, 10 = worst pain). This will be completed prior to the Investigator’s injection site 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 47  13 June 2018 assessment . A window of +1 minute is allowed for the immediately after injection timepoint, and 
a window of ± 5 minutes is allowed for the 6 and 12 hour injection site assessments on Day 1. 
10.2.5. Weight, Body Mass Index, and Height 
Weight and height should be measured in street clothing with no shoes. Body mass index (BMI) 
will be calculated by the site (see Section  24, Appendix VI for calculation and BMI table). 
10.2.6. Vital Signs  
Blood pressure (supine and standing), pulse rate (supine and standing), respiration rate, and body 
temperature will be measured . 
Supine blood pressure and pulse rate will be  collected at the same time as 12 -lead ECG (when 
12-lead ECG is colle cted for the same timepoint). A window of ± 10 minutes of scheduled time 
is allowed.  After Cohort  1, scheduled  timepoints for vital signs measurements may be changed 
based on observed t max of Lurasidone injectable suspension and its metabolites. 
After lying supine for ≥  5 minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiratory rate, pulse 
rate, and oral temperature will be collected. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be taken again 
after standing for 2 to 4  minutes . The same arm should be used during each assessment of blood 
pressure and pulse rate throughout the s tudy.  
If a subject develops symptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension (light- headedness, 
dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing) at any point, his or her supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate should be collected at that time in the manner described above. 
Vital signs will be obtained prior to clinical laboratory collection and performance of an ECG. 
10.2.7. 12-Lead  ECG  
All ECGs will be obtained in the supine position, after the subject has been resting supine for at 
least 5  minutes. ECGs will be 12 -lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. ECGs should be obtained 
prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the same ECG recorder for all visits within individ ual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core lab according to 
established quality assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer to Section  19, 
Appendix I for additional information. 
A wind ow of ± 15 minutes of scheduled time is allowed. After Cohort 1, scheduled timepoints 
may be changed based on observed t
max of Lurasidone injectable suspension and its metabolites.  
10.2.8. Columbia -Suicidality Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a tool de signed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs (suicidal behavior 
and suicidal ideation) throughout the study. The strength of this suicide classification system is 
in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over -identification of 
suicidal behavior. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C- SSRS. At the Screening visit, the Screening/Baseline 
version will be completed; for all subsequent visits, the “Since Last Visit” version of the C -SSRS 
will be administered.  
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 48  13 June 2018 Subjects who answer “yes” to “suicidal ideation” item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some 
intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent) on the C- SSRS assessment at Screening (in the past 1 month) are not eligible and  must be 
referred to the Investigator for follow- up evaluation. 
Further information regarding administration of the C-SSRS, including rater training and certification as we ll as recording C- SSRS scores , will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual . 
10.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for serum PK assessment will be collected at pre dose and 2 hours after tablet 
administration , and at predos e and multiple timepoints up  to 1440 (± 48) hours after the injection 
dose. 
Validated liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) methods will be used 
for determination of lurasidone and metabolite concentrations . 
The detailed sample collection procedures are provided i n Section  21, Appendix III  for blood 
and urine sampling and sample handling guidelines. Blood and urine collection date and times 
(clock time) must be recorded.  
A window of ± 5 minutes of scheduled time (up to 8 hours postdose), and ± 10 minutes of 
scheduled time (from 12 hours postdose onward) is allowed. Blood sampling timepoints for PK 
assessment for subsequent cohorts may be modified based on serum concentration data from 
initial cohort(s). Evaluation of the r elationship between the timing of below limit of 
quantification (BLQ) and the elimination half -life will be used to justify the revised blood 
sampling for PK and safety assessment schedule. 
For subjects receiving lurasidone injectable suspension treatments, all samples will be measured 
for lurasidone and its metabolites in serum ( ID-14283, ID -14326, ID -11614, ID -20219 and 
ID-20220) and in urine (ID-14283, ID 14326, and ID-11614) after a single dose of lurasidone 
injectable suspension. For placebo subjects usually only a subset of serum  and urine samples will 
be measured to confirm no dosing error, interference, or occurrence of contamination. 
Cmax, tmax, AUC 0-last, and AUC 0-inf for Lurasidone injectable suspension will be the primary PK 
parameters and all others will be secondary PK parameters.  
Dose proportionality of Lurasidone injectable suspension will be assessed using a power model 
for C max, AUC 0-last, and AUC 0-inf of Lurasidone injectable suspension with a formula of ln (PK 
parameter)  = α + β⋅ln (dose l evel) . 
The following PK parameters, determined by noncompartmental methods using Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® version 6.4 or higher, are based on the individual subject’s serum  concentration 
data.

Ae0-144h The cumulative amoun t of the analyte excreted from time zero to 144 hours. The 
amount of the analyte excreted in the urine during a given collection interval is 
calculated as the product of the urinary volume and the urinary concentration. The 
cumulative amount of the analyte  excreted during the time interval is calculated by 
summing the amounts excreted in all of the collection intervals between t1 and t2; 
nominal  t1 holds the value 0 and nominal t2 holds the value 144, respectively.  
CLR Renal clearance for an analyte during  the time interval t1 and t2 is calculated as:  
CL R = Ae t1-t2/AUC t1-t2 
Fe Percent of administered analyte  excreted unchanged in urine during the time 
interval  t1 to t2 is calculated as: 
fe = (Ae t1-t2/Dose)*100 
Remaining serum  samples after PK analysis may  also be used for the additional characterization 
and/or bioanalytical method development of putative metabolites of lurasidone injectable 
suspension and for other exploratory measurements, if needed . 
10.4. Pharmacodynamic Assessment  (PANSS)  
The PANSS is an inte rview -based measure of the severity of psychopathology in adults with 
psychotic disorders. The measure is comprised of 30 items and 3  scales: the Positive subscale 
assesses hallucinations, delusions, and related symptoms; the Negative subscale assesses 
emotional withdrawal, lack of motivation, and similar symptoms; and the General 
Psychopathology subscale addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somati c concern, and 
disorientation. 
An anchored Likert scale from 1-7, where values of 2 and above indicate the presence of 
progressively more severe symptoms, is used to score each item. Individual items are then 
summed to determine the total score.

Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 62  13 June 2018 11. SAFETY R EPORTING  
11.1. Definitions 
11.1.1. Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of signing the informed consent form 
(ICF) and drug administration are pre- treatment events. Those that occur after administration of 
study drug are considered AEs. Pre -treatment hospitalizations that occur in accordance with  local 
clinical practice during the screening period (for wash-out from prior or concomitant 
medications) will not be considered as SAEs and do not need to be reported as such. Any 
untoward event that may occur during the hospitalization must be recorded as a pretreatment  
event. If hospitalization is prolonged by an untoward event, the event must be reported as an SAE.  
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal or 
clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration 
of a medicinal  (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of 
pre-existing conditions. 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
11.1.2. Serious  Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is pretreatment event or an AE that meets one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth def ect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in  an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization . 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarction)  (see Sectio n 11.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 63  13 June 2018 relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functioning as defined by the criteria above.  
During the study, if a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (eg, elective surgery) that was scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospitalization is considered a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SA E, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of 
hospitalization).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred 
in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
11.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, an d 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be 
recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recor ded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then the sign (eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) will 
be recorded as the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results w ill be reviewed by the Investigator. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. An y abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study cent er. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical 
significance. If the result of any test (or repeat test, if done) from the samples taken during 
Screening is indicated as clinically significant and is not covered by the inclusion criteria in 
Section  7.1, the subject will not be allowed into the study. Additional testing during the study 
may be done if medically indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples 
taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the Follow- Up/Study Completion  Visit, this should 
be recorded as an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalized or stabilized.  
All on -site E CG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by the Investigator. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigator. 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 64  13 June 2018 11.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investiga tor’s normal clinical practice.  
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
Pre-treatment events will be recorded from the time informed consent is provided at S creening 
until just prior to first lurasidone oral tablet study drug dose at Day -7. AEs will be recorded 
beginning after first study drug dose administration on Day 1 until the follow -up/study 
completion  visit at Day  61 (± 2). 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definitions for severity , 
frequency , action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE:  
• Mild  – Ordinarily transient sympto ms that do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other t reatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate – Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Other  treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe – Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s daily activities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE : 
• Once – an isolated episode.  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
• Unknown  
The causal relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment: 
• Not related  
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 65  13 June 2018 o Not related  – Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease. 
• Related  
o Possible  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug adm inistration, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there 
is a plausible mechan ism to implicate the study drug. 
o Definite  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by concurrent drugs or underlying disease. The AE should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory 
before assigning a definite causality.  
The Medical Advisor is the initial contact person for protocol related questions or discussion of 
AEs. The contact information for the Medical Advisor as well as other emergency contact 
information can be found in Table 1  of this protocol. 
11.4. Immediately Reportable Events  
The following medical events must be immediately reported to  the Sponsor: 
• SAE  
• Pregnancy  
Emergency contact information can be found in Table 1 . 
11.4.1. Serious Adverse Event  
If the Investigator or study center staff becomes aware of an SAE that occurs in a study subject 
up to and including the final follow-up, this must be reported immediately to the Sponsor whether considered related or unrelated to the study drug. SAEs must be recorded on the CRF 
and the data recorded should agree with that on the SAE form. 
Following the end of subject participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to the Sponsor PPD P harmacovigilance (PVG) if 
considered at least possibly related to the s tudy drug. 
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event 
is otherwise explained.  
In addition to the initial telephone notification, a n initial SAE  form as applicable must be 
completed and signed and sent via fax or email (see Table 1 ) to the Sponsor PPD -PVG within 
24 hours of the Investigator or s tudy center staff becoming aware of the event. The SAE form 
must be signed by the Investigator or approp riate designee. The Sponsor PPD -PVG provides the 
SAE form used to report SAEs. 
SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) by the Principal Investigator  or the appropriate person at the study center if 
required per IRB/IEC guidelines. 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 66  13 June 2018 The appropriate PVG group must be contacted immediately upon first knowledge of the incident. 
The immediate report should be made by the Investigator within a very short period of time and 
under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours following knowledge of the SAE or 
pregnancy. 
11.4.2. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies  that occur from the time th at informed consent is signed through the final 
follow-up/study completion  visit will be collected and reported on the Pregnancy Event Form . 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be instructed to return 
promptly/within 48 hours of the first notification of pregnancy to the study center and undergo a 
serum/urine pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. Every effort will be made to follow up 
all pregnancies, including those in the female partner of male subjects, until resolution (ie, termination [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth), providing the volunteers consent to 
follow-up. 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via fax to 
PPD-PVG within  24 hours of the Investigator or s tudy center staff becoming aware of the 
pregnancy The Sponsor provides the Pregnancy Event Form. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or other AEs were detected . 
 
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 67  13 June 2018 12. TERMINATION OF SUBJECT FROM 
STUDY/ DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG  
12.1. Criteria for Subject Termination  
Subject s may terminate the study participation  at any time for any reason.  
The possible reasons for the termination of study participation  are as follows : 
• Adverse event.  
• Lost to follow- up (specify).  
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal by subject (specify).  
• Protocol deviation (specify) . 
• Death . 
• Other (specify).  
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (eg, experiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study. 
The reason for discontinuation and information on the epoch will be recorded on the appropriate 
CRF.  In case of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
Alternate subjects may be admitted to the clinical site in order  to ensure that 8 subjects are dosed 
in each cohort. Subjects who are randomized but not dosed will be replac ed by the alternate 
subject(s).  
Once 8 subjects per cohort are dosed, alternate subjects  who are not needed to complete 
enrollment of a cohort will be discharged  following reintroduction of their prior medication if 
they are clinically stable (in the Investigator’s opinion) . 
Subjects who discontinue the study prior to Day 29 will undergo assessments scheduled for Day 29 at the time of discontinuation  (see Section  10.5.4.1).  Subjects who discontinue the study 
after Day  29 but prior to Day 61 will undergo assessments scheduled for Day 61 at the time of 
discontinuation (see Section  10.5.5).  
Protocol D1052024, Version 2.00 Lurasidone Injectable Suspension 
Confidential and Proprietary 68  13 June 2018 13. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the s tudy at this study center for safety or 
administrative reasons at any time  whil e safeguarding that early termination does not 
compromise subjects’ safety or well -being. In particular, a study center that does not recruit at an 
acceptable rate may be closed . Should the s tudy be terminated and/or the study center closed for 
whatever reason, all documentation and s tudy medication s pertaining to the study must be 
return ed to the Sponsor or its representative. 
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will be required to undergo final study 
assessments scheduled for the Day  61 (±  2) visit at the time of discontinuation. After study 
completion, subjects will be provide d with access to standard care.  
14. STATISTICS  
The comprehens ive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods 
planned for this study and will be finalized prior to database lock . 
14.1. Sample Size  
There will be no formal estimation for the sample size as no previous human PK data are available for lurasidone injectable suspension and the  primary endpoints are safety. The sample 
size of 8 subjects per cohort (6 lurasidone injectable suspension subjects and 2  placebo subjects) 
is selected based on clinical and practical considerations for a study of this design. Approximately 70 subjects are planned overall to ensure that up to 40 subjects receive lurasidone 
injectable suspension or placebo.  
14.2. Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations will be defined: 
• Safety population: The Safety popula tion will consist of all subjects who were 
randomized and received study drug. All analyses will be performed according to treatment received. This population will be used for analysis of baseline and 
safety  data.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) population: The PK population includes Safety population subjects who received lurasidone injectable suspension (active) and have at least 
1 postdose quantifiable serum  or urine lurasidone injectable suspension and 
metabolite(s) concentration. This population will be used for PK analysis.  
• Pharmacodynamic (PD) population: The PD population will include all subjects in 
the Safety Population who have valid baseline and at least one post- baseline PANSS  
assessment.

PK parameters will also include coefficient of variation  (CV%), geometric mean and 
geometric CV%.  
SAS® Version  9.4 or higher will be used for all analyses. 
14.3.1. Subject Disposition  
The total number of screened subjects, the number of subjects who are screen failures, and the 
number of subjects randomized will be presented. The number and percentage of subjects who 
were randomly assigned to treatment and dosed and not dosed, who were included in each population will be summarized. The number and percentage of subjects who complete and 
discontinue study will be summarized, along with reasons for study discontinuation. Subject 
disposition will be displayed by treatment and overall.  
14.3.2. Drug Exposure and Complianc e 
A data listing, by subject, containing the study medication dosing and dosing errors, if any, will 
be provided. Because this is a single dose study, treatment compliance will not be summarized. 
14.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of 
potentially IPDs. The potentially IPDs will be identified through programmatic checks of s tudy 
data, as well as through review of selected data listings. The potentially IPDs to be reviewed include, but are not limited to, subjects who: 
• Did not me et inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Received any disallowed concomitant medication  
• Informed consent date obtained after date of study medication  
• Other  
Additional IPDs may be identified from clinical review o f Investigator comments or other data. 
Individual IPDs will be presented in a data listing.  
14.3.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The number and percentage of subjects in each racial group will be summarized. Age, height, 
weight, and BMI may be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). 
The medical history of subjects will be coded by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term 
(PT) using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activiti es (MedDRA v.  20.1 or higher). The 
number and percentage of subjects with abnormal findings in each SOC and each PT will be 
summarized.

The following conventions will be followed in summarizing AEs: 
• For subject incidence summaries, each subject will be counted only once within each 
SOC and wi thin each preferred term.  
• If a subject reports more than one AE within a preferred term and/or a system organ 
class , the AE  with the highest known severity within each system organ class and 
within each preferred term will be included in the summaries by s everity.  
• For summaries by relationship to the study medication, AEs will be grouped as 
“related” or “not related ,” AEs with relationship to study medication assessed as 
“possible,” “probable,” or “definite” will be grouped as “related ,” and AEs with 
relati onship to study medication assessed as “ not related ” will be summarized  as “not 
related .” If a subject reports more than one AE within the same treatment regimen, 
SOC and PT, and any are related, it  will be summarized as related.  
Summaries of SAEs  and AEs leading to study  discontinuation will be provided. Additional 
summaries may be provided using AEs of special interest. 
A listing of all AEs, as well as a listing of deaths, a listing of SAEs, and a listing of AEs leading

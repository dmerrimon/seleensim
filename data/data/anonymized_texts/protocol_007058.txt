1.1 Background  
 
With more than 2  million abdominal operations occurring annually in the United States (US) , 
up to 20% of those patients developing ventral incisional hernias, abdominal wall defects and 
incisional hernias represent a challenging surgical condition.1, 2 Approximately 348,000 
ventral hernia repairs are p erforme d on a yearly basis .3 There are several options for repair, 
including primary repair, synthetic or biologic material placement, repair with relaxin g 
incisions, and use of musculofascial flaps, utilizing both open and laparoscopic appr oaches.2 
However, there is no clear -cut consensus regarding the optimal hernia repair technique, 
particularly in complex hernia repair cases where patient co -morbidities exist and a high risk 
of infec tion is present.    
 
Simple suture repair has been associated with a high risk of hernia recurrence, with reports 
ranging from 10% to 55%, and has been nearly abandoned for the repair of hernias which are 
greater than  five centimeters (cm) in size.4, 5, 6, 7 Use of s ynthetic mesh reduces  hernia 
recurrence rates , although its use h as been associated with complications such as infection, 
adhesions, fistulae, and foreign body reactions including increased inflammation and/ or 
connective tissue deposition.8 
 
Synthetic mesh repair procedures, either open or laparoscopic, have been reported to lead to 
fewer recurrences compared to primary repairs .9, 10, 11  Improved  outcomes are believed to be 
related to reduced tension on the fascial edges and sutures when mesh is used in hernia repair 
procedures.  However, complex cases and large abdominal wall defects continue to pose a 
challenge to surgeons.  Factors such as pati ent co -morbidities, defect size, location, tissue 
viability and degree of contamination are included in a surgeon’s assessment and decision -
making process .12  These large abdominal wall defects have been associated with recurrence 
rates of up to 46 %.13 
 
Laparosco pic ventral hernia repair was ﬁrst reported by LeBlanc in 1992, and is popular  
alternative to open repairs due to the potential benefit of  shorter hospital stays, improved 
patient outcomes, and fewer  complications compared to open repairs .14, 15  In a large series 
(850 patients)  by Heniford, et al. , laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using prosthetic mesh 
had a low rate of conversion to open surgery (3.4%),  length of hospital stay (2.3 days), a 
moderate complication rate (13.2%), and a low hernia re currence rate of 4.7% (average 
follow -up of 20 months ).15  In a study by Orenstein, et al., l aparoscopic ventral hernia rep air 
with defect closure had  a low recurrence rate  (none in 47 consecutive patients out to 16.2 
months follow -up).16  They purported t hat defect closure eliminate d postoperative seromas 
and patient reports of bulging and reduced the size of implanted mes h.16 
 
Ideally, a re sorbable mesh would provide adequate structural support throughout the healing  
process and  would be fully absorbed when the wound has completely  healed, thereby 
potentially reducing the chances for  complications associated with the persistence of non-
resorbable mesh  material.  However, t he developmen t of re sorbable mesh products has faced 
Davol Inc.  Final 5.0 
Phasix™  ST   April 16, 2018  
Protocol DVL -HE-017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 42  challenges related to the rate  of resorption  with complications arising when  the mesh product 
is resorbed too quickly.  Ra pid re sorption does not support  sufficient  healing if structural 
reinforcement  is diminished during the tissue repair period .  A resorbable mesh should retain 
its functional strength for a sufficient period of time to all ow native cellular ingrowth tissue 
remodeling, maturation of collagen, and gradual shift of mechanical load.  
 
Phasix™ Mesh is a commercially available medical device in the US . It is a resorbable mes h 
prepared from poly -4-hydroxybutrate (P4HB)  which has been studi ed for use as a biomaterial 
for a number of applications in medical devices and tissue engineering due to favorable 
mechanical properties, biocompatibility and desirable degradation times .17,18,19  Using 
standard measures of mechanical strength (suture pull -out, tear and ball burst strength) 
Phasix™ Mesh is comparable in performance to traditional polypropylene mesh.  Pre-clinical 
implantation studies indicate that the resorption of the Phasix™ Mesh fibers is minimal 
throughout the 12 week expected period of healing and up to ~26 weeks post -implantation.  
Resorption of the fibers is essentially complete in 12 -18 months . 21, 22  Given the lo ng-term 
strength retention  observed in preclinical studies, it is anticipated that Phasix ™ Mesh  may 
result in low recurrence and complication rates with minimal pain and discomfort when used 
for hernia repair.  
 
A porcine hernia repair study demonstrated that Phasix™ Mesh could perform as a durable 
scaffold for soft tissue repair.21 The results of the 52 -week study showed that the repair site 
had significantly greater mechanical repair strength, as compared to native abdominal wall. 
Notably, repair strength persisted even after significant Phasix™ Mesh resorption (as 
measured by molecula r weight).  Histologically, Phasix™ Mesh showed an initial mild -
moderate host inflammatory response , that declined to mild over 52 -weeks.  
 
Neovascularization (angiogenesis) and new collagen deposition w ere evident at 6, 12, 26 and 
52-weeks.  In a 24 -week rat study, histological analyses of the repair site demonstrated that 
other fully -resorbable competitive meshes had a greater overall host inflammatory response, 
whereas the response to Phasix™ Mesh was relative comparable to permanent polypropylene 
mesh.22 In the same study, histological analyses demonstrated similar variability on measures 
of host fibrotic response.  
 
The subject of this study, Phasix™ ST is a fully resorbable mesh with a hydrogel coating that 
is also resorbable. It is a sterile mesh devic e with indication for use in the reinforcement of 
soft tissue, where weakness exists, in procedures involving soft tissue repair, such as for the 
repair of hernias. Phasix™ ST Mesh is comprised of a co -knitted mesh and hydrogel coating.   
 
The fascial side  of the mesh allows for a prompt fibroblastic response through the interstices 
of the mesh, allowing for complete tissue ingrowth, similar to P4HB mesh alone. The 
visceral side of the mesh is coated with a resorbable, chemically modified sodium 
hyaluronate  (HA), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) based 
hydrogel. The resorbable hydrogel coating functions to separate the mesh from underlying 
tissues and organ surfaces to help minimize tissue attachment to the mesh. Shortly after 
hydra tion in saline, the biopolymer coating becomes a hydrated gel that is resorbed from the 
site in less than 30 -days.   See Section 1.3 Device Description, for more information.

A laparoscopic, porcine study was conducted to evaluate peritoneal tissue attachm ent 
development 4 weeks after implantation of Phasix™ ST Mesh or Ventralight  ™ ST Mesh 
(each group used 4 pigs; 8 meshes).  At 4 weeks post -implantation, there were very few 
instances of light, omental tissue attachments in both groups.  The overall tissue  attachment 
scores associated with Phasix™ ST Mesh was not significantly different than for 
Ventralight™ ST Mesh.   These results indicate that the hydrogel barrier (Sepra® 
Technology) properties associated with Ventralight™ ST Mesh are maintained with 
Phasix™ ST Mesh.22 
 
Additional porcine studies were conducted to characterize the strength of a buttress repair 
over time.  Twenty -four, female, Yucatan pigs were implanted bilaterally with mesh 
according to one of the following: a) underlay repair with Phasi x™ ST Mesh; b) underlay 
repair with Ventralight™ ST Mesh; c) a retromuscular repair with Phasix™ Mesh or d) a 
retromuscular repair with Strattice™ Firm Reconstructive Matrix.  Bilateral surgical defects 
(1” diameter) were created and subsequently repaired with PDS suture.  Mesh devices were 
placed and fixated with absorbable tacks or sutures.  Ball burst strength and host responses 
were measured at mesh placement and 12 - or 24 -weeks post -implantation.22   
 
At 12 - or 24 -weeks, the burst strength of the Phasi x™ ST Mesh repair was at, or slightly 
above, the burst strength at the time of mesh placement (despite the hydrolysis of the 
Phasix™ material over these time periods).   This suggests a transfer of load from the 
degrading Phasix™ material to the newly ingr own host tissue.  The Strattice™ Firm 
Reconstructive Matrix repairs showed a significant reduction in strength of the repair site at 
12- or 24 -weeks and they had significantly lower burst strength relative to Phasix™ and 
Phasix™ ST Mesh devices.  At 12 - or 24-weeks, histology demonstrated that a robust and 
biocompatible ingrowth is associated with the Phasix™ material.  Neovascularization occurs 
more rapidly in the Phasix™ material relative to the Strattice™ Firm Reconstructive 
Matrix.22   
 
This post-approv al clinical study is  being conducted to evaluate the use of  Phasix™ ST Mesh  
in laparoscopic  ventral  or incisional hernia repair in  patients with a higher level of risk for 
Surgical Site Occurrence (SSO) as defined by the presence of 1 or more comorbid  
conditions .  Patient s who receive  a Phasix™ ST implant will be followed for 24 -months.  
 
1.2 Rationale  
 
This study is intended to evaluate the use of Phasix™ ST for laparoscopic  ventral  or 
incisional hernia repair amongst subjects at high risk for SSO.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 42  Phasix™ ST is a fully resorbable mesh with a hydrogel coating that is also resorbable.   It is a 
sterile mesh device with indication for use in the reinforcement of soft tissue, where 
weakness exists, in procedures involving soft tissue repair, such as for the repair of hernias. 
Phasix™ ST Mesh is comprised of a co -knitted mesh and hydrogel c oating.   
 
Preclinical implantation studies indicate that resorption of the P4HB fibers is minimal 
throughout the 12 week expected healing perio d, and remains minimal up to 26 -weeks post 
implantation.  Significant degradation of the mesh fibers observed in  preclinical studies 
within 12 - to 18 -months indicates loss in mechanical integrity and strength of the mesh. 
While fib er segments were observed at 18 -months, they continued to degrade.20, 21  
 
The fascial side of the mesh allows for a prompt fibroblastic response through the interstices 
of the mesh, allowing for complete tissue ingrowth, similar to P4HB mesh alone.  The 
visceral side of the mesh is coated with a resorbable, chemically modified sodium 
hyaluronate (HA), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and poly ethylene glycol (PEG) based 
hydrogel.  The resorbable hydrogel coating functions to separate the mesh from underlying 
tissues and organ surfaces to help minimize tissue attachment to the mesh.  Shortly after 
hydration in saline, the biopolymer coating beco mes a hydrated gel that is resorbed from the 
site in less than 30 -days.  
 
Phasix™ ST Mesh and Phasix™ Mesh are similar in material; with both containing P4HB, the 
largest percentage of material present in Phasix™ ST Mesh.  The difference between the 
meshes is that Phasix™ Mesh does not have polyglycolic acid  (PGA ) fibers or a hydrogel 
coating.  
 
Phasix™ ST Mesh was designed to handle similarly to polypropylene (permanent) mesh at 
implantation, but it is fully resorbable.  It is expected to maintain its stren gth over the critical 
healing period; minimize tissue attachment to the mesh, and resorbs, leaving no foreign 
material behind.  
 
Phasix™ ST  is commercially available  in the US and indicated for use in the reinforcement 
of soft tissue, where weakness exists,  in procedures involving soft tissue repair, such as for 
the repair of hernias.   Because Phasix™ ST Mesh is fully resorbable, it should not be used  in 
repairs where permanent wound or organ support from the mesh is required.   A full 
description of Phasix™ ST is included in the product’s Ins tructions for Use (IFU) .

6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Subject Screening a nd Baseline Evaluation  
 
Subjects with a diagnosis of  ventral or abdominal incisional  hernia receiving laparoscopic  
surgical repair (including robotic -assisted repairs) with  defect closure,  will be screened for 
potential eligibility against the study protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria , utilizing 
ordinary standard of care procedures ( e.g., physical examination, blood work, medical 
evaluation ) withi n 60 days of the date of consent.  Since t he sa fety and effectiveness of 
Phasix ™ ST Mesh in bridging repairs has not been evaluated or established, the defect 
should be closed prior to mesh use.   This may include a full anesthetic work -up customary 
for hernia repair procedures.  Any other standard of care exa mination or evaluation within 60  
days of the date of consent may be considered baseline for study purposes.  Prior medical 
records documenting these tests, examinations and evaluations may be used as  the source 
documents for the baseline visit.  
 
During the screening and recruitment process, the Inves tigator  will be responsible for 
describing the nature of the clinical study, verifying that the eligibility criteria have been met, 
and obtaining informed  consent.  Written informed consent and a Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver must be obtained prior to performance of 
any protocol specific procedures.  
 
The following s creening/baseline  procedures w ill be conducted and docum ented .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 42  6.1.1 Informed Consent  
 
The investigator will explain the study to the subject, answer all of the subject’s questions, 
and obtain written informed consent in a language in which the subject is fluent before the 
collection of any study data or performance  of any study procedures.  
 
The subject  must be willing and able to sign and date the informed consent form (ICF) prior 
to the collection of study data or performance of any study procedures.   The original , signed  
informed consent will be retained wi th the  subjects’ records and a copy provided to the 
subject.  
 
6.1.2 Enrollment  
 
Subjects who sign an informed consent will be considered enrolled in this study.  Subjects 
who provide consent for participation but do not meet all of the study eligibility criteria and 
do not receive the study  device  will be considered screen failures.  
 
6.1.3 Eligibility  
 
The subject’s eligibility for study enrollment will be reviewed and documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  At the time of screening, a related progress note must be entered in the 
source document ation to indicate that all eligibility criteria were reviewed and screening 
results noted.  Final eligibility will be determined intraoperatively.  
 
Subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria should be considered screen fai lures and treated 
according to the Investigator’s standard of care.   Data are to be collected for screen failure  
subjects from the time the ICF is signed until the subject is deemed a failure .  At a minimum, 
subject demographics an d the reason for failure must be collected .  Adverse events (AEs) 
that occur prior to the surgical procedure will be added to the medical history.  Any adverse 
event that occurs from the beginning of the surgical procedure until the subject is determined 
as screen failure will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
 
6.1.4 Evaluation of Pregnancy Status  
 
The pregnancy status of potential study subjects will be evaluated as part of the 
screening assessment as follows:  
 
Women of child bearing potential  (WOCBP) must undergo a pregnancy test (urine or 
blood).  A  negative pregnancy test (urine or b lood) must be obtained within 7 days of 
the surgical procedure.   
 
Women who are postmenopausal or not of child bearing potential (e.g. status post 
hysterectomy o r tubal ligation , no menses in the past 12 months ): status must be 
recorded to note that the subject is not of child bearing potential.

Subject numbers will be assigned in sequential order , consist ing of six digits w here the first 
three digits designate the study site and the last three digits designate the subject number (i.e., 
subject number 101 001 will be the first subject at site 1; 101 002 will be the second subject 
at site 1, etc.).  
 
6.1.6 Blinding  
 
The study is a n open-label study with a single treatment condition.  Subjects , investigator  
(and surgeon)  will not be blinded to the study treatment .  
 
6.1.7 Demographics a nd Medical History  
 
The subject's medical history and demographic information will be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Demographic information will include gender, date of birth, race and 
ethnicity.   
 
6.1.8 Physical Examination  
 
A standard physical exam, appropriate to subjects about to undergo abdominal surgery, will 
be performed by the physician.  Height and weight measurements will be recorded to allow 
for the calculation of BMI .  The subject’s ability to participate and meet the follow -up 
requirements will be established.  
 
6.1.9 Concomitant Pain Medication Usage  
 
All pain medication taken within 24 hours of each study visit will be recorded in the source 
documentation at baseline  and at each follow -up visit .  A designation of narcotic and non -
narcotic pain mediation will be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
6.1.10  Patient Reported Outcome Assessments  
 
Subjects will complete the  Surgical Pain Scale -VAS , Carolinas Comfort Scale® and SF -12® 
to measure pain, discomfort and quality of life.   
 
6.2 Surgical Procedure  
 
6.2.1 General  Procedure s 
 
All subjects will undergo laparoscopic  ventral hernia repair .  Subjects will be administered  
pre-operative antibiotics according to hospital protocol .  There is an intraoperative exclusion 
for h ernia s >350 cm2.  All other intraoperative exclusion criter ion should be verified  (e.g., a 
Davol Inc.  Final 5.0

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 42  surgical wound classified as clean -contaminated, contaminated or dirty; absence of a n active 
or latent systemic  infection ; presence of peritonitis;  a hernia bridge as the sole repair  
procedure ) as final eligibility is determined intraoperatively .   
 
The surgical technique will require intraabdominal (using absorbable sutures or tacks)  mesh  
placement (with or without C ST).  Ensure proper orientation  (see IFU for details) ; the coated 
side of the p rosthesis should be oriented against the bowel or sensitive organs.  Do not place 
the uncoated mesh side against the bowel.  There is a risk for adhe sion formation or erosions 
when the uncoated mesh side is placed in direct contact with the bowel or viscera.  
 
The Phasix ™ ST Mesh can be tailored without fraying or unraveling and offers bi -directional 
elasticity to adapt to various stresses encountered in the body.  Use a sharp surgical 
instrument (scissors) to trim the mesh.  To minimize chance of recurrence, trim the mesh 
such that it is large enough to prov ide sufﬁ cient overlap beyond the margins of the defect.   If 
the material is cut too small, tensi on may be placed on the suture line, which may result in a 
recurrence of the original defect. The mesh is to be positioned so  its edges extend beyond the 
margins of the defect  by at least 5 cm .  It is recommended that fixation be placed at 
approximately every 1 to 2 cm intervals .  The edges are then fixated to assure proper closure 
under correct tension.   
 
If a prior hernia repair u tilizing mesh is in the same  area to be treated for the study, complete 
removal of existing mesh is required for the subject to  remain eligible for the study.  Subjects 
with intact permanent mesh adjacent to the study hernia to be repaired are excluded from the 
study .  Once all of the dissection is performed and all of the hernia has been exposed, the 
largest vertical and transver se dimensions should be recorded.  
 
The procedure may include C ST to obtain site closure .  All skin incisions will be closed with 
staples and/or sutures  and wounds will be dressed with sterile occ lusive dressings.  
 
6.2.2 Postoperative Care  
 
If for any reason the  mesh is removed and a mesh infection is suspected,  routine culture, at 
the site of the wound, area of contamination, or poten tial contamination, obtained according 
to the instructions in Appendix 4 to determine cell count and type (i.e., yeast, gram posit ive 
or gram negative bacteria, or other).  If genus and species of the culture are identified as part 
of the routine practice at the site, that information should be recorded.   
 
6.2.3 Surgical Details  
 
Surgical details will be recorded and entered in the approp riate source documentation and 
eCRF(s).  Details will include but may not be limited to procedure date, start/stop times, 
concomitant procedures, procedure relate d complications  and AEs.

Subjects will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, 
without affe cting their future care.   
 
Additionally, s ubjects may be discontinued for reasons including, but not limited to t he 
following:  
 Consent is withdrawn  
 Lost to follow -up (LTF U) 
 Investigator withdrawal of subject  
 Other  
 
A subject is considered LTF U if the investigational site personnel are unable to locate the 
subject despite two documented attempts to notify the subject via telephone and a third 
attempt by certified mail.  
 
A subject is considered an Early Termination  (ET) , if discontinuation occurs after success ful 
implant of the study  device.  The site should attempt to bring the subject back to complete all 
ET visit study procedures  (see Table of Study Events ).   
 
A subject who receives a re -operation du e to hernia recurrence or has the repair site 
surgically impacted in any way, ma y be withdrawn from the study u pon discharge from the 
most recent hospitalization .  Site personnel will be responsible for documenting adverse 
events and other post -procedural complications  on the applicable eCRF that the subject may 
have encountered during the hospitalization and up to 30 days p ost re-operation.  
 
Once a subject discontinues from the study, t he Investigator must complete a Study 
Completion eCRF  and the reason fo r subject discontinuation must be fully documented.  
 
7 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
This section describes the planned statistical analyses for this study.   A detailed Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be completed and placed on file prior to database lock.  The SAP 
will contain a comprehensive explanation of the methodology used in the statistical analyses 
described below.  
 
7.1 Study Hypothesis  
 
There is no formal statistical hypothes is for this observational post -market study .  The study 
will follow eligible, high risk patients implanted with the Phasix™ ST for hernia repair in 
order to assess SSO.

Protocol DVL -HE-017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 42  7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
 
This study is projected to treat approximately  120 subjects at approximately 16 sites.  The 
sample size of 120 subjects is based on potential adequacy of data to meet the study 
objectives.  It is not based on any statistical consideration.  
   
7.3 Data Analysis  
 
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) population consists of all enrolled subjects who have sign ed the 
Informed Consent Form . The modified ITT (mITT) population is defined as those subjects in 
the ITT population in whom Phasix Mesh has been implanted .  A Per -Protocol (PP) 
population may be created if there are subjects who have any major protocol dev iations.  The 
PP population will consist of any subjects in the mITT population who do not have any major 
protocol deviation.   The protocol deviations that are considered to have a “major” grade will 
be defined a priori in the analysis plan.   All analyses will be primarily based on the mITT 
population.   Primary analyses may be performed for PP population as well.  
 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the ITT population.  
Summary statistics for categorical variable s will include frequency counts and percentages 
and for continuous variables mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum.  
 
The primary endpoint of SSO within 45 days post -implantation  will be reported by visit 
along with the 95% confidence interv als based on the mITT population.  The calculation of 
rates at each time point will be based on available data at the time point.  Missing data will 
not be imputed.  Additionally, a K aplan -Meier survival analysis will be performed.   
 
The secondary endpoint s of SSO > 45 days post -implantation, hernia recurrence rate, pain – 
VAS, device related adverse event incidence, rate of reoperation due to the index hernia 
repair, Quality of life assessments ( Surgical Pain Scale -VAS, Carolina s Comfort Scale® and 
SF-12®), surgical procedure time as measured from inc ision to closure (skin to skin) and 
length of stay  will be summarized based on the mITT population with mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, median and maximum presented by visit.  Other secondary endpoints 
will be summarized as appropriate.  
 
Subjects who do n ot have Phasix™ ST implanted  will have their AEs summarized separately 
and their outcome data will not be collected or analyzed.  
 
Exploratory analyses on subpopulations may be performed.   Interim analyses m ay be 
conducted during the study for data review purpose.  
 
 
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The Investigator is responsi ble for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol.  All AEs that occur

Protocol DVL -HE-017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 42  during the study should be treated with established standards of care that will protect the life 
and health of the study subjects.   
AEs will be collected from t he time  of enrollment (AE onset after signing ICF) through the 
end of study participation (either study completion or early discontinuation) and will be 
documented in the medical record or source document and on study eCRFs .  All e vents  will 
be followed to satisfactory resolution or stabilization.   AEs that occur prior to the surg ical 
procedure will be added to the medical history.  AEs that occur from the time of surgical 
procedure will be recorded in the source documentation and on the AE page of the eCRF  
 
8.1 Definition o f Adverse Events  
 
In this study, an AE is defined as any unde sirable clinical event occurring in the abdominal  
space including the lower abdominal, inguinal and pubic regions (including the skin), as well 
as any other undesirable clinical events judged to be related to the study device or surgical 
procedure regardle ss of anatomical region.  Abnormal laboratory results are not to be 
considered AEs unless the results are accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms.   The 
Investigator will assess  the relationship of an AE to the study device or procedure as 
described in Se ction 8. 5. 
 
8.2 Definition o f Serious Adverse Events   
 
An event will be classified as a serious adverse event (SAE)  if it meets the definition of 
serious injury in the Medical Device Reporting Regulation [21 CFR 803.3] as listed below:  
 
 results in, or contributes to, a death or serious injury;  
 is life -threatening (i.e., the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event);  
 requires in subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
 results in persistent disability or incapacit y (i.e., permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure);  
 necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above in this definition (i.e., to preclude permanent impairment of a body funct ion or 
permanent damage to a body structure)  
 
NOTE:  The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to describe 
the intensity of an eve nt experienced by the subject.  
 
8.3 Relationship of Adverse Event t o Device/Procedure  
 
Assess each AE fo r its relationship to the device (Phasix™ ST) or surgical procedures as 
follows:

Phasix™  ST   April 16, 2018  
Protocol DVL -HE-017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 42   
 Device:  This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable to devices used 
as part of the study procedure.  
 
 Procedure:  This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable to the study 
device surgical procedure.  
 
Use the following categories for assigning the certainty of the relatedness:  
 
 Definitely Related:  An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certai n or there is little 
doubt regarding the relationship.  
 
 Possibly Related:  An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being related but 
relatively unlikely.  
 
 Not Related : An AE is not related if it is determined that there is no plausible 
association.  
 
8.4 Severity o f Adverse Events  
 
Each AE should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event, experienced by the 
subject.  
 
 Mild : Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s 
activity or is transient and is resolved with out treatment or sequelae.  
 
 Moderate : May interfere with the subject’s activity and require additional intervention 
and/or treatment, and may have additional sequelae.  
 
 Severe : Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s 
activit y.  Additional intervention and/ or treatment are necessary.  Additional sequelae 
occur.  Severe is used to describe the intensity of an event experienced by the subject.  
 
8.5 Reporting Of Adverse Events  
 
If an AE occurs, all sections of the appropriate eCRF must be completed.  
 
All Investig ator-judged device -related AEs that occur (whether serious or not) must be 
reported to Davol Inc. Field Assurance using the contact information provided in Section 9, 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
 
Additionally, all SAEs (whether device - or procedure -related or not)  must be reported to the 
Davol Study Team  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 42  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of 
AEs according to IRB requirements .  The Sponsor will report to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as appropriate after becoming aware of a reportable event.  
 
9 MECHANICAL FAILURES,  MALFUNCTIONS AND DEF ECTS  
 
The Investigator will record if a Sponsor device u sed in the study procedure failed to meet 
its performance specifications whether due to mechanical failure, malfunction or 
defects.   This applies to: devices used in the subject, devices in which the package was 
opened but the device was not used for impla ntation in the subject, or devices with which 
implantation was attempted, but the device did not remain (was not used) in the subject.  
 
A recurrence (unless it is in a different location than the study hernia) is considered a 
device failure if the recurrence is considered to be possibly device related, and not 
procedure related or an issue of patient mismanagement (e.g., mesh used was too small to 
adequately cover the defect, too much tension, etc.), as determined by the Investigator.  
 
All mechanical failures, malfunctions, missing components, or any other defect of the study 
device  or any components of the device kit that do not per form to specifications must be 
promptly reported to Davol:  
 
Field Assurance Department  
E-mail: Davol.FieldAssurance@crbard.com  
 
The event must also be docum ented on the Device Failure eCRF  and the malfunctioning 
device should be retained for return and evaluation to Davol Field Assurance.

Investigator or by his/her documented designee.  
 
The Investigator is also responsible for making source documents and forms readily available 
for a thorough revi ew by the study monitor at each monitoring visit.  The monitor will ensure 
the accuracy  of data recording at each investigational site by comparison to supporting 
source documents during periodic site visits.  Adherence to proper recording of information 
as well as assuring that corrections are being made will also be addressed during these 
periodic visits.  
 
12.7 Subject Compensation  
 
To compensate subjects for their time and participation, they may receive stipends upon 
completion of each of the protocol specified study visits.  If the subject does not complete a 
visit, they will not be compensated for that visit.   
 
12.8 Com munications w ith the Sponsor  
 
Although the Investigator and his/her staff may have contact with other key individuals at the 
Sponsor throu ghout the course of the study, all communications regarding conduct of the 
study must be channeled through the Sponsor’s clinical affairs personnel or their designees.

13 SITE MON ITORING  
 
The study monitors are designated as agents of the Sponsor and are assigned to oversee the 
conduct and progress of the study and to be the principal communication link between the 
Sponsor and the Investigator.  
 
The study monitors will be involved in Investigator selection and training, assurance of IRB 
approvals, and periodic on -site inspection and monitoring of sites and records, to ensure 
continued compliance with the protocol and adequacy of the Investigator and the facility to 
carry out the stu dy.  In addition, the monitor will verify that the device is being used in 
accordance with the protocol instructions.  
 
The site may also be subject to a quality assurance audit by personnel of the Sponsor  as well 
as by FDA representatives.  
 
The monitor wil l perform several types of site visits during the course of the study.   In all 
cases, the study monitor will provide a written summary of the visit, including necessary 
follow -up items, to the Investigator and Sponsor.  
 
It is important that the Investigato r(s) and the relevant site personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits, and possible audit, and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
 
13.1 Study Initiation Visit  
 
Before the study begins, the study monitor will visit the site.  The purpose of this visit is to 
review with the Investigator and staff the provisions and proper conduct of the clinical 
evaluation.  This includes a detailed review of the protocol and eCRFs with instructions as to 
their completion, as well as reviewing r egulations pertaining to the conduct of the clinical 
study.   Arrangement for timely and accurate reporting of clinical data and relevant medical 
events will be established as well as ensuring safe and secure storage for the study devices.  
 
The study monito r will:  
 
 Confirm that the ICF to be used is the one approved by the IRB;  
 Verify that all necessary documents are on file at the site ; and  
 Confirm that there are provisions to continue and maintain all documents and records

The study monitor wil l maintain personal contact with the Investigator and staff throughou t 
the study by telephone, e -mail, fax, mail, and on -site visits.   On-site monitoring will begin 
after the first subjects are enrolled and continue  until the study is completed.  The monitoring 
will assure continued protocol compliance, adequate subject enr ollment, accurate data 
reporting (i ncluding the comparison of eCRFs  with subject records), device accountability (if 
required), and continued IRB acceptance of the study.  The study monitor will e valuate and 
summarize the result s of each v isit in written reports, identifying any ongoing data problems 
with any study site and specifying recommendations for resolution of noted deficiencies.   A 
formal monitoring plan will describe the planned extent of source data verification.  
 
13.3 Final Monitoring Visit  
 
At the  completion of the study, the study monitor will conduct a final on -site visit.  The 
purpose of this visit is to collect all outstanding study data documents, confirm that the 
Investigator’s files are accurate and complete, review the record retention  requirements with 
the Investigator , provide the return of unused devices (if required) to the sponsor, review 
records which account for device shipment (if required), and assure that all applicable 
requirements for closure of the study are met.   The actions and observations made at this visit 
will be recorded and filed.

Appendix 2: Surgical Site Infection Classification24  
 
Superficial Incisional Surgical Site Infections (SSI)  
Infection occurs within 30 days after the oper ative procedure (where day 1 = procedure 
day) 
AND  
involves only the sk in or subcutaneous tissue of  the incision  
AND   
at least one of the following:  
A. Purulent drainage from the superficial incision  or subcutaneous tissue . 
B. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the 
superficial incision.  
C. Superficial incision that is deliberately opened by a surgeon, attending physician or 
other designee and is culture positive or not cultured  
AND  
Patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: pain or tenderness; 
localized swelling; erythema; or heat. A culture negative finding does n ot meet this 
criterion.  
D. Diagnosis of a superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician or 
other designee.  
 
COMMENT: There are two specific types of superficial incisional SSIs:  
1. Superficial Incisional Primary (SIP) –a superficial incisional  SSI that is identified in the 
primary incision in a patient that has had an operation with one or more incisions (e.g., 
C -section incision or chest incision for CBGB)  
2. Superficial Incisional Secondary (SIS) – a superficial incisional SSI that is identifie d in 
the secondary incision in a patient that has had an operation wit h more than one 
incision (e.g., donor site incision for CBGB)  
 
The following do not qualify as criteria for meeting the definition of superficial SSI:  
 Diagnosis/treatment of cellulitis  (redness/warmth/swelling), by itself, does not meet  
criterion d  for superficial incisional SSI.   An incision that is draining or culture (+) is 
not considered a cellulitis.  
 A stitch absces s alone  (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of  
suture penetration) . 
 
Deep Incisional SSI  
Infection occurs within 90 days after the operative procedure (for h erniorrhaphy )(where 
day 1 = procedure day)   
AND  
involves deep soft tissues of the incision (e.g., fascia and muscle layers)  
AND  
patient has  at least one of the following:  
a. Purulent drainage from th e deep incision . 
Davol Inc.  Final 5.0

Protocol DVL -HE-017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 42  b. A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened or aspirated by a 
surgeon , attending physician  or other designee  and is culture  positive or not 
cultured  
AND  
patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms:  fever (>38°C), 
localized pain or tendernes s.  A culture  negative finding does not meet this 
criterion.  
c. An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision that is 
detected on gross ana tomical or histopathologic exam, or imaging test . 
 
COMMENTS: There are two specific types of deep incisional SSIs:  
 
1.  Deep Incisional Primary (DIP) –a deep incisional SSI that is identified in a primary 
incision in a patient that has had an operation wit h one or more incisions (e.g., C -
section incision or chest incision for CBGB)  
2.  Deep Incisional Secondary (DIS) – a deep incisional SSI that is identified in the 
secondary incision in a patient that has had an operation with more than one incision 
(e.g.,  donor site incision for CBGB)  
 
Organ/Space SSI  
Must meet the following criteria:  
Infection occurs within 90 days after the operative procedure (for h erniorrhaphy )(where 
day 1 = procedure day)   
AND  
infection involves any part of the body  deeper than the f ascial/muscle  layers,  that is opened 
or manipulated during the operative procedure  
AND  
patient has at least one of the following:  
a.   purulent drainage from a drain that is placed into the organ/space  (e.g., closed 
suction  drainage system, open drain, T -tube drain, CT guided drainage)  
b.  organisms isolated from an aseptically -obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the 
organ/space  
c.   an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is 
detected  on gross anatomical or  histopathologic exam,  or imaging test  
AND  
meets at least one of the organ/space infection site “intraabdominal” criteria:  
1. Patient has organisms cultured from abscess and/or purulent material from 
intraabdominal space.  
2. Patient has abscess or other evidence of intraabdominal infection on  gross anatomic 
or 
histopathologic exam.  
3. Patient has at least two  of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38.0°C±), 
nausea*,   vomiting*, abdominal pain*, or jaundice*  
And at least one of the following:  
a. organisms seen on culture or Gram stain of drainage or tissue obtained during 
invasive procedure or from an aseptically -placed drain (e.g., closed suction 
drainage system, open drain, T -tube drain, CT guided drainage)

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 42  Appendix 3: Surgical Wound Classification23 
 Class I/Clean: An uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is 
encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected  urinary tract is not 
entered. In addition, clean wounds are primarily c losed and, if necessary, drained with 
closed drainage. Operative  incisional wounds that follow nonpenetrating (blunt) 
trauma should be included in this category if they meet the criteria.  
 
 Class II/Clean -Contaminated *: An operative wound in which the respi ratory, 
alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts are entered under controlled  conditions and 
without unusual contamination. Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract, 
appendix, vagina, and oropharynx are  included in this category, provided no evid ence 
of infection or major break in technique is encountered.  
 
 Class III/ Contaminated*: Open, fresh, accidental wounds. In addition, operations with 
major breaks in sterile technique (e.g., open cardiac massage) or gross spillage from 
the gastrointestinal tract, and incisions in which acute, nonpurulent inflammation is 
encounte red including necrotic tissue without evidence of purulent drainage (e.g. , 
dry gangrene) are included in this category.  
 
 Class IV/Dirty -Infected *: Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and 
those that involve existing clinical infection or p erforated  viscera. This definition 
suggests that the organisms causing postoperative infection were present in the 
operative field before the operation.  
 
* NOTE: In this study, subjects with Class II, Class I II and Class IV  wounds  are to be 
excluded from e nrollment .

BASIC GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTION  
 
1. Collect the material from the site in which the etiologic agent will most likely be found.  
 
2. Obtain cultures prior to administration of antibiotics whenever possible.  
 
3. Collect adequ ate volume of material.  Inadequate amounts of specimen may yield false 
negative results.  
 
4. Collect specimen in a manner that minimizes or eliminates contamination from 
indigenous flora as possible to ensure that the sample will be representative of the 
infected site.  
 
5. Use appropriate collection devices, transport media, and sterile, leak proof containers.  
 
6. Use sterile equipment and aseptic technique to collect specimen to prevent introduction 
of microorganisms during invasive procedures.  
 
7. Clearly label the specimen including specific information regarding site of collection 
(e.g., blood obtained via blue lumen of right subclavian  central catheter) and complete 
the ordering process.  
 
8. Identify the specimen source and/or specific site correctl y so that proper processing 
methods and culture media will be selected by the laboratory personnel.  
 
9. Deliver the specimen promptly to the laboratory.  Delay in transport may compromise 
the specimen.  
 
SUBCUTANEOUS AND SKIN SPECIMEN:  
 
A. Superficial Wound (bacterial)  
1. Syringe aspiration  is preferable to swab collection.

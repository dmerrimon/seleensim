25 June 2021  8 of 47 V1.0 2 Introduction  
2.1 Study Rationale  
Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as atomoxetine  are thought to 
improve obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by increasing pharyngeal muscle stiffness and 
responsiveness  (1-4).  
Cannabinoids , such as dronabinol , have shown potential for reduction of OSA severity  (21). The 
mechanism of beneficial action of dronabinol appears to be distinct from that of SNRIs, 
potentially involving stabilization of respiratory patterns and increased activation of upper 
airway dilating muscles during sleep.  
The SEED s tudy is designed to a ssess  the safety and efficacy for OSA of 3 escalating dose 
combinations of atomoxetine and dronabinol.  
2.2 Background  
2.2.1 Obstructive Sleep  Apnea  
The National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research identified sleep disorders as  a major 
public health burden. OSA is  the most common  and serious of these sleep disorders and affects 
approximately 20 million people in the  United States ( US), with approximately 13% of men and 
6% of women affected  (5). OSA is characterized  by repetitive collapse or ‘obstruction’ of the 
pharyngeal airway during sleep, manifesting  as repetitive episodes of hypopnea (i.e., shallow 
breathing)  or apnea (i.e., paused  breathing).  These episodes of hypopnea or apnea may lead to 
arousal from sleep,  sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, and/or 
neuropsychological  impairment.  
Research has shown that a number of pathogenic factors, or trai ts, contribute to  the development 
of OSA  (6-9). The most important factors are the presence of  an anatomically small, collapsible 
upper airway and a loss of pharyngeal muscle tone  or responsiveness during  sleep.  
Long -term, OSA is associated with increased mortality and a num ber of  adverse cardiovascular , 
neurocognitive, metabolic, and daytime functioning consequences  (10-19). 
2.2.2 Unmet Medical  Need  
Treatment for OSA changed little over the past 40 years, with the overwhelming  majority of 
patients treated with positive airway pressure, the most common of which  is continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP), provided by a machine that  mechanically maintains an open airway. 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  9 of 47 V1.0 Other treatments, such as pharyngeal surgery,  mandibular advancement devices, and implantable 
nerve stimulators, were developed to address  the anatomical predisposition to collapse; however, 
they have shown limited ef ficacy  for niche  populations.  
While CPAP and related therapies are effective in improving sleep characteristics  and 
oxygenation, many, perhaps most, patients find these devices uncomfortable or intolerable, and 
most estimates indicate that fewer than 50% of patients prescribed  CPAP  use it more than 4 hours 
per night, if at all (20). Efforts to develop  pharmacologic therapies, such as antidepressants, 
stimulants, and hormonal agents, for t he treatment  of OSA have been ongoing for at least 20 
years, with no success thus  far. 
As many patients cannot use CPAP because they find it intolerable, this represents  a significant 
health concern, as OSA is associated with numerous co -morbidities  and in creased mortality. 
Alternative options, such as drugs that activate the  pharyngeal muscles , are needed.  
2.2.3 Biological  Rationale  
Atomoxetine is a pre -synaptic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  in children and adults. Dronabinol is synthetic delta -
9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta -9-THC) indicated for the treatment o f anorexia in patients with 
AIDS and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Apnimed believes that the 
combination of dronabinol and atomoxetine  may have an improved efficacy profile in  patients 
with OSA  compared to either constituent alone.

4.1 Overall  Design  
The SEED s tudy is  an open -label, 4 consecutive period dose -escalation study of combinations of 
atomoxetine and dronabinol in pa rticipants  with moderate to severe OSA. Participants will 
undergo initial pre -screening to determine potential stu dy eligibility. Pa rticipants  selected for 
further screening should either have a previous history of OSA of a severity consistent with 
enrollment criteria or be at high risk (e.g. as assessed by STOP -Bang Questionnaire score).  Only 
participant s who meet a ll non -PSG enrollment criteria at Visit 1 are eligible for a screening PSG.  
On a case by case basis and with agreement of the Sponsor a PSG conducted at the site within 3 
months may be used instead of the Screening PSG . 
Participants who meet all enrollment criteria will receive an escalating dose of atomoxetine the 
first week: 3 days of atomoxetine 40 mg followed by 4 days of atomoxetine 80 mg. Pa rticipant s 
will then receive escalating dose combinations  of atomoxetine and dronabinol f or the next 3 
weeks . The w eekly dose schedule is as follows:  
• Week 1: atomoxetine 40 mg x 3 days, then 80 mg x 4 days 
• Week 2: atomoxetine 40 mg/dronabinol 2.5 mg  
• Week 3: atomoxetine 80 mg/dronabinol 5 mg  
• Week 4: atomoxetine 80 mg/dronabinol 10 mg  
 
Dose esca lation will be based on safety and tolerability, as assessed at weekly clinic visits  and by 
telephone contact with participants mid -week of each at -home dosing period . Patients who do 
not tolerate dose escalation will discontinue dosing .  
Three on -drug PSG s will be conducted on the final night of the following dosing periods:  
• 1st week, dosing atomoxetine 80 mg alone  
• 3rd week, dosing atomoxetine 80 mg/dronabinol 5 mg  
• 4th week, dosing atomoxetine 80 mg/dronabinol 10 mg  
 
Study drug for Week 1 is dispensed to participant s at Visit 2 .. Any unused Week 1 study drug is 
returned at Visit 3. Similarly, study drug for Week 2 , 3, and 4  is dispensed at Visit s 3, 4 and 5, 
and unused study drug similarly returned  at the subsequent visit .  
Dosing of the study treatment will occur each night at the pa rticipant ’s usual bedtime , both 
during at -home nights and Visit 3, Visit 5 and Visit 6  PSG night s. Study drug dose on PSG nights

An End -of-Study phone call will take place 2 weeks following the end of study drug dosing.  
Participants who discont inue from the study will not be replaced . No subsequent open -label 
extension is planned following the study.

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  and Dose  
Selective norepin ephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as atomoxetine are thought to 
improve obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by increasing pharyngeal muscle stiffness and 
responsiveness.   
Cannabinoids , including  dronabinol , also have shown potential for reduction of OSA s everity  
(21). The mechanism of beneficial action of dronabinol appears to be distinct from that of 
SNRIs, potentially involving stabilization of respiratory patterns and increased activation of 
upper airway dilating muscles during sleep. Cannabinoids have also shown a hypnotic effect that 
may counteract the potential wakefulness  induced by atomoxetine.

and a review of physical systems (dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, 
thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, extremities, 
musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric systems). Height and weigh t will also be 
measured and recorded (with  shoes removed and wear ing light indoor clothing ).     
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.  
7.2.2 Vital Signs  
• Assessment of vital signs (seated blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, respiratory 
rate) will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA.  
• Vital signs will be measured at all visits in a seated position after 5  minutes rest and will 
include temperature, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse. 
Measurements should be made in the same arm of the participant at each vi sit. 
• Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be repeated for a total of 3 measurements, each at 
least 2  minutes apart.  
7.2.3 Electrocardiograms  
• A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the 
heart rate and measures the PR, QRS, and QT intervals . The ECG will be recorded in the 
semi -supine position after the participant has rested in this position for at least 10  minutes.  
7.2.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
• Refer to Section  9.2 for the list of screening clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to 
the SoA for the timing and frequency.

Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  25 of 47 V1.0 • If laboratory values from laboratory assessments not specified in the protocol and perfor med 
at the institution’s local laboratory result in the need for a change in participant management 
or are considered clinically relevant by the Investigator ( e.g., are considered to be an SAE or 
an AE or require dose modification), then the results must b e recorded in the eCRF.  
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Appendix  3.Adverse event s will be reported by 
the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally 
authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of  an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment  or the study, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the study and/or study treatment . 
7.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from first dose of study drug until the end of the study at the 
timepoints specified in the SoA.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the S ponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix  3. The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of it being available.  
Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y 
related to the study treatment  or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the 
Sponsor . 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are prov ided in Appendix  3. 
7.3.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of  the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE  
occurrence.

Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  26 of 47 V1.0 7.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs  will be followed  until resolution, stabilization, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. Further information on 
follow -up procedures is given in Appendix  3. 
7.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE s 
• Prompt notification (within 24 hours, see Appendix  3) by the Investigator to the Sponsor of 
an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of 
participants and the safety of a study treatment  under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment  under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements rel ating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and 
Investigators.  
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory require ments and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (e .g., summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along wi th the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according 
to local requirements.  
7.3.5 Pregnancy  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants after the start of study treatment and until at 
least 5 terminal half -lives after the la st dose  will be collected .  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24  hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix  4. 
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e .g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered to be SAEs.

8.1 Sample Size Determination  
In Apnimed studies a tomoxetine alone has decreased AHI by 65% or more, and dronabinol has 
been reported to decrease AHI by about 50% ( 21). Assuming that  12 pa rticipants  will complete 
the trial, t he study will have 90% power to detect a treatment difference with baseline at a two -
sided 0.05 significance level  if the true difference is AHI is 12 units and the within -subject 
standard deviation 12 . Considering an attrition r ate of 25%, we will enroll 15 pa rticip ants to 
complete the study . 
8.2 Populations for Analyses  
For the purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined:  
Population  Description  
Enrolled  All participants who signed the ICF (including screening 
failures).  
Modified Intent to Treat 
(mITT) Population  The mITT Population comprises all participan ts who take at least 
1 dose of any of the study treatments , and have at least 1 
measurement on the primary endpoint .  
Safety Population  The Safety Population consists of all participant s who receive at 
least 1 dose of any of the study treatments . Participant s will be 
analyzed for safety based on the treatment rec eived.   
Per Protocol (PP)  
Population  The PP Population consists of all participant s without any major 
protocol violations that could influence efficacy assessment. 
Participant s in this population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they actually r eceived.

for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponso r. Study sites will be closed upon study 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  32 of 47 V1.0 completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have 
been collected and a study site closure visit has been performed.  
The Investigator may initiate study site closure at  any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor or Investigator may include but are not 
limited to:  
• Failure of the Investigato r to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the Investigator.  
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development.  
9.1.8 Publication Policy  
• Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee 
of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  
• The Sponsor retains the right to disapprove any submission for publication, including any 
publication using trial data, including abstracts, presentations or manuscripts.  
• A summary of the study results will also be posted in a publicly accessible database (e .g., 
www.ClinTrials.gov).  
9.1.9 Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study , the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved 
by the IEC/IRB/Competent Authorities, in accordance with local legal requirements. The Sponsor 
must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first particip ant is 
enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments  or exceptions  must be 
written, receive approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC/Competent 
Authority approval prior to implementatio n (if appropriate).

25 June 2021  33 of 47 V1.0 Administrative changes (not affecting the participant  benefit/risk ratio) may be made without the 
need for a formal amendment. All amendments will be distributed to all protocol recipients, with 
appropriate instructions.  
9.1.10  Liability and Insurance  
The Sponsor will take out reasonable third -party liability insurance cover in accordance with all 
local legal requirements. The civil liability of the Investigator, the persons instructed by him or her 
and the hospital, practice, or institute in which they are employed and the liability of the Sponsor 
with respect to financial loss due to personal injury and other damage that may arise as a result of 
the carrying out of this study are governed by the applicable law.  
The Sponsor will arrange for participant s participating in this study to be insured against financial 
loss due to personal injury caused by the pharmaceutical products being tested or by medical steps 
taken in the course of the study.  
9.1.10.1  Access to Source Data  
Regulatory authorities of cert ain countries, IRBs, IECs, and/or the Sponsor may wish to carry out 
source data checks and/or on -site audit inspections. Direct access to source data will be required 
for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out giving due consideration to da ta protection 
and medical confidentiality. The Investigator assures the Sponsor of the necessary support at all 
times.

9.3 Appendix  3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or clinical study 
participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment . 
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (i .e., not related to progression of 
underlying d isease).  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  35 of 47 V1.0 • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment  administration even 
though it may have been pr esent before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment  or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se wi ll not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an 
AE or  SAE.  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
Investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition  that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected  at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (e .g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  36 of 47 V1.0 The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifi es that the participant has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient  setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other situations  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical treatment  to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dys crasias , or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  37 of 47 V1.0 Recording and Follow -up of AE and SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the  Investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the  participant’s 
medical records in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested  by the Sponsor . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of 
the participant number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before 
submission to the Sponsor . 
• The I nvestigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on s igns, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient disco mfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating 
the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  38 of 47 V1.0 • The I nvestigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment  and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather t han a relationship cannot be 
ruled out.  
• The I nvestigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the e vent to study treatment  
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The I nvestigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the I nvestigator must  docu ment in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in whi ch an SAE has occurred and the I nvestigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the  Sponsor . However, it is 
very important that the I nvestigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor . 
• The I nvestigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
informat ion and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
• The I nvestigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the 
Sponsor  to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study, the Investigator will provide the 
Sponsor  with a copy of a ny post -mortem findings including histopathology.  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  39 of 47 V1.0 • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
• The I nvestigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
 
Reporting of SAE to Sponsor  
SAE Reporting to Sponsor  
 
• The Investigator must report any SAEs to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.  
• When calling to report an SAE, state that you are reporting an SAE and give the 
Investigator’s name, your name, the telephone number where you can be reached, and 
the protocol number and title . 
• The Investigator and the Sponsor will review each SAE report and the Sponsor will 
evaluate the seriousness and the causal relationship of the event to study treatm ent. In 
addition, the Sponsor will evaluate the expectedness according to the reference 
document s (Investigator ’s Brochure or US product labeling for atomoxetine or 
dronabinol ). Based on the Investigator and Sponsor’s assessment of the event, a 
decision wi ll be made concerning the need for further action . 
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new S AE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or by 
telephone.  
 
 
All SAEs will be recorded from signing of informed consent until the end of the study. Serious 
adverse events occurring after the end of the study and coming to the attention of the Investigator 
must be reported only if they are considered (in the opinion of the Investigat or) causally -related to 
study treatment . 
 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  40 of 47 V1.0 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)  
Any AE that is serious, associated with the use of the study treatment , and unexpected 
(SUSAR) has additional reporting requirements, as described below.  
• If the SUSAR is fatal or life -threatening, associated with study treatment , and 
unexpected, regulatory authorities and IECs will be notified within 7 calendar days 
after th e Sponsor learns of the event. Additional follow -up (cause of death, autopsy 
report, and hospital report) information should be reported within an additional 8 days 
(15 days total).  
• If the SUSAR is not fatal or life -threatening but is otherwise serious, associated with 
study treatment , and unexpected, regulatory authorities and IEC s will be notified 
within 15 calendar days after the Sponsor learns of the event.  
The Sponsor will notify the Investigators in a timely fashion of relevant information 
about SUSARs that could adversely aff ect the safety of participants.  Follow -up 
informati on may be submitted if necessary.  
The Sponsor will also provide annual safety updates to the regulatory authori ties and 
IECs responsible for the study. These updates will include information on SUSARs and 
other relevant safety findings.  
9.4 Appendix  4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information  
Definitions  
WOCBP  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are n ot considered WOCBP:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with one of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  41 of 47 V1.0 • Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
NOTE: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’ s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Post-menopausal female  
• A post -menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal 
range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on H RT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of po st-menopausal status before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Male Participants:  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if the 
agree to ONE of the following during the protocol -defined time frame:  
• Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long -term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.  
• Agree to use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1% per year as described in 
the table below when having penile -vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not 
currently p regnant.  
In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study and 
for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.  
Male participants with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile -vaginal intercourse or to use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration 
during the protocol -defined time frame.  
Female Participants  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  42 of 47 V1.0 Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a highly 
effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table below.  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent1 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
Combined (estrogen - and progestin -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation2 
• Oral 
• Intravaginal  
• Transdermal  
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Oral 
• Injectable  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Independent1 
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• IUD 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized par tner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, 
an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluate d in relation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
NOTES:  
1 Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with 
local regulations regarding t he use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.  
 
 
Pregnancy Testing  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol: SEED  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 June 2021  43 of 47 V1.0 • WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly 
sensitive serum pregnancy test.  
• Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy 
is otherwise suspected.  
Collection of Pregnanc y Information:  
Female participants who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form 
and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours  of learning of a partici pant’s pregnancy. The 
participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will 
collect any follow up information on the participant and the neonate and the information will 
be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow  up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported, 
regardless of fetal state (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• While pregnancy itsel f is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion 
is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post -study pregnancy -
related SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by the Investigator will be 
reported to the Sponsor. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information 
in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be 
withdrawn from the study.

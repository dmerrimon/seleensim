immun ochemotherapy or ha ve relapsed within 12 mo nths and are eligible for HDCT and HSCT.
The time of relapse is calculated fro m the date of the first disease assessment confirming a 
complete response ( CR) obtained with first -line treatment for disease under study, to the date of 
first assessment dem onstrating a rel apse
.
During screening, a t umor biopsy will be collected for central confirmat ion of diagnosis. 
During screening ,all subjects will undergo anunstimulated leukapheresis to enable JCAR017 
product generation. 
Subjects will be rando mized to receive either: 
Arm A (SOC ):three cy cles of SOC salvage therapy . Responding subjects are 
expected to proceed to HDCT and HSCT
Arm B(JCAR017) : lymphodeplet ing(LD) chemotherap y followed by  JCAR017
infusio n
Subjects in Arm B may receive bridging therapy  with a protocol -defined SOC regimen to 
stabilize their disease during JCAR017 manufacturing. Invest igational therapies are not allowed.
Subjects will be fo llowed f or safet y and efficacy for up to 3 years under thi sprotocol . 
If requested by  the invest igator, subjects in Arm A may be allowed to receive JCAR017 upon 
central  confirmat ion of one of the fo llowing criteria:
Failure to achieve CR or PR by  9weeks post -randomizat ion(after 3 cy cles of SOC)
Progression at any  time
Need to start a new antineoplast ic therapy due to efficacy concerns after 18 weeks 
post-randomizat ion
Subject s who cross over to JCAR017 will be fo llowed in the study  for up to 1 y earafter the 
JCAR017 infusio n.All subjects who received JCAR017 will cont inue to be monitored for long -
term safety  and efficacy  after exposure to gene -modified T cells under a separate long -term 
follow-up (LTFU) protocol for up to 15 y ears after JCAR017 infusio n, as per competent 
authori ty guidelines.
The conduct of the study  will be overseen by  a scient ific steering co mmittee (SSC).

and laboratory  abnormalit ies (ty pe, frequency , and severi ty) wil l be co llected, graded and 
reported according to commo n termino logy criteria for adverse events (CTCAE ). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) may include but not limited to :
Infusio n-related reacti on
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
Neurol ogical toxicity(NT)
Macrophage activation syndro me (MAS)
Tumor lysis syndrom e (TLS)
Prolonged cy topeni as
Hypogammaglo bulinemia
Infections
Autoimmune disorders
Second primary malignancy  (SPM)
The study  data will be regularly reviewed by an independent data safet y monitoring board 
(DSMB). 
Statistical Methods
Subjects will be rando mized at 1:1 ratio into one of the two arms: Arm A (SOC) or Arm B 
(JCAR017). Rando mizat ion will be based on a permuted- blocks rando mization method, with the 
following stratificat ionfactors: 
1.Best overall response to first -line therapy: refractory  (defined as stable disease [SD] , 
progressive disease [PD] , parti al response [PR] or complete response [CR] with relapse 
before 3 m onths) versus relapse ( CRwith relapse on or after 3 m onths )
2.Secondary  age adj usted Internati onal Prognosti c Index (sAAIPI): 0 or 1 versus 2 or 3
The primary  efficacy  endpoint i s event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time from
rando mizat ion to death fro m any cause , progressive disease (PD), failure to achieve complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) by 9 weeks post -randomizat ion,or start of new 
antineopl astic therapy due to efficacy  concerns ,whichever occurs first .

Confident ial and Propri etary 10 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 2019The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints are:
Com plete response rate (CRR), defined as the proporti on of  subjects achieving a CR from 
rando mizat ion up to 3 y ears post -randomi zation. Subjects wi th unknown or missing 
response will be counted as non -responder sin the analysis. Any responses after a start of 
a new antineoplast ic therapy will not be considered. Responses after cross over will be 
analyzed descript ively ;
Progression -free survival (PFS), defined as the time fromrando mizat ionto PD or death 
from any cause, whichever occurs first ;
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time fro m randomizat ion to death due to any  cause .
A first interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 30 evaluable subjects (~15 
subjects per arm and having received their assigned treatment) have their 9 weeks response 
assessment (after 3 cy cles of SOC for Arm  A and 5 weeks after the JCAR017 infusio n) or have 
been confirmed wit h disease progression prior to this t imepo int. The purpose of this interim 
analysis is to stop for fut ility. The study  may be terminated if the CRR in JCAR017 arm is lower 
than the CRR in the SOC arm . No ty pe I error adjustment is implemented for this futility 
analysis.
A second interim analysis will be performed at approximately 60% inform ation time (ie, at 
around 71 EFS events). The purpose of this interim analysis is to demonstrate superior ity of 
JCAR017 versus SOC on EFS. The O’Brien -Fleming method will be used for defining the 
efficacy  boundari es.The s tudy will cont inue as planned regardless of the results at this interim 
analysis unless the experimental arm should be inferior to the refe rence treatm ent arm .
Subjects treated with SOC have median EFS of 3 mo nths. Subjects receiving experimental 
treatm ent JCAR017 are expected to have an increase of ~81% in the median EFS (equivalent to a 
hazard ratio [HR] of 0.55) compared to subjects treate d with SOC, bringing the median EFS in 
the experimental group to 5.455 months. Given these assumpt ions, using a log rank test with 
2.5% one -sided significance level, 119 EFS events will provide at least 90% power to reject the 
null hypothesis of HR greater than or equal to 1 .Given a peak rando mizat ion rate at about 12 
subjects per month, a 20% drop out rate before first response assessment and a y early  dropout
rate of 10% (30% cum ulative) , a sample size of 18 2subjects is expected to be rando mized and 
215subjects to be screened (screen failure rate of 15%).
If the planned subject randomizat ion rate does not appear adequate to accrue the expected 
number of events within the proposed fo llow
-up peri od or if lower than expected number of 
events are observed, the sam ple size m ay be increased (see Secti on9).
The primary  analysis of EFS will be conducted based on the intention -to-treat (ITT) population 
(defined as all subjects rando mized) when 119 EFS events accumulate fro m both JCAR017 and 
SOC arms. If null hypothesis on primary endpo int is rejected, hy pothesis testing on key  
secondary  endpoints will  be perform ed hierarchically  (CRR, PFS and subsequent ly on OS). For 
time to event endpo ints, Kapl an-Meier (K -M) survival analyses will be performed. Number and 
percent of subjects experiencing event of interest and censored will be provided. Kaplan -Meier 
product limit method will be used to estimate the survivors hip funct ion. Event rates at specific 
time points will be estimated from K
-M curves. Medians together with 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals will be com puted using a l og-log transformat ion. Hazard ratio and its confidence

1.1. Disease Background 
Non-Hodgkin lympho mas (NHLs) comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies. Wit hin
Europe, the incidence o f NHL is approximately  49,533 new cases annua lly with 20,347 deaths 
per year (Ferlay, 2015 ).
In the United States (US), it is est imated that approximately 72,580 new cases of NHL will be
diagnosed and approximately  20,150 subjects will di e of their disease per y ear(Siegel, 2016 ).
Non-Hodgkin lympho mas are cl assified according to the current World Health Organizat ion
(WHO) classificat ion (Swerdl ow, 2016 ) into immature lympho id neoplasms, mature B -cell
neopl asms , T cell and natural killer (NK) -cell neoplasms, and post -transplant
lymphoproliferat ive disorders. Mature B -cell lympho mas are further classified into indo lent
lympho mas (eg, mult iple myelo ma, chronic lymphocy tic leukemia [CLL]) and aggressive
lympho mas ( eg, diffuse large B- cell lympho ma [DLBCL]).
Diffuse large B -cell lympho mais the most frequent lympho ma subt ype, representing 
approximately  30% of  all NHL , which can develo p de novo or secondary  to transform ation of an 
indolent NHL , eg, from fo llicular ly mpho ma.In the Uni ted States 27,650 estimated new cases 
were di agnosed in 2016 ( Teras , 2016); incidence in Europe is 3 to 4/100,000/year, increasing 
with age from 0.3/100,000/y ear (35 to 39 y ears) to 26.6/100,000/y ear (80 to 8 4 years) ( Tilly, 
2012 ). About 10,000 deaths per y ear are due to DLBCL in the United States ( US)(National 
Cancer Inst itute [NCI]). 
Diffuse large B -cell lympho ma is a heterogeneous disease wit h several histological and
molecular subt ypes. The largest subgroup is DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS). Molecular
profiling by gene expressio n profiling based on bio logic similarit y to norm al stages of B -cell 
development (cell o f origin [COO]) helped to further divide DLBCL into germinal center like
(GCB), activated B- cell-like (ABC) tumors, and primary mediastinal large B -cell lymphom a
(PMBCL) (Lenz, 2008). Immunohistochemistry  (IHC) al gorithms are clinically used to identify  
the COO and helped to i dentify  ABC DLBCL as a high -risk subt ypeless likely to respond to 
standard immun ochemotherapy. Within the GCB group a specific high- risk group i s defined by 
concurrent chromosomal rearrangements of c -MYC and the ant i-apoptoti c oncogene BCL2, 
referred to a s double -hit lympho mas (DHL). In addit ion, in some cases there is a concurrent 
rearrangement of c -MYC and both ant iapoptotic oncogenes BCL2 and BCL6, which are referred 
to as tri ple-hit lympho ma. D ouble-hit lympho masrepresents approximately 5% of de novo cases 
of DLBCL wi th very poor overall survival ( OS)of ≤ 12 months when treated with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincrist ine, and prednisone (R-CHOP ) (Camicia, 2015 ). Newer 
data suggest negative prognostic impact of p53 muta ti ons or del etions in DLBCL ( Schiefer, 
2015). Primary mediast inal (thymic) large B -cell lympho ma (PMBCL ), T cell/hist iocyte-rich 
large B -cell lymphom a (THRBCL) are considered different histological subt ypes in World 
Health Organizat ion 2016 classification ( Swerdl ow, 2016 ), but internat ional guidelines 
recommend to use DLBCL treatment algorithm (National Co mprehensive Cancer Network 
[NCCN]) ( NCCN, 2019
),especially for refractory and relapsed disease.
Despite fo llicular lympho ma being an indo lent lympho ma type, fo llicular lympho ma Grade 3B 
(FL3B) is regarded as anaggressive lympho ma. Clinical behavior is very similar to DLBCL, and

Confident ial and Propri etary 23 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 2019follicular lympho ma (FL)frequent ly undergoes histological transformat ion into DLBCL. 
Consequent ly, current guidelines reco mmend treating FL3B according to the DLBCL treatment 
algorithm (NCCN, 2019; Dreyling 2016; Dreyling, 2017 ). These patients are generally treated 
with an anthracycline -based chemotherapy  combined wi th rituximab (eg, R -CHOP) and have a 
similar prognosis to that of de novo DLBCL.
Most subjects with localized DLBCL can be cured with convent ional co mbinat ion immuno -
chemo -orcombined -modality therapy  (Tilly, 2015 ). For subj ects wi th advanced -stage di sease, 
the majorit yof subjects can be cured with doxorubicin -based co mbinat ion chemotherapy  and 
rituximab (eg, R-CHOP). Prognosis depends on individual risk f actors. The International 
Prognosti c Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL includes five significant risk factors prognostic of 
OS:Subject age, serum lactate dehy drogenase (LDH) level, Eastern Cooperative Onco logy 
Group (ECOG) performance status, disease stage, and extranodal invo lvement. Subjects with ≥ 2 
riskfactors after age -adjustment have a poor prognosis with a 5 -year OS -rate of 21% to 46%. 
Age andstage -adjusted m odificati ons are used for y ounger subjects wi th localized disease 
(Moller, 2003).
Despite overall improvement in outcomes of DLBCL, appr oximately  one-third of  subjects do not 
respond to init ial therapy or will relapse ( relapsed/refractory  
[R/R]disease )that rem ains a m ajor 
cause of mortalit y. 
The stan dard of care for pati ents wi th R/RDLBCL after init ial therapy  is salvage therapy  with 
platinum -based chemotherapy  regimens ( ie, rituximab ,dexamethasone , cytarabine and cisplat in
[R-DHAP ], rituximab, ifosfamide ,carboplatin and etoposi de [R-ICE] , or ri tuximab, gemcitabine, 
dexamethasone, and cisplat in[R-GDP ]) if they are deemed to be eligible for high dose 
chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autologous 
HSCT; ASCT) ( Tilly, 2015 ). Patients responding to second line salvage therapy , ie, those wi th 
chemo -sensi tive disease, might proceed to HDCT and ASCT to consolidate their response.  
While approximately 50 -60% o f patients wi th R/RDLBCL remain sensit ive to convent ional 
second line therapy , only  roughly  30% will  eventually  proceed to ASCT ( Gisselbrecht ,2010; 
Crum p,2014; van Imho ff, 2016). Yet, only a modest portion of patients undergo ing HSCT are 
cured, and patients with high
-risk DLBCL, ie, relapsing wit hin a year from first-line treatment, 
obtain a limited survival advantage by undergoing HSCT (Van Den Neste, 2017) .
Three l arge rando mized phase 3 trials have compared the efficacy of various 
immun ochemotherapy regimens as second line salvag e therapy , namely  the CORAL trial  
(Collaborative trial in relapsed aggressive l ymphoma) (Van Den Neste, 2017) , the National  
Cancer Inst itute of Canada (NCIC )Clinical Trials Group’s LY.12 trial (Crump, 2014 ), and the 
ORCHARRD (Ofatumumab versus Rituximab Salvage Chemo immunotherapy ) trial(van 
Imhoff, 2016 ).  
The CORAL trial evaluated the efficacy  of standard platinum -based (R- ICE or R -DHAP) second 
line therapy  and subsequent conso lidation with high dose therapy  with ASCT in 396 pati ents 
who failed R -CHOP or R -CHOP -like therapy ( Gisselbrecht, 2010; Van Den Neste, 201 6; Van 
Den Neste, 201 7). Similar response rates were observed after thre e cycles of R -ICE (64%) or R -
DHAP (63%). After a median fo llow
-up time of 27 months, the 3 -year event -free survival ( EFS)
and progressi on-free survival ( PFS)rates were31% and 37%, respectively, the R-ICE and R -
DHAP arms were not significant ly different , and the 3-year OS was 49% with no difference 
between the R -ICE and R -DHAP arms .
For pati ents who underwent ASCT, 3 -year PFS was 53%

before ASCT ( Gisselbrecht , 2010). Patients failing salvage therapy or relapsing after ASCT had 
a particularly poor prognosis, with a median OS of 4.4 months and 1 -and 2 -year OS rate sof 
23% and 15.7%, respectively (Van Den Neste, 2016 ; Van Den Neste, 201 7). Median time 
between ASCT and relapse in the CORAL trial was 7.1 months. 
The NCIC -CTG LY.12 trial compared the efficacy of gemci tabine, dexamethasone, and cisplat in 
(GDP) versus dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplat in (DHAP) a nd subsequent consolidat ion 
by H
DCT/ ASCT in 619 patients with R/R aggressive NHL s. Results were very  similar to what 
had been observed in the CORAL trial. Overall response rate to GDP was 45% and 44% to 
DHAP with 52% and 49% continuing to ASCT ( Crump, 2014 ). With a median fo llow-up 
durati on of 53 m onths, 4 -year event -free survival was 26% and overall survival 39% in the 
overall pat ient group with no difference between the two arms . 
The m ore recent ORCHARRD study  in 447 patien ts rel apsing after rituximab -containing 
front line therapy co mpared DHAP in co mbinat ion with either ri tuximab (R) or the cluster of 
different iation (CD)20 ant ibody  ofatum umab (O). In contrast to the CORAL and the LY.12 
trials, all patients enrolled in this trial were refractory  to, or had rel apsed fo llowing, fi rst-line 
treatm ent wi th rituximab in combinat ion with an anthracycline -containing chemotherapy  
regimen. In thi s study , response rate for ofatum umab, dexamethasone, high dose cy tarabine 
(AraC), and cisp latin(O-DHAP )was 38% (CR 15%) versus 42% (CR 22%) for R -DHAP. Only 
one third of subjects completed ASCT on protocol; 74 patients (33%) in the O -DHAP arm and 
83 pati ents (37%) in the R -DHAP arm. Progression -free survival (defined as time from rando m 
assignment until PD, death from any cause, or SD after 2 cy cles) ,EFS, and OSwere not 
significant ly different between O -DHAP versus R -DHAP: PFS at 2 years was 24% versus 26% 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval ( CI), 0.89 to 1.42; P 5.33); EFSat 2 years was 
16% versus 18% (HR, 1.10; P 5.35); and OSat 2 years was 41% versus 38% (HR, 0.90; P 5.38).
This study represent sthe most relevant benchmark for efficacy of salva ge therapy  in the 
rituximab era. Com plete m etabo lic response (CMR) before AS CT was highly  predict ive for 
superi or outcom e (van Imhoff, 2016).
All three trials failed to improve on the standard of care (SOC) and ident ified early relapse 
(refractory  disease or progression wit hin 12 mo nths) as well as se condary age -adjusted el evated 
IPI as poor prognostic factors. The CORAL trial ,furthermore ,ident ified prior exposure to 
rituximab as a risk factor. In particular subjects relapsing within 12 mo nths of rituximab -
containing front line therapy had a very poor prognosis even with ASCT ( Gisselbrecht, 2010 ). 
While prior use of rituximab was not ident ified as an adverse prognostic factor in the LY.12 and 
ORCHARRD trials, they  confi rmed the poor prognosis of patients with refractory  DLBCL or
patients relapsing wit hin 12 months. 
Recent ly, the SCHOLAR -1 meta-analysis (n=63 6) has reported on the very  poor outcom e of 
patients wi th DLBCL refractory  to anti -CD20 m onocl onal ant ibody -and anthracycline -
containing regimens ( Crum p, 2017 ). Chemo -refractori ness was defined as: progressive disease 
(PD)as best response to chemotherapy, or stable disease ( SD)as best response to chemotherapy  
(received at least 4 cy cles of first
-line or 2 cy cles of later -line therapy), or relapse wit hin 12 
months from prior autol ogous HSCT. The m edian overall response rate ( ORR )was 26% (CR 
8%, PR 18%) and the median OS was 6.6 months.

anthracycline containing first -line immun ochemotherapy, there is a high unmet medical need for 
patients wi th R/RDLBCL. While subjects with chemotherapy  sensitive disease (defined as 
relapsing after 12 months of response to first- line therapy) have a relatively good prognosis , the 
majorit y of subjects with chemotherapy refractory  disease (defined as best response of PD, SD or 
relapse wi thin 12 m onths from response) undergo ing second line salvage therapy will not derive 
long term  benefit. Thus, novel therapies are urgently  needed for thi s pat ient population.
1.2. Compound Background 
1.2.1. CD19 as a Therapeutic Target 
CD19 i s a 95 -kDa glycoprotein present on B -cells fro mearly  devel opment until  different iation 
into plasma cells ( Stam enkovic, 1988 ). It i s a m ember of the immunoglobulin superfamily  and a 
component of a B -cell surface signal transduct ion complex that posit ively regulates signal 
transduction through the B -cell receptor. 
CD19 i s an attractive therapeut ic target because it is expressed by most B -cell malignancies, 
including B -cell NHL ( Li, 1993 ). Im portantly , the CD19 ant igen is not expressed on 
hemato poiet ic stem cells or on any normal t issue apart from those of the B -cell lineage.
1.2.2. CD19 –Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptors 
CD19 -specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are single chain variable fragments (scFv) 
fused to a transmembrane domain and cyto plasmic si gnaling dom ains. Expressio n of CD19 -
targeted CAR sin autologous T cells typically is achieved by ex vivo transduction using a 
recombinant retroviral or lent iviral vector. The CAR i s expressed on the T cell surface and 
redirects the transfected T cells to CD19
-expressing lympho ma cells, leading to CD19 -specific 
tumor cell recognit ion, lysis, cytokine secret ion and T cell pro liferat ion (Sadel ain, 2013 ). In 
clinical studies, CD19 -targeted CARs have demo nstrated encouraging activit y in adult and 
pediatric subjects wi th R/R B -cell acute lymphoblasti c leukemia (A LL) and B -cell NHL ( Porter, 
2011; Davila, 2014; Maude, 2014; Kochenderfer, 2015; Lee, 2015; Turtle, 2016 a; Turtle, 
2016b ).Promising results have been reported for different CD19 -directed CARs in the treatment 
of adul t (Neelapu, 201 7; Schuster, 201 7; Turtle, 2016b ) and pediatric ( Park, 2016 ) CD19 -
positive lymph oidmalignancies.
Two CD19 -directed CAR T therapi es have recent ly been approved by  the US Food and Drug 
Administrati on (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) : 
Tisagenlecleucel for the treatm ent of :
Patients up to age 25 y ears wi th B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory  or in 
second or later relapse .
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory  (R
/R) large B -cell lympho ma after two 
or more lines of systemic therapy .
Axicabtagene cilo leucel to treat adult patients with certain t ypes of large B -cell 
lympho ma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds 
of treatm ent.

1.2.4. Clinical Experience with JCAR017 
JCAR017 is cu rrent ly being evaluated in adult subjects with relapsed and refractory B -cell NHL 
(Study 017001 -TRANSCEND NHL001; ClinicalTrials.gov No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ( Abramson ,
2017a ). A total of 108patients had received JCAR017 at the time o f data cutoff ( October 9 , 
2017). Preliminary  data suggest promising ant itumor activit y of JCAR017 in these heavily 
pretreated, poor prognosis R/R pat ients with aggressive NHL (median o f 3 prior lines of 
therapy ). In65patients with R/R DLBCL t he best ORR reported was 80% and the complete 
response rate ( CRR) at 6months 47%, and an accept able safet y profile. No dose -limiting toxi city 
(DLT) was observed at DL2 (JCAR017 infusio n of 1 00x 106viable CAR+ T cells). 
Pharmacokinet ics (PK)analyses showed that in vivo expansio n of JCAR017+ T cells peaks 
around day  11 after infusion o f JCAR017. This is consistent with the reported safet ywith most 
important toxicit ies (cytokine release syndrome [CR S], neurotoxicit y [NT]) occurri ng wit hin the 
first 14 day s after infusio n.
Out of 91 patients evaluable for safet y, major safety  findings inc lude CRS, NT, and 
hematol ogical disorders, including neutropenia, thrombocy topeni a, and anemia. The most 
significan t toxi cities reported have been severe CRS (sCRS) and NT. Cy tokine release syndrome 
was observed in 32(35%) pati entstreated, with only  1 pati ent devel oping sCRS ( Grade 3 -4). NT 
was observed in 19% of the patients, of which 12% developed severe NT ( Grade 3 -4). Median 
time to onset of CRS after JCAR017 infusio n was 5 day s, median t ime to onset of NT was 10
days. The median time to resolution to grade 1 or better was 5 days for CRS and 10days for NT. 
No unexpected early  or late toxi cities were reported . No cerebral edema, fatal CRS or NT were 
observed and symptoms were reversible and manageable wit h appropriate treatment intervention 
and close mo nitoring ( Abramson, 2017
a, Mal oney, 2017 ).Abilit y of CAR cells to cross the 
blood -brain -barrier has been reported ( Kochenderfer , 2017 ) and has been observed in Study
017001 ( Abramson , 2019). At tim e of data analysis, the subjects enrolled and e xperiencing NT 
had no evidence of central  nervous system  (CNS )involvement. This supports the rational to 
further invest igate CAR T cell therapy in patients with primary CNS or secondary CNS 
involvement. Two patients with secondary CNS invo lvement by DLBCL were included in Study

1.3. Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
Despite an improvement in long-term remissio ns after fi rst-line therapy for subjects with 
DLBCL, outcomes of subjects who have failed front -line therapy are poor, and addit ional 
options are needed. 
Although sev eral second -line salvage therap ies, such as R -DHAP, R -ICE, or R -GDP, each 
followed by HDCT and autologo us stem cell transplant (ASCT), have been the standard of care 
(SOC) for subjects who are refractory  to or who relapse fo llowing fi rst-line treatment with 
combinat ion immuno -chemotherapy, the clinical outcome of these subject s is disappo inting. 
Three and 4 -year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates range between 
30% to 40% and 40 % to 50%, respe ctively (Crump, 2014; Gisselbrecht, 2010 ). Especi ally 
subjects whose disease is refractory  to standard R -CHOP fir st-line therapy or are relapsing
within 12 m onthsafter diagnosi shave avery poor prognosi s, wi th a 3 y ear PFS rate of 23% 
(Gisselbrecht, 2010 ).
The m ost recent randomized clinical trial in second -line, transplant -eligible subjects shows an 
ORR to DHAP
-based salvage therapy  of 40% wi th approximately 35% of subjects proceeding to 
HDCT/ASCT ( van Imho ff, 2016 ). The overall 2 -year PFS rate was approximately 25%, and the 
2-year OS rate was approximately 40%. In this trial, 71% of the subjects had high -risk poor 
prognosti c disease (refractory  or relapsing within 12 months to R -CHOP). In this high -risk 
popul ation, the ORR and percentage of subjects that completed HDCT/ASCT were 29% and 
26% compared wit h 67% and 59% for the subject subgro up wi th CR of m ore than 1 y ear from R-
CHOP, respectively . Median PFS in the high -risk versus standard risk population swas 
approxima tely 2 months v
ersus 24 m onths, and m edian OS was approximately  10 m onths versus 
not reached ( van Imho ff, 2016 ), clearly showing the urgent need for improved therapeut ic 
options in this the high -risk popul ation.
The National Co mprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines reco mmend that as a second -
line therapy , subjects shoul d receive salvage chemo therapy  followed by  HDCT wi th ASCT for 
subjects in CR. Subjects with SD and PD after salvage chemotherapy should receive next line of 
therapy . Subjects who only achieve PR after salvage chemotherapy  are reco mmended to receive 
either CAR T cells, HDCT with ASCT , be enrolled in a clinical trial, or continue to allogeneic 
HSCT in selected cases ( NCCN, 2019). For subjects with PR, relapse or PD after conso lidation 
with HDCT and ASCT, the recommendat ion is to use CAR T cell therapy (if not previously  
given), to enroll in a clinical trial, or to use alternative second -line therapy , if available (NCCN,

Confident ial and Propri etary 28 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 20192019). Data fro m Study  017001 in subjects with aggressive B -cell NHL who have failed two or 
more lines of therapy , including subjects who were refractory  to first -line and second- line 
therapi es, demonstrate that treatm ent wi th JCAR017 resul ts in encouraging efficacy results 
(ORR of 49% at 6 months, CR Rof 46% at 6 months, and median OS in responders has not been 
reached wit h a m edian fo llow
-up of  12 months) and an acceptable safet y profile ( Abramson, 
2018). Based on promising early results in later lines of therapy, JCAR017 has the potential to 
improve outcom es in this study popul ation. The purpose of this Phase 3 study  is to com pare the 
current SOC paradigm for subjects with R/R DLBCL and to dem onstrate whether JCAR017
,
used in an earlier line of therapy will be superior to the current SOC in high -risk, transplant -
eligible subjects who have failed one previous line of CD20 -directed antibody  and anthracycline 
containing therapy  for aggressive B -cell NHL.  
1.3.2. Rationale for the S tudy Design
This is a rando mized, open -label, parallel -group, mul ti-center t rial to determine the efficacy and 
safet y of JCAR017 in adult subject s with relapsed or refractory  aggressive NHL after failure of 
anti-CD20 ant ibody and anthracycline containing first -line immun ochemotherapy co mpared to
the SOC strategy . Subject s with R/Raggressive NHL eligible for transplant are usually  treated 
with a salvage immun ochemotherapy fo llowed by  HDCT and HSCT. This study  is designed to 
compare the current SOC treatment paradigm versus JCAR017 for subjects with high risk 
DLBCL , DHL/THL, PMBCL, THRBCL and FL3B .
Subjects will be rando mized to either receive SOC (Arm A) or to receive JCAR017 (Arm B). 
Randomization will be stratified by response to first- line therapy ( relapsed versus refractory ), 
and secondary  age-adjusted International Prognostic I ndex (sAAIPI ) (0 to 1 versus 2 to 3). Both 
stratificat ion factors have been used previously in large randomized Phase 3 trials and shown to 
control  for imbalances during the randomizat ion (Gisselbrecht, 2010; Crump, 2014; van Imhoff, 
2016). 
The reference treatment in Arm A corresponds to the SOC in this setting based on the CORAL, 
the LY.12, and the ORCHARRD trials . These consist of the R-DHAP ,
R-ICE, or R -GDP 
regimen fo llowed by HDCT and HSCT ( NCCN, 201 9; Tilly , 2015 ). All subjects rando mized to 
Arm A will receive 3cycles of SOC salvage therapy  (R-DHAP, R
-ICE or R-GDP) as per 
physician’s cho ice, during which peripheral blood hematopoiet ic stem cells for HSCT are 
harvested . After 3cycles, respons e will be evaluated by  PET -CT. Subjects responding to SOC 
(CR and PR) will proceed to HDCT and HSCT. 
Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive LD chemotherapy fo llowed by  JCAR017 infusio n. 
Subjects m ay receive one cy cle of  SOC salvage therapy to bri dge th e time between 
rando mizat ion and availabilit y of the JCAR017 cell product (manufacturing time). Based on 
promising preliminary  resul ts from Study 017001, which show high response rates even in 
subjects wi th refractory  DLBCL ( Abramson, 2018 ), 
it is expected that subjects in high risk 
second line DLBCL will also derive a meaningful benefit from treatment with JCAR017. 
The primary  object ive of the study  is to com pare the efficacy  of JCAR017 therapy  to SOC 
salvage therapy  (immun ochemotherapy fo llowed by  HDCT and HSCT) wi th respect to event -
free survival ( EFS) in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory  DLBCL , DHL/THL, PMBCL,

1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, S chedule and Regimen Selection
The Phase 1 trial ( Study 017001- [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is evaluat ing JCAR017 at several dose levels 
after LD chem otherapy  with cycl ophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day x 3 days) combined wit h 
fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day x 3 days). The init ial dose l evel evalua ted (DL1: 5 0x 106CAR+ T 
cells) was found to be tolerable, the dose was escalated and a dose of 1 00x 106CAR+ T cells 
(DL2) and addit ional dosing schedules are currently being evaluated ( Abramson, 2016 ). Safety 
and efficacy  of 
18subjects treated at DL2 showed good tolerabilit y and effic acy with a single 
JCAR017 infusio n. This dose was selected for the pivotal cohort in the Study 017001 as the 
recommended Phase 2 dose and therefore was selected for this Phase 3trial.
1.3.4. Rationale for Choice of Comparator Compounds
The current SOC salvage t herapies for R/R DLBC L in second line are defined as R -DHAP, R -
ICE or R -GDP.
These regimens are widely used and accepted, backed by  large rando mized trials and 
recommended by  internat ional treatment guidelines ( Tilly, 2015; NC CN, 201 9). As described in 
Secti on1.1, it has been demonstrated that the three regimens are comparable in terms of efficacy 
and safet y. The most commo nly used high dose chem otherapy  in NHL i s carmust ine(BCNU), 
etoposide, cy tarab ine, and melphalan ( BEAM )and will be used as standard HDCT for this trial. 
In Japan, due to unavailabilit y of intravenous BCNU, ranimust ine (MCNU) will be used. 
Ranimust ineis in the same class o f nitrosourea anticancer agents as BCNU andhas shown 
effica cy equivalent outcom es (Sugimoto, 2016 ). 
Standard of care regimen, schedule of the 
regimen, dose adjust mentfor toxici tiesand prem edication willbe done as per si te standard , local 
label and invest igator’s decisio n.Please see Secti on7.3for further details.

3.1. Study Design
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the International Council forHarm onisati on 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use/Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory  requi rements.
This is a random ized, open -label, parallel -group, mul ti-center tri al in adult subject s with R/R
aggressive NHL to compare safet y and efficacy between the standard of care (SOC) strategy  
versus JCAR017. Subjects will be rando mized to eit her receive SOC (Arm A) or to rece ive 
JCAR017 (Arm B). See Figure 1.
Randomization will be stratified by response to first
-line therapy ( SD, PD, PR or CR with 
relapse before 3 m onths versus CR wi th relapse on or after lasting at least 3 months ), and sAAIPI 
(0 to 1 versus 2 to 3). 
All subjects rando mized to Arm A will receive 3cycles of SOC salvage therapy  (R-DHAP, R-
ICE or R-GDP) as per phy sician’s cho ice, during which peripheral blood hematopoiet ic stem 
cells for HSCT are harvested. If peripheral  blood hem atopoi etic stem cells are available from a 
collect ion done pri or to screen ing, 
theymay be used and a collect ion does not need to be 
repeated during the study. After 3cycles, response will be evaluated by PET -CT. Subjects 
responding to SOC (metabolic CRor metabolic PR, see Table 12) are expected to undergo 
HDCT and H SCT.In case of toxicit yor not satisfactory response as per investigator judgment to 
theselected SOC regimen, a switc h within the 3 defined SOC regimen will be allowed and will 
not be counted as an EFS event.
Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive LD chemotherapy fo llowed by  JCAR017 infusio n. 
Subjects m ay receive one cy cle of  SOC chemotherapy  to bri dge the m anufacturing t ime. 
A staggered dosing approach will be utilized for all sites without pri or experience of 
administering CAR T cell therapies as fo llows:
1st subject infusio n, wai t 14 day s
2nd subject infusion, wait 14 day s
Following com pletion of this site -staggered randomizat ion approach, the si te may proceed wi th 
subject randomizat ion as co mmu nicated by  Celgene. 
If requested by  the invest igator, subjects in Arm A may be allowed to receive JCAR017 upon 
central  confirmat ion of one of the fo llowing cri
teria:
Failure to achieve CR or PR by  9 weeks post -randomizat ion(after 3 cy cles of SOC)
Progress ion at any  time
Need to start a new antineoplast ic therapy due to efficacy concerns after 18 weeks 
post-randomizat ion

treatment, the initially planned study visit needs to be repeated and documented as such (eg, if a subject in Arm A cannot start the ir2ndcycle of SOC on Day  22, 
but there were assessments performed on the scheduled visit day, these will be documented as unscheduled. Once the subject can receive their treatment, all 
assessments from Day 22 should be performed and next visits scheduled as per the below table . Same example would apply to Arm B JCAR017 infusion at 
Day 29 and following visits ).Please refer to the specified protocol section for further details on each procedure.

Any quest ions regarding the protocol should be directed to the Medical Monitor(s) or designee. 
6.1. Pre-Treatment Period
6.1.1. Screening
Screening evaluat ions will be performed for all subjects to determine study  eligibilit y. These 
evaluat ions shoul d be co mpleted within 4weeks prior to randomizat ion unless noted otherwise 
below. 
Waivers to the protocol will not be granted during the conduct of this trial, under any 
circumstances.
Screening laboratory  values m ust dem onstrate subject eligibilit y, but may  be repeated wi thin the 
screening window, if necessary .
The fo llowing assessments are to be performed at screening as specified in the Table of Events 
(see Table 3), after informed consent has been obtained:
Subject should be registered in the interactive response techno logy 
(IRT ) system
Assess eligibilit y per inclusio n/exclusio n criteria. All  eligibil itycriteria m ust be m et 
in order for subjects to be randomized in the study
Obtain medical history , including: disease diagnosis and history , chem otherapy , 
radiation and surgical history , and history  of prior gene therapy . May include history  
of toxicities related to prior treatments and allergies 
Dem ographics 
sAAIPI status (seeAppendix M)
ECOG performance status assessment 
HCT -CI (hematopoiet ic cell transplantati on – specific co morbidity index) (Sorror, 
2005; seeAppendix K)
FEV 1(forced expiratory  volume in one second)
Physical examinat ion, including height, weight, vital signs ( see Section6.4.2 ), 
oxygen saturati on via pulse oximetry  
Prior and concomitant procedures and medications within 1 month before signing the 
ICF, except for those related to the disease

perform ed atWeeks 9 (after 3 cy clesof SOC for Arm  A and 5 weeks after JCAR017 infusio n for 
Arm B)and 18 (8 weeks after the start of HDCT for Arm A and 14weeks after JCAR017 
infusio n for Arm  B)and Month s 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 . 
Subjects in Arm Bwho received bridging chemotherapy  shoul dhave a PET performed prior to 
start of lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy . 
This assessment will be only used for evaluation o f PET 
disease status , not counted as a formal efficacy assessment .
6.5.1. Pseudoprogression 
If a subject demonstr ates early tumor progression (defined as occurring prior to 3monthsafter 
JCAR017 infusio n), the invest igator is responsible for evaluating whether the subject is 
experiencing a possible pseudoprogression (ie, tum or flare, which is local inflammatory  reaction 
indicat ing early tumor response at sites of disease such as lymph nodes) ( Cheson, 2016 ).  
6.6. Pharmacokinetics 
6.6.1. Pharmacokinetics of JCAR017

6.8. Subject Reported Outcomes or Quality of Life or Health Economics
Subject -reported qualit y-of-life outcomes will be administer ed according to Table 3.
If the subject withdraws from the study  prem aturely , all attem pts shoul d be made to obtain a 
final qualit y
-of-life questionnaire prior to subject discontinuat ion. EORTC QLQ -C30 
andFACT -Lym “Addit ional concerns” subscale will be used to assess the subject’s healt h as 
well as physical, social, emot ional, and funct ional well -being. Reasons for missing subject 
reported outcomes quest ionnaires should also be captured so that the appropr iate imputation 
method can be emplo yed to correct for missing data in the analysis.
The quest ionnaire will be co mpleted by  the subjects before any clinical assessments are 
perform ed and treatm ents administered at any  given visi t. If subjects refuse to comp lete all or 
any part of a questionnaire, this will be documented. Questionnaires should be co mpleted in the 
language most familiar to each subject, and subjects should be given adequate time and space to 
complete the questi onnai re. Si te personnel shoul d review questionnaires for completeness and 
ask subjects to complete any missing responses.
6.8.1. EORTC QLQ -C30
The European Organizat ion for Research and Treatment of Cancer –Qualit y of Life C30 
Quest ionnaire (EORTC QLQ -C30)questionnaire will be used as a measur e of healt h-related 
qualit y of life. The EORTC QLQ -C30 i s composed of both mult i-item scales and single item 
measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognit ive and social), 
three symptom  scales (fat igue, nausea/vo miting, a nd pain), a global health status/healt h-related 
qualit y of life (HRQoL) scale, and six single items (dyspnea, inso mnia, appetite loss, 
constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies). Each o f the multi-item scales includes a 
different set of items –noitem occurs in m ore than one scale.
The EORTC QLQ -C30 em ploys a week recall period for all items and a 4 -point scale for the 
funct ional and symptom scales/items with response categories “Not at all”, “A little”, “Quite a 
bit” and “Very  much”. The two i tems assessing global healt h status/ HRQoL utilize a 7 -point 
scale ranging fro m 1(“Very Poor”) to 7 (“ Excellent”) ( Aaronson, 1993). See Appendix H.

7.4.2. Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Subjects will be treated with fludarabine IV (30 mg/m2/day for 3 days) and cyclophosphamide 
IV (300 mg/m2/day for 3 day s) pri or to JCAR017 infusio n. Refer to the most recen t package 
inserts for further details on administration of these agents.
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy can start 5 to 7days before JCAR017 infusio n and must be 
completed at l east 2 days before JCAR017 infusio n. If side effects fro m the LD chemotherapy 
occu r, JCAR017 infusio n may be delayed for up to 7days after LD chemotherapy upon 
discussio n with Celgene. Refer to Section 6.2.3.2 for the assessments that will be performed on 
each day  of LD chem otherapy.
Serum  creatinine will be measured on the first day  of LD chem otherapy; LD chemotherapy 
shoul d be wi thhel d if serum  creat inine is > 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) OR calculated 
creatinine cleara nce (by Cockcroft -Gaul t, see Appendix D)is ≤ 30 mL/min. 
The recommended administration is as fo llows: 
The IV hy dration is 1 L of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl )given at 500 mL/hr starting 
2 hours pri or to cycl ophosphamide
Fludarabine IV 30 mg/m2over 30 minutes
If creat inine clearance (CrCl ) is between 50 to 70 mL/min: Reduce dose by 20%
for each daily  dose
If CrCl is between 30 to 49 mL/min: Redu ce dose by  40% f or each daily dose
If CrCl < 30 mL/min: Do not administer fludarabine
Cyclophosphamide IV 300 mg/m2over 60 minutes
Addit ional 1 L o f 0.9% NaCl given at 500 mL/hr
Antiemetic therapy may be given prior to LD chemotherapy per inst itutional practice. Mesna 
may be used for subjects with a history  of hemorrhagi c cyst itis per institutional practice.

(CAR+ T cells) on Day  29(2 to 7 days after com pletion of  LD chem otherapy) for subjects 
rando mized in Arm B .For subjects fro m Arm A crossing over to JCAR017, refer to the schedule 
on Table 4.Each JCAR017 dose includes CD4+ CAR+ T cells and CD8+ CAR+ T cells. The 
subject must be continuously  monitored during each administration of JCAR017. Vital signs 
(temperature, respi ratory  
rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and SaO 2by pulse oximetry ) will  be 
measured approximately  every 15 minutes , starting from 15 minutes prior to the first IV 
administration until one hour after the l ast IV administration, and hourly for the next 2 hours. I f 
the subject’s vital signs are not stable 4 hours fo llowing the final administration, vital signs 
shoul d be m onitored as clinically  indicated unt il stable.
See the JCAR017 Product Administration Manual for complete informat ion.
7.4.6. Non-Conforming Product
7.4.6.1. Protocol Product Deviation Plan 
The JCAR017 Protocol Product Deviat ion Plan (PPDP) defines an assessment and decisio n-
making process, which could result in a recommendation to treat a subject with a drug product 
that does not meet the specificat ion for certain non -safet y related attributes (non -conforming 
JCAR017). In this process, the Medical Monitor and the Primary Invest igator at the clinical site 
agree that the healt h of the subject and the risk/benefit profile is acceptable for the subject to 
receive treatm ent. Qualit y Assurance then assesses the recommendat ion and is ult imately 
responsible for the drug product lot disposit ion. Documentation of the non -conforming drug 
product is submitted to local healt h authorit ies and is provided to the Invest igator to submit per 
institutional review board/ ethics committee ( IRB/EC )requirements. The JCAR017 PPDP is a 
stand alone docum ent.
7.4.6.2. Exception Use of Non -conforming Product
Once a decisio n is made for the except ion use of non -conforming JCAR017, country -specific 
requi rements will be fo llowed for the rel ease of a non -conforming JCAR017 product to treat a 
subject enrolled in a JCAR017 clinical trial.  For example, approval fro m local health authori ties 
and/or IRBs/ECs will be obtained where required.  In the European Unio n (EU), requirements 
provi ded in Sect ion 11.54 of the EU Guideline on good manufacturing practice specific to 
advanced therapy  medicinal products will be followed. Any subject will need to provide consent 
prior to receiving the non -conforming JCAR017 product. Please refer to Secti on9for the details 
regarding analyses o f these subjects.
7.4.7. Overdose

Confident ial and Propri etary 94 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 20198.3. Required Concomitant Medications and Procedures
To minimize the risk of infusion react ions, all subjects should be premedicated with 
acetaminophen and diphenhydr amine prior to JCAR017 infusio n (see Secti on7.4.3 ).
Supportive care for the management of CRS is detailed in Appendix L.In so me cases, 
tocilizumab, an ant i-IL-6R-antibody , may be required to treat toxicit ies such as CRS. Please refer 
to the currently approved Actemra®/ RoActemra® package insert. As per label,up to 4 doses of 
tocilizumab can be given for treatment of CRS. T he recommendat ion is to fo llow the local 
labeled guidance. However, for JCAR017 investigator s, it is important to understand that the 
JCAR017 Management Guidelines for Cy tokine Rel ease Syndr ome and Neurotoxi city and the 
recommended use of tocilizumab is different from the CRS management algorithms of the 
approved CAR Ts. Hence, Celgene requires that all JCAR017 global sites (eg, US, EU, Japan) 
must have at least 2 doses of tocilizumab availab le pri or to i nfusi on per a given patient and to 
resupply in case tocilizumab is given. The preferred dose to intervene in subjects with CRS is 8 
mg/kg. Another anti -IL-6 agent , if available in the country , shoul d be considered in the event of 
sCRS not resp onding to tocilizumab . Dosing of any other ant i-IL-6 agent should be per 
prescribing information.
In some cases, steroi ds (eg, dexamethasone )may also be given for the treatment of CRS or NT .

Confident ial and Propri etary 95 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 20199. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
9.1. Overview
This is a global randomized mul ticenter phase 3 trial evaluat ing the efficacy and safet y of 
JCAR017 versus SOC in subjects with high- risk, second- line, transplant -eligible 
relapse/refractory  aggressive B -cells NHL.
The primary  object ive is to demonstrate that subjects trea ted wi th JCAR017 have a larger benefit 
on E FS than subjects treated with SOC salvage strategies. Key secondary object ives are to 
demonstrate hi erarchically  addi tional efficacy benefit on CRR, PFS and OS.
The ORCHARRD trial ( van Imho ff, 2016 ) reports a m edian PFS (wi th failure to achi eve a 
response after 2 cy cles included as an event) in the overall populat ion of approximately 3 
months, with a median OS of approximately 13.5 mo nths, with significant ly shorter PFS and OS 
in high risk subjects of approximately  2 months medi an PFS and 11 m onths median OS. Event -
free survival at 2 y ears for the R -DHAP and O -DHAP arms were 18% and 16%, respectively.
Date of rando mizat ion will be defined as Day 1. Baseline value will be defined as the last val ue 
onthe rando mizat ion date (+3 day s)or before the date /time of rando mization (date if date/ time 
not collected). If mult iple values of the same variable are eligible for the baseline, the average of 
these values will be used as the baseline. For subject swho are not randomized, the baseline will 
be the last available value. For subjects crossing over to receive JCAR017 , secondary  baseline is 
defined as the last value on or before the date /time of start of LD chemotherapy (date if date /time 
not col lected).

9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
Sample size calculat ion, robustness and sensit ivity
is based on EAST 6.3 software (Cy tel Inc.).
9.3.1. Sample Size Calculation
It is hypothesi zed that subj ects treated wi th SOC have median EFS of 3 months. Subjects 
receiving experimental treatment JCAR017 are expected to have an increase of ~81% in the 
median EFS (equivalent to a hazard ratio of 0.55 under the exponent ial distribut ion assumption )

5.455months.
An interim analysis for superiority  of JCAR017 over SOC on EFS will be performed at 60% 
inform ation time (approximately 71 EFS events) . O’Brien -Flemin g boundary  alpha spending 
funct ion is used.
Given these assumpt ions, using a log rank test with 2.5% one -sided significance level, 1 19
EFS 
events will provide at least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of HR greater than or equal  
to 1.
The null hypo thesis will be rejected if the p -value associated to the test is smaller than or equal to 
0.004 at the time of the interim analysis for efficacy (ie, when 71 EFS events are observed) or 
smaller than or equal to 0.024 at the time o f the primary  efficacy ana lysis (ie., when 119 EFS 
events are observed). The significance thresho lds will be adjusted based on the actual number of 
EFS events observed at the time of each efficacy analysis in order to ensure the no minal 
significance l evel is maintained.
Given an expected randomizat ionrateof up to 12 subjects per month (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 subjects 
rando mized during 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th month and 12 subjects per months after 6th month) and 
a 20% drop out rate before first response assessment and a y early  dropout rate of 10% (30% 
cumulative), a sam ple size of 182subjects i s expected to be randomized and 215subjects to be 
screened (screen failure rate of 15%). The est imated accrual duration is 17.6 months , which i s 
the midpo int between the est imated minimal accrual time (15.1 mon t
hs)and the suggested 
maximu m(20 m onths) ;minimal and suggested maximum accrual t imes are estimated by the 
sample size software and are based on the assumptio ns described above . Interim  analysis for 
efficacy  is expected to be performed at around 14.7 months after study  start and final analysis at 
around 21.4 months after study  start. The approximated time for the interim analysis for efficacy 
and for the final analysis are based on the assumptions for alpha, power, HR (or improvement in 
median survival), interim looks, accrual models and drop- out rates and are estimated by  the 
sample size software .  
If null hypothesis of HR equal to 1 is rejected for EFS , hypothesis testing on CRR (and 
subsequent ly on PFS and OS) willbe perform ed hierarchi cally ; the h ierarchical test ing strategy 
is used in order to control the overall t ype I error rate. If the null hypothesis can be rejected for 
the primary  endpoint but at l east one null hypothesis for key  secondary  endpoint cannot be 
rejected at the interi m analysis for efficacy , then hypothesis testing on all key secondary  
endpo ints will be re -evaluated at the primary  efficacy  analysis (Glimm , 2010). 
Considered independently, performed at the sam e time of the primary  efficacy analysis and wi th 
the same randomizat ionand dropout model, expected power will be respect ively over 98% for 
CRR assuming a rate of 22% in Arm A and 51% in Arm B, over 96% for PFS assuming a 
median of 3 months in Arm A and6 months in Arm B (HR =0.5), an d approximat ively 37% for 
OSassuming a rate at 2 y ears of 41% in Arm A and 56% in Arm B (HR =0.65) .
In addit ion, an interim analysis for futilit y will be conducted when ~30 evaluable subjects (~15 
subjects per arm and having received their assigned treat ment) have their 9 weeks response 
assessment (after 3 cy cles of SOC for Arm  A and 5 weeks after the JCAR017 infusio n) or have 
been confirmed wit h disease progression prior to this t imepo int. No formal statistical test will be

9.3.2. Sample Size Robustness and Sensitivity
The robustness and the sensit ivity of the proposed sample size has been evaluated under several 
condi tionsvia simulations .Power extracted out of the simulat ions were rounded up to the next 
integer. Please note that number of subjects randomized is set to 182 and that maximum number 
of EFS events at primary  efficacy analysis is set to 119.
If the HR is below the expected value and median EFS in Arm A isset to 3 months , power at the 
primary  efficacy  analysis is above 90% (seeTable 6). If the HR is above the expected val ue but 
on or bel ow 0.6 and median EFS in Arm A isset to 3 months , power at the primary efficacy 
analysis is at an acceptable level (seeTable 6).If expected HR is strict ly above 0.6 with median 
EFS in Arm A set to 3 months, power at the primary  efficacy analysis ( ie, when 182 subjects are 
rando mized and 119 events are observed) is below acceptable levels, indicating that the number 
of EFS events tr iggering the primary efficacy analysis is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis 
with a high likelihood.
When EFS events are not distributed according to an exponent ia
l distribut ion but according to a 
Weibull distribut ion (wi th shape parameter set at t he same value in Arm A and Arm B, ensuring 
proporti onal hazard assumpt ion is maintained ), targeting the same abso lute clinical benefit 
(median EFS at 3 months in Arm A and median EFS at 5.455 months in Arm B) underpowered 
and overpowered situations may occur . In case the shape parameter is above 1 (indicating that 
hazards in both arms are increasing with time but with constant hazard ratio ), HR is below the 
expected value and power at the primary  efficacy  analysis is above 90% (see Table 7). In case 
the shape parameter is below 1 (indicat ing that hazards in both arms are decreasing wit h time but 
with hazard rati o constant), power is at an acceptable level as long as shape param eter is strictly
above 0.75 (see Table 7).

rando mized for study  treatm ent but not able to successfully  generate a JCAR017 cell product, 
along wi th the reason(s) for m anufacturing failure, will be summarized.
9.6. Efficacy Anal ysis
Primary analysis will be based on the ITT analysis set . Per- protocol and safet y analysis set will 
be used for supportive analyses when required.
For time -to-event endpo ints such as EFS, PFS , DOR, and OS, the K -M product limit method will 
be used to extract summary  information about survivorship. At least m edians together with two-
sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported and it will be calculated and extracted from K- M 
curves.
In addit ion, the event rates at specific time -points will  be com puted, al ong wi th the standard 
errors and associated two- side 95% confidence intervals (Greenwood’s form ula; Klein, 1997 ).
The rank preserving s tructural  failure t ime (RPSFT) ,theinverse probabilit yofcensoring 
weighting(IPCW )and the 2- stage Weibull approaches , will  be considered for PFS and OS in 
order to adjust for cross over bias (Colleoni, 2011; Ishak, 2014; Jin, 2012; Korhonen, 2012; 
Motzer, 2010; Sternberg, 2013 ; Lat imer, 2014).

Confident ial and Propri etary 100 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 2019The RPSFT approach, relies on a simple model for survival t imes that assumes that the effect of 
treatm ent is m ultiplicat ive on time, that it conveys benefit immediately, and that the size of the 
benefit is the same regardless of whether subjects were randomized or crossed over to treatment 
(Ishak, 2014).
The IPCW approach reweights the influence of subjects who could have crossed over but did 
not, despite being otherwise similar to those who did cross over (i e, omi ts survival t ime after 
cross over fro m analyses by censoring subjects at the time o f the treatm ent swi tch). The m ethod 
usually relies on using t ime-dependent (and possibly  time-fixed) risk factors to determine 
subjects’ pr obabilit y of cross over which serve as weights. It assumes that there are sufficient 
numbers of subjects who did and did not cross over in all risk factor profiles where cross over 
occurred ( Ishak, 2014).
In the 2 -stage Weibul l approach, the EFS event can be used as a secondary  baseline and p atients 
in Arm A aretreated as an observat ional dataset. Treatment effect received by subjects in Arm A
who swi tched com pared subjects who did not switch willbe est imated by fitting a Wei bull 
model (excluding pat ients in Arm B) withcovari ates m easured at the secondary  baseline and a 
time- varying covariate indicating treatment switch fro m Arm A to JCAR017.
For binary  endpoints such as CRR and ORR, the frequency  distribut ion (n, %) will be provi ded 
as summary informat ion. The point estimate together with two -sided exact 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) will be provided. Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with stratificat ion factors 
as strata will be used for analysis and calculat ion of p -values .
9.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  endpoint is EFS, defined as the time from rando mizat ion to death due to any cause, 
PD, failure to achieve CR or PR by 9 weeks post -rando mizat ion, orstart of a new antineoplast ic
therapy due to efficacy concerns ,whichever occurs first.
Start of a new antineoplast ic therapy due to efficacy concerns will be based on invest igator’s 
assessment and related data will be co llected in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). Start of a 
new ant ineoplast ic therapy will be c aptured from  time of randomization to date of imaging (or 
other object ive finding) that serves as the basis of starting a new antineoplast ic therapy.
Primary r esponse assessment will be based on central assessment perform ed by  the IRC and 
supportive respon se assessment will be based on investigator assessment. Response assessment 
will be evaluated primarily per the Celgene Lugano Cl assificati on guidelines based on “The 
Lugano Classificat ion” (Cheson, 2014).
Event -free survival will be analyzed wi th a stratified Cox-PH m odel ifthe proporti onal hazards
assumpt ion hold(unstratified Cox -PH m odel as supporti ve analysis) . 
The stratificat ion factors to 
be used in the Cox -PH m odel correspond to the stratificat ion at the time of randomizat ion; in 
addition, the model will include treatm ent as the only  covari ate for analysis . If the proporti onal 
hazards assumpt ion is not fulfilled, piecewise Cox -PH m odel will be used. Details on the 
evaluat ion of HR assumpt ion and applicat ion of the Cox-PH m odel will be described in the 
statist ical analysis plan (SAP) .
Full set of censoring rules for EFS will be detailed in the SAP.

progression , start of new ant ineoplast ic therapy or death andwill be summarized 
using K -M est imates. In case a subject does not have PD , start of a new ant ineoplast ic 
therapy or death pri or to data cutoff date, DOR will be censored at the date of the last 
adequate response assessment.
Progression -free survival on the next line of treatment (PFS -2)is defined as time 
fromrandomization to objective tum or progressi on on next -line treatment or death 
from any cause. Subjects alive and for whom a second object ive disease progression 
has not been observed will be censored at the last time known to be alive and without 
second objective disease progression. Recurrent event approach based on a Prentice, 
Williams and Peterson model will be used for the analys is of PFS-2.
Subjects receiving HSCT up to 3 y ears post -randomizat ion will be summarized via 
counts and percents .Subjects receiving HSCT, response rates will be summarized at 
3 months post -HSCT.

9.7.3.1. Numeric Laboratory Results
Summaries of numeric laboratory  data will be based on central  assessment and will be reported 
using convent ional units for hem atological tests, serum  chemistry  tests and for other l aboratory  
tests including c oagul ation, inflammatory  markers andimmunogl obulins . Baseline, raw values, 
and changes from baseline will be summarized per arm  using descript ive statist ics for each 
laboratory  test specified in the study  protocol .
9.7.3.2. Graded Laboratory Values
Central laboratory  data will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Vers ion 4.03 (or higher)
severit y grade: mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), or life threatening (Grade 
4). Grade 0 includes all non -missing values that do not meet criteria for an abnormalit y of at least 
Grade 1. Summary data (count and perc ent) within each grade will be provi ded per arm. Cross -
tabul ation table of post -baseline grade and worst post baseline grade versus baseline grade will 
be provided for selected hem atology, serum  chemistry  and coagulation parameters per arm .
9.7.3.3. Summaries of La boratory Abnormalities
Laboratory  resul ts will be programmat ically classified asbelow normal range, within normal 
range and above normal range if the numeric laboratory  resul t is below the lower limit of normal 
range, within normal range or above the uppe r limit of normal range. Shift tables per treatment 
arm will be presented for selected hematol ogy, serum  chemistry  and coagul ation parameters 
showing change in results fro m the baseline value (below normal range, within normal range, 
and above normal range ) to each post- baseline visit and to the worst post -baseline value (below 
norm al range, wi thin norm al range, and above normal range) .
9.8. Interim Analysis
Two interim analyses , one f or futilit y and one for efficacy ,will be perform ed.In addit ion, the 
rateof EFS events will be monitored during the course of the study  at predefined timepo ints to 
potenti ally increase thesample size, if required. In order to prevent bias being introduced into the 
study  conduct and analyses , an independent and external statist ical group will be responsible f or
performing these interim analyses and monitoring of EFS events for sample size increase . A data 
safet y monitoring board (DSMB) will be responsible of reviewing such analyses and provide 
recommendat ion to the sponsor .
9.8.1.
Futility Interim Analysis
The purpose of the first interim analysis is to stop for fut ility in case of no efficacy signal on 
CRR at 9weeks after randomizat ion (after 3 cy cles of SOC for Arm A and 5 weeks after the 
JCAR017 infusio n)for JCAR017 treated subject compared to SOC. The fut ility interim analysis 
will be conducted when ~30 evaluable subjects (~15 subjects per arm and having received their 
assigned treatment) have their 9 weeks response assessment (after 3 cycles of SOC for Arm A 
and 5 weeks after the JCAR017 infusio n)or have been confi rmedwith disease progression prior 
to this timepo int. 
Screening and treatment will continue while this interim analysis is being

9.8.2. Efficacy Interim Analysis
A second interim analysis will be performed at 60% informat ion time ( ie, at around 71 EFS 
events). The purpose of this interim analysis is to demonstrate superiority of JCAR017 versus 
SOC on EFS . O’Brien -Fleming boundary are used for defining the efficacy boundaries. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if the p -value associated to the test i s smaller than or equal to 0.004 . 
Screening and rando mizat ionwill continue while this interim analysis is being conducted . In 
case of efficacy  dem onstrated on primary  endpoint, recrui tment of subjects will cont inue.
9.8.3. Monitoring of EFS Events and Sample Siz e Increase
Moni toring of EFS events will be performed in an aggregate manner during the study  course at 
predefined timepo int(at 100 subjects randomized and at the time of the efficacy interim 
analysis) . Predi ctive probabilit y of observing the required 119 EFS events or more at the 
expected pri mary  analysis (ie ,at around 21.4 months) will be co mputed at these predefined 
timepo int. In case this predict ive probabilit y is too low (below 50% at first monitoring and below 
80% at second monitoring of the EFS eve nts), then sample size will be increase dwith a limi t of 
up to 40 addit ional subjects (with a 1:1 rati o). 
Addit ional information on the estimat ion of the EFS probabilit y curve and com putati on of  the 
predi ctive distribut ion for the EFS events will be ment ioned in the SAP.
9.9. Other Topics
9.9.1. Randomization
Subjects will be rando mized at 1:1 ratio into one of the two arms: Arm A or Arm B. 
Randomization will be based on a permuted -blocks rando mizat ion method, wi th the f ollowing 
stratificat ion factors:
1.Best overall response to first -line therapy: refractory  (defined as SD, PD, PR or CR with 
relapse before 3 m onths) versus relapse (CR with relapse on or after lasting at least 3 
months);
2.Secondary  age adj usted Internati onal Prognosti c Index (sAAIPI): 0 or 1 versus 2 or 3.
9.9.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent data safet y monitoring board ( DSMB )will review cumulat ive study  data over 
the course of the study  to evaluate safet y, protocol  conduct, and scientific validit y and integri ty 
of the tri al. The DS MB, com posed of a stati stician and selected physicians wit h experience in

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any  noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury , or any  concomi tant impai rment of  the subject’s healt h, including 
laboratory  test val ues (as specified by  the cri teria in Secti on 10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any 
worsening (ie, any  clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensit y of a pre -
exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE.  
Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity or toxi city to an investi gational product shoul d be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or n ot it is associ ated wi th an AE should be
reported on the overdose CRF (seeSecti on7.4.7 for the definit ion of overdose) . Any sequela of 
an accidental  or intent ional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE 
on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an 
SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose result ing in the SA E shoul d be i dentified as 
the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported as an SAE 
itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary . Ther e is no known specific ant idote for JCAR017 , fludarabine 
and cyclophosphamide ( flu/cy)and SOC (R -DHAP, R -ICE, R- GDP) overdose. Actual treatment 
shoul d depend on the severit y of the clinical situat ion and the judgment and experience of the 
treating physici an.
All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study . Assessments m ay include m onitoring of 
any or all o f the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , pathol ogical , 
radiological  or surgical  findings, physical examination fi ndings, or findings fro m other tests 
and/or procedures.
Adverse events must be recorded as shown in Table 8. If they  meet the seri ousness cri teria, the y 
will be reported to Drug Safet y as provided in Secti on10.5.

A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF rather than the 
individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndro me.
ForCRS and neurotoxicit y reporting requirements in the CRF , please refer to the CRF 
completion gui delines (CCGs ).
Any medical condit ion already  present pri or to randomizat ionshoul d not be reported as an AE 
unless the medical condit ion is related to any  study procedure and increases in severit y. In this 
case, i t shoul d be reported as an AE and indicated as a worsening event.
Inpat ient or ICU stays, while anticipated, are not scheduled protocol -defined visits. In addit ion, 
inpat ient or ICU adm issions can generate large amounts of clinical data (eg, mult iple 
concomitant medicat ions, frequent concomitant medicat ion dose changes, laboratory  values, and 
vital sign assessments). Therefore, targeted collect ion of data fro m inpat ient or ICU stay s, as 
well as a separate CRF for detailing specific adverse events of special interest (AESI; ie, signs 
and symptoms of CRS and neurotoxicit y), will be utilized for the purpose of adequately 
describing the expected risks of JCAR017 and the recommendat ions for managing these risks.
AEs and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF and in the subject ’s source 
docum ents. All SAEs meeting the criteria described in Table 8must be reported to Celgene Drug 
Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by  facsimile, or other 
appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (i e, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on 
(hospi talizat ion is defined as an inpatient admissio n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupti on of  the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life-
threatening or resu lt in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.

relationship to LD chemotherapy, JCAR017 and SOC/HDCT and HSCT , acti on taken regarding 
LD ch emotherapy , JCAR017 and SOC/HDCT and HSCT , and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y/ intensity of the event. CRS 
must be graded using the modified CRS grading scale ( Appendix L).
The severit y/intensity of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor versio n of the Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE, 
Version 4. 03or higher); 
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severit y/intensity according to 
the following scale:

Confident ial and Propri etary 112 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 2019Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical  
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may  be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervent ion/therapy  required
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy requi red, hospi talizati on is possible
Grade 4 =Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activit y, significant assistance 
requi red; significant medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi talizat ion or hospice 
care probable
Grade 5 =Death -the event res ults in death
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This c riterion is notthe sam e as “serious” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration of the LD 
chemotherapy, JCAR017 or the SOC regimen and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not 
Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic 
intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provi de a sufficient 
explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the admi nistrati on of  IP 
caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the IP and 
the adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SAE based on currently available 
information. Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provi de the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.

Confident ial and Propri etary 113 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 201910.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, di scont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if 
concomitant and/or addit ional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
SAEs will be fo llowed until they  return to baseline, the event stabilizes or is no longer 
considered clinically significant by  the Invest igator; the subject dies or withdraws consent; or 
study  closure.
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnor mal laboratory  value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervent ion(including transfusio ns or growth factors) ; or
isjudged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbat ion or worsening of an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a se riousness cri terion 
need to be document ed as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. If the abnormalit y was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndro me, then the laboratory abnormalit y shoul d be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies andsuspecte d pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or posit ive pregnancy test)
occurring at any  time after recei pt of lymphodepl eting chem otherapy ,infusion o f JCAR017 or 
SOC/HDCT in either a female subject of childbearing potential or a female partner of a male 
subje ct are immediately  reportable events . The pregnancy , suspected pregnancy , or posi tive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y immediately by email, phone or 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.  
10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
The Investigator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy and afterwards 
up to 1 year of the newborn baby , and must notify  Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  about the 
outcome of the pregnancy  (either norm al or abnormal  outcom e) using the Pregnancy Fo llow-up

criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge o f the event using the SAE Report 
Form , or ap proved equivalent form .
All neonatal  deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causalit y, as SAEs. In addi tion, any  infant death after 28 day s that the Invest igator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the I P should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y by 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form .
10.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP 
shoul d notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healt hcare provider immediately .The pregnant partner will be asked for consent for fo llow-up by  
the Invest igator until completion of the pregnancy and afterwards up to 1 year of the newborn 
baby.
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the complet ion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours of the Invest igator ’s knowledge of the event by  facsimile, 
or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form. This instruction pertains to init ial SAE reports as well as any  follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the dat a on these forms is accurate and consistent. This 
requi rement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relatio nship to LD chemotherapy or JCAR017 or 
SOC/HDCT and HSCT ) recorded in the CRF as described in Sect ion 10.1.
The SAE report should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi tal records and other relevant documents. If a subject died and an autopsy  has been 
perfor med, copies of the autopsy  report and death certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these beco me available. Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Sa fety.  
Progressive disease is considered as a study  endpo int and will not be reported as a serious 
adverse event (SAE). However, any sign, symptom, or manifestation of progressive disease that 
meet any  of the seri ousness cri teria will be reported as indiv idual SAE.
Where required by  local legislat ion, the Invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional 
Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant 
initial and fo llow-up informati on about the event. The In vestigator m ust keep copi es of  all SAE

10.6. Potential Risks and Management of Treatment Toxicities
A summary  of potenti al risks and m anagement of treatment toxicity is provi ded bel owfor the IP . 
See respective IB for a complete discussio n of potent ial risks associated with JCAR017.
10.6.1. Management of Toxicities Associated with JCAR017
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicit ies (NT) are associated wi th CAR T -cell 
therapi es.Celgene has developed specific toxicit y management guidelines (TMG) for CRS and 
NT associated with Celgene cellular products based on current clinical experience across the 
clinical development programs ( Appendix L). These recommendat ions are based on the CRS 
revised grading system ( Lee, 2014 ) and the Common T ermino logyCriteria f or Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide management in this trial. 
If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and NT grading according to the 
American Societ y for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System  (Lee, 2019 ) shoul d also be recorded in the eCRF to inform future modifications of the 
management guidelines.
10.6.1.1. Cytokine Release Syndrome
Administrati on of  JCAR017 i s associ ated wi th cytokine rel ease syndrom e (CRS ). Cytokine 
release syndrom e is characteri zed by  high f ever, fati gue, nausea, headache, dy spnea, tachy cardia, 
rigors, hy potensi on, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptoms and severit y 
of CRS are highly variable (Lee,
2014) , and management can be complicated by concurrent 
condi tions. Wit h JCAR017, CRS usually occurs wit hin two weeks after infusio n
(Abramson, 
2017b ).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥38.5°C or ≥101.3 °F), is a commo nly-observed hallmark 
of CRS, and m any features of CRS mimic infect ion. Hence, infection must be considered 
in all subjects present ing with CRS symptoms and appropriate cultures must be obtained 
and empiric ant ibiotic therapy init iated per institution standard of care .
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t 
respi ratory  distress syndrome, renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopathies, disseminated 
intravascular coagulat ion, and capillary  leak syndrom e.

Confident ial and Propri etary 116 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 2019Neurol ogical toxicity has been observed concurrently  with CRS.
With other CAR T cell products, CRS has been reported in a few cases to be associated 
with findings of macrophage act ivation syndrome/ hemophagocy ticlymphohist iocytosis 
(MAS/HLH), and the ph ysiology of the syndro mes may  overlap. 
Please refer to Appendix Lfor detailed descript ion of CRS, grading and treatment 
recommendat ions.Note: Cetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of CRS.
10.6.1.2. Fever
The possibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects with fever ( ≥38°C or ≥ 100.4°F ) 
following JCAR017 treatment. Subjects should be mo nitored cl osely  for hem odynamic 
instabilit y and chang ing neuro logic status. Febrile subjects, neutropenic or otherwise, should be 
evaluated promptly for infection and managed per inst itutional or standard clinical pract ice.
10.6.1.3. Neurologic Toxicities
CAR T cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicities. Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activit y. With JCAR017, to date, the start of neurologic symptoms has been noted between 3 to 
23 day s (median 10 days) (Abramson, 2017b ) after CAR T cell infusio n and in severe cases may 
requi re admissio n to the intensive care unit (ICU) for frequent monitoring, respiratory  support, or 
intubation for airway protecti on. The symptom s are variabl e generally occur as CRS is resolving 
or after CRS resolut ion.
Please refer toAppendix Lfordetailed descript ion of neurologic toxicit ies, grading and 
treatm ent recommendat ions.Note: Cetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of neuro logic 
toxicities.
10.6.1.4. Macrophage Activation Syndrome
Macrophage activation syndro me (MAS) is a serious disorder potentially associated with 
uncontrolled activation and pr oliferation of CAR T cells and subsequent activat ion of 
macrophages. MAS is ty pically characteri zed by  high -grade, non -remitt ing fever, cy topeni as, 
and hepatospleno megaly. Laboratory  abnorm alities found in MAS include elevated 
inflammatory  cytokine l evels, serum  ferritin, so luble IL -2 receptor (sCD25), triglycerides, and 
decreased circulat ing NK cells. Other findings include variable levels o f transaminases, signs of 
acute liver failure, coagulopathy , and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy . There are n o 
definit ive diagnostic criteria for MAS; it is t ypically diagnosed using published criteria for 
hemophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis ( Schulert, 2015). While there is considerable overlap in 
clinical manifestations and laborator y findings between MAS and CRS, other distinguishing 
MAS physical findings such as hepatospleno megaly and lymphadenopathy  are not comm on in 
adult subjects treated wi th activated T cell therapies.
Subjects treated with JCAR017 should be monitored for MAS, a nd cy tokine -directed therapy  
shoul d be considered as clinically  indicated.

Confident ial and Propri etary 117 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 201910.6.1.5. Infusion Reactions
Administrati on of  JCAR017 m ay cause infusio n reactions, such as fever, rigors, rash, urticaria, 
dyspnea, hypotension, and/or nausea.
To minimize the risk of infus ion react ions, all subjects should be pre -medicated wi th 
acetaminophen and diphenhydramine (see Secti on7.4.3 ). Mild infusio n react ions should be 
managed expectantly wit h ant ipyretics, antihistamines, and anti -emet ics. Corti costeroi ds shoul d 
be avo ided because of the potential impact on efficacy o f infused JCAR017 cells. Rigors may be 
treated with meperidine.
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for infusio n reactions:
Grade 1: administer symptomat ic treatment; continue JCAR017 administration of 
both CD8+ and CD4+ components at the same dose an d rate
Grade 2: stop administration of JCAR017; administer symptomatic treatment, and 
resum e JCAR017 administration of both CD8+ and CD4+ components at a reduced 
rate of administration only  after symptom s reso lution
Grade 3: stop administration of JCAR017 , administer symptomatic treatment, and 
resum e at a reduced rate of administration only  after symptom s reso lve. If Grade 3 
reacti on recurs, discontinue JCAR017 administration; no further CD8+ or CD4+ 
components of JCAR017 should be administered
Grade 4: di scontinue administration of JCAR017 and administer symptomat ic 
treatm ent as necessary; no further CD8+ or CD4+ components of JCAR017 should be 
administered
10.6.1.6. Tumor Lysis Syndrome
Both lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy and JCAR017 may cause tumor lysis syndro me (T LS) in 
subjects wi th high disease burden. Subjects should be closely  monitored f or laboratory  evidence 
of TLS (hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia ) (see
Appendix E), and subjects at high risk for developing TLS, such as those with high disease 
burden and high cell turnover, shoul d receive prophylact ic treatment including administration of 
allopurino l and hydrati on,per sta ndard clinical practice. 
10.6.1.7. B-cell Aplasia
B-cell aplasia is an expected potential o ff-tumor, on -target toxi city. Prol onged B -cell aplasia has 
been observed in other CD19- directed CAR T cell programs ( Davila, 2013 ;Grupp, 2013 ).Serum 
immunogl obulin levels will be obtained fro m all subjects prior to and at various time points 
following JCAR017 treatment. Hy pogammagl obulinemic subjects (serum immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) < 500 mg/dL) should be considered for intravenous immunoglobulin r eplacement therapy  
per institutional guidelines.
10.6.1.8. Uncontrolled T Cell Proliferation
JCAR017 T cells could theoretically proliferate out of control. If uncontrolled JCAR017 T cell 
proliferat ion occurs, subjects may be treated with high dose steroi ds (eg, m ethylpredniso lone 1 to 
3
g/day , tapered over 7 days ) or lymphodepl eting doses of cyclophosphamide (1 to 3 g/m2IV). If

expressing CAR T cells in vivo ( Wang, 2011 ). Current ly, there is no data available on use of 
cetuximab or other EGFR -directed ant ibodies for deplet ion of JCAR017 CAR T cell s in humans.
10.6.1.9. Replication -Competent Lentivirus, Clonality and Insertional Oncogenesis
Lentiviral vectors used in gene transfer are engineered to be replicat ion-defect ive; however, 
generat ion of replication -competent lent iviruses (RCLs) during manufacturing is still a 
possibilit y. Modern vector production systems have been improved to reduce the risk of RCL 
generat ion. To date, there have been no reports of RCL generated during lentiviral vector 
manufacturing, which may be due, at least in part, to the use of self-inact ivating vectors such as 
the lentiviral vector used in the production of JCAR017 ( Rothe, 2013 ). 
Concerns for possible vector integration into the host genome have arisen due to preclinical 
studi es that have shown re trovi rus-mediated malignant transformat ion in mice ( Li, 2002; 
Modlich, 2005) and m onkeys ( Donahue, 1992 ), and a single clinical study  reporting 
development of leukemia in subjects with X- linked se vere co mbined immunodeficienc y who 
received retroviral- modified CD34+ hematopoi etic stem  cells ( Hacein -Bey-Abina, 2003), 
including one subject who died ( Couzin, 2005). Of note, no instances of RCL generat ion during 
producti on or l entivirus -mediated malignant transformation in animals or subjects have been 
reported to date. 
Data has recent ly been published on the integration sites o f retroviral and lent iviral vectors used 
for T cell modificat ion inclinical tri als (Wang, 2009; Scho ller, 2012; McGarri ty, 2013 ). No 
clonali ty of integrati on si tes was observed. In addi tion, there di d not appear to be enrichment of 
integrat ion sites near genes invo lved in clo nal expansio n orpersistence. 
10.6.1.10. Cytopenias
Severe cy topenias, including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topeni a, can occur 
with both JCAR017 and lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy , and delayed recovery  has been 
observed. Co mplete blood counts should be monit ored af ter JCAR017 infusio n unt il count 
recovery . Inst itutional guidelines shoul d be f ollowed in the event of Grade ≥ 3 cy topeni as.
10.6.1.11. Infections
Life-threatening and fatal infect ions have been observed. Severe infect ions m ay include 
bacteri al, fungal  (including pneumocystis jirovecii), and viral infections (eg, CMV, HBV, 
respi ratory  viruses, and other viruses). A high index of suspicion is warranted in the event of 
prolonged or recurrent cy topenias, especially  in conjunct ion with hypogammagl obuline mia, 
severe lymphopenia, and/or recent use of corticosteroids. Viral reactivation and other serious 
opportunist ic infect ions should be considered in these settings, and prophylactic, pre -empt ive, or 
symptom atic treatment with antimicrobial, ant ifungal, ant i-pneum ocyst ic, and/or antiviral 
therapi es shoul d be considered per l ocal institutional guidelines.
10.6.2. Risks Associated with Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy

T cell sequence, where applicable (refer to Section 6.3.6 ).
10.7. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting, Cel gene Drug Safet y will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to JCAR017 based on the Invest igator Brochure.
In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance wit h 21 CFR 312.32.
For countri es wi thin the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory  Authori ties and Ethi cs 
Committees concerne d, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) in accordance 
with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verificat ion and 
presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on invest igational products f or

10.8. Adverse Event sof Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scient ific and medical interest specific to
understanding of the Invest igational Product and may require close mo nitoring and rapid
communicat ion by the I nvest igator to the S ponsor. An AESI may be serious or nonserious. The
rapid reporti ng of AESIs all ows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and

All aspects of the study  will be carefully mo nitored by  Celgene or i ts authori zed representative 
for com pliance wi th applicable government regulatio ns wit h respect to current GCP and SOPs .
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedur es are performed before, during and after 
the study . All aspects of the study  are reviewed wit h the Invest igator and the staff at a study  
initiation visit and/or at an Invest igators’ Meeting. Prior to screening subjects into the study , a 
Celgene representa tive will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Invest igator. Monitoring will 
include on -site visi ts with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any  appropri ate 
commu nicat ions by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During monitoring visits, the facilit ies, 
investigat ional product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study  
docum entati on will be inspected/reviewed by  the Cel gene representati ve in acc ordance wi th the 
Study  Moni toring Pl an.
Accuracy  will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a di rect com parison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any result ing 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investi gator and/or his/her staff. Any  necessary  
correcti ons will be made direct ly to the CRFs or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion 
criteria and docum entati on of  SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Addit ional 
monitoring act ivities may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addit ion to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Pract ice Qual ity Assurance 
unit exists wit hin Celgene. Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activit ies in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is re quired to permi t direct access to the facilit ies where the study  took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study  subject parti cipat ion for 
audits and inspect ions by IRB/ ECs, regul atory  authori ties (e g,FDA, EMA, Healt h Canada) and 
company authorized representatives. The Investigator should make every  effort to be available 
for the audi ts and/or inspect ions. If the Invest igator is contacted by any regulatory  authori ty 
regarding an inspect ion, he/she should contact Celgene immedi ately .
15.3. Product Quality Complaint

It is recognized that in Waldeyer's ring or

or with activation within spleen or marrow (eg, 
with chemotherapy or myeloid colony -

aA score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especiall y if at the time of an 
interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where deescalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider 
a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment). For the purpose of this trial, while score 3 might 
represent an early response 1 or 3 months after JCAR017 infusion , it likely reflects remaining active disease at 
later time points. 
Measured dominant lesions: Up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected 
to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and 
should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include those in solid 
organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. 
Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should 
be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and ex tranodal sites not selected as 
dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, 
as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow 
quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring or in 
extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with 
complete metabolic response, but should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with 
marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).
bPET 5PS: 1, no uptake above background; 2, uptake ≤ mediastinum; 3, uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 4, 
uptake moderately > liver; 5, uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions; X, new areas of uptake 
unlikely  to be related to lymphoma.

Confident ial and Propri etary 167 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 2019APPENDIX L.JCAR017 MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR 
CYTOKINE RELEASE SYN DROME AND NEUROLOGIC
TOXICITIES (V3.2)
1.MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITIES ASSOCIATED WITH JCAR017
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicit ies (NT) are associated with chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. Celgene has developed the toxicit y management 
guidelines (TMG) for CRS and NT associated with Celgene cellular products based on current 
clinical experience across the clinical development programs. These recommendat ions are based 
on the CRS revised grading system  ( Lee, 2014 ) and the Commo n Toxi city Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide management in this 
trial. 
If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and NT grading according to the 
American Societ y forTransplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System   (Lee, 2019 ) should also be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) to inform 
future m
odificati ons of  the m anagement gui delines.
2.CYTOKINE RE LEASE SYNDROME
Administrati on of cellular products such as chime ric antigen receptor (CAR) -expressing T cells 
can be associ ated with cytokine -associ ated toxicity  due to systemic producti on and release of 
various cytokines into the circulat ion. Cytokine -associated toxicity, also known as cytokine release 
syndro me (CRS), is a toxicity that occurs as a result of immune activat ion (Lee, 2014; Gardner ,
2017). 
2.1. Pathophysiology of Cytokine Release Syndrome
The hallmark of CRS is immune act ivation result ing in elevated inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine 
release syndrome clinically manifests when large numbers of lymphocytes (B -cells, T cells, and/or 
natural  killer cells) and/or myelo id cells (macrophages, dendrit ic cells, and monocy tes) beco me 
activated and release inflammatory  cytokines. Cytokine release syndrome has classically been 
associ ated with therapeut ic monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusio ns, most notably anti
-CD3 
(OKT3), anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab), anti-CD20 (rituximab), and the CD28 super -agonist, 
TGN1412. Cy tokine rel ease syndrom e is also frequent ly observed fo llowing administration of bi-
specific T cell engaging antibodies for leukemia, and adoptive cellular immunotherapies for 
cancer, most notably CAR T cells. Incidence, time to on set and severit y of CRS due to CAR T 
cells is at least partially dependent on the infused cell dose and tumor burden/ant igen densit y, 
presum ably due to more rapid and higher levels of CAR T cell act ivation. Onset of CRS symptoms 
typically  occurs days to occasi onally  weeks after the CAR T cell infusio n, usually preceding 
maximal in vivo T cell expansi on. Cytokine release syndrome is associ ated with elevated 
interferon gamma (IFN -γ), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF -α) levels, and 
increa ses in IL -2, granulocy te macrophage –colony-stimulating factor (GM -CSF), IL -10, IL -8, IL -
5, and fractalkine although the pattern of elevated cy tokines varies among subjects ( Davila, 2014; 
Hay, 2017 ). IL-6 has been ident ified a s a central mediator of toxicit y in CRS. IL -6 is a pleiotropic 
cytokine with anti-inflammatory  and proinflammatory  properties. High levels of IL-6, present in 
the context of CRS, likely  initiates a proinflammatory  IL-6-mediated si gnaling cascade.

Confident ial and Propri etary 168 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 20192.2. Clinical Presentation of Cytokine Release Syndrome
Cytokine release syndro me is characterized by high fever, fatigue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, 
tachy cardi a, rigors, hypotension, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptoms 
and severi ty of CRS are highly variable (Lee, 2014 ), and management can be complicated by 
concurrent condit ions.In non
-Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) subjects treated with JCAR017, CRS 
usually occurs within two weeks after infusio n (Abram son, 2017 ).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥38.5°C or ≥101.3 °F), is a commo nly-observed 
hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infect ion must 
be considered in all subjects presenting wit h CRS symptoms and appropriate cul tures 
must be obtained and empiric ant ibiotic therapy initiated per inst itution standard of 
care
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t 
respi ratory  distress syndrome, renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopa thies, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and capillary  leak syndrom e. 
Neurol ogic toxi city has been observed concurrent ly with CRS; refer to Secti on2.
CRS has been reported in somecases to be associated with findings of macrophage 
activat ion syndro me(MAS)/ hemophagocy ticlymphohist iocytosis (HLH), and the 
physio logy of  the syndromes may  overlap ; refer to Secti on 3. 
2.3. Clinical Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome
Across various CD19 CAR T cell  products, early  manifestati ons of  CRS can predict m ore severe 
toxicity for both CRS and NT. 
Subjects wi th B-cell acute lymphoblast ic leukemia (ALL) and high burden of disease are at high 
risk of developing CRS (Frey, 2017). Subjects with NHL who have high baseline tumor burden 
(measured by the sum of product of the perpendicular diameters [SPD]or high serum  lactate 
dehydrogenase [
(LDH ) ≥ 500 U/L] prior to the start of  lymphodepl etion)also have a higher risk 
for developing CRS and/or neurotoxicit y (Siddiqi , 2017 ).
High baseline levels of other comm only measured inflammatory markers, such as ferritin and C -
reactive protein (CRP), were also associated with CRS. 
It should be noted that , although useful for ident ifying subjects at higher risk for developing CRS, 
CRP, ferritin, and serum  cytokine levels shoul d not be used for CRS clinical 
management/treatment decisio ns in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms of CRS; for 
exampl e, a subject with an elevated CRP but no concomitant symptom s may not requi re 
intervent ion (Park, 2017 ). Thus, close observation of these subjects is strongly reco mmended.
A modificat ion of the CTCAE CRS grading scale has been established to better reflect CAR T 
cell-associ ated CRS, as detailed in Table 1 (Lee, 2014 ).

LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS
Macrophage activation syndro me (MAS) or HLH is a rare, potentially fatal immune -mediated 
disease, which is caused by impaired natural killer and cytotoxic T cell funct ion. This syndro me 
has a wi de range of causes, symptoms, and outcomes, but all lead to a hy perin ﬂammatory  
response (with so me characterist ics that overlap with CRS and organ damage ( Ramos-Casals,
2014 ). Cases of MAS/HLH have been described in patients treated with CAR T cell 
therapi es(Neelapu, 201 7). 
3.1.Pathophysiology of M acrophage Activation Syndrome/Hemopha gocytic 
Lymphohistiocytosis
Macrophage activation syndro me/hemophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis is divided into primary  
(genet ic) and secondary (react ive) forms. Secondary MAS/HLH is subclassi ﬁed as vi ral, 
autoimmune, or tumor related. MAS/ HLH has both infe ctious and non -infect ious tri ggers 
(Ramos-Casals, 2014). Viral infect ion is the most frequent trigger, either due to primary 
infect ion or after reactivation in immunosuppressed patients. Bacterial and fungal infections can 
also tri gger MAS/HLH. Macrophage activat ion like syndro me (MALS) is a dist inct entit y that 
leads to early  death in sept ic patients and must be carefully ruled out in patients who are prone to 
develop severe infect ions, including patients fo llowing CAR T cell therapy  (Karakike, 2019
). 
Patients wi th hematol ogical malignancies, in part icular lympho ma, have a higher risk of 
developing MAS/HLH.
3.2. Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis of M acroph age Activation 
Syndrome/Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis
The presentation of secondary MAS/HLH is heterogeneous and characterized by  a panoply of 
clinical signs and symptoms. The clinical syndro me can be acute or subacute with non -specific 
symptoms appea ring over few days to 4 week(s) ( Ramos-Casals, 2014). The cardinal features are 
continuous high fever ( ≥38.5 °C) and enlarged lymphohematopoiet ic organs 
(spleno/hepatom egaly, occasi onally acco mpanied by adenopathy ). Pulmo nary, neurol ogic, 
cutaneous and gastrointestinal invo lvement may  also be present.
Laboratory  markers associated with MAS/HLH include pancy topenia, hyperferri tinemia, 
hypo ﬁbrinogenemia and raised D -dimer levels, hypertriglyceridemia, and abnormalit ies in liver
funct ion. 
Detection of any ongo ing infect ion acting as a trigger for MAS/HLH is crit ical ( Figure 1
). 
Standard tests should be used to screen for infect ions caused by the most commo n viruses such 
as herpes, cy tomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein -Barr vi rus (EBV). Other infect ious agents (eg, 
mycobacteria, parasites, and fungi, particularly Candida and Mucor) should be ruled out 
according to speci ﬁc clinical or epidemio logical features ( Ramos -Casals, 2014; Lehmberg, 
2015).
Bone m arrow i s the preferred anatomical site for investigation o f suspected MAS/HLH. Bone 
marrow aspirate can be negat ive at the init ial stage of MAS/HLH and should be repeated during 
the clinical course if there is a high suspicio n of MAS/HLH.

criteria below is fulfilled: 
1.A molecular diagnosis consistent with MAS/HLH 
2.Diagnostic cri teria for MAS/HLH fulfilled (five out of the eight criteria below):

3.3. Clinical Management of Macrophage Activation Syndrome/Hemophagocytic 
Lymphohistiocytosis
Effect ive treatment of MAS/HLH requires mult iple simultaneous approaches ( Ramos-Casals,
2014, Lehmberg, 2015 ).
1.Supportive care is essent ia
l because of frequent life -threatening severe manifestations at 
presentation. 
2.The eliminat ion of tri ggers (parti cularly  infect ion) is crucial to rem ove the stimuli  that 
initiate the abnormal immune system act ivation. Appropriate broad- spectrum ant iviral, 
antibacterial, ant ifungal prophylaxis and treatment must be init iated. 
3.Suppression o f the inﬂammatory  response and cell proliferat ion by i mmunosuppressive 
and cy totoxi c drugs, respectively , is necessary . First line treatm ent includes IL -6-
blockade wit h tocilizumab. Glucocortico ids are al so indicated for the init ial treatm ent of 
MAS/HLH, irrespect ive of the cause (CRS Grade 4 treatment recomm endat ions should 
be followed). IL -1 blockade wi th anakinra is suggested as second line treatment or in 
case of rapidly progressing clinical course. A nti
-IL-6 antibody siltuximab might be 
considered as well as second line therapy . The use of cycl osporin, cy clophosphamide, 
etoposide and/or intrathecal methotrexate is not generally  indicated in patients who 
develop MAS/HLH after CAR T cell therapy, but may have to be emplo yed in refractory  
cases. 
Newer em erging treatm ents include emapalumab (ant i IFN-gamma an tibody ), which has 
been approved by FDA for the treatment of primary refractory  or recurrent MAS/HLH 
(Benedetti, 2019 ).

CAR T cell therapy  is associ ated wit
h unique neurol ogic toxicit ies. Neurologic symptom s may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, al tered level of  consci ousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activit y. With JCAR017, to date, the start of neurologic symptoms has been noted between 3 to 23 
days (median 10 days) (Abramson, 2017) after CAR T cell infusio n and in severe cases may 
requi re admissio n to the intensive care unit (ICU) for frequent monitoring, respiratory  support, or 
intubation for airway protecti on. The symptom s are variable and genera lly occur as CRS is 
resolving or after CRS resolut ion.
4.1. Pathophysiology of Neurologic Toxicities
The pathogenesis of neurotoxicit y is poorly defined. Analysis of a subset of subjects treated wi th 
JCAR017 (
study 017001 - TRANSCEND NHL001) with NHL who have high baseline tumor 
burden (measured by the sum of product of the perpendicular diameters or high serum LDH (≥500 
U/L) prior to the start of lymphodepletion) also have a higher risk for developing neurotoxi city 
(Siddiqi, 2017). In addit ion, severe neurotoxi city has also been reported in subjects with B-cell 
ALL 
and higher disease burden at the time of CD19 directed CAR T cell infusio n (Park, 2017; 
Gust, 2017 ).
Peak l evels o f IL-6, IFN -γ, ferrit in, and CRP are significant ly higher in subjects who develop any 
Grade or Grade 3 or higher neurotoxicit y (Turtle , 2016; Heipel, 2017) . Protein levels in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)are usually elevated in patients with neurotoxici ty, compared with 
baseline measurements, suggesting disrupt ion of the blood -brain barrier. Other organ dy sfunct ion 
(hepat ic and renal), as well as hypoxemia, and infect ion, might 
also contribute to the 
encephalopat hy (Neelapu, 2018). In another study, it has been reported that evidence for cytokine -
mediated endothelial activation causes coagul opathy , capillary  leak, and blood –brain barrier 
disrupt ion allowing transit of high concentrat ions of systemic cytokines into the CSF (Gust ,
2017).
4.2. Clinical Management of Neurologic Toxicities
The optimal management of CAR T cell-induced neurotoxicit y is unknown at this time. These 
management guidelines represent the current state of knowledge and additional informat ion will 
be provi ded to Investigators as it becom es available. Management should also be guided as per 
institutional or standard clinical pract ice, and as determined by the Invest igator or treating 
physician and/or consult ing neuro logist. A thorough neurologic evaluat ion, including 
electroencephalogram (EEG), m agnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or com puter tom ography  (CT) 
scan of the brain and diagnosti c lumbar puncture and frequent monitoring of cognitivefunction 
(eg,mini mental  status exams or handwrit ing tests) should be considered. 
Treatable causes of neurol ogic dysfuncti on, such as infect ion or hem orrhage shoul d be rul ed out. 
Commo n manifestations of neurotoxici ty (eg,confusion, seizure, aphasia), can also be seen with 
infect ion, electroly te imbalances , metabo lic acidosis, uremia , concomitant medication use (eg,
narcoti cs), and other m edical condit ions. Other causes for such symptoms should be considered.
Magnet ic resonance imaging and CT scans of the brain are usually negat ive for any anatomical 
pathol ogy that would account for the neurotoxicit y symptom s observed in subjects treated with 
CAR T cell therapy, although rare cases of reversible T2/fluid attenuated inversio n recovery 
(FLAIR) MRI hyperintensit y invo lving the thalami, dorsal pons, and medulla, and cerebral edema 
have been reported (Neelapu, 2018) .

Protocol  JCAR017 -BCM -003 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 175 JCAR017 -BCM -003Amendment 2 Final: 09 Dec 2019For subjects who have neuro logic toxicity in the presence of CRS, the CRS shoul d be managed 
following the guidelines provided in Figure 1. 
Neurotoxi city should be evaluated following the guidelines provi ded in Figure 2. For concurrent 
CRS and neurotoxicit y, the most aggressive inter vention recommended by either guideline should 
be empl oyed (
if the recommendations for steroid doses differ, use the highest dose and/or 
frequency ). For subjects with Grade 4 neurotoxi city with cerebral edema, high-dose 
corticosteroi ds, hyperventilat ion and hyperosmo lar therapy  has been recommended (Neelapu,
2018).
Note: Tocilizumab is not recommended for the treatm ent of neurotoxi city related to CAR T cell 
therapy , unless CRS or MAS/HLH is also present. Resul ts from 2 studi es, one of  preem ptive use 
of tocilizumab shortly  after anti
-CD19 CAR T cell therapy  in relapsed/refractory  NHL subjects 
(Locke, 2017), and the other mandatory  use of tocilizumab at first fever [>38.5°C] in pediatri c 
ALL patients treated wit
h anti-CD19 CAR T cells (Gardner, 2017), demonstrated that early 
tocilizumab use ei ther increased overall neurotoxicit y and Grade ≥3 neurotoxi city rates (85% vs 
62% overall; 35% vs 26% Grade ≥3) 
or provided no improvement in neurotoxi city rates, 
respectively . These findings support the hypothesis that tocilizumab does not improve and may 
worsen i solated neurotoxicit y (Locke, 2017 ).
Neurotoxi city management gui delines ar e provided in Figure 2.

Confident ial and Propri etary 3 JCAR017 -BCM -003 Amendment 2 Final: 0 9Dec 20191. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
A global protocol  amendment was generated for Study  JCAR017- BCM -003 
 
 
The updates introduced wi th this protocol  amendment rem ain consistent wi th the scient ific 
advice received  
 in December 2017.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Inclusion and exclusion criteria and pregnancy risk section updated with information 
on blood and tissue donation, cont raception and breastfeeding following exposure to 
lymphodepletion, combination agent and/or JCAR017
There i s no exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of contraception 
following treatm ent wi th JCAR017. The JCAR017 program excludes pr egnant subjects fro m 
participat ion and mandates that subjects use highly effect ive contraception. So far, no 
pregnancy has occurred in the JCAR017 clinical development program. No animal studies 
have been conducted with JCAR017 to assess whether it could c ause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. It is not known whether JCAR017 has the potential to be 
transferred to the fetus via the placenta and cause fetal toxicit y, including B -cell 
lymphocy topeni a. As the risk for the mother and fetus or new born is unknown at this time, 
and negat ive CAR T quant itative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR )tests do not reliably 
predi ct com plete di sappearance of CAR T cells from the body , this test cannot be used to 
guide durati on of  contracepti on. Therefore, the in dicat ion that contraception may  be changed 
or breastfeeding may be resumed fo llowing two subsequent negative CAR T qPCR tests was 
removed from  the inclusio n criteria.
Inclusio n criterion#10 was updated to align wit h the summary  of product characterist ics 
(SmPC) and the United States ( US)package insert (USPI) pregnancy guidance for 
cy
clophosphamide.
Revised Sections: 4.2. Inclusio n Cri teria(criteria #10 to #12), 5. Table of Events (Tabl es 3 
and 4) , 
6.3.1.1.1. Month 6 (± 10 day s), Secti on 6.3.1.1.2. Months 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 (± 14 
days), 10.4 Pregnancy
Exclusion criterion for known allergy to dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO )or Dextran was 
added

Confident ial and Propri etary 3 JCAR017 -BCM -003 Amendment 1Final : 06 Feb 20191. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
A global protocol  amendment was generated for Study  JCAR017- BCM -003 
 
 
 
 
The updates introduced wi th this protocol  amendment rem ain consistent wi th the scient ific 
advice received  in December 2017.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Eligibility broaden edto include additional subtypes of relapse d/refractory (R/R) 
aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas
Theaddition of primary  mediast inal (thymic) large B -cell lympho ma [PMBCL], T 
cell/hist iocyte-rich large B -cell lymphom a [THRBCL] is based on the fact that these histologies 
have similar bio logical behavior, are treat ed according to the DLBCL treatment algorithm, and 
supporting preliminary  data are available from Study  017001.

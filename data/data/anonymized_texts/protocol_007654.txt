 SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor : Silk Technologies , Ltd.  
Nam e of Finished Product:  SDP-4 Ophthalmic Solution  
Name of Active Ingredient:  Silk-Derived Protein -4 (SDP -4) 
Study  Title : 
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Double -Masked, Randomized, Vehicle -Controlled , Parallel -Group , 
Dose -Response  Study of SDP -4 Ophthalmic Solutio n in Subjects with Dry Eye Disease  (DED)  
Study Number:  SDP-4-CS201  
Study Phase:  2 
Primary Objective:   
Assess the safety and efficacy of SDP -4 ophthalmic solution in subjects with DED  over a 12 -week (84-
day) treatment period . 
Study Design : 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -controlled, dose -response, parallel -
group study designed to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety and efficacy of SDP -4 ophthalmic 
solution in subjects with moderate to severe DED in both  eyes (OU)  over a 12 -week  (84-day) treatment 
period.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 concentrations (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) of SDP -4 Ophthalmic 
Solution or vehicle in a 1:1:1:1 ratio in parallel groups. All investigational product ( SDP-4 
concentration s and vehicle ) will be provided in single -use doses (SUDs)  contained in foil pouches . 
Subjects, the Investigator , and all site personnel responsible for performing study assessments will 
remain masked to treatment assignment.  
Investigational product (IP)  will be administered via topical ocular instillation, one drop per eye, twice 
daily (BID) for 12 weeks  (84 days) . Both eyes will be treated. A 2-week screening/ run-in period  on 
BID vehicle will precede the 12 -week randomized treatment period.  
Subjects must have a Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) total score of ≥ 40 at 
Visit  1/Screening and Visit 2/Day 1 to ente r the trial. For subjects  with a qualifying SANDE score who 
meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, t he eye with the lower  tear break -up time (TBUT)  at Visit 
2/Day 1  will be designated as the study eye . In the event both eyes  have the same TBUT score s, the eye 
with the lower Schirmer’s test score  will be designated as the study eye . If both eyes have the same 
TBUT and Schirmer’s test score s, the right eye will be designated as the study eye.  
The study will consist of 7 clinic visits, 2 visits during the screening period and 5 on -treatment visits: 
Visit 1 (Day -14 ± 2 /Screening Visit), follow ed by the 2-week run -in on BID vehicle , Visit 2 
(Day  1/Confirmatory and Randomization Visit), Visit 3 (Day 7 ± 2), Visit 4 (Day  14 ± 2), Visit 5 (Day 
28 ± 2 ), Visit 6 (Day 56 ± 4) and Visit 7 (Day 84 ± 4/End of Study Assessments).   
If a subject complains of  persistent dry eye symptoms, the site may provide the subject with 
unpreserved artificial tears  (provided by the Sponsor) , to be used only if necessary. T he subject must 
return all used and unused artificial tears at each visit so the site  can conduct  accountability to assess 
the use of artificial tears . Artificial tears may not be used within 2 hours prior to any study visit.  
Study Population :  
Number of Subjects Planned:  
A total of 300 randomized subjects are planned, with 75 subjects assigned  to each dose group of SDP -4 
Ophthalmic Solution (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) or vehicle.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

Statistical Methods:  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock.  
General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment and visit (as applicable) using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). All categorical 
study assessments will be summarized by treatment and visit (as applicable) using frequency counts 
and percentages.   
All study data will be listed by treatment, subject,  and visit (as applicable).  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye.  
Sample Size Rationale  
A sample size of 70 subjects per treatment group will have 80% power to detect a treatment difference 
of 11.7 units in SANDE total score and 1.2 seconds in TBUT at 12 weeks using a t -test with a 0.05 
two-sided significance level. Over -enrollment of 5 subjects per group/20 subjects per study is planned 
to account for discontinuations .  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Silk-derived protein -4 (SDP -4) is a novel biotherapeutic being developed by Silk 
Technologies , Ltd. (Silk Te chnologies) as a treatment for the signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease (DED). Dry eye disease , as defined by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society  
(TFOS) Dry Eye Workshop  (DEWS) II, is a “ multifactorial disease of the ocular surface 
characterized by loss of homeostasis of the tear film and accompanied by ocular symptoms, 
in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, 
and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles” ( Craig et al ., 2017 ).  
The disease re sults in corneal irregularities that can create sight -limiting outcomes over time 
due to chronic inflammation governed by nuclear factor κB (NF -κB) signaling, which is 
thought to play a significant role in disease pathogenesis ( Lan et al., 2012 ). Inflammatory 
mediators regulated by NF-κB, such as matrix metalloprotease ( MMP )-9, tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNF -α), and interleukin (IL) -8 have been found in the tear fluid  at high 
concentrations in patients exhibiting  severe  DED ( Solomon et al., 2001 ; Smith et al., 2001 ). 
Furthermore, t opical administration of MMP -9 to DED  MMP -9-knockout mice subjected to 
dry eye via cholinergic blockade  significantly  increase s corneal epithelial permeability , 
implicating MMP -9 in increased corneal epitheli al disruptio n and damage ( Pflugfelder et al., 
2005 ). Collectively, these observations suggest a relationship between disruption of the 
corneal epithelium, increased secretion of MMP -9 through NF -κB signaling, and the signs 
and symptoms of DED.  
Silk fibroin protein  is the primary fibrous component of the Bombyx mori  silkworm cocoon.  
In vivo , aqueous silk fibroin protein solution was successfully used to treat DED in a murine 
animal model, improving clinical outcomes (increased tear production, decreased corneal 
irregularity, inhibited epithelial cell detachment, and increased goblet cell density) and 
reducing inflammatory cytokine presence (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM] -1, 
vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM] -1, MMP -2 and MMP -9) (Kim et al, 2017 ).  
Silk-derived protein (SDP) is a partially hydrolyzed population derived from the silk fiber 
protein fibroin with a molecular weight (MW) distribution of 2000 –300, 000 Daltons (Da).  
In vitro  studies in immortalized hCLE cell s subjected to scratch wound denu dement 
demonstrated that aqueous SDP improved corneal epithelial wound healing through 
accelerated cell migration, proliferation and enhanced cell -matrix attachment ( Abdel -Naby et 
al., 2017 ). Cultures treated with SDP displayed significant increases in cel l-matrix focal 
adhesion formation and basement membrane adhesive strength compared to untreated 
cultures. In vivo , treatment with SDP accelerated the acute healing phase of injured rabbit 
corneal epithelial tissues, as shown by significantly increased epit helial migration rate, and 
produced a dose -dependent, 8 -fold decrease in MMP -9.  
Through a series of additional manufacturing steps, the subpopulation , SDP-4, is produced 
with a MW range of 10,000 -30,000  Da. In nonclinical studies, SDP-4 has demonstrated a 
dual mechanism of action that both inhibits inflammation and physically improves the 
stability of the tear film. SDP-4 inhibits NF -κB driven expression of known dry eye 
inflammatory mediators produced by ocular surface cells , inclu ding MMP -9, TNF -α, and 
IL-8.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 Multiple  in vitro  assays revealed that SDP-4 inhibits NF -κB-driven expression of known dry 
eye inflammatory mediators produced by the corneal epithelium. SDP-4 treatment inhibited 
secretion of IL -8 by stimulated hCLE  cells in a dose -dependent manner . Treatment with 
SDP-4 also impair ed chemokine activation and subsequent mobilization of immune -like cells 
in an in vitro  co-culture model. Direct impairment of NF-κB activity by SDP -4 was 
confirmed using a human embryonic kidney cell  line containing a NF -κB-responsive reporter 
gene. SDP -4 inhibited reporter gene expression dose dependently at concentrations ranging 
from 0.1% -10%.  
Cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology studies were conducted in the monkey 
and ra t, respectively, with SDP -4 administered by intravenous (IV) injection. No statistically 
significant effects on respiratory rate, tidal volume or minute volume or on cardiovascular 
function, e.g., electrocardiographic waveforms, QT, heart rate, were observ ed at doses of 0, 
10, 50 and 75 mg/kg.  
The pivotal 90 -day toxicity study in rabbits was conducted at SDP -4 concentrations of 0% 
(vehicle), 1%, 3%, 5% or 10% instilled four times/day into both eyes. Ocular findings in all 
groups, including controls, occurre d sporadically throughout the dosing phase with no 
relationship to dose or duration of treatment. Irritation observed during the study tended to 
resolve during the dosing phase as the study progressed. No histopathological changes in the 
ocular tissue were  observed. Plasma levels of SDP -4 were either below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) or approximated the LLOQ at the highest dose. Based on the results, 
the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for this study was 10%, the highest dose 
examined.  
A pivotal 28 -day IV toxicity study in rats was undertaken at doses of 0, 10, 50 and 75  mg/kg. 
No SDP -4-related toxicity was observed. Microscopically, dose -related cytoplasmic 
vacuolation was noted in the proximal convoluted tubule segment of the renal ne phron, 
which was reduced in severity following the 14 -day recovery phase but not completely 
resolved. Because there were no other histopathological changes observed in the kidney and 
no clear evidence of altered renal function at any dose, t he finding is considered to have  
limited toxicological significance. A dose proportional increase in plasma levels of SDP -4 
was observed. The half -life was approximately 0.5 -1 hr and n o accumulation of SDP -4 was 
evident.  
The pharmacological and toxicological data for SDP -4 are considered adequate to support the 
safe clinical use of the SDP -4 drug product for the initial Phase 2 clinical trial. Based on the 
results of the toxicology program, the estimated margin of safety on a body surface area basis 
was determined to be 1 28-fold. Therefore, ocular instillation of SDP -4 twice daily to patients 
with a maximum clinical concentration of 3% administered twice daily for up to 12 weeks is 
considered safe for the initial Phase 2 clinical study.  
SDP-4 Ophthalmic Solution is a topic al treatment for DED that  has not been evaluated in 
clinical trials. The planned first in human (FIH) study is a multicenter, double -masked, 
randomized, vehicle -controlled, dose -response, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the 
ocular and systemic safety and efficacy of SDP -4 in subjects with moderate to severe DED in 
both eyes over a 12 -week  (84-day) treatment period.  For additional information regarding 
SDP-4 Ophthalmic Solution, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Ph ase 2, multicenter, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -controlled, dose -
response, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety and 
efficacy of SDP -4 ophthalmic solution in subjects with moderate to severe DED in both eyes  
(OU)  over a 12 -week (84-day) treatment period.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 concentrations (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) of SDP -4 
Ophthalmic Solution or vehicle in a 1:1:1:1 ratio in parallel groups. All investigational 
product ( IP) (SDP-4 concentrations and v ehicle ) will be provided in single -use dose (SUD)  
containers seal packed into foil pouches. Subjects, the Investigator , and all site personnel 
responsible for performing study assessments will remain masked to treatment assignment.  
The IP will be administered via topical ocular instillation, one drop per eye, twice daily 
(BID) for 12 weeks  (84 days) . Both eyes will be tr eated. A 2-week screening/ run-in period 
on BID vehicle will precede the 12 -week randomized treatment period.  
Subjects must have a Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) total score of ≥ 40 at 
Visit  1/Screening and Visit 2/Day 1 to enter the trial. For subjects with a qualifying SANDE 
score who meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, t he eye with the lower tear break -up 
time (TBUT) at Visit 2/Day 1 will be designated as the study eye. In the event both eyes have 
the same TBUT scores, the eye with the lo wer Schirmer’s test score will be designated as the 
study eye. If both eyes have the same TBUT and Schirmer’s test scores, the right eye will be 
designated as the study eye.  
The study will consist of 7 clinic visits, 2 visits during the screening period an d 
5 on-treatment visits: Visit 1 (Day -14 ± 2/Screening Visit), follow ed by the 2-week run -in 
period on BID vehicle , Visit 2 (Day 1/Confirmatory and Randomization Visit), Visit 3 
(Day  7 ± 2), Visit 4 (Day 14 ± 2), Visit 5 (Day 28 ± 2), Visit 6 (Day 56 ± 4)  and Visit 7 
(Day  84 ± 4/End of Study Assessments).   
If a subject complains of persistent dry eye symptoms, the site may provide the s ubject with 
unpreserved artificial tears  (provided by the Sponsor) , to be used only if necessary. The 
subject must return all used and unused artificial tears at each visit so  the site can conduct 
accountability to assess the use of artificial tears. Artificial tears may not be used within 
2 hours prior to any study visit.  
See Table 1, Schedule of Visits and Examinations . 
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
It is hypothesized that by reduc ing pro-inflammatory mediato rs of DED , and providing a 
mucin replacement to enhance spreading and wetting of the tear film, SDP-4 may produce 
improvement in the symptoms of DED , as measured by the total SANDE score,  and in the 
physical characteristics of the tear film, as measured by  TBUT . These are designated primary  
(SANDE)  and secondary (TBUT) endpoints . The study is also designed to measure 
additional secondary endpoints including individual symptoms  (itching , foreign body 
sensation , burning/stinging , fluctuating vision , eye dryness , eye discomfort , photophobia , and SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 eye pain ) and additional signs  (anesthetized  Schirmer’s test , corneal fluorescein staining , 
conjunctival lissamine green staining , and c onjunctival hyperemia ). Three concentrations of 
SDP-4, (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%)  will be dosed topically BID versus vehicle control to test th e 
hypothes es of this protocol. The SDP-4 concentrations are among those shown in nonclinical 
pharmacology studies to be effective in inhibiting inflammatory mediators , with the 1% 
concentration pr oducing maximal inhibition of NF-κB activity. The 12-week  (84-day) 
treatment period allows adequate assessment of the comparative efficacy of the IP 
concentrations being compared and their effects over time.  The control is the vehicle without 
the active ingredient of the drug product to be used in the study.  
3.3. Study Duration and Dates  
The duration of study treatment is 12 weeks  (84 days) . The overall duration of the study is 
14 weeks, which includes a 2 -week screening/ run-in period on vehicl e and 12 weeks of 
treatment.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1. Description of Treatment(s)  
5.1.1.  Study Drug  
SDP-4 Ophthalmic Solution is a non-preserved aqueous solution of SDP -4 for topical 
ophthalmic use  and will contain the active substance  (SDP -4) and p olysorbate -80, sodium 
acetate trihydrate, glacial acetic acid , magnesium chloride hexahydrate , and d extrose  
monohydrate . 
5.1.2.  Control  
The vehicle solution will be th e same as the SDP-4 except for the omission of the active 
substance (SDP -4).  
All subjects who meet study entry criteria at Screening/Visit 1 (Day -14 ± 2) will receive a 
supply of vehicle solution prior to randomization to the double -masked study  to be 
administered during the 14 -day (± 2) screening/run -in period.  
5.2. Selection , Timing  and Administration  of Dose for Each Patient  
Subjects will be randomized to treatment with 1 of 3 concentrations (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) 
of SDP -4 Ophthalmic Solution or vehicle  whic h will be administered to each eye BID, 
approximately 12  hours apart , for 84 days.  
Subjects (or their caregiver, if the subject is not able to self -administer the IP) will administer 
IP topically OU BID for 84 days. At the Screening and Baseline visits, site personnel will 
instruct the subject (or caregiver) in topical ocular drop administration procedures. After 
instilling a drop in each eye, the  used single -use dose ( SUD ) should be stored in the storage 
container provided by site personnel  and pl aced back in the box.  
Twice each day, approximately 12 hours apart, the subject (or caregiver) will open a new 
SUD  and administer 1 drop to each eye, store the used SUD  in the foil pouch , and place it in 
the box  (or storage container)  for return to the cli nical site  so accountability can be 
documented in the source document and electronic case report form (eCRF) . All IP, 
including  the box, used SUDs /foil pouches and any unopened SUDs will be returned to the 
clinical site where the used and unopened IP will be documented  at Visits 2 through 7 .  
5.3. Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 0.1%, 1.0% or 3.0%  SDP-4 or vehicle in 
parallel groups. A computer -generated randomization code for allocating the solu tions will 
be prepared by an independent unmasked biostatistician not involved in the day -to-day 
running of the study.  
If subjects meet eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1 /Day -14) and Visit  2/Day 1  (see 
Section  4 for eligibility criteria), subjects will be randomly assigned to IP at Visit 2 . Clinical 
sites will utilize the Interactive Web Response System (IW RS) to assign kits to subjects. The 
IP kit randomization number will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF . The randomized IP may 
vary slightly in hue from nearly clear to a slight tint. This variability is normal.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

SDP-4-CS201 Protocol  SDP4_CS201_pro_FA -1.docx /03 April 2019  
 5.4. Masking  
The study will be double -masked. All SDP-4 concentrations and vehicle will be provided in 
SUDs  seal packed into foil pouches which are enclosed in a box  and dispensed in one -month 
supplies at Visits 2, 5, and 6 . Subjects, the Investigator , and all site personnel responsible for 
performing stu dy assessments will remain masked to treatment assignment.  
Should it be necessary to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
Investigator  may obtain the treatment code for a given randomized subject from the IWRS . 
The treatment  code is to be obtained only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of 
the medication being taken will influence the medical management of the subject.  
The following procedure should be followed:  
1. The Investigator should contact the Medical Mo nitor via phone immediately before 
unmasking a subject, unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject.  
2. The Investigator should document the serious adverse event (SAE) , if applicable , and 
justification for unmasking in the eCRF.  
3. The subje ct may continue to participate in the study  to be followed for safety  at the 
Investigator’s discretion. If the subject is to be discontinued from study participation, 
then ALL procedures described in the Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section  7.3) 
should be completed.  
4. The Investigator should contact Oculos Clinical Research (Oculos), the clinical 
research organization (CRO), at SilkTech -safety@ oculoscr .com  within 24  hours with 
the randomization number, subject initials, details of the adverse event (AE) or SAE, 
any action taken, and whether the subject is continuing in the study.  
5.5. Concomitant Therapy  
Therapy conside red necessary for the subject’s welfare that will not interfere with the 
evaluation of the IP may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor. If there is any question as to whether the medication may 
interfere, the Investigator  should contact the Medical Monitor or Sponsor.  
If a subject complains of persistent dry eye symptoms, the site may provide the s ubject with 
unpreserved artificial tears  (provided by the Sponsor) , to be used only i f necessary. The 
subject must return all used and unused artificial tears at each visit so  the site can conduct 
accountability to assess the use of artificial tears. Artificial tears may not be used within 2 
hours prior to any study visit ; the subject may either be rescheduled or may wait at the site 
until 2 hours have passed since instillation if this occurs .  
Permitted steroid medications  include intranasal, inhaled, dermatologic, or peri-anal,  
steroids . 
Whenever possible, medications should be administered in dosages that remain stable  
throughout the study duration. All concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 5.6. Restrictions  
The Medical Monitor should be notified before prohibited medication or  therapy is 
administered, unless the safety of the subject requires immediate action. The decision to 
administer a prohibited medication or therapy should be done with the safety of the subject as 
the primary consideration. The Medical Monitor should  be co ntacted to determine the 
permissibility of a specific medication or therapy and whether or not the subject should 
continue with study participation.  
5.6.1.  Prohibited Medications and Treatments  
The following medications are prohibited as specified:

falls out during the study, it should be replaced with a new plug of the same type.  
Contact lens w ear prior to and during the study is prohibited.  
5.6.2.  Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be monitored by IP accountability  throughout the study . The 
amount of used and unused run-in vehicle  returned at Visit 2/Day 1 and  used and unused 
randomized IP returned at Visit 5/Day 28, Visit 6/Day 56, and Visit 7/Day 84 will be 
documented by site personnel . Additionally, the amount of used and un used artificial tears 
will be documented by site personnel  starting at Visit 2 throug h Visit 7 if the artificial tears 
were required by the subject . 
5.7. Packaging and Labeling  
The IP will be filled into blow -fill-seal (BFS) containers composed of low density 
polyethylene (LDPE). The individual cartridges of 5  SUDs will be seal packed into a fo il 
pouch . The foil-wrapped cartridges will be pack aged 7 at a time into a cardstock storage box 
that will contain a total of 3 5 SUDs  for the 2 -week run -in period. The foil -wrapped cartridges 
will be packaged 1 6 at a time into a cardstock storage box that w ill contain a total of 
80 SUDs dispensed monthly at Visits 2, 5 and 6 during the randomized treatment period. A 
label bearing the required IP labeling information per Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)

 5.8. Storage and Accountability  
The IP should be stored at a controlled temperature at 15°- 25°C (59° -77°F) in a secured 
area. A temperature log will be maintained at each clinical site. Subjects should be instructed 
to store IP at home  at room temperature.  After opening a foil pouch , the remaining SUDs  
should be stored in the pouch until used. Subjects will retain all used and unused IP materials 
(SUDs , foil pouches , boxes) to return to the site.  
5.9. Investigational Product Dispensing and Retention at Study Site  
At Visit 1/Screening, if the eligibility criteria are met, vehicle solution for the 
screening/ run-in period will be dispen sed to the subject with instructions to return the used 
and unused IP at Visit 2/Day 1. When the run -in study materials are returned by the subject, 
accountability will be performed and the box will be retained at the site in a secured location.  
At Visit 2/Day 1 , Kit 1 will be dispensed  after the subject is randomized. Kits 2 through 3 
will remain in a secured location  at the site. The subject will be instruct ed to return the box 
along with all used and unused IP study materials  at Visit 5/ Day 28. 
At Visit 5/ Day 28, when Kit 1 is returned by the subject, accountability will be performed 
and the kit  will be retained at the site in a secured location. The site will dispense Kit 2 to the 
subject according to randomization number with instructions to retur n the box along with 
used and unused IP study materials  at Visit 6/ Day 56 . 
At Visit 6/ Day 56, when Kit 2 is returned by the subject, accountability will be performed 
and the kit  will be retained at the site in a secured location. T he site will dispense Kit  3 to the 
subject  with instructions to return the box along with used and unused IP study materials at 
Visit 7/Day 84.  
At Visit 7/Day 84 , when Kit 3 is returned by the subject, accountability will be performed 
and the kit  will be retained at the site in a secured location  for the clinical research associate 
(CRA ) to perform IP accountability and reconciliation. At the end of the study , the site or 
CRA will ship the IP study materials  back to the packager for destruction.  
Note: If  at any visit, the subject complains of persistent dry eye symptoms and a supply of 
artificial tears is provided, the subject must return all used and unused artificial tears at each  
subsequent visit so the si te can perform accountability to assess the use of artificial 
tears/resupply artificial tears as needed.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

The tear film will be  observed under the slit -lamp and timed until the tear film breaks up (i.e., 
tiny dry spots develop ) (Nichols et al ., 2004 ). The procedure is conducted 2 times for each  
eye and the TBUT for each is measured in seconds and recorded in the eCRF. The average 
for each eye will be calculated by the eDC system.  Consult the Study Reference Manual for 
specific details regarding the evaluation procedure s. 
6.3.2.2.  Corneal Fluorescein Staining  
Following evaluation of TBUT, corneal fluorescein staining using a Wratten #12 filter  (or 
equivalent)  will be measured using the National Eye Institute (NEI) standardized grading 
system to grade each of the 5 areas of the cornea on a 0-3 scale ( as shown in Figure  2)(range: 
0 – 15) (Lemp, 1995 ). Consult the Study Reference Manual for specific details regarding the

6.3.2.3.  Conjunctival Hyperemia  
Conjunctival hyperemia will be graded during the slit -lamp examination using the 
McMonnies ph otographic scale (McMonnies and Chapman , 1987a ; McMonnies and 
Chapman, 1987b ). This photographic reference scale consists of 6 levels or grades of 
conjunctival hyperemia (0 = none, 5 = severe). Please note that these were designed for 
contact lens wearers, but validated for non -contact lens wearers ( McMonnies and Ho, 1991 ). 
Consult the Study Reference Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedure s. 
6.3.2.4.  Conjunctival Lissamine Green Staining  
After corneal staining, lissamine green conjunc tival staining will be measured. Six (6) areas 
of the conjunctiva will be evaluated  (Figure  3) (Lemp, 1995 ). The Investigator will record a 
score for e ach area of each eye. The scores for each eye will be summed, excluding superior 
zones 2 and 4. Consult the Study Reference Manual for specific details regarding the 
evaluation procedures.

6.3.2.5.  Anesthetized Schirmer’s Test  
An anesthetized  Schirmer’s test will be performed at least 5 minutes after the lissamine green 
conjunctival staining to allow for any reflex tearing to subside  (Li et al ., 2012 ; Tsubota  et al., 
1999 ). Following instillation of topical anesthetic, filter paper strips will be placed in both 
eyes inside the lower eyelid (conjunctival sac) at the same time. The eyes are closed for 
5 minutes. The paper is then removed and the amount of moisture on each strip in

the Study Reference Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedure s. 
6.4. Adverse and Serious Adverse  Events  
6.4.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
6.4.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a n IP that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and uni ntended sign ( for example, an  abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP , whether or not considered 
related to this IP.  
Note: IP in this study refers to all concentrations of SDP -4 and to the vehicle  (control ). 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test 
results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical sign s or symptoms, are considered 
clinically significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by open -ended questioning of the subject at each 
visit during the study. At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following questio n: 
"Have you had any problems since your last visit?” Adverse event s also may be detected 
when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through study 
assessments.  
6.4.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  or sight -threatening  
Note: The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might ha ve caused death if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding 
progression/outcome of the disease under study)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existin g hospitalization  
• Is medically significant; i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that doe s not result in hospital admission, or a 
hospitalization that is elective or is a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is 
not considered an SAE.  
All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of completion or discontinuation from the study will be 
followed until stabilization or resolution of the event.  
6.5. Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship of AEs to the IP should be assessed by the Inve stigator using the definitions 
below.  
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the IP makes a causal relationship 
unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observe d event.  
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the IP makes a causal relationship 
possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
If there is any val id reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the IP and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“suspected.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the IP is determined by the Spons or to be 
“suspected” the event will be considered to be related to the IP for the purposes of expedited 
regulatory reporting.  
6.6. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events  (AEs)  spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open 
question from th e study personnel or revealed by observation, regardless of severity or 
potential association with the IP or study procedures, will be recorded in the eCRF. Changes 
from baseline assessments that are part of the disease being studied will not necessarily be 
recorded as AEs unless the Investigator deems them as such. Investigators are advised to 
consider reporting an increase in IOP of 10 mmHg or greater, or a visual acuity decrease of 3 
lines EDTRS (15 letters) or greater  as an AE .  If ongoing at the time of the subject's last 
study visit, Investigators should follow the event until the subject has returned to baseline or 
the event has resolved.   
All AEs that occur following consent and until the final study visit ( Visit 7/Day 84 ) should 
be collected and recorded on the AE eCRF page.  AEs that occur during the screening/ run-in 
period (Visit 1/Day -14 ± 2 to Visit 2/Day 1) will be summarized separately from AEs th at 
occur from the first dose of double -masked treatment on Day 1 to the Day 84 Visit or Early 
Discontinuation . Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until the event is resolved 
or stabilized.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

SDP-4-CS201 Protocol  SDP4_CS201_pro_FA -1.docx /03 April 2019  
 The AE term should be reported in standard medical term inology when possible. For each 
AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the following:  
• Onset (date)  
• Resolution (date)  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)  
• Relationship to IP (not suspected, suspected)  
• Action taken (none, IP temporarily interrupted, IP permanently discontinued; 
concomitant medication taken; hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization; other)  
• Serious outcome (yes/no)  
The severity grade should be determined by the Investigator using the definitions below : 
• Mild : Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate : Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe : Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
It is important to distinguish between serious  and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity (as defined directly above) whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under 
Section  6.4.1.2 . An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP may have 
interfered with the ef fectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  The subject will stop using 
the IP, be withdrawn from the study, and followed through conclusion of pregnancy. The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congeni tal abnormality) must be followed up and documented.  
6.7. Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs ( suspected  and not suspected ) will be recorded following consent and until the final 
study visit, Visit 7/Day 84 . Any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the IP and discovered by 
the Investigator at any time after the study should be reported.  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported within 24 hours of its occurrence or within 24  hours 
of learning of its occurrence  by entering the information in the appropriate eCRF  page in the 
EDC system . Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be 
reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24  hours of the Investigator receiving the 
information. Information about all SAEs will be collected and recorded on the SAE form. All 
pertinent medical records and information collected during the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject should be maintained at the site with a copy emailed to 
SilkTech -Safety@oculoscr.com  only if requested and after thorough de -identification/  
removal of all personal health information (PHI) . The Investigator must assess the SAE 
relationship to the IP/study treatment and severity and complete the SAE form. Silk 
Technologies /Oculos  may request additional information. Follow -up information ( e.g., SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to 
SilkTech -Safety@ oculoscr .com . 
In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF page with the serious 
question marked “Yes”.  
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the 
appropriate diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event.  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to no tify the approving IRB of any site-specific SAEs 
per the IRB’s reporting requirements . 
Silk Technologies  will report all SAEs to the United States ( US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) on the appropriate schedule depending if the event is IP related or not 
IP related, expected  or unexpected (based on the available information in the IB). 
Any death occurring during the study and follow up period should be reported as an SAE. 
For any death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship 
to IP, the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to Silk Technologies or designee . A 
death occurring after completion of the study d oes not require completion of the SAE form.  
6.8. Other Safety Assessments  
6.8.1.  Best-Corrected Visual Acuity  
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement will be performed in each eye at all study 
visits with the logMAR eye chart  using the subject’s best correctiv e lens prescription 
eyeglasses or trial frame lenses, if applicable . The subject's BCVA must be determined (via 
refraction) if corrected or uncorrected visual acuity is not logMAR 0.0 (equivalent to 20/20). 
This refraction must be used for all VA assessmen ts for the duration of the study. The subject 
must wear the same glasses/trial frame, if applicable, at each visit.  Ambient room  lighting 
should be consistent for a given subject throughout the study period . Consult the Study 
Reference Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedures.  
6.8.2.  Biomicroscopy and External Eye Exam  
A slit -lamp examination will be conducted at each study visit to assess the anterior ocular 
structures, including lid, cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, lens , and posterior 
capsule (if pseudophakic) . Abnormalities will be documented.  Consult the  Study Reference 
Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedures.  
6.8.3.  Dilated Fundus Exam  
A fundus exam consisting of the vitreous, optic nerve, macula, and peripheral retina will be 
conducted, and the structures will be graded as normal or abn ormal.  Consult the Study 
Reference Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedures.  
6.8.4.  Intraocular Pressure Measurement  
Intraocular pressure will be measured utilizing a Goldmann  tonometer . If possible, the same 
observer should perform the assessment and the same calibrated instrument  should be used 
for a given subject throughout the study.  To avoid IOP changes due to the diurnal rhythm, the SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 IOP measurements should be performed at approximately the same time of th e day each 
time. Consult the Study Reference Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation 
procedures.  
6.8.5.  Investigational Product Comfort Assessment  
Subjects will rate the comfort  of IP instillation according to the following 4 -point scale:  
0 = No disc omfort  
1 = Mild discomfort  
2 = Moderate discomfort  
3 = Severe discomfort  
6.9. Screen Failures  
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
criteria or met at least 1 of the exclusion criteria, and has not been ra ndomized into the study. 
Based on Investigator discretion and Sponsor approval, subjects who initially failed to meet 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be rescreened at a later time if their eligibility status has 
changed. The subject will retain the sa me subject identification number that he/she was 
assigned at the first screening.  
6.10. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
The following are the criteria for considering withdrawal from the study:  
• Withdrawal of subject consent . The subject may request for any reason at  any 
time to be withdrawn from the study.  
• The Sponsor terminates the study.  
If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
If a study subject fails to attend a study visit at any point during the study period , every effort 
should be made to keep the subject in the study and conduct all study visits as scheduled ; all 
attempts to contact the subject must be documented.  If the subject relocates during the study 
period, the CRO  should be contacted to determine if there is a possibility that the subject 
could continue at another clinical site.  
6.11. Appropriateness  of Measurements  
The efficacy and safety assessments in this study are standard for ophthalmologic 
investigations, and their reliability, accuracy, and relevan ce is well established. Collection of 
AEs to monitor drug safety is standard in clinical studies . SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
Silk Technologies  and/or their contracted agents utilize standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) designed to ensure that research procedures and documentation are consistently 
conducted/prepared to the highest quality standards. These SOPs require compliance with 
FDA regulations and the International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) guidance.  
The study wil l be monitored by CRAs/monitors  to verify that the rights and well -being of 
human subjects are being protected, the reported data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, 
and that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol, with 
ICH GCP, and with the applicable regulatory requirements.  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, Silk 
Technologies or its agent may conduct a quality assurance audit at any time during or after 
completion o f a study. The Investigator will be given adequate notice if he/she is selected for 
an audit. The audit will include, but is not limited to: a review of all informed consent forms, 
medical records, and regulatory documentation; an assessment of study condu ct and protocol 
compliance; and a review of the study materials receipt, storage, and administration. At the 
conclusion of an audit, the auditor will conduct a brief meeting with the Investigator to 
review the findings of the audit.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 9. STATISTICS  
9.1. General Cons iderations  
This is a Phase 2 , multicenter , randomized, double -masked, vehicle -controlled, 
dose-response , parallel group  study to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety and efficacy of 
SDP-4 ophthalmic solution in subjects with moderate to severe DED . 
Subjects with DED are planned to be randomized to 1 of 3 concentrations of SDP -4 (0.1%, 
1.0%, or 3.0%) or vehicle  in a 1:1:1:1  ratio, with 75 subjects randomized to each group.  
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as agreed with the Sponsor acco rding to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) . 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment and visit (as applicable) 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). 
All categorical study assessm ents will be summarized by treatment and visit (as applicable) 
using frequency counts and percentages.  
All study data will be listed by treatment, subject,  and visit (as applicable).  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye.  
Efficacy analys is will be conducted on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population (primary efficacy 
analysis) and the per protocol (PP) population (secondary efficacy analysis). Safety analyses 
will be performed using the safety analysis population . Definitions for the analysi s 
populations may be found in Section  9.3. 
9.2. Determination of Sample  Size 
A sample size of 70 subjects per treatment group will have 80% power to detect a treatment 
difference of 11.7 units in SANDE total score and 1.2 seconds in TBUT at Visit 7/Day 84 
using a t -test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level. This calculation is based on the 
assumptions shown in Table 2. Note: TBUT is one of several secondary outcomes planned to 
be analyzed, but the sample size was derived usin g assumptions based on expected SANDE 
and TBUT values. Over -enrollment of 5 subjects per group/20 subjects per study is planned 
to account for discontinuations.

 9.3. Analysis Populations  
9.3.1.  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population will include all randomized subjects who received IP. This population 
will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all 
efficacy variables and will summar ize subjects as randomized.  
9.3.2.  Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which will include all subjects who 
complete the study without major  protocol deviations . This population will be the secondary 
population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables. 
The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.3.3.  Safety Population  
The safety population will include all subjects who received IP. This population will be used 
to summarize safety variables and will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized in tables. Summary 
tables will  be supported with individual subject data listings.  
9.5. Efficacy  Endpoints  and Analyses  
9.5.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Mean change from baseline in total SANDE score at Visit 7 /Day 84  
9.5.2.  Secondary  Efficacy Endpoint s

 • SANDE  
− Mean change from baseline in total SANDE score at each visit  
− Mean total SANDE score at each visit  
− Mean and mean change from baseline in each component of SANDE at each 
visit 
9.5.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint (SANDE) will be summarized using continuous summary 
statistics by treatment group and visit. The primary analysis will utilize a repeated measures 
mixed model where the dependent variable is the change from baseline score, tr eatment 
group is a fixed effect, baseline score is a covariate, and visit is a repeated measure on 
subject . The repeated measures mixed model is utilized to account for the effect of missing 
data under the assumption that the data are missing at random. Least squares means will be 
used to test each concentration of SDP -4 to vehicle.  Sensitivity analyses for the primary 
endpoint will be performed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) as well as 
observed data only.  
In order to minimize the impact of m ultiplicity in this dose -response study, the following 
hierarchy for analyses will be conducted  (note: TBUT is one of several secondary outcomes 
planned to be analyzed, but the sample size was derived using assumptions based on 
expected SANDE and TBUT valu es): 
1. Primary (SANDE) high concentration vs. vehicle  
2. Primary (SANDE) middle concentration vs. vehicle  
3. Primary (SANDE) low concentration vs. vehicle  
4. Secondary (TBUT) high concentration vs. vehicle  
5. Secondary (TBUT) middle concentration vs. vehicle  
6. Secondary (TBUT) low concentration vs. vehicle  
The comparisons will be conducted at α = 0.05. Each comparison will be made in order until 
P > (exceeds) 0.05. If P ≤ 0.05, the comparison is statistically significant and testing is 
continued.  
The planned analyses for all efficacy outcomes will be described in detail  in the SAP , which 
will be finalized prior to database lock . 
9.6. Safety Variables and Analysis  
9.6.1.  Safety Variables  
Safety variables are as follows:  
• Ocular and non -ocular AE monitoring  
• BCVA  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

 • Biomicroscopy  
• Intraocular pressure  
• Dilated fundus exam   
• IP comfort assessment  
9.6.2.  Safety Analysis  
Safety and IP comfort  data will be presented in tables of descriptive statist ics and frequency 
distribution. All summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
AEs that occur during the screening/ run-in period ( Visit 1/ Day-14 ± 2 to Visit 2/Day 1 ) will 
be summarized separately from AEs that occur from the f irst dose of double -masked 
treatment on Day 1 to the Day 84 Visit or Early Discontinuation . 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular and non -ocular treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) using discrete summaries at the subject level by system o rgan class 
and preferred term for each treatment group. A TEAE will be defined as occurring after the 
first dose of IP. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment -related ocular and non -ocular 
TEAEs will be summarized similarly. Ocular and non -ocular TEAE s will also be 
summarized by severity.  
Biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized by 
tabulating the distribution of score shifts between baseline and post -baseline assessments   
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; logMAR) and IOP  (mm Hg) will be summarized at 
each visit, using continuous and discrete summary statistics, including change from baseline 
and the proportion of study eyes with pre -defined increases from baseline , specifically, eyes 
with a 3 -line decrease in BCVA or eyes with ≥ 10 mm Hg increase in IOP .  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-00500 | 1.0

visit(s), and a study close -out visit. Training will be provided for key investigative personnel 
in all aspects of study conduct. The Investigator will be responsible for making sure that site 
personnel are provided adequate training on conducting delegated tasks.   
Before a site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of the Sponsor will:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator (s) and other personnel their responsibilities 
regarding protocol adherence and the responsibili ties of the Sponsor and or its 
representatives  
This study will utilize eDC to optimize the eCRF source verification process with limited 
separate source documentation. Monitors will review e -source data and overall study 
data/consistency remotely and query  discrepancies based upon eCRF entries (eCRF initial 
entry is the source). During this monitoring, data are reviewed as entered by the site, and the 
monitors will flag any abnormalities, trends, or safety signals for Medical Monitor review 
and monitor foll ow-up onsite, if necessary.  Refer to the Study Reference Manual  and/or 
Regulatory Binder  for details regarding the direct data entry of study assessments and 
requirements for maintaining additional source documentation via paper/medical record.  
During visi ts to the study site, the monitor may review the source documents including but 
not limited to signed informed consent forms, inclusion/exclusion checklist, medical/ocular 
history, concomitant medications, study material accountability and storage, complet ed 
SANDE questionnaires  and subject -completed VAS assessments , the reporting procedures 
for AEs , SAEs , and protocol deviations .  The CRA will review the study documents 
maintained in the Regulatory Binder to ensure all documentation is current and only qua lified 
and trained staff are appropriately delegated study related tasks.  The CRA will also review 
the site -specific processes and research -related SOPs to ensure appropriate Investigator 
oversight is being maintained and documented as required by GCP/ICH .

flexibility in enrollment of 
subjects.  
Synopsis Exclusion 
Criteria;  
4.3. Exclusion Criteria;  
5.6.1. Prohibited 
Medications and 
Treatments  Add 
If a subject has a punctal plug at Visit 
1/Screening for ≥ 30 days and it falls 
out during the study, it should be 
replaced with a new plug of  the same 
type.  To clarify that punctal 
plugs that fall out from the 
eye during the study  must 
be reinserted.  
Synopsis Exclusion 
Criteria;  
4.3. Exclusion Criteria;  
5.6.1. Prohibited 
Medications and 
Treatments  Change  
The following medications are 
prohibite d within 30 days prior to 
Visit 1/Screening  and throughout the 
study duration : 
• Systemic (i.e., oral, intravenous, 
intra-articular, or intramuscular) 
corticosteroids (intranasal, inhaled, 
dermatologic, peri -anal, or intrathecal  
steroids are allowed)  
to 
• Systemic (i.e., oral, intravenous, 
intra-articular, intrathecal, epidural, 
or intramuscular) corticosteroids 
(intranasal, inhaled, dermatologic, or

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  
 A Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled evaluation of PLN -74809 
on type 1 collagen deposition using 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI imaging in participants with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)  
Study Number:  PLN -74809 -IPF-205 
Study Phase:   2a 
Number of 
Participants Approx. 12 (8 receiving PLN -74809 and 4 receiving placebo)  
Objectives:  Primary:   
• Quantification of type 1 collagen in the lung following 12 weeks of treatment with 
PLN-74809, as assessed by changes from Baseline in 68Ga-CBP8 positron 
emission tomography (PET) / magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tracer uptake 
patterns 
Secondary:  
• Assessme nt of the safety and tolerability of PLN -74809 in idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) participants  
Exploratory: 
• Relationship between PLN -74809 systemic exposure and PET imaging and 
biomarkers in IPF participants  
• Forced vital capacity (FVC): absolute FVC vo lume and FVC as percent of 
predicted as assessed by spirometry  
• Patient -reported outcome (PRO): a visual analog scale (VAS) for cough severity  
Study Design:  This is a Phase 2a, single -center, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled 
study to evaluate  type 1 collagen deposition in the lungs following once -daily (QD) 
treatment with 160 mg PLN -74809 for 12 weeks in participants with IPF.  
The study consists of an up to 28- day screening period, a 12- week treatment period, 
and a 2 week (±3 days) post treatment follow -up period.  
Potential participants who provide written informed consent will be screened for study eligibility up to 28 days be fore administration of the first dose of study drug. 
Approximately 12 eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (160 mg PLN-74809 vs placebo; 8 receiving PLN -74809 and 4 receiving placebo) on Day 1 
(Visit 3). Study treatment will be administe red once daily for 12 weeks. 
Randomization will be stratified by use of standard of care (SoC) IPF therapy with pirfenidone or nintedanib (SoC use; yes or no).  
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI scans will be conducted within 7 days prior to baseline and at or 
within 7 day s prior to Week 12, as indicated in the Schedule of Events . 
Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 12 weeks of treatment will be encouraged to remain in the study to complete all 
remaining assessments; if this is not feasible, they will be asked to return to the clinic 
for an Early Termination (ET) visit for follow -up evaluations. If a participant elects to 
withdraw from the study after the 6
th week of randomization , an end of participation 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI wil l be offered to the participant to enhance appropriate data 
capture. 
Potential acute exacerbations, respiratory-related hospitalizations, and/or respiratory -
related deaths will be reviewed by an adjudication committee.

12.9 mCi but in practice, the dose has averaged 5.5 mCi per subject.  
 
Duration of 
Treatment: 12 weeks  
Pharmacokinetic 
and Pharmacodynamic Assessments Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
On Day 1, total and unbound plasma samples for PLN -74809 pharmacokinetic (PK) 
analysis will be obtained predose and at 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose.  
At steady -state, total and unbound plasma samples for PLN -74809 PK analysis will be 
obtained predose and at least 2 hours postdose at Weeks 4 and 12.  
Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
PET/MRI Imaging for the Assessment of Type 1 Collagen Deposition  
All PET/MRI will be performed at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital. PET imaging will be performed at prespecified times
 
as indicated in the Schedule  of Events. Blood samples will be obtained prior to each 
PET/MRI and will be stored for future analyses.  The total amount of radiation 
exposure from the PET/MRI is equal to a whole -body exposure up to 22 mSv (11 mSv 
per administration  of 68GaCBP8). 
MRI for the Assessment of PET/MRI Relationship  
All participants will undergo dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI during each PET/MRI 
session. This will be pe rformed using gadoterate meglumine at a predefined weight -
base dose and injection rate, as detailed in the study’s Radiology Manual . 
Biomarkers in Urine, Plasma, and Serum  
Urine, plasma and serum samples will be obtained at predetermined times  as indicated 
in the Schedule of Events. These samples will be used to measure specific proteins, 
peptides, metabolites and/or messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts that may 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 6  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  be elevated in patients with inflammatory/fibrotic disease or act as pharmacodynamic 
(PD) markers that may change with inhibition of α vβ6. 
Pharmacogenomic Assessments  
A whole blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation will be collected 
before dosing on Day 1 from each participant in the study.  
Exploratory Efficacy 
Assessments:  Spirometry  
Absolute FVC volume and FVC percent of predicted will be assessed by spirometry at 
screening and at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Events.  FEV1 will be 
assessed by spirometry at screening.  
Patient-reported Outcome (PRO)  
Study participants will respond to a VAS for cough severity at the timepoints specified 
in the Schedule of E vents.  
Safety Assessments:  Open ended adverse event (AE) inquiry; clinical chemistry and hematology; vital 
signs; 12-lead ECG  
Sample Size 
Justification: The sample size of approximately 12 participants (8 participants receiving 160 mg 
PLN-74809 and 4 receiving placebo) is expected to provide a meaningful evaluation of 
PLN-74809 safety, tolerability and PK in the target population, and add to the data of approximately 21 participants planned to be evaluated at this dose level in an ongoing multicenter, dose ranging Phase 2a study (PLN -74809-IPF-202). 
Statistical Methods:  Analysis Populations  
Safety Population: All randomized participants who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  
PK Analysis Population: All rand omized participants who have sufficient PLN -74809 
concentration data for PK calculation will be included in the PK analyses.  
PD Analysis Population: All randomized participants who receive any amount of study 
drug and who have results from Baseline and from at least one post -baseline PET/MRI 
scan or PD assessment will be included in the PD analyses.  
Primary Endpoint: PD  
Quantification of type 1 collagen in the lung following 12 weeks of treatment, as assessed by changes from Baseline in 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI tracer uptake patterns.  
PET/MRI scans will be interpreted by American Board of Nuclear Medicine (ABNM)-certified nuclear medicine physicians in an unblinded manner. Lung contours will be generated from baseline and post -treatment PET/MRI. Mean and maximum 
standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements of contoured lungs will be calculated using MIMS software, by analyzing the uptake values of 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI within 
the lung, and by comparing values from the baseline and post -treatment scans. 
Numeric al and graphical results will be presented by dose.  
In addition, relationships between PK and type 1 collagen deposition, as well as between MRI and PET imaging, may be evaluated in an exploratory fashion and presented in a graphical manner  
Secondary Endpoint: Safety  
Safety data from all participants who received at least one dose of study drug will be incorporated into the final safety analysis.  
Exploratory Endpoints  
PK and PD  
Plasma PLN-74809-versus- time profiles (with plasma concentrations on both a log  
and linear scale) will be plotted for each participant. Non- compartmental analysis will 
be used to calculate PK parameters as appropriate . 
Relationships between PK and type 1 collagen deposition, as well as between MRI and 
PET imaging, may be evaluated in  an exploratory fashion and presented in a graphical 
manner.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 7  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Urine, plasma, and serum samples will be analyzed for biomarkers (presence or actual 
concentration). These samples will be used to determine the levels of these markers in 
participants, the relationship between these markers, and the level of PET tracer uptake (type 1 collagen deposition) in the lung.  
 
Efficacy  
Percent of predicted FVC and volume will be assessed using the standard spirometry procedure at the Chest Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital and presented as absolute values and as percent of predicted values. Baseline FVC will be the average of the screening and Day 1 determinations. End -of-study FVC will be the average of 
Week 12 and Week 14 determinations.  
For PRO, cough VAS will be completed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of 
Events.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  1 INTRODUCTION  
Pliant Therapeutics Inc. (Pliant) is developing PLN -74809 for the treatment of idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and treatment of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with at least severe coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID -19).  
IPF is the most common interstitial lung disease usually observed in the elderly characterized 
by dyspnea and progressive loss of lung function leading to death, with median survival of 
3.8 years after diagnosis based on 2014 data in the United States (US). The hallmark 
honeycomb appearance of IPF on high- resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) is the 
result of extensive fibrosis ( Lederer  and Martinez, 2018). Although not completely 
understood, IPF appears to be a response to alveolar epithelial injury with the resultant fibrosis mediated by growth factors ( Kreuter et al, 2015 ; Wilson and Raghu, 2015) and 
propagated by myofibroblasts. As has also been indicated to be the case for other fibrotic conditions, signaling mediated by α
v integrins is central to the control of fibrosis in the lungs. 
Specific roles proposed for α vβ6 in epi thelial cells and α vβ1 in myofibroblasts for induction of 
fibrosis are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure for PLN -74809. 
PLN -74809 is a small molecule and a selective dual inhibitor of α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrins: 
50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) 5.7 nM and 3.4 nM, respectively, in an in vitro ligand-
binding assay (protein- free); IC 50 30 nM and 19.5 nM (10.2 nM and 6.6 nM unbound), 
respectively, in an in vitro co- culture assay of transforming growth factor beta (TGF -β) 
activati on. PLN -74809 reduced collagen synthesis in mice with bleomycin- induced lung 
injury, a commonly used experimental model for IPF ( Moeller et al, 2008 ). In ex vivo human 
IPF lung tissue (precision cut lung slices), treatment with PLN -74809 significantly decreased 
collagen type  1 alpha 1 ( COL1A1 ) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels 
after a 3 -day incubation period, providing an indication of antifibrotic activity in IPF. Mice 
completely deficient for α vβ6 function live a normal lifespan ( Horan et al, 2008 ), suggesting 
that even full inhibition of such integrins is well tolerated.  
1.1 Summary of Clinical Development  
To date, 4 Phase 1 studies in healthy participants are completed. One Phase 1 and 4 Phase 2 
studies are currently ongoing. All data from these studies are supportive of the continued 
clinical development of PLN -74809 across the current indications.  
1.1.1 Completed Phase 1 Studies  
In the first -in-human evaluation of PLN -74809 (PLN -74809- P1-01), a total of 71 healthy 
participants were exposed to PLN -74809 for up to 14 days, with single and multiple doses 
ranging from 10 to 75 mg. Overall, the study showed that single ascending dose (SAD) and 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) administration of PLN -74809 was well tolerated at all dose 
levels, with no apparent relationship between frequency or severity of adverse events (AEs) 
to PLN -74809 doses or to treatment duration.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 16  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  In Study  PLN -74809- P1-03, a total of 13  healthy participants were exposed to PLN -74809 at 
20 and 40 mg for up to 7 days. Overall, the study showed that PLN -74809 was well toler ated 
and led to suppression of TGF -β signaling in the lung at the 40 mg dose.  
In Study PLN -74809- 106 (Relative Bioavailability Study), a total of 24 healthy participants 
were exposed to a single dose of 40 mg PLN -74809 in either oral solution or tablet 
formulation. There were no notable differences in the safety and tolerability of the 
2 formulations.  
In Study PLN -74809- 107 (mass balance study), 12 healthy participants received a single 
40 mg dose of 14C-labelled PLN -74809. PLN -74809 was excreted mainly via the feces, and 
was safe and well tolerated. One minor metabolite was detected in plasma.  
Overall, all the completed studies showed that SAD and MAD admini stration of PLN -74809 
was safe and well tolerated.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional detailed information on these 
studies.  
1.1.2 Ongoing Phase 1 Study PLN -74809-104 
Study PLN -74809- 104 is a continued evaluation of higher single and multiple doses of 
PLN -74809 in healthy participants. To date, participants have received single doses of 
PLN -74809 up to 640 mg and multiple doses of PLN -74809 up to 320 mg. 
PLN -74809 showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile after up to 7 days of tre atment, 
with no new safety concerns observed during this dose -escalation study. There were no 
clinically significant alterations in vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) or laboratory 
parameters across either the SAD or MAD cohorts indicative of a safety signal. There were 
no deaths reported during or after the study period.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional detailed information on this study. 
(Note that analysis of data from single doses greater than 320 mg and multiple doses greate r 
than 160 mg is ongoing.) 
1.1.3 Ongoing Phase 2 studies  
Four Phase 2 studies evaluating doses of PLN -74809 are ongoing.  
Study PLN -74809- IPF-201 is a Phase 2a open- label study to evaluate the effect of 
PLN -74809 on α vβ6 receptor occupancy using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
in participants with IPF evaluating single doses ranging from 60 to 320 mg. Evaluation of 
target engagement and the safety and tolerability of PLN -74809 is currently ongoing and no 
new safety concerns have been identified.  
Study P LN-74809- IPF-202 is a Phase 2a, multicenter, 3 -part, randomized, double -blind, 
dose- ranging, placebo- controlled evaluation of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of once daily treatment with PLN -74809 for 12 weeks in participants with IPF.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 17  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Study PLN -74809- PSC-203 is a Phase 2a, multicenter, 2 -part, randomized, double -blind, 
dose- ranging, placebo- controlled evaluation of the safety, tolerability and PK of once daily 
treatment with PLN -74809 for 12  weeks in participants with PSC and suspected l iver 
fibrosis.  
Study PLN -74809- ARDS -204 is a Phase 2a, multicenter, 3 -part, randomized, double -blind, 
dose- ranging, placebo- controlled evaluation of the safety, tolerability and PK of once daily 
treatment with PLN -74809 for 7- 14 days in participants with ARDS associated with at least 
severe COVID -19.  
At the time of protocol finalization, safety and tolerability data from these ongoing Phase 2 
studies suggest no new safety concerns.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional detailed infor mation on these 
studies.  
1.2 Study Rationale for PLN -74809- IPF-205 
IPF is characterized by excessive type 1 collagen deposition in the lungs that replaces healthy 
parenchymal tissue with collagen -rich scar. As the disease advances , progressive 
architectural di stortion and dysfunction ensues resulting in often subtle but limiting 
breathlessness, fatigue and cough. TGF -β is an important pleotropic cytokine that is a key 
regulator of tissue fibrogenesis in both normal wound repair and pathologic fibroproliferative 
diseases such as IPF. TGF -β is constitutively secreted and bound within the extracellular 
matrix in its latent or inactive form. Release or activation of latent TGF -β may occur with 
proteolytic cleavage via plasmin or matrix metalloproteinases, or interaction with several different integrins, namely α
vβ6 (expressed on epithelial cells) and α vβ1 (expressed on 
fibro blasts) in the lung. In IPF, α vβ6 and αvβ1 expression are increased with a resultant 
increase in TGF -β signaling and its downstream pro- fibrotic targets, notably COL1A1.  
PLN -74809 is an oral, once -daily, dual -selective inhibitor of α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrins in 
development for the treatment of IPF, with orphan drug designation granted by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). PLN -74809 was generally well tolerated in over 
180 participants treated to date in clinical studies, with single doses up to 320 mg  and 
multiple doses up to 160 mg once daily; additionally, single doses of up to 640 mg and 
multiple doses of 320 mg were evaluated and preliminary blinded data have not identified new safety concerns . The binding of PLN -74809 inhibits the interaction of these integrins 
with latency associated peptide and blocks the release of free TGF -β into the extracellular 
matrix for subsequent binding to its receptor and activation of profibrotic pathways, 
including collagen synthesis. Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) generated from IPF patient 
lungs collected during transplant were used to evaluate the ability of PLN -74809 to block 
TGF -β activation and collagen gene expression in fibrotic human lung tissue ex vivo. 
Following 7 days incubation with PLN -74809 (200 nM or 1820 nM), collagen gene 
expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation (a marker of TGF -β signaling) in IPF patient PCLS 
were significantly reduced by approximately 50%. In vivo efficacy studies of PLN -74809 
were also performed using the bleomycin mouse model of pul monary fibrosis. In a 
prophylactic treatment study (PLN -74809 administered orally or via minipump from 1 to 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 18  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  14 days post -bleomycin challenge), PLN -74809 significantly decreased Ashcroft score, total 
hydroxyproline levels, new collagen synthesis, and phosphorylation of SMAD3 in lung 
tissue, confirming inhibition of collagen deposition via a reduction in TGF -β signaling.  
Similar effects were observed with therapeutic treatment with PLN -74809 in the bleomycin 
model (oral administration from 7 to 21 days post -bleomycin challenge). Lung 
hydroxyproline levels were significantly reduced and morphometric analysis of lung tissue showed a dose -dependent and significant reduction in interstitial fibrillar collagen deposition 
in mice treated with PLN -74809. These data suggest that PLN -74809 is expected to decrease 
new collagen formation in the lungs of patients with IPF, which will be evaluated in this study.  
68Ga-CBP8, a PET radiotracer that binds specifically to type 1 collagen, has previously been 
shown to detect and quantify elevated collagen levels in patients with IPF compared to healthy individuals, particularly in the subpleural regions of the lung where fibrosis is known 
to be prominent ( Montesi et al, 2019 ). Importantly, increased collagen tra cer signal was also 
noted in radiographically normal areas on computerized tomography (CT) prior to architectural distortion, indicating the 
68Ga-CBP8 probe may be more sensitive than HRCT 
in detecting active and/or early fibrosis. Furthermore, 68Ga-CBP8 u ptake in mouse lungs has 
been shown to correlate with levels of fibrosis following injury, with data suggesting that the 
tracer more readily binds newly formed collagen in active disease than established mature 
collagen. PLN -74809 consistently, and in a dose -dependent manner, reduced COL1A1  
expression in murine models of bleomycin lung injury and PCLS. These findings suggest that 
68Ga-CBP8 may be an effective tool for measuring disease activity (e.g., recently deposited 
pulmonary collagen levels) and therefore a powerful tool for evaluating efficacy of anti-fibrotic agents such as PLN -74809 in clinical studies. Therefore, in the proposed 
12-week study of PLN -74809, the measurement of 
68Ga-CBP8 PET ligand wi ll serve two 
functions ; changes over time will provi de an exploratory endpoint of both pharmacodynamic 
(PD) activity and  efficacy (reduced collagen levels) of PLN -74809.  
To complement the evaluation of antifibrotic effects in the proposed PLN -74809- IPF-205 
study, ongoing Phase 2 studies conducted in participants with IPF (PLN -74809- IPF-202) or 
PSC (PLN -74809- PSC-203) will assess the safety and tolerability of PLN -74809, along with 
exploratory endpoints relevant to fibrosis. In the PLN -74809- IPF-202 study, exploratory 
efficacy endpoints will be assessed, including change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and 
quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) from baseline following 12 weeks of treatment with 
PLN -74809. These established (FVC) and exploratory assessments of progressive disease 
and collagen deposition in IPF will complement the current study, which will be first of its kind to quantify changes in type 1 collagen in the lungs of participants with IPF following 
12 weeks of treatment with PLN -74809 using 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/ magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) tracer upta ke.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 2a, single -center, randomized, double -blinded, placebo- controlled study to 
evaluate type 1 collagen deposition in the lungs following once -daily (QD) treatment with 
160 mg PLN -74809 for 12 weeks in participants with IPF.  
The study consists of an up to 28- day screening period, a 12- week treatment period, and a 
2-week (±3 days) post treatment follow -up period.  
Potential participants who provide written informed consent will be screened for study 
eligibility up to 28 days before administration of the first dose of study drug. Approximately 
12 eligible participants will be randomized in a 2 :1 ratio (160 mg PLN -74809 vs placebo; 
8 receiving PLN -74809 and 4 receiving placebo) on Day 1 (Visit 3). Study treatment will be 
administered once daily for 12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by use of standard of 
care (SoC) IPF therapy with pirfe nidone or nintedanib (SoC  use; yes or no).  
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI scans will be conducted within 7 days prior to baseline and at or within 
7 days prior to Week 12 , as indicated in the Schedule of Events  (Appendix 1 ). 
Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 12 weeks of 
treatment will be encouraged to remain in the study to complete all remaining assessments; if 
this is not  feasible, they will be asked to return to the clinic for an Early Termination (ET) 
visit for follow -up evaluations. If a participant elects to withdraw from the study after the 
6th week of randomization, an end of participation 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI will be offered to 
the participant to enhance appropriate data capture.  
Potential acute exacerbations, respiratory -related hospitalizations, and/or respiratory -related 
deaths will be reviewed by an adjudication committee.  
3.2 Rationale for PLN -74809 Doses and Control Group  
This study will quantify type 1 collagen expression in the lung following PLN -74809 
exposure, as assessed by changes from baseline in 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI tracer uptake 
patterns following 12 weeks of treatment with 160 mg of PLN -74809, administered once  
daily. Available safety, tolerability and PK data from Study PLN -74809- 104 and Study 
PLN -74809- IPF-202 (i.e., Part B evaluating 40 mg once daily for 12 weeks; Part C has 
initiated and will evaluate doses of 80 or 160 mg once daily, in parallel groups) support 
evaluation of a dose of 160 mg, which is expected to achieve the target 80% inhibitory 
concentration (IC 80) for α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrin -mediated TGF -β1 activation (IC 80 
∼2300 ng/mL) for approximately 8 hours and the target IC 50 (∼500 ng/mL) for 24 hour s.  
PLN -74809 160 mg is the highest dose evaluated in the ongoing dose ranging Study 
PLN -74809- IPF-202. 
To complement prior and ongoing safety evaluations, the safety, tolerability and PK of 
PLN -74809 in participants with IPF, with or without co- administra tion with SoC 
(pirfenidone or nintedanib) will also be assessed. The proposed randomized, double -blind 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 21  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  study design allows a reduction in bias in the assessment of type 1 collagen expression and of 
drug safety and tolerability. Stratification for background treatment with SoC will ensure a 
similar proportion of participants on SoC in each treatment group. The proposed sample size 
and 12- week treatment duration are expected to provide meaningful PK information in the 
IPF population, comparing PLN -74809 to placebo. The proposed randomization strategy in 
this exploratory study, 2:1 (PLN -74809 : placebo), will allow for determination of change in 
type 1 collagen deposition over 3 months and the impact of PLN -74809, which is expected to 
lead to decreased type 1 collagen expression within the lung based on localized inhibition of 
TGF -β signaling.  
The evaluation of PLN -74809 160 mg QD is supported by safety and PK data evaluating 
multiple doses of 160 mg from study PLN -74809- 104. In Study PLN -74809-104, 
PLN -74809 showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in healthy participants after 
single doses of up to 320 mg and after 7 days of treatment at doses of up to 160 mg, as 
described in the Investigator's Brochure; additionally, single doses of up to 640 mg and 
multiple doses of 320 mg were evaluated and preliminary blinded data have not identified 
new safety concerns ( Section 1.1.2 ). The safety margins determined after single doses of up 
to 320 mg and multiple doses up to 160 mg were calculated using the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) observed in monkeys for both area under the plasma concentration-
time curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24) and maximum observed drug concentration 
(Cmax) for the measured unbound concentrations of PLN -74809. At all dose levels studied, 
there was a substantial margin between the unbound AUC 0-24 and the monkey NOAEL. See 
PLN -74809 Investigator’s Brochure for more details.  
 
The evaluation of PLN -74809 is also supported by safety and PK data from participants with 
IPF enrolled in study PLN -74809- IPF-202; in Part B, PLN -74809 showed a favorable safety 
and tolerability profile after daily doses of 40 mg for up to 12 w eeks. No related 
treatment -emergent serious adverse events  (SAEs)  were reported, no new safety concerns 
were identified to date and the DSMB recommended continuation to Part C, evaluating 
PLN -74809 doses of 80 mg and 160 mg QD, without any modifications.  
Taken together, the accumulating data from completed and ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 
evaluations of PLN -74809 continue to highlight its favorable safety and tolerability profile 
and support the evaluation of the dose of 160 mg QD administered for 12 weeks in this study.   
3.3 Study Duration  
Participants will be on study for up to 18 weeks (4 weeks of screening, 12 weeks of treatment 
with study drug and 2 weeks of follow up).

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  5 STUDY DRUG AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
5.1 Description of Study Drug  
5.1.1 Study Drug  
The zwitterion PLN -74809- 000, and the phosphate salt PLN -74809- 020 are derivatives of the 
parent form PLN -74809. Both are formulated as immediate -release tablets.  In this study, the 
phosphate form will be tested, hereafter referred to as PLN -74809. 
PLN -74809 drug product is supplied as 80- mg immed iate release tablets. The PLN -74809 
tablets are manufactured by dry granulation with standard excipients (microcrystalline 
cellulose, mannitol, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, and butylated hydroxytoluene), tablet compression, and spray coating of tablet s.  
5.1.2 Placebo  
A corresponding matching placebo will be provided.  
5.1.3 PET Tracer   
The 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI tracer is not considered a study treatment but is an investigational 
tool used during the PET procedure for obtaining the images necessary for this trial.  
[68Ga]CBP8  is given as an  intravenous injection within 7 days prior to baseline and at or 
within 7 days prior to Week 12 . The radiochemical dose  is up to 12.9 mCi but in practice, the 
dose has averaged 5.5 mCi per subject.  
 
5.2 Packaging and Labeling  
The PLN -74809 oral tablets will be packaged in high- density polyethylene bottles with 
desiccant canisters. Details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.3 Storage and Accountability  
The study drug should be stored refrigerated at  2°C to 8°C and protected from light, whether 
at the site pharmacy or at the participant’s home.  
All used and unused study medication bottles must be returned to the study site at the 
Week  4, 8, and 12 visits in order to perform accountability.  
5.4 Treatment C ompliance 
Dosing will be performed in the presence of site staff every time the participant is on site on 
dosing days. For offsite dosing, participants will be provided with a dosing log in which they 
will collect dosing information for PLN -74809 and, if applicable, nintedanib or pirfenidone 
doses taken at home. Participants should return all used and unused medication bottles to the 
site at each site visit.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 27  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Treatment compliance will be calculated comparing the amount of drug dispensed and drug 
returned. 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 28  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  6 STUDY TREATMENTS  
6.1 Description of Treatments  
160 mg of PLN -74809 or matching placebo administered orally QD  (2 tablets)  
PLN -74809 and matching placebo will be supplied by Pliant as a tablet for oral 
administration. Study drug will be taken once daily at approximately 24- hour intervals.  
6.2 Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
There will be no dose modifications of the study drug. If the study drug needs to be 
interrupted for safety or tolerability issues, this should happen, as feasible, in consultation 
with the Sponsor Study Director, who together with the Investigator will assess and decide 
whether the study drug interruption should be temporary or permanent on a case by case 
basis. Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 12 
weeks of treatment will be asked to remain in the study to complete all remaining 
assessments; if this is not fe asible, then they will be asked to return to the clinic for an early 
termination visit.  
Dose modifications or interruptions of pirfenidone or nintedanib treatment may be 
implemented only for safety and tolerability reasons (e.g., liver enzyme elevation; se e 
Section  9), in accordance with their corresponding prescribing information and in 
consultation with the Sponsor Study Director. This should not affe ct the administration of the 
study drug or the continuation of participants in the study.  
6.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Participant  
Participants will be encouraged to take their study drug at the same time of the day, each day. Participants will take the study drug on an empty stomach (no food for 2 hours before or 
2 hours after dosing) and will drink up to 240 mL (~1 cup of water) after swallowing the 
study drug.  
 
A dose will be considered missed if the participant cannot take the dose within 12 hours of 
their regular dosing time.  
• If a participant has missed a dose of study drug and is still within 12 hours of the time it 
is usually taken, the participant should take a dose of the missed drug as soon as possible. 
The participant may then continue  the usual dosing schedule.  
• If the participant has missed a dose of study drug more than 12 hours after the time it is 
usually taken, the participant should not take the missed dose and should resume the 
usual dosing at the next scheduled time. The participant should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 29  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  6.4 Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups  
Approximately 12 eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (160 mg PLN -74809 
vs placebo). Randomization will be stratified by use of SoC IPF therapy (pirfenidone or 
nintedanib) (SoC  use; yes or no).  
Assignment will be performed in a blinded manner using interactive response technology 
(IRT) based on a previously generated randomization code. Randomization will occur 
immediately  prior to dosing on the morning of the first dose (Day 1).  
6.5 Blinding  
The placebo treatment will resemble the active treatment for tablet shape, size and color. This 
ensures that the participant, Investigator, clinical site study staff, and Sponsor study tea m 
directly involved in trial conduct are unaware of the treatment allocation during the conduct of the study. The PLN -74809 or placebo will be provided as blinded kits and will be assigned 
to participants using a randomization code.  
Procedures will be in place to allow prompt breaking of the blind by the investigator if 
needed for the safety management of a participant. Unblinding at the study site for any other 
reason will be considered a protocol deviation. The investigator is strongly encouraged to 
contact the sponsor  Study Director before unblinding any participant’s treatment assignment, 
but must do so within one working day after the event. A written explanation of the reason for unblinding should be provided to the sponsor within 24 hours of breaking the blind. Refer 
to the IRT User Guide for a description regarding how investigators may access treatment 
information via the IRT system.  
6.6 Concomitant Therapy 
6.6.1 Allowed Medications  
During screening, all medications including over the counter medications and herbal 
supplements taken during the 30 days prior to screening will be recorded and reviewed by the 
Investigator in consultation with the sponsor Study Director to determine whether the 
participant is suitable for inclusion. For other concomitant medications needed during the 
study conduct, the Investigator should consult with the sponsor Study Director as soon as 
feasible.  
Only treatment with approved SoC for IPF (nintedanib or pirfenidone) is allowed. These 
drugs must have been given at a stable dose for at least 3 months before initiation of 
screening and be expected to remain unchanged during the study. In addition, for participants 
receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone, the time of drug administration should be collected each 
day samples are obtained fo r assessing PLN -74809 PK. Treatments to address IPF disease 
symptoms, (e.g., cough, gastroesophageal reflux disease, etc.) are allowed.  
Other medications to provide reasonable patient care of comorbidities are allowed during the 
study; however, these should only be used if necessary because, at this stage of development, 
no formal drug- drug interaction studies with PLN -74809 have been performed. If used, all 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 30  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  concomitant medications including both prescription and nonprescription drugs should first 
be discussed with the Sponsor Study Director before administration. This requirement does 
not apply in the case of urgent, necessary treatment of AEs. In all cases, medications, including over the counter medications and herbal supplements, taken by participants during 
the course of the study will be recorded using the generic name of the medication.  
Prolonged treatment with high doses of systemic corticosteroids may induce CYP3A4 and 
reduce PLN -74809 concentrations; if such treatment is required, this must be discussed and 
approved by the Sponsor Study Director . 
PLN -74809 is a moderate inhibitor of P -gp and multidrug toxin extrusion transporter 
(MATE1). Participants who receive substrates of these transporters should be monitored for 
potential tolerability issues.  
This includes monitoring for signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis, which has been 
reported in patients receiving metformin, a substrate for MATE1. Symptoms of lactic 
acidosis include: malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pai n. 
Laboratory abnormalities include elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL. If lactic acidosis is 
suspected or confirmed, metformin must be discontinued immediately, and the participant 
should undergo clinical evaluation and appropriate management. The Sponsor Study 
Director should be notified within 24  hours of any suspected or confirmed onset of 
lactic acidosis.   
Coadministration of nintedanib with P -glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may 
increase or decrease nintedanib exposure, respectively (see local prescribing information). As PLN -74809 is a moderate inhibitor of P -gp (but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4), 
participants receiving nintedanib should be mo nitored for potential tolerability issues, 
including treatment -emergent elevations in liver enzymes (See Section 9). 
6.6.2 Disallowed Medications  
Treatment  with potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, 2C9 or 2C19 or, potent inhibitors 
or inducers of P -gp, BCRP or OATP1B1/1B3 transporters is prohibited. This includes 
fluconazole (a strong inhibitor of 2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of 2C9 and 3A4), which is 
disallowed.   
Treatment with digoxin, which has a narrow therapeutic window and is a substrate for P -gp, 
is not allowed since PLN -74809 is a moderate inhibitor of this transporter (IC
50 9.98 µM) 
and could increase digoxin exposures.  
Use of rifampin (a potent inducer of CYP3A4) is not allowed, as it is expected to result in reduced PLN -74809 concentrations.  
 Grapefruit or grapefruit -containing foods and beverage are not allowed.  
 
St. John's wort is not allowed.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 31  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Treatment with a disallowed medication, other investigational drug or investigational device 
is prohibited within 30 days or, in the case of medications, 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) 
before screening.  
6.7 Restrictions  
6.7.1 Prior Therapy  
Previous use of IPF SoC treatment (pirfenidone or nintedanib) is allowed for participation in 
this study.  
6.7.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
Participants should be dosed with the study drug on an empty stomach (no food for 2 hours 
before or 2 hours after dosing). Dosing should be accompanied by approximately 240 mL 
water (1 cup).  
6.7.3 Participant Activity Restrictions  
Smoking of any kind is not permitted within 3 months of screening and throughout the study.  
6.7.4 Contraception  
Female Participants of Childbearing Potential  
Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use a contraceptive method with a 
failure rate of <1% per year or remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse, if that 
is their preferred and established lifestyle) during the treatment pe riod and for 1 month after 
the last dose of study treatment.   
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if:   
• She has not reached a postmenopausal state, defined as ≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause or 6 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle -stimulating hormone [FSH] levels 
>40 mIU/mL  
• She has not undergone surgical sterilization, defined as hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy  
Examples of contraceptiv e methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include:  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Male sterilization (>3 months from Day 1 or provide a zero sperm count)  
• Hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation (initiated >3 months from Day 1)  
• Hormone- releasing intr auterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1)  
• Copper intrauterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1)  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 32  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Male Participants  
Male participants, including those who are surgically sterile, must agree to use contraceptive 
measures, as defined below, or alternately to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse)   
• Male participants, with female partners of childbearing potential, must use a condom 
plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% 
per year or  remain abstinent during the treatment period and for at least 3 months 
after the last dose of study treatment.  
• Male participants with pregnant female partners are excluded from this study.  
• Male participants whose female partners become pregnant during the study must stop 
the medication immediately as outlined in Section 8.6. 
Female and Male Participants  
Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those with a failure rate of < 1% per 
year (adapted from Trussell,  2004; CTFG 2014).  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the durati on of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  Complete abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method when refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatment.   
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 33  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The Schedule of Events with study activities is provided in Appendix 1 . 
When several assessments are required at the same time point, evaluations should be 
completed so that the PK sample is collected at the required time. It is understood that other 
assessments such as ECGs, vital signs, etc. will be performed as close to the time point as possible. 
7.1 Informed Consent  
Written and dated informed consent, describing the study and all anticipated risks of 
participation must be obtained from each study participant prior  to any study- related 
procedures being performed.  
7.2 Medical History  
Medical history of the previous 5 years will be reviewed and recorded at screening. It should also include any relevant information or condition relevant to the purposes of this study, regar dless of the timeframe.  
7.3 Demographic Information  
Date of birth, sex, ethnicity, and race will be recorded at screening.  
7.4 Physical Examination  
Complete and targeted physical examinations will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Event s (Appendix 1 ). Complete physical examinations include general 
appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, dentition, thyroid, chest (heart, lungs), abdome n, 
skin, neurological, extremities, back, neck, musculoskeletal, and lymph nodes. Targeted 
physical examination after screening will only be performed based on prior findings in the 
general exam, and includes head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, 
musculoskeletal and lymph nodes, and any pertinent system based on any prior findings. 
Physical examinations may be performed at various unscheduled time points if deemed necessary by an Investigator.  
7.5 Vital Signs  
Blood pressure and heart rate  will be recorded with participants having rested for at least 
3 minutes in a supine position. Body temperature (preferably by ear) will be measured and 
peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO
2) will be measured using a finger pulse oximeter.  
7.6 Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate 12‑lead ECGs will be obtained at the visits specified in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1). ECG collection during the study will be  performed using standardized 
equipment and centrally read. ECGs will be collected prior to a time -matched PK sample at 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 34  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  least 2 hours postdose). Additional 12‑lead ECGs may be obtained at other times if clinically 
indicated, using unscheduled visits. All ECGs should be obtained after the participant has 
rested quietly in the supine position for at least 10 minutes with the triplicate ECGs recorded 
within ~ 5 to 10 minutes. The triplicate ECGs will be averaged and the mean values per time 
point (average of t he 3 assessments) used to interpret the ECG tracings. QT correction will 
utilize the Fridericia Method ( Fridericia 1920).  
The Investigator (or designee) will evaluate the ECG tracings and will record 1 of the 
following interpretations on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs): normal; abnormal, not 
clinically significant; or abnormal, clinically significant. Clinically significant changes from 
baseline in ECG findings will be recorded as AEs. Refer to the ECG Manual for more 
information. 
7.7 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
7.7.1 Laboratory Parameters  
Participants will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. Safety laboratory 
tests (hematology, serum chemistry and coagulation) will be collected from fasting (at least 
8 hours) participants where appropria te. Results from these safety laboratory assessments 
will be recorded in the electronic data capture (EDC) as detailed in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1). including at the end of treatment or at early termination. A detailed list of 
laboratory tests is provided in Table 1. Creatinine clearance will be calculated using the 
Cockcroft- Gault equation.  
The Investigator will review the results of all laboratory tests as they become available and will ascertain if any laboratory value is abnormal or represents a clinically significant change 
from baseline for the individual participant. If a laboratory value is determined to be 
abnormal and to represent a clinically significant change from baseline for the participant, the 
Investigator will determine if it qualifies as an AE. If “yes,” the abnormality will be reported 
on the AE eCRF. All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that occur during the 
study and that were not present at baseline should be followed and evaluated with additional tests, i f necessary, until diagnosis of the underlying cause or resolution.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  7.9 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
On Day 1, total and unbound plasma samples for PLN -74809 PK analysis will be obtained 
predose and at 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose.  
At steady -state, total and unbound plasma samples for PLN -74809 PK analysis will be 
obtained predose and at least 2 hours postdose at Weeks 4 and 12, as indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 ). Samples will be obtained and stored as detailed in the 
study manual.  
The actual collection time of each sample, as well as the dosing time, must be recorded in the 
source data and on the eCRF. If the participant discontinues the study early, a plasma sample for PK should be taken at the ET visit if possible.  
Aliquots of these PK samples may be used to measure nintedanib and/or pirfenidone concentrations in those participants who are receiving background SoC.  
If participants experience treatment -emergent elevations in liver enzymes or ECG 
abnormalities, additional PK samples will be collected at the time of repeat laboratory or 
ECG testing (See Sections 9 and 10). 
7.10 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
7.10.1  PET/MRI Imaging for the Assessment of Type 1 Collagen Deposition  
All PET/MRI will be performed at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at 
Massachusetts General Hospital. PET imaging  will be performed at prespecified times 
according to the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1) using the collagen- targeted tracer, 
68Ga-CBP8 as synthesized at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and following 
predefined instructions as detailed in the Radiology Manual for the study. The radiochemical dose is up to 12.9 mCi per administration; but in practice, the dose  averages to  5.5 mCi per 
subject . The total amount of radiation exposure from the  PET/MRI  is equal to a whole -body 
exposure up to 22 mSv (11 mSv per admin istration  of 
68GaCBP8).  Blood samples will be 
obtained prior to each PET/MRI and will be stored for future analyses. Details for blood sample collection and processing are detailed in the Radiology Manual.  
7.10.2  MRI for the Assessment of PET /MRI Relationship  
All participants will undergo dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI during each PET/MRI session. 
This will be performed using gadoterate meglumine at a predefined weight -base dose and 
injection rate, as detailed in the study’s Radiology Manual. Additional MRI sequences for anatomic assessment will be performed as detailed in the Radiology Manual.  
7.10.3  Biomarkers in Urine, Plasma, and Serum  
Urine, plasma and serum samples will be obtained at predetermined times as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 ). These samples will be used to measure specific proteins, 
peptides, metabolites and/or mRNA transcripts that may be elevated in patients with 
inflammatory/fibrotic disease or act as PD markers that may change with inhibition of α
vβ6.

7.11 Pharmacogenomics  
A whole blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation will be collected before 
dosing on Day 1 from each participant in the study. The DNA samples will be analyzed to 
evaluate drug metabolic enzyme and transporter polymorphisms that may contribute to the 
variability in PK  of PLN -74809. Detailed instructions for the handling and shipping of 
samples will be provided in the study manual.  
7.12 Exploratory Efficacy Assessments  
7.12.1  Spirometry  
Absolute FVC volume and FVC percent of predicted will be assessed by spirometry at 
screening and  at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 ). A 
historical value may be used if it has been completed within 1 month from the Basel ine visit.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 38  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  FEV1 will be assessed by spirometry at screening. A historical value may be used if it has 
been completed within 1 month from the Baseline visit.  
7.12.2  Patient- reported Outcome (PRO)  
Study participants will respond to a VAS for cough severity at the t imepoints specified in the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 ). 
7.13 Concomitant Medication and Adverse Event Assessments  
At each study visit, participants will be asked about how they are feeling and what medications they are taking (have started/stopped, adjusted dose, etc.).  
7.14 Missed Assessments 
Missed assessments will reported as such and will not be imputed.  
7.15 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Collagen accumulation within the lungs of patients with fibrotic lung disease, particularly 
those with IPF, is the hallmark of disease progression and associated with substantial 
mortality.  The changes in the PET ligand 
68Ga-CBP8 correlate with disease progression and 
may be a more sensitive measure of active disease, with 68Ga-CBP8 preferentially binding to 
recently synthesized collagen over mature, organized collagen. Consistent with the 
mechanism of action of PLN -74809, changes in the PET ligand 68Ga-CBP8 w ill support the 
role of 68Ga-CBP8 as an important biomarker of disease activity, as well as  evidence of PD  
effect and efficacy of PLN -74809 (decrease in collagen levels)  in participants  with IPF.  
Collection of AEs, safety labs, vital signs, physical examinations and ECG recordings are standard well -established parameters to assess the safety and tolerability of pharmacological 
agents.  
PK samples will be analyzed according to predefined validated analytical methods to assess the concentrations of PLN -74809 in plasma.  
FVC is a standard measure collected according to current ATS guidelines for the 
measurement of IPF progression. The VAS scale for the assessment of cough will follow 
recommendations from the ERS Guidelines ( Morice et al, 2007).  
When available, appropriate standard guidelines will be used.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Timing  
In this study, AEs will be collected from the time the participant signs the ICF until the 
participant's last study visit.  
8.2 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any event, side effect, or other untoward medical occurrence that occurs in conjunction with the use of a study drug in humans, whether or not considered to have a 
causal relationship to this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or 
a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/ serious adverse 
event [SAE]).  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
- Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE  
- Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or convenience admission to a hospital)  
- Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
 
If there is evidence of an AE through report or observation, the Investigator or designee will evaluate further and record the following information:  
• Time of onset and resolution 
• Severity  
• Causality/relation to study treatment  
• Action taken regarding study drug  
• Outcome 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 40  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  8.3 Severity of an Adverse Event  
Grading the severity of AEs will use the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) grading system (Version 5.0), as described below. The clinical significance of the 
AE is  determined by the Investigator. The Investigator is encouraged to consult with the 
Study Director.  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabli ng; limiting 
self-care ADL**  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
*Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, 
using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self- care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.

8.4 Causal Relationship of an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will assess the relation ship between study drug and the occurrence of each 
AE. The Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of each AE to study drug will be 
recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history, 
concomitant therapy, other  risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study drug should be considered and investigated, if appropriate. The following definitions 
are general guidelines to help assign grade of attribution.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 41  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug (PLN -74809 or placebo) should be 
assessed using clinical judgment and the following considerations:  
No  
(not related):  Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study 
drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre -existing 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  
Yes 
(related):  A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration of the 
study drug that cannot be readily explained by the participant’s clinical state or concomitant therapies. Furthermore, the AE appears with some degree of 
certainty to be related, based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic 
actions or AE profile of the study drug. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the AE abates or resolves and reappears upon re -challenge.  
 
The relationship to study procedures (such as venipuncture) should be assessed using the 
following considerations:  
No 
(not related):  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other  than the study procedure  
Yes 
(related):  The AE occurred as a result of protocol -mandated procedures.  
 8.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE will be recorded on the AE eCRF as follows:  
• Recovered / Resolved  
• Recovering / Resolving 
• Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae 
• Not Recovered / Not Resolving  
• Fatal  
• Unknown 
 8.6 Pregnancy  
A pregnancy is not an AE. If a female participant or the female partner of a male study 
participant becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study following administration of study 
drug and within 30 or 90 days, respectively, after administration of the last dose of study 
drug, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of the 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 42  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  pregnancy. Administration of study drug will be discontinued immediately, and the 
participant or the female partner of a male study participant will be fo llowed through the 
outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator is required to provide all the relevant information 
to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Information Form to do so.  
The pregnancy will be followed through delivery. If the pregnancy results in a c ongenital 
anomaly/birth defects, this will be considered and reported as an SAE as per definition 
detailed in Section 8.8. 
8.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse  Events  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (eg, ECG, vital signs) per se are not reported as AEs. However, those 
abnormal findings that are deemed clinically significant or are ass ociated with signs and/or 
symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE, as described in Section 8.2 (or recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious , as described in 
Section 8.8). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other abnormal findings that a re 
detected after consent or that are present at baseline and worsen after consent are included as AEs (and SAEs if serious).  
The Investigator should exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. 
Usually, the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom, or 
be likely to result in an evident sign or symptom in the near term, to be considered clinically 
significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical 
symptoms may jeopardize the participant and may require intervention to prevent immediate 
consequences. For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be 
accompanied by coma or convulsions, yet be of a magnitude to require glucose 
administration to prevent such sequelae.  
8.8 Serious Adverse Events  
8.8.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Is life -threatening  
- An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the opinion of either the Investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Results in death  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (ie, admission) or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Except:  
- An emergency room visit without hospitalization is not considered fulfilling the 
serious criteria of hospitalization.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 43  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  - Planned hospitalization or surgical procedures for an illness or disease which existed 
before the participant was enrolled in the clinical trial is not considered an SAE 
unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event  
- An event that does not fulfill any of the serious criteria above, but is considered t o be 
clinically significant and may jeopardize the participant, or when medical or surgical intervention may be required to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
- Examples of such events include, but are not limited to: laboratory abnormalities 
meeting  the criteria for suspected drug induced liver injury (DILI) or QT prolongation 
that lead to permanent study drug discontinuation, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment at an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
8.8.2 Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open 
question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. Any clinically 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE 
and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF. When possible, signs and 
symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive 
event.  
8.8.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to meet the requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific 
requirements to applicable regulatory authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/ 
Independent Ethics Committee (IECs)/ Research Ethics Boards (REBs), all SAEs must be 
reported to the Sponsor per the Study Manual  within 24 hours from the time site personnel 
first become aware of the event  by completing the SAE form and emailing it to the below:  
ctisafety@ctifacts.com  
Initial notification of an SAE by telephone must be confirmed in writing within 24 hours by 
completing the SAE form. As further information regarding the SAE becomes available, such 
follow up information should be documented and sent to ctisafety@ctifacts.com. 
All SAEs must be followed by the Investigator to resolution or medical stabilization.  
Withdraw al from the study in the event of a SAE and therapeutic measures taken shall be at 
the discretion of the Investigator. A full explanation for the discontinuation from the study 
should be made in the eCRF.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 44  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  8.8.4 Reporting SAEs to Regulatory Authorities and IRB/IE C/REB  
The reporting of any SAEs to applicable regulatory authorities will be the responsibility of 
the Sponsor in compliance with applicable country regulations. All SAEs must be reported to the IRB/IEC/REB by the Investigator in accordance with their regulations.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  9 MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF ELEVATED LIVER 
BIOCHEMISTRY TESTS  
Reference ranges for key liver biochemistry tests are shown in Table 2 .  
Table 2 Reference Ranges for Key Laboratory Liver Function Tests  
Parameter  Reference Range  
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  10 – 55 U/L  
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  10 – 40 U/L  
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  45 – 115 U/L  
Total bilirubin  0.0 – 1.0 mg/dL  
 
Participants who experience treatment -emergent elevations in serum ALT or AST that reach 
the thresholds listed below must be managed carefully:  
• ALT or AST ≥ 8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN  for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN  and (Total Bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio [INR] >1.5)  
• ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN  with liver -related symptoms including the appearance of 
fatigue , nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (> 5%)  
 
Participants must return to the study site for reevaluation within 48 to 72  hours after the 
abnormal laboratory results become available for confirmatory  testing serum levels of ALT, 
AST, total and direct bilirubin, and INR. A PK sample must be obtained at the same time that 
the repeat clinical laboratory samples are drawn, and the date and time of the PK draw and the last dose of study drug (and that of pirfenidone or nintedanib, if applicable) must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
If prompt evaluation is not possible within 48 to 72 hours after receipt of the abnormal 
laboratory results, study drug should be interrupted immediately (date of last study 
drug dose [and that of pirfenidone or nintedanib, if applicable]  must be recorded in the 
eCRF), and the participant must return to the study site as soon as possible for reevaluation . The Sponsor Study Director  should be notified of laboratory abnormalities and 
any clinical symptoms within 48  hours of the availability of laboratory results and/or 
assessment of clinical symptoms.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 46  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Participants who experience treatment -emergent elevations in ALT or AST ≥  2 × ULN  (but 
< 3 × ULN) should be managed as follows:  
• Participants  must return to the study site for reevaluation within 48 to 72  hours after the 
abnormal laboratory results become available for confirmatory testing serum levels of 
ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin.  
• A PK sample must be obtained at the same time that the repeat clinical laboratory 
samples are drawn, and the date and time of the PK draw and the last dose of study drug 
(and that of pirfenidone or nintedanib, if applicable) must be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
In the absence of liver -related symptoms and/or elevations in total bilirubin or INR, 
participants with confirmed treatment- emergent elevations in ALT or AST ≥ 2 × ULN (but 
< 3 × ULN), may continue dosing of study drug and be monitored closely with frequent (eg, 
at least once weekly) hepatic labo ratory testing and clinical assessments using unscheduled 
visits, including a thorough causality evaluation and in consultation with the Sponsor Study 
Director . 
Study drug must be permanently discontinued in the event of confirmed elevations in 
serum ALT o r AST that meet the following criteria for suspected acute DILI, based on 
the Guidance for Industry on Drug- Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation 
(FDA, 2009 ).  
Criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug for confirmed ALT or AST 
elevations: 
• Confirmed ALT or AST ≥ 3× ULN with (Total Bilirubin >  2 × ULN or INR >  1.5) 
and/or, presence of liver -related symptoms, if no other etiology is suspected/confirmed 
and liver enzymes are sustained following interruption of study drug  
• Confirmed A LT or AST ≥ 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks, if no other etiology is 
suspected/confirmed and liver enzymes are sustained following interruption of study drug  
• Confirmed ALT or AST ≥ 8× ULN, if no other etiology is suspected/confirmed and liver enzymes are sus tained following interruption of study drug  
 
All elevations in serum ALT and/or AST that are confirmed upon repeat testing AND 
that meet the criteria for suspected DILI (as listed above) must be reported to the 
Sponsor Study Director within 48  hours. The participant must permanently discontinue 
study drug immediately and continue to be followed for close monitoring and causality 
and clinical evaluation as follows:  
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests at least once a week until abnormalities 
stabilize (i.e., levels are clinically comparable to baseline values or baseline grade of 
abnormality) and the participant is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a detailed history of symptoms and prior or concomitant diseases  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 47  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  • Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription or over -the-counter 
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational 
drug use, and special diets  
• Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; alcoholic hepatitis; 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
• Obtain immunoglobulin G1 (IgG -1), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti -smooth muscle 
antibody (anti -SMA), anti -liver-kidney microsome type  1 (anti -LKM1), and anti -liver 
cytosolic antigen type  1 (anti -LC1) levels to be compared with  baseline values, to rule 
out autoimmune hepatitis  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents  
• Consider a gastroenterology or hepatology consultation, which may include a liver biopsy, for definite diagnosis  
 
For participants with confirmed elevations in liver enzymes (as described above) warranting 
temporary interruption of study drug but not meeting permanent drug discontinuation criteria 
as stated above, more frequent hepatic laboratory testing and clinical assessments must be 
conducted using unscheduled visits, including a thorough causality evaluation and in consultation with the Sponsor Study Director .  
Reinitiation of study drug can only be considered if another etiology is identified and 
confirmed and if  liver abnormalities have returned to baseline values. The decision to 
restart study drug must be discussed and approved in consultation with the Sponsor 
Study Director prior to reinitiation .  
Participants who permanently discontinue study drug due to pote ntial liver toxicity must be 
followed for close monitoring until abnormalities stabilize to baseline levels or baseline 
grade of abnormality and the participant is asymptomatic. Participants should be encouraged 
to remain in the study and completed all scheduled visits and assessments. Long- term 
follow- up information should be provided for participants who permanently discontinue drug 
due to potential liver toxicity, including information on immunosuppressive therapy and new 
liver histology.

Any participant who experiences a treatment -emergent QT interval corrected for heart rate 
(QTc) prolongation of Grade 2 or higher must return to the study site for prompt clinical 
evaluation after the abnormal ECG results become available and to repeat the safety ECG 
assessment. A PK sample must be obtained at the same visit that the repeat ECG assessment is performed, and the date and time of the PK draw and the last dose of study drug (and that 
of pirfenidone or nintedanib, if applicable) must be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Grade 2 QTcF interval > 480 but ≤  500 msec; or increased > 30 to ≤  60 msec from 
baseline value → The participant must return to the study site within 48 to 72 hours.  
• Grade 3: QTcF interval > 500 msec or increased > 60 msec from baseline valu e → The 
participant must return to the study site within 24 hours or, if not feasible, to a local 
clinic or hospital for immediate clinical evaluation.  
 Clinical evaluation must include the following:  
• Ruling out comorbidities and potential risk factors (eg, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias) 
• Evaluation of electrolyte disturbances (eg, potassium, calcium, and magnesium)  
• Review of potential concomitant medications known to prolong the QTc interval (eg, serotonin receptor antagonists, anti -emetics)  
 
If prompt evaluation is not feasible (as described above and based on severity of 
abnormality), study drug should be interrupted immediately (date of last study drug 
dose [and that of pirfenidone or nintedanib, if applicable]  must be recorded in the 
eCRF),  and the participant must return to the study site as soon as possible for 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 49  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  re-evaluation . The Sponsor Study Director should be notified within 48 hours of the 
availability of initial ECG results and/or assessment of clinical symptoms.  
Study drug must be pe rmanently discontinued in the event of QTc prolongation 
meeting the following criteria:  
• Confirmed Grade 3 abnormality: QTcF interval >  500 msec or increased > 60 msec from 
baseline value  
• Grade 4 abnormality (does not require confirmation): torsade de pointes; polymorphic 
ventricular tachycardia; signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia  
 All treatment -emergent QTc abnormalities meeting the criteria for permanent 
discontinuation (as listed above) must be reported to the Sponsor Study Director within 48 hours. The participant must permanently discontinue study drug immediately and 
continue to be followed for close monitoring and causality and clinical evaluation as 
follows:  
• Repeat ECG at least once weekly until abnormalities stabilize (ie, QTc interval is 
comparab le to baseline value or baseline grade of abnormality, if applicable) and the 
participant is asymptomatic  
• Correction of any electrolyte abnormalities, if applicable 
• Obtain a detailed history of symptoms and comorbidities  
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription or over -the-counter 
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations)  
• Consider a cardiology consultation  
 For participants with confirmed QTc prolongation (as described below) warranting 
temporary interruption of study drug but not meeting permanent drug discontinuation criteria, 
more frequent ECG testing and clinical assessments (at least once weekly) must be 
performed using unscheduled visits, including a thorough causality evaluation and in consul tation with the Sponsor Study Director .  
• Confirmed Grade 2 QTcF interval >480 but ≤  500 msec  
• Confirmed increased > 30 to ≤  60 msec from baseline value 
 
Re-initiation of study drug can only be considered if a more likely etiology is identified and 
if ECG abnormalities have returned to baseline values. The decision to restart study drug must be discussed and approved in consultation with the Sponsor Study D irector prior 
to re- initiation . More frequent clinical monitoring and ECG assessments (at least once 
weekly) after re- initiation of study drug, if applicable, should be performed through use of 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 50  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  unscheduled visits. If the QTc prolongation reoccurs upon re-c hallenge, study drug must 
be permanently discontinued.  
Any participant who experiences a QTc prolongation not confirmed upon repeat ECG 
assessment may continue or resume administration of study drug and follow the scheduled 
study visits, if clinically appr opriate. More frequent clinical evaluation and ECG monitoring 
through use of unscheduled visits is allowed, if clinically warranted.  
Participants who permanently discontinue study drug due to potential QTc prolongation must 
be followed for close monitoring until abnormalities stabilize to baseline levels or baseline 
grade of abnormality and the participant is asymptomatic. Participants should be encouraged 
to remain in the study and completed all scheduled visits and assessments. Long- term 
follow- up information should be provided for participants who permanently discontinue drug 
due to confirmed QTc prolongation, including information on corrective therapy and 
cardiology consultation, if applicable.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  11 EARLY DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY OR INDIVIDUAL 
PARTICIPANTS  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, participants have the right to withdraw from 
the study at any time for any reason. The Investigator or Sponsor may withdraw a participant 
from the study or discontinue study drug for any of the following reas ons: 
• Noncompliance with protocol procedures including those relating to administration of study drug  
• A serious or intolerable AE occurs  
• Infection with COVID -19 that precludes safe participation in the study 
• A clinically significant change in a laboratory p arameter occurs  
• Confirmed elevations in serum ALT or AST meeting criteria for suspected acute DILI 
(see Section 9) 
• Prolonged ECG QTc interval meeting criteria for permanent discontinuation (see Section  10)  
• Male participants whose female partners become pregnant during the study must stop the medic ation immediately  
• The Sponsor or Investigator terminates the study 
• The participant requests to be discontinued from the study 
 
If a participant is withdrawn from the study or discontinues study drug, they will undergo 
early termination assessments; refer t o the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 ).

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 General Considerations  
This is an exploratory study, with exploratory efficacy and biomarker assessments; as such, 
no statistical hypotheses are being tested. In general, data will be summarized using 
statistical summary methods; graphic presentations of data may also be prepared. A statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), prepared and agreed before final database lock, will describe the 
analytic approach and methods in mor e detail.  
12.2 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of approximately 12 participants (8 participants receiving 160 mg 
PLN -74809 and 4 receiving placebo) is expected to provide a meaningful evaluation of 
PLN -74809 safety, tolerability and PK in the target population, and add to the data of 
approximately 21 participants planned to be evaluated at this dose level in an ongoing 
multicenter, dose ranging Phase 2a study (PLN -74809- IPF-202).  
12.3 Analysis Populations  
Safety Population:  All rand omized participants who receive at least one dose of study drug 
will be included in the safety analyses.  
PK Analysis Population:  All randomized participants who have sufficient PLN -74809 
concentration data for PK calculation will be included in the PK anal yses.  
PD Analysis Population:  All randomized participants who receive any amount of study drug 
and who have results from Baseline and from at least one post -baseline PET/MRI scan or PD 
assessment will be included in the PD analyses.  
12.4 Demographics and Basel ine Characteristics  
Data will be summarized using statistical summary methods.  
12.5 Primary Endpoints  
12.5.1  Primary Pharmacodynamic Endpoint  
• Quantification of type 1 collagen in the lung following 12 weeks of treatment, as assessed 
by changes from Baseline in 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI tracer uptake patterns.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  PET/ MRI  
PET/MRI s cans will be interpreted by American Board of Nuclear Medicine (ABNM) -
certified nuclear medicine physicians in an unblinded manner. Lung contours will be 
generated from baseline and post -treatment PET/MRI. Mean and maximum standardized 
uptake value (SUV) measurements of contoured lungs will be calculated using MIMS software, by analyzing the uptake values of 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI within the lung, and by 
comparing values from the baseline and post -treatment scans. Numerical and graphical 
results will be presente d by dose.  
In addition, relationships between PK and type 1 collagen deposition, as well as between MRI and PET imaging, may be evaluated in an exploratory fashion and presented in a 
graphical manner (see Section 12.7.1 ). 
12.6 Secondary Endpoints  
12.6.1  Secondary Safety Endpoint  
• Assessment of the safety and tolerability of PLN -74809 in IPF participants  
 
Safety data from all participants who received at least one dose of study drug will be 
incorporated into the final safety analysis. Further details of the safety analyses will be 
provided in the SAP. AEs will be collected from the time the participant sign s the ICF until 
the last study visit. Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that 
emerged or worsened in severity after the first administration of study drug.  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA®). All 
AEs will be graded for severity per the CTCAE grading scale and listed by participant and summarized by treatment.  
The incidence of AEs, the incidence of TEAEs, the incidence of treatment -related AEs, and 
the severity of AEs will be summarize d by system organ class, preferred term, and maximum 
severity. In cases where a participant reports multiple occurrences of the same event 
(preferred term), the greatest severity will be included in the summary. The number and 
percentage of participants with SAEs and treatment -related SAEs, and the number and 
percentage of participants who withdraw due to an AE will be tabulated by study treatment 
and dose.  
Clinical laboratory test parameters will be listed, using the CTCAE grading scale, for 
individual par ticipants, with values outside the reference ranges flagged. The incidence of 
treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by severity. Summary 
statistics will be calculated for each parameter.  
Individual ECG results will be listed for each participant. Summaries of ECGs will include changes from baseline for each parameter. The number and percentage of participants with abnormal ECGs will be summarized by treatment.  
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 54  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Vital sign measurements other laboratory tests, concomitant medications, medical history and 
changes in physical examinations at each time point will be listed by participant.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most current World Health Organization drug dictionary available.  
12.7 Exploratory Endpoints  
12.7.1  Exploratory Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
• Relationship between PLN -74809 systemic exposure and PET imaging and biomarkers in 
IPF participants  
 Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma PLN -74809 concentrations at each sampling time point will be presented in listings 
and summarized with descriptive statistics. Plasma PLN -74809-versus- time profiles (with 
plasma concentrations on both a log and linear scale) will be plotted for each participant. 
Non-compartmental analysis will be used to calculate PK parameters as appropriate. Plasma 
PK parameters will be presented in listings and summarized with descriptive statistics. The 
data will also be presented graphically.  
Further details of the analyses will be provided in the SAP to be prepared and agreed prior to 
final ‘database lo ck’ at the end of the study. The PK analysis plan and report may be 
prepared separately from the SAP as appropriate.  
PET/MRI  
Relationships between PK and type 1 collagen deposition, as well as between MRI and PET imaging, may be evaluated in an exploratory  fashion and presented in a graphical manner. 
The analysis of PET/MRI imaging is described in Section 12.5.1. 
Pharmacodynamics: Biomarkers  
Urine, pla sma, and serum samples will be analyzed for biomarkers (presence or actual 
concentration). These samples will be used to determine the levels of these markers in 
participants, the relationship between these markers, and the level of PET tracer uptake 
(type 1 collagen deposition) in the lung. Results will be presented in listings and summarized 
with descriptive statistics and in graphical form.  
12.7.2  Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
12.7.2.1 Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)  
• Absolute FVC volume and FVC as percent of predicted as a ssessed by spirometry  
Percent of predicted FVC and volume (mL) will be assessed using the standard spirometry 
procedure at the Chest Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital and presented as absolute 
Protocol PLN -74809-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 55  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  values and as percent of predicted values. Baseline FVC will be the average of the screening 
and Day 1 determinations. End-of- study FVC will be the average of Week 12 and Week 14 
determinations.  
12.7.2.2 Patient -reported Outcome (PRO)  
• Patient -reported outcome (PRO): a VAS for cough severity 
A cough VAS will be completed  at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix 1).

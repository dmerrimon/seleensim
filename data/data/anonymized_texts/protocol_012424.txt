 1. Protocol synopsis  
Title of study  
A single -arm phase II trial to evaluate  the safety and efficacy of the antibody -drug conjugate 
SYD985  in patients with HER2 -expressing recurrent, advanced or metastatic endometrial carcinoma 
who previously progressed on or after first line platinum -based chemotherapy  
 
Objectives  
The primary objective  of this study is:  
• To evaluate the objective tumour response rate (ORR) of SYD985;  
The secondary objectives  of this study are to evaluate for SYD985:  
• Progression -free survival (PFS);  
• Overall survival (OS);  
• Safety.  
 
Study design  
 This is an open -label, single -arm study in patients with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 
(HER2) -expressing recurrent, advanced or metastatic endometrial carcinoma. HER2 -expression is 
defined as a 1+, 2+ or 3+ score on immunohistochemistry (IHC) or positive by in situ hybridization 
(ISH). Inclusion of patients with HER2 1+/2+, ISH negative tumours will be limite d to a maximum 
of 50% of the total sample size. Eligible patients for this study should have progressed on or after 
first line platinum -based chemotherapy. Patients who have had two or more lines of chemotherapy 
for advanced/metastatic disease are not elig ible. 
 
Eligible patients will receive SYD985 every three weeks (Q3W) until disease progression (PD) or 
unacceptable toxicity. During the first treatment cycle, patients will have to visit the clinical site 
weekly for safety assessments, followed by one vis it in subsequent cycles. Patients who have stopped 
study treatment for other reasons than PD (e.g. due to toxicity) will continue their tumour evaluations 
in an observation period until disease progression or start of a new anticancer therapy.  
Duration of patient treatment and participation:  
After a screening period of maximally 28 days, patients who are eligible will be treated until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. A safety follow -up visit is planned 30 days after the treatment 
discontinuation visit after which patients may move into an observation period and/or survival 
follow -up.  
 
Study population  
The study population will consist of patients complying with the following in - and exclusion criteria:

Study medication, mode of administration:   
 
SYD985, [vic-]trastuzumab duocarmazine , Byondis  BV, The Netherlands  
SYD985 is an ADC comprised of Byondis’  HER2 -targeting monoclonal IgG1 antibody trastuzumab 
covalently bound to a linker -drug. The linker -drug contains a cleavable linker and the prodrug seco-
duocarmycin -hydroxybenzamide -azaindole ( seco-DUBA). The linker ca n be cleaved by proteases 
in the tumour at the dipeptide valine -citrulline (vc) motif, which releases the active DNA -alkylating 
toxin (DUBA).  
Drug product vials contain 80 mg sterile lyophilized SYD985 which should be reconstituted prior to 
use with 8.0 mL sterile water for injection to yield a solution of 10 mg/mL. The calculated amount 
of solution should be added to an infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride without other 
additives. SYD985 is to be administered intravenously over 60 minutes for  the first infusion, 
subsequent infusions can be given over 30 minutes.  
 
Study assessments and procedures (see also flowchart)  
The informed consent form (ICF) must be signed before any study -related procedure is performed. 
The pre -screening HER2 testing -ICF should be used to allow the central analysis of HER2  
expression on most recent available tumour material from a potentially eligible patient. A fresh 
tumour biopsy should be performed if no adequate tumour tissue is available. In case the HER2 
tumour ex pression does not comply with the inclusion criterion, the patient cannot participate. Before 
continuing with full screening the Main -ICF should be signed.  
 
Safety assessments will include physical examination, ECOG performance status, vital signs, weight  
assessment, electrocardiography (ECG), LVEF measurements by echocardiography or MUGA scan, 
laboratory measurements, pulmonary function testing (PFT), ophthalmological examination and 
adverse event (AE) reporting. Blood samples for blood chemistry and haem atology will be measured

 by the local laboratory. In addition, genetic analysis will be performed by a central laboratory on 
most recent available tumour tissue and a blood sample, to explore the correlation between 
biomarkers and tumour response and/or to xicity. The patient will be requested to sign the Genetic 
tumour analysis -ICF for this purpose.  
 
Patients will be clinically and radiologically (CT or MRI scan) evaluated for tumour response at 
screening and subsequently during treatment every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks 
thereafter. Tumour responses will be assessed locally by the investigator/radiologist using RECIST 
(version 1.1). In addition, scans will be collected and stored at a central imaging lab, for potential 
central analysis  at a later stage. Patients who have stopped study treatment for other reasons than PD 
(e.g. due to toxicity) will continue their tumour evaluations in an observation period until disease 
progression or start of a new anticancer therapy.  
 
After a treatmen t discontinuation visit patients will be contacted to follow up on clinical disease 
progression, unresolved AEs and new anticancer therapies. After the last study related visit (either 
30-day follow up or observation period) patients will be contacted ever y 3 months to collect overall 
survival data.  
 
Number of patients and study sites  
Approximately 60 patients will be recruited in up to 35 -40 participating clinical sites located in 
Europe, USA a nd Asia -Pacific. Inclusion of patients with HER2 1+/2+, ISH negative tumours will 
be limited to a maximum of 50% of the total sample size. This study is of explorative nature; 60 
patients should provide for sufficient safety information and for an ORR estimate with acceptable 
confidence interval for future decision -making.

1 Following signing the  main study  ICF an eligible patient should be treated  within 28 days. In addition to the main ICF s eparate informed 
consent forms  are available  for determination of the HER2 tumour status and for gen etic tumour analysis;  
2 A cycle is defined as 21 days (3 weeks);  
3 Day 1 assessments are to be done prior to study drug administration unless otherwise stated ; 
4 Vital signs should include assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry ;  
5 Weight  should always be measured prior to SYD985 administration on the Day 1 visits. However, weight measured up to  7 days befor e 
the Day 1 visit  can be used  for the preparation of the infusion bag ; 
6 Pulmonary Function Testing (PFTs) should be done at baseline and whenever clinically indicated, according to local hospital s tandard;  
7 Archived tumour material should be submitted for ce ntral analysis of HER2 status  by IHC  and ISH . HER2 status should be available 
before start IMP treatment. If there is no archival tumour material available a biopsy should be performed to obtain tumour material ; 
8 Genetic tumour analysis will be performed by  a central laboratory. Most recent available tumour tissue should be sent to the central lab 
together with a blood sample taken on the Cycle 2 Day 1 visit to determine the germline DNA;

 9 Blood sampling for haematology/chemistry should be done as closely as possible to the start of the new cycle, but may be done up to 3 
days before. Results from the local laboratory should be available before the start of the new cycle to determine if the pati ent can continue 
or not. If the screening assessment is done within  5 days before the first study drug administration, analysis does not need to be repeated 
at the day of first administration;   
10 Pregnancy tests (serum test at screening and serum or urinary tests during treatment and at treatment discontinuation) will b e performed 
to exclude pregnancy in women with childbearing potential, and may be done up to 3 days before the start of the new cycl e. If the screening 
assessment is done within 5 days before the first study drug administration, analysis does not need to be repeated at the day of first 
administration ; 
11 LVEF assessment as well as ophthalmological examination (slit lamp exam, corneal sensitivity testing, fluorescence tear film break up 
time, and pachymetry) should be done as closely as possible to the start of t he indicated cycle, but may be done up to 7 days before. Results 
should be available before the start of the indicated cycle to determine whether the patient can continue;  
12 LVEF should be measured by echocardiogram or MUGA scan according to routine local cl inical practice, however the method should 
remain the same per patient. If LVEF is below 50% the next assessment should be performed before the start of the next cycle as indicated  
in the dose modification Section  9.6.1.3 of  the protocol ; Assessments shoul d be done at cycle 2 and every 4th cycle, meaning cycle 2, 6, 
10 etc.  
13 12-lead ECGs should be recorded in triplicate; Assess ments should be done at cycle 1 and  2 and every 4th cycle, meaning cycle 1, 2, 6, 10 
etc. 
14 Tumour evaluation includes systemic use of clinical, radiological (e.g. CT or MRI) and other methods (if deemed necessary). For tumour 
measurements, a CT or MRI scan should be performed every 6 weeks (± 3 days) for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks (± 7 da ys) 
thereafter, independent of dosing d elays. If tumour evaluation falls at the Day 1 of a cycle (in case there are no treatment delays), it can 
also be performed up to 7 days prior to the Day 1 visit, but should always be done prior to IMP infusion. The methodology and  imaging 
levels should re main the same at baseline and subsequent evaluations for a given patient.  Additionally, scans should be provided to the 
central imaging lab for collection and storage;  
15 Administration of SYD985  in a 21 -days regimen  (± 3 days) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . No recalculation of the 
SYD985 dose in mg is needed if the weight at the day of administration has changed < 5% compared to the weight at Cycle 1 Day  1. 
Concomitant prophylactic lubricating eye drops should be prescrib ed to patients, to be used 3 times a day or as needed;  
16 The treatment discontinuation visit should occur at the time study treatment is discontinued for any reason. Tumour evaluatio n at the 
discontinuation visit is required for patients who discontinue stud y treatment before first scheduled in -treatment tumour assessment (week 
6) and for patients whose previous tumour assessment did not demonstrate PD and was done more than 21 days prior to the treat ment 
discontinuation period. For patients who continue into  the Observation Phase there is no need to perform a tumour evaluation at the 
discontinuation visit, they should maintain the same tumour evaluation schedule as during the Treatment Phase ; 
17 If a follow -up visit is not possible, the patient should be contact ed by  telephone;  
18 The Observation Phase is for any patient that discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD ( e.g. toxicity). Patients stay in the 
Observation Phase until the time of PD or the start of a new anticancer treatment ; 
19 Tumour imaging fo r the Observation Visits should be maintained by the same schedule that was initiated during the Treatment Phase ; 
20 Every 3 months ( ±14 days)  following the last visit/contact (i.e. 30 -day follow up visit or final observation phase visit) patient should be 
contacted for survival until death, lost to follow -up or consent withdrawal, whichever comes first. During this follow -up only survival 
information and initiation of new anticancer medication should be documented.

 5. Introduction  
5.1. Therapeutic background and study rationale  
 
Endometrial cancer is the second most common gynaecologic  malignancy world -wide, with an 
estimated 380,000 new cases and 90,000 deaths in 2018 .1 Metastatic disease remains non 
curable. For advanced, metastatic disease platinum -based chemotherapy is the preferred first 
treatment line.2,3 Few chemotherapy agents have been shown to produce meaningful response 
rates in the second -line setting, highlighting a need for new therapies in advanced, recurrent, 
metastatic endometrium cancer.4  
 
Human Epidermal growth factor  Receptor 2 (HER2) provid es critical signalling for cancer cell 
growth, survival, and proliferation.5,6 Amplification and over -expression of HER2 are 
associated with shortened survival in breast cancer.7,8 Four HER2 -targeting therapies have been 
approved up to now in the EU and th e US for HER2 -positive breast cancer: two antibodies 
(trastuzumab and pertuzumab), antibody -drug-conjugate (ADC) (ado -trastuzumab emtansine, 
T-DM1), and a small molecule kinase inhibitor (lapatinib).  
 
According to literature on average 25 -30% of patients w ith endometrial cancer have HER2 -
positive disease .9,10,11,12. In an aggressive endometrial cancer subtype of uterine serous 
carcinoma the addition of trastuzumab to a chemotherapy combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel 
has shown increased progression -free s urvival (PFS) in HER2 -positive patients.13  
 
Byondis developed a new HER2 -targeting therapy, SYD985, which is comprised of Byondis’ 
monoclonal IgG1 antibody trastuzumab covalently bound to a linker -drug. This linker -drug 
contains a cleavable linker and the  prodrug seco-DUocarmycin -hydroxyBenzamide -Azaindole 
(seco-DUBA). After binding to HER2 on the cell membrane, SYD985 undergoes receptor 
mediated internalization and the linker is cleaved in the lysosome at the dipeptide valine -
citrulline (vc) motif by prot eases. Upon cleavage, two self -elimination reactions occur to 
generate the prodrug ( seco-DUBA), which then spontaneously rearranges to form the active 
toxin (DUBA). The active toxin alkylates DNA resulting in DNA damage in both dividing and 
non-dividing ce lls, and ultimately cell death. In addition, in vitro  studies showed that the active 
toxin can cross the cell membrane and kill neighbouring, HER2 -negative tumour cells as a 
bystander effect (see for more details the  Investigator's Brochure (IB)).  
 
Results  of the first -in-human Phase I study suggest that SYD985 is efficacious and has an 
acceptable safety profile in heavily pre -treated patients with HER2 -expressing metastatic 
cancer.14 In the HER2 -positive breast cancer cohort an objective response was achie ved by 16 
(33%, 95% CI 20.4 -48.4) of 48 patients and a median PFS of 7.6 months (95% CI 4.2 -10.9). 
Further investigation of SYD985 is ongoing in a phase III study comparing the efficacy and 
safety of SYD985 to physician’s choice in patients with HER2 -posit ive unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  
 
In the endometrial cancer cohort of the Phase I study, 13 patients were  enrolled and treated  with 
SYD985. The objective response rate (ORR) was 39% (95% CI 13.9 -68.4), with partial 
responses i n 5 patients. These partial responses were observed both in patients with high - and 
low-expressing HER2 tumours. Median PFS was 4.3 months (95% CI: 2.4 -9.9).14

                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The intent of this Phase II study is to further investigate the efficacy and safety of SYD985 for 
the treatment of patients with HER2 -expressing recurrent, advanced or metastatic endometrial 
cancer who have progress ed on first line platinum -based chemother apy.  
 
5.2. Patient population rationale  
 
The patient population for this study includes patients with HER2 -expressing recurrent, 
advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer who have progressed after receiving primary 
treatment with platinum -based chemotherapy . Patients may have had p rior chemothera py in the 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant  setting.  
 
Few agents have been shown to produce meaningful response rates in the second -line setting 
and no HER2 -targeting therapies have been approved yet for endometrial cancer while 25 -30% 
of the patients overexpress t he HER2 -receptor.  
 
Patients who have received one previous line of HER2 -targeting therapy and who have 
developed resistance to this therapy are eligible, as clinical data suggests that HER2 -positive 
cancers continue to depend on HER2 at the time of progres sion.15,16 In addition, efficacy has 
been demonstrated in the phase I study with SYD985 in patients with breast cancer after having 
received multiple prior HER2 -targeting therapies.  
 
As it is not known what minimal level of HER2 -expression is required to i nitiate an anti -tumour 
effect with SYD985 in endometrial cancer, and considering the promising results in the phase 
I study, both patients with high - and patients with low -expressing HER2 tumours will be 
included in this study, where the patients with HER2 -low tumours will not exceed more than 
50% of the total sample size.  
 
5.3. Dosage rationale  
 
SYD985 will be administered in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg once every three weeks.  
 
The 3 -weekly interval was investigated in the dose -escalation part of the Phase I study and  is 
the regimen chosen to investigate in the ongoing phase III and in this phase II trial. Dosing 
delays and reductions are allowed to reduce toxicity in an individual patient (Section 9.6).  
 
5.4. Primary endpoint rationale  
 
The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the anticancer activity of SYD985 with respect 
to ORR.  
 
ORR will be defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete 
response (CR) or a partial response (PR). This is an established measure of anti -tumour activi ty, 
as tumour reduction is a direct therapeutic effect whereas stable disease (SD) could reflect the 
natural history of the disease. The objective tumour response will be assessed by the 
investigators using RECIST 1.1.17

 5.5. Safety considerations  
 
This section is  primarily based on the clinical data from the phase I and ongoing phase III study 
with SYD985 . Please refer to the SYD985 IB for further information. It should be taken into 
account that toxicity other than described in the IB may evolve. For the most up to date 
information one should always refer to the  current version of the  IB.  
 
The most common drug -related AEs reported in the clinical studies (>10%) are:  
• Conjunctivitis, dry eye, keratitis, lacrimation increased;  
• Fatigue;  
• Nausea, stomatitis;  
• Alopecia, skin hyperpigmentation;  
• Neutropenia, anaemia;  
• Decreased appetite;  
     
In addition, specific important safety considerations are described in more detail below.  
 
Ocular  toxicity  
Ocular  toxicity was commonly reported with SYD985 . Patients previously reported treatment -
related ocular toxicity, including most commonly conjunctivitis, dry eye, keratitis and 
lacrimati on increased.  Most eye disorders were of mild or moderate intensity. The most 
common severe AEs were keratitis and conjunctivitis. In the majority of patients, the ocular 
toxicity improves and eventually recovers, but it may take several months.  
 
Ocular  toxicity should be  monitored prior to initiation of treatment and every other cycle  by an 
ophthalmological examination  (see Section 1.1) . Patients with a history of keratitis are not 
eligible for this study.  Specific guidelines  regarding d ose delays  and/or reductions or 
discontinuation for severe ocular  toxicity are provided in Section 9.6.1.1.  
 
Pulmonary toxicity  
Pulmonary events, including Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, dyspnoea 
(exertional), pleural effusion and respiratory failure, have been reported with S YD985. So far 
one fatal pneumonitis event has been reported at 2.4 mg/kg  in the phase I study and one possibly 
related case of fatal respiratory failure  at 1.2 mg/kg  in the phase III study .  
 
Caution should be exercised when a patient presents with non -specific respiratory signs and 
symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough, dyspnoea or radiological features on chest 
CT scan. To detect pneumonitis or other pulmonary toxicity in an early stage, tumour evaluation 
CT scans should be carefully evaluated for lung changes e.g. by means of high resolution CT.  
Infectious and disease -related aetiologies should be ruled out.  Patients sho uld be advised to 
promptly report any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.  
 
The diagnosis of ILD/pneumonitis should be made on clinical/radiological findings. 
Biomarkers for ILD/pneumonitis are exploratory and they should not be used for diagnosis or 
monitoring of drug induced ILD/pneumonitis. When evaluating ILD/pneumonitis (regardless 
of stage) it is highly recommended to include a pulmonary consult, a high resolution CT, 
pulmonary function testing (PFT), pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases (ABGs).

 In case pneumonitis is suspected one should consider treatment with a sufficiently high dose of 
corticosteroids followed with an adequate taper period as per standard hospital protocol for 
drug-induced pneumonitis.  Specific guidance for dose modification s for pneumonitis is 
described in Section 9.6.1.2.  
 
Cardiac toxicity  
Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF)  was reported as treatment -related AE  in a 
small number  of patients treated with SYD985 . The majority of events was reported as 
recovered.  No other significant cardiotoxicity has been reported with SYD985 to date. SYD985 
should be delayed or discontinued in cases of left ventricular dysfunction according to the 
guidance in Section 9.6.1.3.

Infusion rela ted reactions were reported for some patients  treated with SYD985 . All infusion 
related reactions occurred at the start of the study drug treatment , either after the first and/or 
second infusion , and SYD985 treatment was continued in all patients . The most  common 
symptoms included chills/ shivering and fever  that mostly  recovered within 1 day.    
 
Infusion related reactions mostly occur during or immediately following the (initial) infusion. 
Infusions should be slowed or interrupted for patients experiencin g infusion -related symptoms . 
 
Injection site reactions  
Injection site reaction  was reported in a few patients.  Infusion site extravasation was reported  
sporadically .  
 
It is recommended to avoid the use of veins over joints or in extremities with compromised 
venous or lymphatic drainage. At the end of each infusion, the line must be flushed with up to 
100 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for infusion, at the discretion  of the investigator. When 
extravasation is noted, immediately stop the infusion and follow the local hospital extravasation 
protocols for vesicant drugs in consultation with the responsible physician.  
 
Haematological toxicity  
Treatment -related haematotox icity, with neutropenia and anemia as the only treatment -related 
haematological events reported for more than 10% of patients , were m ostly mild or moderate 
in intensity and only a few  patients discontinued SYD985 treatment due to it (all decreased 
platelet  count). Of the patients that recovered, the majority  either did not require any 
intervention or recovered after delayed dosing. D ose modification for haematological events is 
described in Section 9. 6.1.4.  
 
Embryo -foetal toxicity  
There are no data from th e use of SYD985 in pregnant women. Although specific studies to 
assess a potential effect of SYD985 on fertility or embryonic development have not been 
conducted, it is likely that SYD985 can have an effect on fertility and is a developmental toxin 
based o n the DNA reactive nature of the toxin. Therefore, pregnant and lactating women are 
not eligible to participate in clinical stud ies with SYD985 . Participating patients must use 
highly  effective methods of contraception  as described in Section 10.3 . In case  a patient 
becomes pregnant during SYD985 treatment, she must be discontinued from the study.

 5.6. Benefit -risk assessment  
 
Currently there are few to none treatment options available beyond first -line chemotherapy for 
patients with advanced or metastatic end ometrial cancer that provide a clinically meaningful 
benefit.  
 
As described in Section 5.5, in previous studies SYD985 was associated with dose -related 
ocular and pulmonary toxicities. These toxicities are also commonly observed with other 
ADCs.18,19 Frequent safety assessments such as ophthalmological and physical examinations, 
haematology/biochemistry and ECG/LVEF measurements are included in the study to early 
detect and adequately monitor toxicities when they occur. Clear instructions for dose 
modifications, i.e. dose delay, reduction or discontinuation, are provided in Section 9.6 
specifically for ocular, lung, cardiac and haematological toxicity. In addition, investigators will 
be instructed to carefully evaluate the tumour evaluation scans for a ny lung changes. Patients 
with a history or presence of keratitis, impaired cardiac function and/or lung disease are 
excluded from the study as these patients may potentially be at higher risk to develop significant 
treatment -related toxicity.    
 
Based on  the efficacy and safety data observed in the clinical phase I and III study and the 
implemented safety measures in this study, the benefit -risk assessment supports clinical 
development of SYD985 in this patient population.  
 
6. Objective(s)  
6.1. Efficacy objectives  
6.1.1.  Primary objectives  
 
The primary objective  of this study is to evaluate  the ORR  of SYD985 . 
6.1.2.  Secondary objectives  
 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate SYD985  with respect to:  
• Progression Free Survival (PFS) ;

                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9.3. Treatment assignment  
 
When all screening data are available and patient eligib ility has been confirmed by the Contract 
Research Organization (CRO)/Sponsor, the patient will be assigned SYD985 treatment as long 
as enrolment is not yet completed . A patient should start study treatment  within 28 days of 
signing the Main -ICF.  
 
Enrolmen t of patients with a  HER2 -tumour status of IHC 1+, 2+ and ISH -negative or IHC 3+ 
and/or ISH -positive  will be monitored and stopped when 50% (30 patients) have been enrolled 
in each sub -group.  
 
9.4. Treatment regimen and individual administration procedure  
 
SYD985 1.2 mg/kg will be administered once every three weeks (± 3 days) by intravenous 
infusion  using an infusion set with filter as specified in the pharmacy manual .  
 
The infusion should be prepared aseptically. Slowly inject 8.0 ml sterile  water for injection into 
the 80 mg SYD985 vial to yield a solution of 10 mg/mL. The vial should be swirled gently until 
completely dissolved. DO NOT SHAKE. Let the vial stand undisturbed for 5 minutes before 
further use. Inspect the solution for particulates  and discoloration. The solution should be clear 
to slightly opalescent and free of visible particles. The solution should be colourless to pale 
yellow. Do not use the solution if it contains visible particles or is cloudy or discoloured. The 
reconstituted  vials should preferably be used immediately but can be stored  temporarily (see 
below).  
 
The volume of the SYD985 solution needed for a particular patient should be calculated based 
on the weight of the patient. The weight should always be measured prior t o IMP infusion at 
the Day 1 visits. However, weight measured up to  7 days before the Day 1 visit can be  used for 
the preparation of the infusion bag. If the weight at a dosing day differs more than 5% from the 
Cycle 1  Day 1  measurement the actual weight sh ould be used for the preparation.  
 
The required volume needs to be withdrawn from the vial(s) and added to a 100 ml infusion 
bag as specified in the pharmacy manual containing 0.9% sodium chloride without other 
additive s. To mix the solutions the infusion  bag should be gently inverted to avoid foaming.  
 
In case the reconstituted vial and/or prepared infusion bag is not used immediately, they can be 
stored at 2 to 8 °C (36 -46 °F). The prepared infusion bag must be used within 24 hours after 
reconstitution of the vial.  
 
The first infusion should be administered over 60 minutes  (± 10 minutes) . Following the initial 
dose, patients will be observed for at least 90 minutes after end of infusion for fever, chills, or 
other infusion -related symptoms. If prior infu sions were well tolerated (without any signs or 
symptoms of infusion reactions) subsequent infusions can be given over 30 minutes  (minimum 
of 25 minutes) , with a minimum 30 -minute observation period following the end of infusion.  
 
For each SYD985 infusion, it is recommended to avoid, if possible , the use of veins over joints 
or in the extremities with comprised venous or lymphatic drainage. At the end of every infusion, 
the infusion line must be flushed with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution fo r infusion  as

 indicated in the pharmacy manual , at the discretion of the investigator. In case extravasation is 
noted, the infusion should be stopped immediately and the local hospital extravasation protocol 
for vesicant drugs should be followed.  
 
Infusio ns may be slowed or interrupted for patients experiencing infusion -related symptoms at 
the discretion of the investigator. Infusion of SYD985 should be interrupted for patients who 
develop dyspnoea or clinically significant hypotension, but may resume at d ecreased infusion 
rate when sufficiently recovered. Infusions may be restarted at the full rate during the next 
cycle, provided there is adequate monitoring. Adequate premedication should be considered at 
the discretion of the investigator. Patients who ex perience a Grade 4 infusion -related reaction 
or a Grade 3 infusion -related reaction which does not respond to symptomatic medication 
and/or  temporary  interruption of infusion or infusion rate reduction should  be discontinued 
from study treatment.  
 
Prophylactic lubricating eye drops should  be prescribed to patients, to be used 3 times a day or 
as needed. All patients are advised not to wear contact lenses or rub their eyes during SYD985 
treatment.  
9.5. Treatment compliance and accountability  
 
SYD985  will be administered to the patient by trained staff of the study site. Details of 
preparation and administration will be documented in the e lectronic Case Report Form (eCRF) . 
 
All Investigation Medicinal Product (IMP) will be tracked and accounted for at the 
investigational site following receipt, dispensing and administration to the patient, and 
ultimately including destruction or return to the Sponsor/CRO . In case of missing or damaged 
medication cartons or vials, this is to be reported to the Sponsor /CRO acc ording to the 
instructions provided in the Pharmacy Manual. The product accountability will be fully 
documented by the investigational site. The investigational site will retain all unused study drug  
(and outer packaging) until the drug accountability has been checked by the  clinical research 
associate ( CRA ).  
 
9.6. Dose modifications  
 
Patients should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose: dosing should  only occur if the 
clinical assessment and laboratory test values are acceptable. Dosing delays and reduc tions are 
designed to maximize treatment for those who derive clinical benefit from treatment while 
ensuring patient safety.  
 
Irrespective of the reason, if dosing is delayed, dosing should be resumed within 42 days from 
the last dose received, or the pati ent should discontinue treatment . On a case -by-case basis it 
can be decided to postpone dosing for a longer duration, e.g. in case the patient has clearly 
benefit from study drug treatment. Please contact the Medical Monitor for approval.  
 
Dose delays for  SYD985 -related toxicities, other than the ones specified below, should be 
handled as follows:  
• If significant SYD985 -related toxicities have not recovered to Grade 1 or baseline, the 
next scheduled dose may be delayed for up to 42 days from the last dose r eceived. 
“Significant” and “related” will be based on the judgement of the investigator (in

 consultation with the Medical Monitor). For example, alopecia even if considered 
related would most likely not be considered to be significant. Fatigue may or may n ot 
be considered either related or significant.  
• In general, when the significant and related toxicity (or any other toxicity that the 
investigator chooses to delay dosing for) resolves to Grade 1 or baseline or is sufficiently 
resolved in the opinion of th e investigator, the patient may resume SYD985 if the delay 
has not exceeded 42 days from the last received dose. Patients should be re -evaluated 
weekly during the delay whenever possible. If dosing resumes, the patient may receive 
SYD985 either at the same  dose level as before or the dose can be reduced, at the 
discretion of the investigator. The dosing interval for subsequent cycles should remain 
every 21 days.  
• If toxicity does not resolve sufficiently within 42 days from the last dose received, the 
patien t should  be discontinued from study treatment and should  be followed  in the 
observation period for PD as described in Section 11.1 8.5. 
 
If a patient needs a dose reduction the dose should be reduced from 1.2 mg/kg to 0.9 mg/kg. 
Patients on the 0.9 mg/kg dose who develop an AE necessitating further dose reductions should 
be reduced to 0.6 mg/kg. Patients on the 0.6 mg/kg dose who develop an AE necessitating 
further dose reductions should be discontinued from treatment.  Dose escalation is not allowed  
after a dose reduction.  
 
Protocol requirements for specific toxicities are outlined below.  
 
9.6.1.1.  Dose modification s for ocular toxicity  
 
Patients who experience Grade 3 (or higher) ocular toxicity  should  be discontinued from 
treatment.  For patients who experience Grade 2 ocular toxicity, it should be considered to delay 
dosing for up to 42 days from the last received dose and appropriate treatment with eye drops, 
cream, or gel should be applied (e.g. ster oid containing eye drops). If study drug is interrupted 
for Grade 2 toxicity it should resolve to Grade 1 or baseline before restarting treatment. Patients 
may continue treatment at the same dose level as before or the dose can be reduced, at the 
discretio n of the investigator. Subsequent dosing delays or treatment discontinuation should be 
considered in case the ocular toxicity persists. The ocular toxicity should be monitored by an 
ophthalmologist (or qualified delegate) for recovery.  
 
9.6.1.2.  Dose modification s for pulmonary  toxicity  
 
Patients who experience ILD/ pneumonitis  Grade ≥ 2 will be discontinued from treatment.  For 
patients who experience Grade 1  ILD/ pneumonitis dosing must be delayed for up to 42 days 
from the last received dose. When the ILD/ pneumoniti s resolves to Grade 0 patients may 
continue treatment and a dose reduction should be considered . Reversibility or stabilisation of 
ILD/pneumonitis should be monitored and documented. If in addition to SYD985 a patient is 
receiving co -medication and develop s drug -induced ILD/pneumonitis this should be considered 
related to SYD985.   
 
Caution should be exercised when a patient present s with non -specific respiratory signs and 
symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough, dyspnoea or radiological features o n chest 
CT scan. The diagnosis of ILD/pneumonitis should be made on clinical/radiological findings.

 Biomarkers for ILD/pneumonitis are exploratory and they should not be used for diagnosis or 
monitoring of drug induced ILD/pneumonitis. When evaluating ILD/ pneumonitis (regardless 
of stage) it is highly recommended to include a pulmonary consult, a high resolution CT, PFTs, 
pulse oximetry and ABGs. It is recommended to delay SYD985 infusions until symptom 
improvement or until the diagnosis is clarified. It sh ould be considered to reduce the SYD985 
dose for subsequent infusions or to discontinue treatment, at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
9.6.1.3.  Dose modification s for cardio toxicity  
 
Patients who develop clinically significant symptomatic cardiac disease during  the study will 
be discontinued.  
 
LVEF assessments will be performed regularly during the study and declines will be handled 
as summarized in  Figure 1.  
Figure 1: SYD985 dosing in relation to LVEF assessment  
 
SYD985 administration may be delayed to maximally 42 days after the last do se.  
 
9.6.1.4.  Dose modification s for haematologic toxicity  
 
For patients who experience a Grade 3 (or higher) haematological  event dosing must be delayed 
for up to 42 days from the last received dose. When the haematologic event resolves to Grade 
1 or baseline, patients may continue treatment at the same dose level as before or the dose can 
be reduced, at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
9.7. Subject  emergency card  
 
At start of treatment  patients will be hand ed out a Subject Emergency Card . This card indicates 
that the patient is participating in a clinical study and contains the patient number and provides 
details on the study drug that is being studied in the study. The patient is to carry the card at all

 times , so that in case of a medical event, the treating medical personnel are aware of the study 
drug administration . The card also presents an emergency phone number.  At the treatment 
discontinuation visit , the patient is to return the Subject Emergency Card.  
 
10. Concomitant medication  
10.1. Acceptable concomitant medication  
 
Patients are allowed to receive supportive care therapies concomitantly during the study  (i.e. 
during treatmen t and observation phase) . Concomitant medication and supportive care should 
be administered only as medically necessary during the study. Any concomitant medication 
(including herbal medication and vitamins) must be recorded in full detail (drug, dose, dur ation 
of treatment, reason for concomitant medication) in the eCRF. Note that the use of concomitant 
medication must relate to the documented medical history, an AE or be reported as prophylactic 
treatment.  
 
After consultation with the medical monitor, pa lliative radiotherapy may be allowed during the 
study for e.g. symptomatic treatment of painful bone lesions as long as the lesion is not a 
RECIST 1.1 defined target lesion and is not administered for tumour control. Study treatment 
should be held during t he course of palliative radiotherapy and should be resumed no earlier 
than the next scheduled administration of study treatment. Treatment of brain metastases may 
also be allowed after consultation, unless the (symptoms of) brain metastases are classified as 
progressive disease for which the patient needs to be discontinued.   
 
Patients will not be routinely treated with an antiemetic regimen prior to SYD985 
administration. If a patient experiences grade 3 or greater nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting, 
medic al intervention should occur, including prophylactic administration of antiemetic  agents 
for subsequent infusions as indicated. Serious infusion -related events should be managed with 
supportive therapies as clinically indic ated according to standard clinic al practice (e.g. 
supplemental oxygen, β2 -adrene rgic receptor agonist, and/or corticosteroids). Reduction of the 
infusion rate and prophylactic treatment should be considered for subsequent infusions, if the 
patient continues in the study.  
 
Prophylactic lubricating eye drops should  be prescribed to patients, to be used 3 times a day or 
as needed. All patients are advised not to wear contact lenses or rub their eyes during SYD985 
treatment.  
 
10.2. Prohibited  concomitant medication  
 
Patients are proh ibited to receive the following therapies during the study (i.e. during treatment, 
and observation phase, if applicable):  
• All anti -cancer therapies, including:  
o Chemotherapy;  
o HER2 -targeting therapy;  
o Other anticancer therapy including immunotherapy or investigational agent s; 
o Hormone therapy ; 
• Radiotherapy  (except for palliative care as described in Section 10.1).

 Washout criteria apply for anticancer therapy prior to start of study treatment as described in 
exclusion criterion 1.  
 
10.3. Cont raception  
Patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception during the study, and 
up to  at least  6 months after last study drug  dose. For this study, methods that can achieve a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consis tently and correctly are considered as 
acceptable highly effective birth control methods in line with the recommendations of the 
Clinical Trial Facilitation Group.20 Such methods include : 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraceptio n associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal);  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, 
injectable, or implantable);  
• Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS);  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
 
The above contraception is not required in case the patient or sole partner of patient is surgically 
sterilized, or in case the patient truly abstains from sexual activity (when this is in line with the 
preferred a nd usual lifestyle of the patient).  
 
11. Study procedures and assessments  
The Study Flow Chart in  Section  1.1 summarize s the study procedures to be performed at each 
visit. Individual study procedures are described below. For details of assessment and reporti ng 
of AEs, see Section 12 ( Safety Monitoring).  
11.1. Obtain informed consent  
 
The investigator or authorized delegate will explain the study  to the patient , answer all of his/her  
questions and obtain the patient ’s written informed consent before performing any study-related 
procedure.  
 
The following ICFs will be available in this study:  
• Pre-screening HER2 testing -ICF; 
• Main -ICF; 
• Genetic tumour analysis -ICF; 
• Pregnancy -ICF (see Section 12.9).  
 
For potential participants, the  pre-screening HER2 testing -ICF should  be used to allow the 
central analysis  of HER2 expression on most recently available tumour tissue and to perform a 
fresh tumour biopsy, if applicable (see also Section 11.8) . When the HER2 tumour expression 
complies with the inclusion criterion and patient enrolment is still open, the patient should sign 
the Main -ICF before full screening can be started. In addition, the patient will be asked to sign 
the Genetic tumour analysi s-ICF. In case a patient does not consent for this genetic tumour 
analysis, she can still participate in the study.   
 
The patient can only start study treatment when all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria 
are met and enrolment is not yet complet e. The  patient should start study treatment  within 2 8 
days of signing the Main -ICF.

 11.2. Demographics and medical history  
 
Demographic and medical history data will be obtained by the investigator or authorized 
(medically qualified) delegate. The medical histo ry will include at minimum the time of initial 
and metastatic cancer diagnosis, sites of metastases, prior anticancer  therapies (including 
therapies in the (neo) adjuvant and/or metastatic setting) and details on the hormone receptor 
(Estrogen and/or P rogestrogene receptor ) status of the primary tumour and/or metastasis (if 
available). Only clinically relevant conditions should be reported on the CRF as medical 
history.  
 
11.3. Inclusion /exclusion criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by m edically qualified study personnel to 
ensure that the patient qualifies for the study. The review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
confirmation of the patient’s eligibility will be noted in patient’s source documents and 
appropriate eCRF.  
 
11.4. Physical  examination  
 
A complete physical examination will be performed by the investigator or a medically qualified 
delegate , which should  involve abnormalities of at least head/neck, thorax, abdomen, 
extremities, skin and lymph nodes. Results of the examination  should be documented in the 
patient’s medical chart and the eCRF. Abnormal findings at screening are to be reported in the 
medical history  and any clinical significant findings during treatment or at discontinuation as 
AEs. 
 
11.5. Vital signs, body weight and height  
 
Vital signs assessments include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature  and oxygen 
saturation by pulse oximetry . Vital signs and weight should be measured at screening and at the 
time points as indicated in the flowchart (see Section  1.1). Body weight should be used to 
prepare the IMP infusion bag as described in Section  9.4. Height will be recorded only at the 
screening visit.  
 
11.6. Eastern co operative oncology group (ECOG) performance status  
 
The ECOG performance status quantifies the functional status of the patient and should be  
determined by the investigator or a medically qualified delegate  according Table 1 .

Grade  Description  
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre -disease performance without restriction.  
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out 
work of a light or sedentary nature (e.g. light housework, office work).  
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self -care, but unable to carry out any work activities. 
Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.  
3 Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of 
waking hours.  
4 Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self -care. Totally confined to bed or 
chair.  
5 Death.  
 
 
11.7. Pulmonary Function Testing  
Pulmonary function testing should be done according to local hospital standards, and may 
include spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide or peripheral oxygen 
saturation.  
 
11.8. Determination of HER2 tumour status  
HER2 tumour status will be determined on most recent available tumour tissue . Tumour tissue 
taken from previously irradiat ed areas should not be used for the analysis. Formalin -fixed 
paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks or freshly cut FFPE tissue slides should be sent to a 
central laboratory for assessment of HER2 expression by IHC and ISH,  accord ing to the 
instructions in the laboratory manual . The remaining part of the tumour block will be returned 
to the institution.  If no archived tumour material is available a biopsy should be performed to 
obtain tumour material. The biopsy s hould be performed  according to local routine  clinical 
practice .  
 
A patient will be considered eligible  if the central laboratory reports a HER2 expression grade 
1+, 2+ or 3+ by means of IHC analysis  and/or ISH positive.  
 
In general, in case the HER2 tumour assessment was unevaluable, it is allowed  to send in new 
material for re -analysis.  
 
11.9. Genetic tumour analysis  
 
Genetic tumour analysis will be performed by a central laboratory using a clinically validated  
next generation sequencing test. The analysis will be done on most recent available tumour 
tissue  in combination with blood analysis on germline DNA . Instructions for sample handling 
and shipment will be provided in the laboratory manual. The patients’ tu mour mutational profile 
will be determined, including microsatellite instability and tumour mutational burden. The 
genetic analysis will cover genes known to be involved in e.g. DNA damage repair pathways, 
apoptosis, cell cycle and senescence pathways. In addition, gene expression levels by RNA -
sequencing may be analy zed as well.

 11.10.  Haematology and  blood chemistry  
 
Blood samples will be taken and analyzed  by the local laboratory  for h aematology and blood 
chemistry  according to local routine clinical practice. In general, t he following parameters  will 
be included, but it may differ slightly between local laboratories:  
 
Haematology:  Erythrocyte counts, haematocrit, haem oglobin, mean cell volume 
(MCV), full and differential white blood cell counts (baso phils, 
eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neut rophils), mean corpuscular 
haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelets . 
Serum  biochemistry:  Albumin, alkaline phosphatase  (AP) , ALT, AST, total  and direct (i.e. 
conjugated)  bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen  (BUN ) (i.e. urea ), calcium, 
chloride, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), GGT, glucose, inorganic 
phosphorus, LDH, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, uric 
acid.  
 
Sampling should be done as indicated in the flowchart (see Section  1.1). The Day 1 samples  
should be taken as closely as possible to the start of the new cycle, but may be done up to 3 
days before. If the screening assessment is done within 5 days before the first infusion, no new 
analysis needs to be done at Cycle 1 Day 1 . Results of the local  laboratory should be available 
before the start of the new cycle to determine if the patient can continue or not. Patients with 
screening values not in line with inclusion criteri on 7 are not eligible to enter the study (see 
Section  8.1). For dose modific ations or treatment discontinuations based on abnormal 
laboratory values, see Section 9.6 . Clinically relevant laboratory values occurring during the 
study should be recorded as AEs, preferably as a diagnosis or symptom.  
 
The Sponsor  should be provided wit h a copy of the local laboratory’s certification and a 
tabulation of the normal ranges and units of each parameter collected in the eCRF. The 
investigator is responsible for reviewing all laboratory reports for patients in the study and 
evaluating any abno rmalities for clinical significance.  
 
11.11.  Pregnancy test  
 
To exclude pregnancy in women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test should be 
performed at screening and a serum or urine pregnancy test during treatment . 
 
In the event a patient becomes pregnant during the study, treatment is to be discontinued. The 
outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up according to the procedures described in 
Section 12.9 . 
 
11.12.  LVEF assessment  
 
LVEF should be measured by echocardiogram  or MUGA scan according to the routine local 
clinical practice. Although both echo and MUGA can be used, the method must remain the 
same per patient from screening onwards. Results of the examinations should be documented 
in the patient’s medical chart and  the eCRF.

 If LVEF is below 50% the next assessment should be performed during the next cycle as 
indicated in the dose modification Section 9.6.1.3.  
 
The Day  1 examinations should be performed as closely as possible to the start of the new cycle, 
but may be done up to 7 days before. Results should be available before the start of the new 
cycle. Any clinical ly relevant findings should be reported as an AE.  
 
11.13.  ECG assessment  
 
Standard 12 -lead ECG should  be recorded in supine position after the patients being 5 minutes 
at rest.  
ECGs should be recorded in triplicate for at least 3 seconds with approximately a 3 -7 minutes’ 
gap between each of the triplicate readings.  ECGs should be obtained before study drug 
administration for all patients.  
 
Evaluation should be done by the investigator  or qualified delegate and any clinically 
significant abnormalities during treatment should be reported as AEs. Key parameters , 
includ ing the QT/QTc interval,  will be recorded in the CRF. Printouts of the ECGs should be 
retained for each patient.  
 
11.14.  Ophthalmological examination  
An ophthalmologist (or qualified delegate) should perform the eye examination, which should 
at least include a slit lamp exam, corneal sensitivity testing, fluorescence tear film break -up 
time, and pachymetry. Details of the findings should be recorded in the patient’s medical chart 
and the CRF. Abnormal findings at screening are to be rep orted in the medical history and any 
clinical ly significant findings during treatment or at discontinuation as AEs.  
 
The Day  1 examinations should be performed as closely as possible to the start of the new cycle, 
but may be done up to 7 days before. Resul ts should be available before the start of the new 
cycle.  
 
11.15.  Tumour evaluation  
 
Measurable and non -measurable lesions must be documented at screening (within 28 days of 
start study treatment) and must be re -assessed at each subsequent tumour evaluation. Tum our 
response will be assessed locally according to RECIST version 1.1 until disease progression 
(for details see Appendix 1).  
 
Scans will be collected and stored by a central imaging laboratory. Independent and blinded 
assessment of these scans may be ini tiated at a later point in time when deemed necessary.  
  
Patients must have at least one measurable cancer lesion that is evaluable per RECIST v1.1 (see 
Appendix  1) to be eligible for the study.  
 
The assessment technique used at screening should be used th roughout the study. Technical 
imaging parameters are defined  in the  imaging  manual. All images are to be submitted to the

 central imaging centre. Preferably the same investigator/radiologist should assess all tumour 
responses for each patient.  
 
CT or MRI scans that were performed before a patient signed the “Main” -ICF may be used to 
provide screening tumour status as long as they were performed within 28 days prior to start 
IMP treatment, at the same hospital, with the same technique or machine and pre ferably by the 
same individual as those for the tumour assessments during the study. This should be 
documented in the study files at the site.  
 
Tumour evaluations will be performed every 6 weeks (± 3 days) after the date of start IMP 
treatment, for the fir st 24 weeks and every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter. The timing of the 
tumour assessments is independent of dosing delays. If tumour evaluation falls at the Day 1 of 
a cycle (in case there are no treatment delays), it can also be performed up to 7 days pr ior to the 
Day 1 visit, but should always be done prior to IMP infusion.  
 If a tumour assessment has to be performed earlier or later, subsequent assessments should be 
conducted according to the original schedule based on the date of start IMP treatment.  
 
Tumour evaluation at the discontinuation visit is required for patients who discontinue study 
treatment before first scheduled in -treatment tumour assessment (week 6) and for patients 
whose previous tumour assessment did not demonstrate PD and was done mor e than 21 days 
prior to the treatment discontinuation period. For patients who continue into the Observation 
Phase as described in Section 11.18.5 there is no need to perform tumour evaluation at the 
discontinuation visit, they should maintain the same tum our evaluation schedule as during the 
Treatment Phase.  
 
In cases where there is suspicion of progression before the next scheduled assessment, an 
unscheduled CT or MRI scan is to be performed, if possible.   
 
11.16.  Previous  and concomitant medication  
 
Information  on all prior received anticancer therapies must be recorded in the eCRF and 
reviewed in view of the required wash -out period as defined in the exclusion criteria. Other pre -
treatment medication and concomitant medication used between 14 days prior to sign ing the 
Main-ICF till the treatment discontinuation visit should be recorded in the CRF. The use of 
concomitant medication must relate to the documented medical history, an AE or be reported 
as prophylactic treatment. For details on allowed and not -allowed concomitant medication, see 
Section 10. 
 
11.17.  (Serious) adverse events  
 
For details of assessment and reporting of AEs, see Section 12. 
 
11.18.  Visit requirements

Maximally 28 days before start IMP treatment, potential patients will be evaluated to determine 
eligibility with the in - and exclusion criteria as described in Section 8.1.  
 
11.18.2.  Treatment phase  
 
Visit requirements are outlined in the study flowchart in Section 1.1. Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 11 . Visits are based on a 21 -day cycle (± 3 days).  
 
11.18.3.  Discontinuation visit  
 
The treatment discontinuation visit should occur at the time study treatment is discontinued for 
any reason  (e.g. due to PD, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent).  
 
11.18.4.  Follow -up 
A follow -up visit should be scheduled 30 days after the treatment discontinuation visit. In case 
a visit is not possible, the patient should be contacted by telephone. During this visit/contact, 
additional information on (S)AEs that were ongoing at the  previous visit will be collected, as 
well as information on new (S)AEs and concomitant medication used since that visit.   
 
11.18.5.  Observation phase  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than PD (e.g. toxicity), should 
continue into the Observation Phase of the study and continue tumour imaging according to 
their original schedule until the time of PD or start of a new anticancer therapy.  
 
11.18.6.  Survival f ollow -up 
 
After the 30 -day follow up visit and/or observation period a patient will be fol lowed up for data 
on disease progression, new anticancer therapies, and survival. These survival follow -up 
contacts should continue until patient’s death, lost to follow -up, consent withdrawal or end of 
study data collection, whichever comes first.  
 
11.19.  Study assessments after last patient enrolled  
 
Study assessments will continue as per flowchart (see Section 1.1) until a ll patients are enrolled  
and treated in the main study  for at least 6 months or have discontinued study  participation . 
Patients who are still  on treatment beyond this date may continue treatment , but the frequency 
and number of study assessments may be reduced as per instructions of the Sponsor. Collected 
information, such as the toxicity profile of the study drug, will be used to justify the a dapted 
assessment schedule and details will be documented appropriately. Safety assessments and 
safety reporting will continue in such a way that patient’s safety is adequately monitored and 
documented .

AE An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and  
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
TEAE  An treatment emergent adverse event i s any event not present prior to the initiation of the 
treatments or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency 
following exposure to the treatments.  
ADR  An adverse drug reaction is any noxious and unintended response to a med icinal product 
related to any dose. This definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the AE and the IMP, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
Unexpected ADR  An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not  consistent with the  
risk information set out in the IB.  
SAE  An AE that is/ results in:  
− Fatal;  
− Life-threatening;  
− Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
− Admission to hospital as an in -patient or prolongation of hospital stay;  
− A congenital anomaly;  
− Other important medical event.  
 
Note when assigning one of the above serious outcomes the following should be referred 
to: 
 
Life-threatening:  Any adverse drug experience that places the patient, in the view of the 
investigator, at immed iate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e. it does not 
include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Hospitalization:  Admission overnight to an acute care hospital. Procedures done in or 
visits to a  clinic or outpatient facility are not considered serious AEs (SAEs). Admission 
to a rehabilitation facility, transitional care unit, or nursing home is not considered a 
hospitalization.  
 
Prolonged hospitalization:  Any AE that extends a patient’s hospital stay beyond the 
normal expected time.  
 
Disability:  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
 
Congenital anomaly:  Intrauterine development of an organ or structure that is abnormal 
in form, structure, or position.  
 
Important medical event:  Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important 
medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalisation but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be 
considered serious.  
SUSAR  A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction is a serious ADR t hat is not identified 
in nature or  severity in the risk information set out in the IB  or SmPC/PI . 
Proto col defined 
events  of special 
interest  (AESI)  The following events are adverse events of special interest  and will need to be reported 
to the CRO expeditiously, irrespective of regulatory seriousness criteria or causality:  
– Pneumonitis/ILD,  
– Keratitis grade ≥ 2,  
– Other ocular toxicity grade ≥ 3  
– LVEF decrease to < 50%.

SYD985.003                                                          Version 3.0  
                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
12.2. Adverse event monitoring  
 
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety and for providing appropriate medical 
care in patients who have entered this study (i.e. from the signing of “Main -ICF” onwards). In 
addition, the investigator remains responsible for following AEs that are serious, drug -related,  
AESIs,  or that caus ed the participant to discontinue treatment until the event has resolved or 
until the event has stabilized and determined to be persistent.  
Each patient will be carefully questioned and/or examined by the investigator or a medically 
qualified delegate to obtain information regarding AEs (including SAEs) at each visit until the 
last protocol specified visit or contact. All AEs will be reported and documented as stated 
below.  
12.3. Adverse events documentation  
 
AEs will be collected from signing of the Main -ICF up to the follow -up visit 30 days after 
treatment discontinuation.  AEs occurring between signing the HER2 testing -ICF and the Main -
ICF do not n eed to be reported, unless it is related to study procedures (i.e. when a tumour 
biopsy is performed under the HER2 testing -ICF). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -
existi ng conditions that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need 
not be considered AEs. Worsening of pre -existing conditions should be reported as a (S)AE.  
 
The investigator/designee is responsible for recording all AEs which have occurred during the 
study in the patient’s medical charts and in the eCRF, regardless of their relationship to the 
study drug. This includes AEs spontaneously reported by the patient, observed by the 
investigator/designee or elicited by general non -leading questioning, as well as clinically 
important deviations of laboratory valu es from normal ranges. The investigator will review this 
data and determine the severity and causality as per the definitions provided in Section s 0 and 
12.3.2 .  
 
Note that by definition AEs include accidents (e.g. motor vehicle accidents) and the reasons for 
changes in concomitant medication ( drug and/or dose), medical, nursing and/or pharmacy 
consultation, and admission to hospital and surgical operations. Progression of the underlying 
malignancy  itself is not considered to be an AE.  
 
Planned hospital admissions and/or surgical operations/proc edures for an illness or disease that 
existed before the investigational product was given or the patient was enrolled in a clinical 
study are not to be considered AEs. This needs to be documented clearly in the patient’s medical 
records. Note that any (pr olongation of) hospitalization resulting from these planned admissions 
or procedures are to be recorded as SAEs.  
 
Clinical laboratory data collected during the course of the study, which exceed or drop below 
the acceptable limits for the patient population  and which, based on baseline values, are 
considered by the investigator to be clinically significant, will be reported as an AE. Note that 
if clinically significant abnormal laboratory values lead to, or are associated with clinical 
symptom(s), the diagno sis should be reported as an AE rather than the abnormal laboratory 
value to allow proper coding.

                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If a patient’s participation is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly 
document the circumstances and data leading to the reaso n for discontinuation.  
12.3.1.  Adverse events severity  
 
The investigator should determine the severity of AEs according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE ) (version 5.0) (see the website 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). AEs that are not 
listed in the CTCAE should be graded according to Table . 
 
Table 2: Adverse Event grading (for events not listed in the CTCAE)  
Grade  Equivalent to:  Definition  
Grade 1    Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death  Death related to AE.  
 
12.3.2.  Adverse events causality  
 
The investigator will determine the relationship of any AE to the study  drug according to the 
following guidelines:  
 
Unlikely Related:   
A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lack ing or unclear.  
Probably Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
 
If a clinical event occurred before the patient received study drug, the causality will be 
considered as Not Applicable.   
 
12.4. Serio us adverse events documentation  
 
The following information must be provided  for all SAEs :  
• Detailed patient  data;

                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • Exact documentation of the event ; 
• Exact description of the temporal sequence to the therapy course ; 
• Documentation of the results of diagnostic and therapeutic measurements ; 
• Details of the development and outcome including medical judgement ; 
• As much other supporting data as possible which are important for the judgement 
concerning the relationship of the SAE to the study  drug; 
• Critical examination of the relationship to the study  drug; 
• Name of the reporter . 
 
Events solely  due to the progression of underlying malignancy should not be reported as 
an SAE . Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if the symptom cannot be 
determined as exclusively due to the progression of the underlying malignancy, or does not fit 
the expected pattern of progression for the underlying disease . In case of progression of disease, 
the patient must be discontinued from the study.  
 
All SAEs mus t be followed until resolved or stabilized. The investigator must obtain and 
maintain files of all pertinent medical data relating to the event. This includes medical records, 
information and medical judgments from any party who assists in the treatment an d follow -up 
of the patient .  
 
12.5. Reporting of serious adverse events  
 
The occurrence of any SAE from signing of the Main -ICF up to the follow -up visit 30 days 
after discontinuation  visit (regardless of relationship to IMP) has to be notified immediately 
(with in 24 hours of the investigator or designee becoming aware of the event) to the CRO via 
the electronic data capture system . This also applies to study procedure -related SAEs that occur 
between signing the HER2 testing -ICF and Main -ICF. In case the SAE cann ot be reported via 
the system, a completed serious adverse event report ing form should be send by fax to the  
Pharmacovigilance  Department of  …... 
 
The investigator or designee must promptly report (within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event) clinically  significant follow -up information pertaining to the SAE  to the CRO. The 
investigator is obliged to pursue and provide additional information as requested by  
Sponsor /CRO medical monitor or its designee. The final outcome of the SAE has to be reported 
in the electronic data capture system or if not available , by fax .  
 
The CRO will report all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the 
appropriate Regulatory Agencies, adhering to timelines for reporting outlined as per the 
(inter)national and local regulatory requirements and ICH GCP Guideline. For this study the 
Investigator’s Brochure contains the reference safety information and is to be used to assess the 
expectedness of an AE  for SYD985 .  
 
Investigators must report all SAEs to their Independent Ethic Committee (IEC)/ Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) according to local requirements .

SYD985.003                                                          Version 3.0  
                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The following events are protocol defined AEs  of Special Interest  (AESI)  and will need to be 
reported to the CRO expeditiously, irrespective of regulatory seriousness criteria or causality:  
• ILD/P neumonitis ; 
• Keratitis grade ≥ 2;  
• Other ocular  toxicity grade ≥ 3;  
• LVEF decrease  to < 50%.  
 
AESIs should be reported expeditiously to the CRO from start of study drug up to the follow -
up visit 30 days after treatment discontinuation, irrespective of regulatory seriousness criteria 
or causality. Initial AESIs and follow -up information should be re ported to the CRO within 5 
days of the investigator becoming aware of it, with the same details as for SAEs.     
 
All AESIs  must be followed until resolved or stabilized. The investigator must obtain and 
maintain files of all pertinent medical data relatin g to the event. This includes medical records, 
information and medical judgments from any party who assists in the treatment and follow -up 
of the patient.  
 
12.7. Reporting of death  
 
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (from signi ng of the “Main -
ICF”  up to up to the follow -up visit 30 days after  treatment discontinuation) that are, according 
to the investigator, due solely  to the progression of underlying malignancy , should not be 
recorded  as an (S)AE. Instead, date and reason of d eath should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Concurrent AEs should be reported as ongoing at the time of death.  
 
All other deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period should be 
recorded on an SAE eCRF and should be reported expeditiously.  During post -study survival 
follow -up, deaths due to any cause should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
 
12.8. Reporting of serious breaches  
 
A serious breach is defined as a protocol deviation which is likely to affect to a significant 
degree : 
• The safety, physical or mental integrity of the patient in the study; or  
• The scientific value of the study.  
 
The investig ator should notify the CRO in case of a suspected serious breach within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the breach. Additionally, protocol deviations will be reviewed by the 
Sponsor  / CRO during the study and suspected serious breaches will be identified. Th e Sponsor  
will define if the suspected serious breach is considered a serious breach. Depending on the 
nature of the breach, regulatory agencies, ethics committees and investigators will be notified  
in line with applicable laws and regulations.  
 
12.9. Reporting of pregnancies  
 
If a patient would become pregnant during the course of the study, the investigator or qualified 
designee must contact the CRO within 5 working days of the investigator or qualified designee

 first becoming aware of, or is being notified / informed about th e pregnancy. The notification 
must include a completed pregnancy reporting form. If a SAE  occurs in conjunction with the 
pregnancy, then the reporting time frame for an SAE (24 hours) must be met. The anticipated 
date of birth or termination of the pregnan cy should be provided at the time of the initial report.  
The patient must be followed up until birth or termination of the pregnancy and the outcome of 
the pregnancy should be forwarded to the Sponsor /CRO as soon as it is known.  
 
A patient who becomes preg nant during the study must  be discontinued from treatment.  
 
13. Criteria for patient discontinuation, replacement and study termination  
13.1. Patient discontinuation  
 
Patients participating in this study have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason. A patient must be discontinued from the study when the patient withdraws informed 
consent. From that moment onwards no new data can be collected from that patient. However, 
in the case that the patient  decides to prematurely discontinue study treat ment ( e.g. “refuses 
treatment“ ) or discontinues study treatment prior to progressive disease, e.g. for toxicity or 
investigators decision, she will remain in the study and will continue all protocol -required 
follow -up visits according to the flow -chart (Se ction 1.1). The primary reason for study 
treatment discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRF and in the patient’s medical chart.  
 
The investigator has the right and duty to stop treatment in any case in which emerging effects 
are of such nature that the  benefit -risk ratio is unacceptable to the individual patient. In addition, 
the investigator is to stop treatment of any patient with unmanageable factors that may interfere 
significantly with the study procedure and/or interpretation of the results. As an  excessive rate 
of withdrawals can render the study not interpretable, unnecessary withdrawal of patients 
should be avoided.  
 
The investigator should discontinue a patient from study treatment  for reasons including but 
not limited to the following:  
• Diseas e progression ; 
• Unacceptable toxicity , including;  
o Clinically significant symptomatic cardiac disease (see Section 9.6.1.3); 
o Clinically significant drug -related toxicity requiring dose delay or interruption 
which did not resolve within 42 days from the last dose received;  
o Grade 4 infusion -related reaction or a Grade 3 infusion -related reaction which 
is not responsive to symptomatic medication and/or interruption of infusion;  
o Grade 3 (or higher) ocular toxicity ; 
o Grade 2, 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis;  
• Pregnancy;  
• Substantial non -compliance with the requirements of the study;  
• Investigator decision based on the patient’s best interest ; 
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor.  
 
Patients who discontinue from study treatment for any of the above reasons should return to the 
clinic for a treatment discontinuation and follow up visit after the last administration of st udy 
drug. Subsequently , these patients will continue to be followe d according to protocol for disease

                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 progression  (if discontinued for other reasons than PD) , unresolved AEs, new anticancer 
therapies, and survival status as detailed in Section 11.17.5 and 11.17.6 .  
 
If a patient decides to completely withdraw from the st udy participation, the reason for 
withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the eCRF and in the patient’s medical chart. 
Discontinuation is permanent, once a patient is discontinued it is not allowed to enrol the patient 
again in the study. When a pati ent discontinues the study, all efforts should be made to complete 
and report clinical observations prior to withdrawal from study participation as thoroughly as 
possible.  
 
In cases where patient contact is lost, a patient should be considered lost to foll ow-up only after 
multiple efforts have been made to contact the patient.  
 
13.2. Patient replacement  
A patient that discontinues from treatment or study will not be replaced.  
 
13.3. Start and end of study  
 
The overall study  begins when the first patient  has signed th e ICF. The overall study ends when 
the last patient completed the last study visit , discontinued from the study or is lost to follow -
up.  
 
The sponsor may decide to stop further r ecruitment in the study  or at (a) particular site(s) due 
to insufficient compliance with the protocol, GCP and/or other applicable regulatory 
requirements, procedure related problems , too low recruitment speed, or any other medical, 
ethical, or business reason. Additionally, the  clinical study  will be stopped prema turely if the 
extent (incidence or severity) of emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that the benefit -risk 
ratio to the study  population as a whole is unacceptable.  In such case, all ongoing patients will 
be requested to return to the clinic for a f inal follow -up visit, during which all treatment 
discontinuation assessments should be conducted. Additional safety monitoring assessments 
may also be performed, should the reason for termination of the study dictate such assessments.  
 
14. Study evaluation , statistical considerations and data analysis  
14.1. General considerations for data analysis  
 
The statistical considerations and analysis plan are summarized in this chapter. A detailed 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared following finalization of the protocol and eCRF 
and will be finalized well in advance of database lock. Any deviations from, or additions to, the 
original analysis plan described in the protocol will be documented in the SAP and final study 
report.  
 
All study variables will be analysed  using appropriate descriptive statistical methods. The 
statistical software used for analysis will be SAS® release 9.4 or higher. Continuous data will 
be summarized by their mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. 
Categorical and ordinal da ta will be summarized in frequency tables by their absolute frequency 
(N) and relative frequency (%).

 As it is anticipated that accrual will be spread thinly across sites and summaries of data by site 
would be unlikely to be informative, data from all participating sites will be pooled prior to 
analysis.   
 
All data from all clinical assessments whether ex plicitly referred to in this statistics section or 
not, will be presented in data listings.  
 
Since the secondary endpoints are exploratory in nature, no adjustments for multiple 
comparisons will be conducted.  
 
14.1.1.  Missing data  
 
As the duration of treatment fo r a given patient  will depend on efficacy and tolerability, the 
duration of follow -up will vary between patients . Consequently, there will be no imputation for 
missing data.  
Handling of incomplete data required for analysis will be detailed in the SAP.  
 
14.2. Analysis populations  
14.2.1.  Full analysis set  
 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all patients  who received at least 1 full dose or partial 
dose of SYD985 . The FAS will be used for all listings of raw data, demographic and baseline 
characteristics, and safety analyses. Unless otherwise specified, the FAS will be the default 
analysis set used for analyses.   
 
14.2.2.  Efficacy analysis set  
 
The efficacy analysis set consists of a subset of the FAS patients who has a baseline and at least 
one post -baseline tumour evaluation assessment. The efficacy set will be used for the efficacy 
analysis.  
 
14.3. Timing of analysis  
14.3.1.  Interim analysis  
 
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study.  
 
14.3.2.  Main analysis  
 
The primary analysis will be performed when all patients have been enrolled in the main study 
for at least 6 months or have discontinued study participation (i.e. completed the last study visit 
due to disease progression or start of a new anticancer therap y, discontinued from the study or 
lost to follow -up). All data collected after this date will be summarized and added to the final 
study report, e.g. as an appendix.

The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR based on investigator assessed tumour assessment 
according to RECIST 1.1. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall 
response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The de termination of tumour 
responses is described in Appendix 1 . Both non-confirmed tumour responses as well as 
confirmed tumour  responses  (by second assessment at least 4 weeks after first assessment) will 
be used for efficacy evaluation.  
 
14.5.2.  Secondary endpoints  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• PFS;  
• OS; 
• Safety . 
 
PFS (Investigator assessed ) is defined as  the time from the date of first IMP intake  to the date 
of first documented investigator -assessed disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 or 
death due to any cause  (whichever occurs earlier). Handling of missing values will be similar 
as described for the primary endpoint.  
 
OS is defined as the time from date of first IMP intake  to date of death due to any cause. Patients 
who are alive or who are not known to have died at the time of the analysis will be censored at 
the last known date they were alive. Patients with no post -baseline information will be censored 
at the date of sta rt IMP treatment plus 1 day.  
 
14.5.3.  Other  endpoints  
 
• To describe time to response ; 
• To describe duration of response ; 
• To describe the CBR;  
• To explore genomic profile/response relationships.  
 
14.6. Efficacy analysis  
14.6.1.  Primary objective  
 
The primary objective of the stud y is to evaluate the anticancer activity of SYD985 with respect

 14.6.1.1.1.  Objective response rate  
 
The primary efficacy  endpoint  is ORR, defined by RECIST 1.1. ORR will be calculated based 
on the Efficacy Analysis  population. The ORR will be based on calculated responses from 
investigator  lesion assessment s. Proportion of patients with ORR will be presented along with 
95% CIs. Patient s with unknown or missing res ponse will be treated as non -responders , i.e. 
they will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage.  
 
14.6.2.  Secondary objective  
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate SYD985 with respect  to PFS and OS. 
 
14.6.2.1.  Analysis  
14.6.2.1.1.  Investigator assessed PFS  
 
Investigator assessed PFS  will be calculated based on the Efficacy Analysis  population. The 
survivor distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. The median PFS 
along with 95% CI will be presented.  
 
14.6.2.1.2.  Overa ll survival  
 
The analysis for OS will be based on the Efficacy Analysis  population. The median duration of 
survival will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
 
14.6.3.  Other objectives  
 
Exploratory endpoints of this study include time to response, duration of response and clinical 
benefit rate.  
 
Time to response is the time between the date of first IMP intake  until first documented 
response (CR or PR) according to RECIST 1.1.  
 
Duration of response applies to patients whose best overall response was CR or PR according 
to RECIST 1.1 , the start date is the date of first documented response (CR or PR) and the end 
date is the date defined as first documented disease progression or death from any cause 
(whichever occurs first).  
 
The CBR is defined as the propor tion of patients with CR, PR, or SD (SD for 24 weeks or 
longer ). CR, PR and SD are defined according to RECIST 1.1. CBR will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics. These assessments  will be analyzed based on the data observed in 
the FAS population and  will be determined by investigator tumour assessment.  
 
If data allow, exploratory analysis or modeling techniques will be used to investigate the 
relationship between genomic profile  and safety/efficacy parameters.

with special  attention will be the safety  assessments , the ICF process and the primary study 
endpoint.   
15.3. Data handling and records retention  
15.3.1.  Collection of data and data management  
 
All data collected for this study is to be  recorded in the patient medical charts according to 
standard practice at the investigational site and according to additional requirements of the 
study. The relevant data will be transcribed from the patient’s medical chart into the eCRF. All 
data that is  collected in the eCRF, including the eCRF itself, will be anonymous and will not 
reveal the patient’s name. All documents will be identified by the patient number.  The eCRFs 
must be kept up -to-date so that they always reflect the latest observations on th e patients  
enrolled in the study . CRFs should be signed -off by the investigator as soon as possible after 
the patient discontinued/completed the study . A monitor will review the completed eCRF.  All 
source data should be kept in conformance to applicable na tional laws and regulations.  
 
For patients who fail screening, data are to be collected from the time the Main -informed 
consent is signed until it is determined that the patient has failed the screening. Minimal 
information should be completed on the eCRF such as patient demographics, disease

APPENDI X 1: Tumour evaluation criteria (based on RECIST 1.1)  
Method of assessment  
Tumour evaluation will include systemic use of clinical, radiological, and/or other methods to 
be able to determine tumour progression. Radiological assessment of tumour burden should be 
performed by CT (preferred) or MRI scan and will follow the RECIST 1.1 criteria.16  
 
The same assessment technique must be used throughout the study for evaluating a particular 
lesion and the same investigator/radiologist should assess the t umour responses for each patient.  
 
Review of tumour response  
Tumour assessments should include an evaluation of all known and/or suspected sites of 
disease, whenever possible. Patients should have lesions selected that can be evaluated at every 
tumour assessment. Patients with non -measurable disease whose non -target lesions are not 
assessed at a follow -up visit will be considered unevaluable at that visit unless PD is assessed.  
 
Definition of measurable and non -measurable lesions  
Measurable lesio ns 
Measurable lesions are defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter is to be recorded) and have a minimum size of 10 mm when 
measured by CT scan with a CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm, or ha ve a minimum 
size of 10 mm with ca lliper measurements by clinical exam. If scans are used with a slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of measurable lesions should be twice the slice 
thickness  
 
Measurable malignant lymph nodes need to have a minimum size of 15 mm in short axis when 
assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  
 
Non-measurable lesions  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm shor t axis), are regarded as non -measurable. Leptomen ingeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or peripheral effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, or abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by 
physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques are all non -
measurable.  
 
Special considerations regarding lesion measurability  
Measurements of bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy 
require special considerations : 
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence 
or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CT or

SYD985.003                                                          Version 3.0  
                                                                              30 Sep 2020  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability described above . 
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, 
definition, simple cy sts. 
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for sele ction as target 
lesions.  
 
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
 
Baseline documentation of target and non -target l esions  
When more than one measurable lesion is present, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions 
in total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ), representative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions. This means that for patient s with only one or two involved organs, 
the maximum number of target lesions is two or four, respectively.  
 
Target lesions should be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should be usable for reproducible repeated 
measurements. The largest lesion may not always lend itself to reproducible measurement, in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion should be selected.  
 
Lymph nodes should be classified using the shortest axis, where a short axe of < 10 mm as 
assessed by CT scan signifies non -pathological lymph nodes. Lymph nodes with a short axis ≥ 
10 mm but < 15 mm are non -measurable, pathological lymph nodes. Only lymph nodes with a 
short axis ≥ 15 mm as assessed by CT scan can be use d as measurable target lesions.  
 
A sum of the diameters for all target lesions (longest diameter for the non -nodal lesions, and 
the shortest diameter for nodal lesions) will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters.  
 
All other lesions will automatically qualify as non -target lesions and these lesions will be 
recorded as ‘present’ at baseline. Measurement of non -target lesions is not required.  
 
Response criteria  
To determine tumour response, the sum of the diameters of the target lesions will be recorded. 
The target lesions will be evaluated as follows:  
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node 
(whether target or non -target) must have a short axis reduction to 
< 10 mm.

 Partial Respons e (PR):  At least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
when compared to baseline.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
compared to the smallest sum of diameters found in the study, 
including the baseline sum. In addition, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor su fficient 
increase to qualify for PD, when compared to the smallest sum of 
diameters while on study.  
 
Target lesions should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation . 
Lesions which after baseline decrease in size to less than 5 m m will be categorized as too small 
to measure (TSTM) and a default value of 5 mm will be adjudicated.  
Target nodal lesions should also have their actual measurement recorded, even when that 
measurement is below 10 mm (which would signify a normal lymph nod e). In the event the 
nodal lesion decreases to less than 5 mm it will be categorized as too small to measure (TSTM) 
and assigned a default value of 5 mm. For complete responses, the sum of the diameters of the 
target lesions may therefore be higher than ze ro while still qualifying for a complete response, 
due to the inclusion of lymph nodes. In order to achieve a complete response, the target nodal 
lesion must achieve a short axis < 10 mm.  
 
In addition, the non -target lesions will be evaluated as follows:  
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesions.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of exist ing non -target lesions and/or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
To achieve an unequivocal progression of non -target lesions, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in these lesions, such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in the target 
lesions, the overall tumour burden has increase sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  
If a new lesion is equivocal because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
 
The patient’s overall response assignment on each assessment will depend on the finding s of 
both target and non -target lesio ns and will also take into consideration the appearance of new 
lesions. Per tumour assessment, the evaluation of target and non -target lesions will be combined 
to give an overall response ( see Table s A1 and A2 ).

Evaluation of best overall response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start IMP treatment  until 30 
days after the last dose of study treatment .  
The best overall response is defined as the best response across all assessments. For example, 
a patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment 
has a best overall response of PR. When SD is believed to be the bes t response, it must also 
meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met , when 
SD is other -wise the best response, the patient’s best overall response depends on the 
subsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD at second 
assessment and does not meet the minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. 
The same patient lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered 
unevaluable.     
 
To be assigned a stat us of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least 
once after study entry at a minimal interval of 6 weeks.

patients may continue treatment at the same dose level as b efore or the dose can be reduced, at 
the discretion  of the investigator. Subsequent dosing delays or treatment discontinuation should 
be considered in case the ocular toxicity persists. The ocular toxicity should be monitored by 
an ophthalmologist (or qual ified delegate) for recovery.

 Justification for the amendment  
 
This substantial amendment has been prepared for the following reasons:  
• On April 1 5, 2020, the name of Synthon Biopharmaceuticals B.V. was changed to  
Byondis B.V. The legal entity of the company was not changed. The Clinical Study 
Protocol was updated with the new Sponsor name and logo  and converted to a new 
template .  
• Inclusion criterion 3 has been reworded for clarification to assure correct and consistent 
understanding .  
• A time w indow  is added  for the pregnancy test at C1D1 to align with the allowed blood 
sampling window for haematology/chemistry.  
• Patient discontinuation criteria updated to reflect the change to Section 9.6.1.1 (Dose 
modifications for ocular toxicity) as de scribed in Protocol Amendment I.  
 
Apart from editorial changes, t his has led to the following changes in the protocol text, all 
included in version 3.0 of the protocol. New text is underlined , deleted text is strikethrough . 
 
Protocol Synopsis  and Section 8 .1.1: Study population / Inclusion criteria  
3. Eligible patients should have progressed on or after first line platinum -based chemotherapy 
for advanced/metastatic endometrial cancer. Patients who have had two or more lines of 
chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease are not eligible , taking into account the 
following:  
– Patients may have received up to one additional line of chemotherapy if given in the 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting . If such treatment was completed less than 6 months 
prior  to the current tumour recurrence or progression  it is to be considered first -line 
treatment;  
– No more than one line of non -cytotoxic systemic cancer therapy (such as 
immunotherapy, trastuzumab or protein kinase inhibitors) is allowed.  
Note: there is no restriction regarding to the lines of prior hormonal therapy.  
 
Now reads as:

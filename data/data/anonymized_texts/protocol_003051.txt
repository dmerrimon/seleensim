Protocol  Summary  
 
Background    
 
Preliminary evidence suggests that 8 -week training programs in meditation and exercise lead to reductions in incidence, 
duration and severity of acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness.1 
 Methods  
 
In this parallel 3 -group phase 2 trial, women  and men aged 30 to 69 will be randomized to: 1) an 8- week behavioral 
training program in mindfulness meditation, 2) an intensity, duration and location- matched 8 -week program  in sustained 
moderate intensity exerc ise, or 3) a wait-list observational control group.  Recruitment will target those who do not 
exercise regularly, and have not had training in meditation. 
 Outcomes    
 The primary outcome will be severity -weighted total days of ARI illness as assessed by self -reports on the validated 
Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24).   Number of ARI illness episodes, total days of ARI 
illness, ARI -related visits to h ealth care facilities, and time lost from work and school due to ARI illness will be a ssessed 
as secondary outcomes. Weekly computer- assisted telephone monitoring for ARI illness will be conducted by personnel 
blinded to intervention group.  Blood and nasal wash samples will be obtained at baseline, one month after the end of the 8-week interventions, and once again three months later.  Blood and nasal wash samples will be obtained approximately 
24-72 hours into each ARI episode.  N asal wash samples will be tested with multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to 
identify etiological agents .  Serum and nasal wash will be analyzed for interleukin-6, interleukin -8, C- reactive protein, 
procalcitonin , and interferon- gamma -induced protein 10. These  inflammatory biomarkers will serve as objective 
indicators of disease severity to compare with illness severity self-reported on the WURSS -24.  Study participants will fill 
out validated questionnaire s assessing perceived stress, self- efficacy, mindfulnes s, social support, and general mental and 
physical health  at baseline and at least twice after behavioral trainings .  Inflammatory biomarkers and psychosocial 
indicators will be analyzed as potential mediators of causal pathways leading from behavioral training interventions to 
ARI illness outcomes.  
 Timeframe / logistics   
 
This will be a 5 -year project, with 4 yearly cohorts of n=99 per cohort randomized into 3 groups of n=33 each. Assuming 
9% loss to follow -up, the final sample size will be n=360 study participants, with n=120 in each comparison group.  
Enrollment, randomization and study interventions will begin in September of each year .  Participants will be monitored 
by weekly self -report through May.  Summers will be used for data cleaning, preliminary analyses, and for recruiting the 
next year’s cohort.  
 
Analysis    
 Analyses will proceed as follows: 1) descriptive analyses of all variables; 2) assessment and potential response t o outliers 
and missing data; 3) calculation of area -under- curve severity weighted days of ARI illness ; 4) primary efficacy analyses; 
and 5) secondary analyses, including assessment of intervention impact on secondary outcomes, longitudinal analyses, 
and process (mediation) analyses.  Primary e fficacy will be assessed using zero -inflated mu ltivariate regression models.    
Generalized estimating equations, random -effects pattern -mixture models, and hierarchical l inear models will be used to 
assess longitudinal effects, interactions, and covariate mediation.

1 Introduction  
 
Acute respiratory infection (ARI), including common cold and influenza, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, 
and has a major  economic impact.2-7 Both mental and physical heal th are linked to ARI burden.8-12 For example, people 
who report more neg ative emotion and higher stress are more likely to get ARI.13-15  Exercise affects the immune system, 
improves physical and mental health, and may protect against ARI illness.16-21 Mindfulness meditation reduces perceived 
stress,22-27 influences the immune system,28-35  and may protect against ARI.1 Our own recent NCCAM -funded trial 
randomized 154 people to 3 groups: 1) meditation, 2) moderate intensity exercise, or 3) wait-list control. For the 149 
people followed to study completion, there were 40 ARI episodes and 453 days of illness in the control group, 27 episodes and 257 days of ARI illness in the meditation group, and 26 episodes and 241 days of ARI illness in the exercise group .
1 
Corresponding reductions in ARI- related work days lost to ARI illness were observed . The proposed research will build 
upon these findings with refined methodology in a larger sample to: A) determine whether these findings are replicable, 
and B) investigate potential explanatory pathways.  
 
This research will use state-of-the-art randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology to assess potential effects of 
meditation or exercise o n ARI outcomes.  Four cohorts of n=99 people each (total n=396) will be randomized to 3 groups: 
1) an 8-week training program in mindfulness meditation, 2) an attention, duration and location-matched program in 
progressive exercise, or 3) a non- interventional wait-list control group.  Each cohort will be observed for 8 months 
comprising the annual cold and flu season. The primary outcome will be area-under-the- curve severity -weighted days of 
ARI illness, with severity assessed using the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24).  
Secondary outcomes will include ARI- related health care visits, work time lost to ARI illness, and total work time lost.   
 Blood and nasal wash samples will be collected at baseline, 1 and 4 months after the end of the 8-week intervention, and 
approximately 24-72 hours into each ARI episode.  These samples will be assayed for neutrophil count and pro -
inflammatory cytokine  levels:  interleukin -6 (IL -6), interleukin -8 (IL -8), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), 
and interferon- gamma -induced protein 10 (IP-10) levels).  [Procalcitonin assays were dropped in 2014 due to all 
nondetectable values]  Nasal wash samples collected during ARI illness episodes will also be tested for nucleic acid using 
multiplex  P CR (polymerase chain reaction) methods.
36   
 
Self-report measures of perceived stress, positive and negative emotion, self -efficacy, social support, sleep quality , 
mindfulness, and general mental and physical health will be used to assess potential pathways through which interventions 
may exert influence on primary outcomes.  A zero -inflated Poisson regression model will test whether interventions 
influence severity and duration of ARI illness episodes.  Potential mediating effects of psychological and physical health domains will be assessed using appropriate mediation (process) analysis statistical models.  
 
Acute infection from influenza and other respiratory viruses leads to much human suffering and loss of economic 
productivity.  Our own evidence suggests that training in either meditation or exercise may lead to substantial reductions 
in ARI dise ase burden and work absenteeism.1  In addition to testing whether our findings are replicable in a larger sample 
with refined methodology, this proposed comparative effectiveness translational research will investigate mechanisms of action and provide initial estimates of cost- effectiveness.  If positive findings are confirmed, this line of research could 
have direct and immediate impact on public and private health -related policies and clinical practice, as well as on 
scientific understanding of respiratory infection. 
1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Acute respiratory infection (ARI)  is responsible for tremendous health burden.2-7 While influenza (flu) is often 
classified separately, its symptoms are usually indistinguishable from those produced by other etiological agents,37-42 
which  include rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and 
metapneumovirus.43-48  In the U.S. alone, non-influenza ARI accounts for total economic impact of about $40 billion, 
putting ARI in the top 10 most expensive illnesses.3;49-52 Ava ilable treatments are only minimally effective at reducing 
symptoms.53-55 Immunization strategies are impractical as there are hundreds of antigenically distinct viral strains. 
Conventional preventive  strategies are limited to contact avoidance and hand washing.56 
 
2 
1.1.2 Influenza  is the most serious of the viral respiratory infections, and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality. Ea ch year, approximately 36,000 deaths57;58 and more than 500,000 hospitalizations59 in the U.S are associated 
with influenza infection. Influenza vaccination (flu shot) is widely accepted as efficacious and even cost effective,57-64 but 
is imperfect.  Seroprotection rates range from 60 -80% in healthy younger adults65-67 to perhaps 40 to 60% in the elderly.68-
75 A 2006 review concluded that flu shots have a “clinical efficacy in the elderly of 17-53%.”60   
 
1.1.3 Stress, inflammation and health   Relationships between psychological stress and physical health are complex, but 
well-documented.76-81 Perceived stress has been linked to depression ,82-84 cardiovascular disease,85-88 and mortality.89-92 
Most relevant to this proposal, s tress has been linked to various immune -inflammatory  processes,93-98 and to ARI 
illness.8;14;15;99-108 Stressed people have higher levels of “stress homones”109-111 and may respond to infection with higher 
levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines , including C- reactive protein (CRP),112-114 procalcitonin (PCT),115-121  and interferon-
gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10).122-128  For s tressed people who are at higher risk for ARI illness , exercise appears to  
mediate that risk.129   Our  own  preliminary research suggests that  trainings in mindfulness based stress reduct ion may  
work to lower the incidence, duration and severity of ARI illness.1  
1.1.4 Mindfulness meditation is a technique used to train the attention and enhance awareness .  The concept of 
“mindfulness” refers to the nonjudgmental awareness of - and attention to - bodily sensations, thoughts, and emotions as 
they are happening in the present moment. The most common mindfulness meditation training program taught in medical 
settings is known as Mindfulness Based Stress R eduction (MBSR).130-132 MBSR facilitators emphasize self -appreciation, 
compassion, and empathy, which may bring their own salutary effects. MBSR has been reported to reduce stress and 
anxiety,22;26;27;133-137 psychological distress,138 pain,130depression,139;140 and to increase quality of life among people with 
chronic illness.141 No study before ours has examined the effects of MBSR on ARI illness, or in the context of comparison 
to effects of exercise.  
 
1.1.5 Exercise  is known to positively influence health,142-145 and to predict measures of both immunity146-158 and respiratory 
infection.159-166  Nevertheless, few prospective studies have assessed the effects of exercise interventions on ARI illness or 
immune mechanisms.  Of those that have, results have tended to be positive.16;167-169   For example, Chubak et al. 
randomized n=115 overweight post-menopausal women to either 45 minutes per day of moderate intensity exercise, or to 
a low- intensity stretching program (control).16  Over a 12 -month observation period, 30.2% of those randomized to 
exercise reported at least one ARI illness episode, compared to 48.4% of the control group (p = 0.03).16  As another 
example, study Consultant David Nieman followed n=1,002 men and women for 12 weeks, and found an average of 8.18 days of ARI illness in the lowest exercise tertile, compared  to 4.41 days in the highest exercise tertile (p<0.001).
168   
Nevertheless, most research to date has been limited by the lack of randomization, sample size, outcomes measured, choice of control group, and observation period.  The trial proposed here would provide both methodological rigor and adequate statistical power to detect meaningful effects on ARI illness. 
1.2 Preliminary Trial  
The research protocol described here follows directly from a recently completed NCCAM -funded study (1R01AT004313) 
in which we randomized n=154 people to 3 groups: 1) 8- weeks of training in mindfulness meditation , 2) matched 8- weeks 
of training in exercise, or 3) wait list control.  A total of 94 participants were randomized in September 2009, and 60 more in January 2010.  Only 5 withdrew early, with 149 followed through May 2010. There were 27 ARI episodes and 257 days of ARI illness in the meditation group (n=51) and 26 episodes and 241 ARI illness days for exercise (n=47), 
compared to 40 episodes and 453 ARI illness days for the control g roup (n=51). Mean area -under- curve global severity 
was 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control.  Comparing meditation to control, one -sided T -test yielded 
P=0.034 for illness days and p=0.0042 for global severity.  Comparing exercise to c ontrol, corresponding p- values were 
0.032 for illness days and 0.16 for global severity.  Adjusting for covariates with zero- inflated multivariate regression 
models, both total days of illness (p=0.033) and global severity (p=0.010) appeared to be lower for meditation, but not for 
exercise (p = 0.47 and p=0.31, respectively).  There were 16 ARI -related health care visits and 67 sick days lost to work in 
the control group, compared to 15 visits and 32 sick days for exercise and 10 visits and 16 sick days for meditation.  
Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed virus in 19 of the control episodes, 14 for meditation, and 8 for 
exercise.  The only 2 cases of confirmed influenza were in the control group.  Neutrophil counts and interleukin- 8 (IL -8) 
assays provided corroborating evidence that observed benefits were unlikely to be  due to biased- self-report biases.

2. Study Objectives  
To the best of our knowledge, the preliminary research described above  is the first randomized trial to assess potential 
influences of mindfulness meditation on ARI illness, and the first to use a validated outcome measure to assess effects of 
exercise on ARI illness.  It is also the first to compare both meditation and exercise to a valid control group, allowing 
head -to-head comparative effectiveness assessment.  The proposed work is also innovative in terms of the degree of rigor 
employed in ARI surveillance and verification , and in the number and quality of immune and infl ammatory biomarkers 
assayed.  Finally, the proposed research will assess several psychosocial domains, both as potentially important outcomes, but also as mediational processes that could help to explain the causal pathways leading from behavioral interventions to 
ARI outcomes.      
 
The primary goal of this project is to determine whether behavioral training in mindfulness meditation or moderate 
intensity sustained exercise will  lead to reductions in acute respiratory infection  (ARI) illness, such as commo n cold and 
influenza like illness .  Our preliminary findings suggest substantial benefit of these interventions in terms of reduced 
incidence, duration and severity of ARI illness, with corresponding reductions in days of work lost to illness.1 If the 
proposed research confirms these findings, there will be major implications for public and private health -related policy 
and practice, as well as for scientific knowledge regarding health maintenance and disease prevention.  
 
Specific aims  
 
1.  D etermine whether an 8 -week training program in mindfulness meditation, as compared to the control group, 
will lead to significant reductions in incidence, duration, and severity of ARI illness.  
2.  D etermine whether an 8-week training p rogram in  moderate intensity sustained exercise, as compared to the 
control group, will lead to reductions in incidence, duration, and severity of ARI illness.  
3.  A ssess whether any observed reductions in ARI illness are accompanied by fewer ARI- related health care visits 
and less time lost to productive work  (reduced absenteeism). 
4.  C ompare the potential benefits of mindfulness meditation to those from moderate intensity sustained exercise.  
5.  Discern potential mediating factors and causal pathways that might help e xplain how these interventions lead to 
improved ARI illness -related outcomes.

3. Study Design  
 
3.1 G eneral Design  
 
This will be a paral lel, three group, phase 2 randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of training in meditation or 
exercise, compared to control, on incidence, duration and severity of ARI illness. Participants will be women and men 
aged 30 to 69 years who: report at least one ARI per year on average, and are willing a nd able to be randomized and 
follow through on all aspects of the protocol. The primary outcome will be severity -adjusted total days of ARI illness 
during one cold and flu season (September through May). Exercise and meditation training will be held in the same facility, and will be matched by in -class contact time (2 ½ hours/week) and out-of- class practice time (45 minutes daily ).  
It is hoped that participants will continue their mindfulness or exercise practice long term .  In order to standardize risk, a ll 
participants will receive influenza immunization (flu shots).  
 
 From consent onward, participants will be monitored once weekly using computer- assisted self -report ARI surveillance 
methods.  Jackson criteria
170-172 will be  used to define the beginning of each ARI episode.  Respiratory infection daily logs 
(RIDLs) incorporating the WURSS-24 instrument173-176 will be filled out once daily from the beginning of each ARI 
episode until the participant is no longer symptomatic.  Study personnel administering the se assessments will be blinded 
to intervention group st atus.  Once ARI illness is identified, lab visits will be arranged.  Prior to the lab visit, participants 
will self -swab b oth nostrils, bringing the swab to the lab visit.  
 Nasal wash and blood samples will be collected at baseline, 1 and 4 months after 8 week interventions, and once with 
each ARI episode.  Samples  will be analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL -6), interleukin- 8 (IL -8), C- reactive protein (CRP), 
procalcitonin (PCT), and interferon- gamma -induced protein 10 (IP-10).  Nasal swabs and wash collected  during each ARI 
illness episode will be assessed for viral  and bacterial  RNA/DNA using m ultiplex PCR.
36   
 
This will be a 5 -year project, with 4 yearly cohorts of n=99 per cohort randomized into 3 groups of n=33 each. Assuming 
9% loss to follow -up, the final sample size will be n=360 study participants, with n=120 in each comparison group.  
Enrollment, randomization and study interventions will begin in September of each year, and participants will be 
monitored by weekly self-report through May.  Summers will be used for data cleaning, preliminary analyses, and for recruiting the next year’s cohort.  
3.2 Conceptual framework    
Incidence, duration and severity of viral ARI illness are influenced by both psychosocial and physiological factors.  
Sedentary lifestyle, stress, and negative emotions are risk factors for ARI, and may be causal influences.  The brain, body, 
and immune system are highly integrated, with many known and hypothesized mechanisms of action.177-180  Psychological 
factors, apparently working through neuro-immune and inflammatory pathways, are associated with various measures of 
viral ARI.181-188 These potential pathways, combined with possible interactions and feedback loops, provide for a 
conceptual framework of almost limitless complexity. To simplify this complexity we will focus on verifiable ARI -related 
health ou tcomes and a few select physical, mental, and social health domains.

3.4 Primary Study Endpoints 
The primary goal of this project is to determine whether behavioral training in mindfulness meditation or moderate 
intensity sustained exercise can lead to reductions in acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness, such as common cold and influenza like illness .  The primary outcome will be severity -weighted total days of ARI illness (global severity) , 
calculated as trapezoidal approximation to area under the time severity curve during A RI illness, with severity assessed 
once daily using self -reports on the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS -24).  
3.5 Secondary Study Endpoints 
Computer- assisted weekly monitoring will assure that ARI illness episodes are detected, and will serve to document 
secondary outcomes, including health care utilization and work or school absenteeism.  Vi sits to health care facilities and 
time lost from work an d school will be documented, then classified as ARI -related (or not ) by personnel blinded to 
allocation .  Questionnaire measures assessing perceived stress, self -efficacy, sleep quality, depression, and general mental 
and physical health will also be analyzed as secondary outcomes.   Degree of stress reduction, mindfulness, positive and 
negative emotion, social support, self -efficacy and sleep quality will be analyzed as potential mediators of effects of 
interventions on outcomes.  
 
Laboratory assessed objective measures will primarily serve to corroborate self -reports of disease severity, but will also be 
analyzed as potential mediators of effects of behavioral interventions on ARI illness incidence, duration, and severity.    As potential mediators, pro-inflammatory cytokines (CRP, PCT, IL- 6, IL -8, IP -10) will be assessed as change from 
baseline to one month after the 8 week behavioral interventions finish .  These will serve as indicators of a pro -
inflammatory state.  [Procalitonin assays stopped in 2014 due to nondetectable values] Repeating these assays 3 months 
later will assess whether pro -inflammatory changes from baseline will be sustained.  Cytokines from samples taken during 
ARI illness will be assessed as corroborating biomarkers of disease severity.   Identification of viral agents using multiplex 
PCR will also serve to  corroborate ARI self-reports.

4.2  Participant Recruitment and Screening    
 
4.2.1 Retention   Our experience suggests that >90% of participants will complete the intervention training, follow -up, and 
provide primary and secondary outcome measures.  Our research team has the capability and experience to recruit, enroll 
and monitor the proposed number of participants (n=396 over 5 years), with a retention rate of ≥ 90% (n=360 retained).  A 
previous NCCAM -funded trial led by Dr. Barrett enrolled 719 and retained 713 people.237;244 The preliminary trial on 
which this proposal is based enrolled 154 and retained 149 people.1 
 
4.2.2 Study promotion  will include flyers, posters, and brochures, posted in medical settings and in the community (e.g., 
through media such as newspaper, radio, press releases, website, email), and mailings of post cards and letters.   
 
4.2.3   Screening  Prospective participants who passed phone screening will be met in-person for informed consent and 
enrollment in a 2- week run -in trial. Screening will continue year -round, with main emphasis on the period from June to 
August. Prospective participants will call the advertised study phone number to be screened by study personnel using 
scripted protocol. Potentially eligible and willing , interested participants will be scheduled for a run- in trial.   
 
8 
4.2.4   Run- in trial for adherence assessment  Prospective participants who passed phone screening will be met in-person for 
informed consent and enrollment in a 2- week run -in trial. Run- in tasks will include in -person baseline questionnaires, at 
least one phone contact, self-report questionnaires at home, and finally a follow-up in-person appointment, which in most 
cases will serve as the consent visit for the main trial, and which will include a nasal wash and blood draw.  Based on our 
preliminary study, we expect that approximately 70- 75% of the eligible run-in participants will consent and be enrolled in 
the main trial.  
4.3 Data  Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects 
Intention- to-treat (ITT) analysis methods will be used to take account of all randomized participants, including those lost 
to follow-up.  The ITT approach: 1) preserves the effects of randomization, and 2) addresses the practical impact of 
interventions better than “per protocol” analyses. Our approach to ITT will involve random- effects pattern -mixture 
modeling, where participants will be divided into groups depending on their missing-data patterns.  First, analysis of 
missing data will assess the level and possible reasons for missingness.245  Second, modeling of data patterns will be used 
to adjust the longitudinal intervention analysis using the pattern -mixture modeling approach.246 
5. Study Interventions   
5.1 Study Arms  
 
5.1.1 Mindfulness meditation   Training will consist of a standardized 8 -week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) 
program, including 2½ hour weekly sessions and regular at- home daily practice.132 The MBSR program guides 
participants from body sensation awareness (body scan), through stretching and breathing to sitting (and lying down) meditation.  Didac tic sessions center on awareness of physical, emotional, cognitive, and interpersonal responses to stress.  
In addition to weekly group sessions at U.W. Research Park , participants are asked to practice at home for 45 minutes per 
day, and to log minutes of daily practice time.  A half day meditation “retreat” on a weekend day at the end of week 6 will 
allow participants to practice their skills. After the 8 -week intervention, participants will be asked to continue meditation 
at ≥150 minutes/week, in sessions of at least 10 minutes each . They will record their practice daily on a paper log and will 
enter their practice minutes once weekly into an on-line survey.  The Mindfulness- based Self Efficacy Scale (MSES)
247  
and MAAS248;249 will serve as additional measures of mindfulness and practice. The MBSR intervention will be deliv ered 
by trained  instructors, all with extensive experience teaching MBSR at the UW Integrative Medicine Program.  Since 
1994, more than 2,000 people have completed MBSR training through this program.  Katherine Bonus, MA, is the MBSR 
Program Director and is expected  be one of the meditation instructors for our study. The UW MBSR program has 
demonstrated excellent retention and adherence in both general enrollees and research -based samples.  In a sample of 505 
general enrollees, more than 86% completed the full 8 weeks and reported significant decreases in both medical and psychological symptoms, comparable to effect sizes noted in a meta- analysis of MBSR trials.
250  In a trial of MBSR 
among women with fibromyalgia led by co- investigators Muller and Coe,  34 of 42 participants who received MBSR 
training continued meditation practice after 1½ years of follow-up.  See Appendix A. 
 
5.1.2 Exercise  The exercise program will match the meditation program in duration (8 weeks), attention (weekly 2½ hour 
group sessions), intensity (daily 45 minute at-home practice), and at the U.W. Research Park location. See Appendix A. 
The proposed intervention structure is consistent with many standardized exercise programs.242;251;252  Participants 
randomized to exercise who are deemed “high -risk” based on the American Heart Association guidelines will undergo 
ECG -monitored exercise testing to assess safety (see “safety of exercise” in protection of human subjects section). They 
will record their exercise daily on a paper log and will enter their exercise minutes once weekly into  an on- line survey.   
Exercise training will primarily focus on walking or jogging, activities that are convenient, easy to teach and do not 
require special equi pment. Individualized programs will be developed for those who have access to specific equipment, 
are unable to do walking/jogging, or prefer different types of exercise (e.g. biking, swimming, etc). Based on 2008 
guidelines, the target will be sustained m oderate intensity exercise for at least 150 minutes per week.242;243  Borg’s Rating 
of Perceived Exertion (RPE) will be used to guide and monitor exercise intensity, using a target RPE level of 12 to 16 points.
253;254   In addition to exercise logs documenting minutes-per- week of moderate and strenuous exercise, participants 
will complete the  Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) at baseline, at the end  of the 8 -week trainings, and 
every other  month thereafter.255;256 Each weekly exercise session will include 1½ hours of didactic and 1 hour of group 
exercise in the U .W. Research Park Sports Medicine Fitness Center. The didactic portion will consist of a check -in period 
to review the previ ous week’s activities, a brief presentation on exercise techniques and effects, a discussion of behavioral 
change principles and strategies, and a brief wrap-up focused on discussing the next- week exercising goals and logistics. 
9 
A half day  exercise retreat designed to match the meditation retreat will occur the weekend of week 6.  The retreat will 
include didactics, group discussion and activities, and individualized exercise practice.  After the 8 -week intervention, 
participants will be expected to continue moderate intensity exercise at ≥150 minutes/week, in sessions of at least 10 
minutes each.     
 
5.1.3  Wait -list control   At enrollment, one third of participants will be randomly assigned to a usual care wait- list non -
interventional control group.  Apart from not attending any of the specific meditation or exercise training sessions, those 
in the control group will be treated in essentially the same manner as “experimental” participants. This will include 
email/telephone contact every week and monthly questionnaires. Control participants will not complete daily logs of 
exercise or meditation during the study period; however , they will fill out MAAS, MSES, ESES and the GPAQ 
questionnaires on an every other month basis .  Control participants will be offered free meditation training after they 
complete their study participation, assistance with finding appropriate exercise training, or $300 cash. They will be 
reminded of this occasionally throughout the study to help maintain adherence to protocol.  
5.2 Randomization  
Randomized allocation will provide each participant a 33.3% chance of assignment to each of the 3 study arms. Each 
sequentially enrolled participant will receive the next sequentially numbered sealed envelope containing randomization 
codes generated by the study statistician  using permuted variable -sized block randomization (SAS  software).  The key 
linking codes to intervention category will be kept blinded from co -investigators, study personnel and analysts until after 
the first stages of statistical analysis have been completed.  
5.3 Blinding  and Expectation 
Investigators, most study personnel and analysts will be blinded to allocation status until the compilation of the first stages 
of statistical analysis. However, study participants cannot be blinded to the group status. Potential reporting bias will be 
minimized by framing the study in an expectancy-neutral manner, and by assessing and controlling for expectancies toward meditation and exercise.   Prior to  and following randomization, participants will be asked to rate their belief in the 
ability of meditation and exercise to protect against ARI using pre- tested expectancy -related questions.
257 258  See 
Appendix B.  Participants will be instructed and regularly reminded to self -report in an unbiased manner and not to reveal 
their group status to the data collection staff. 
5.4   Participant Compliance Monitoring  
 
5.4.1 Weekly monitoring and adherence assessment  Each participant will be assigned a study representative who will serve 
as his/her primary contact, to build rapport and enhance protocol adherence.  The primary contact cannot feasibly be blinded to allocation . To minimize potential bias , we will employ blinded- to-allocation personnel to assist participants 
with documenting and classifying ARI illness, sick days, and clinic visits.  For most subjects, weekly computer- assisted 
self-reports will be used to assess ARI illness. For those without internet access, weekly telephone calls will be scheduled.  
As soon as an ARI illness episode is verified by criteria (See 6.3.1 below) , the participant will self -administer a nasal 
swab, and arrange a clinic visit where nasal wash will be obtained. During ARI episodes, participants will fill out 
respiratory infection daily logs  (RIDLs) , including both WURSS-24 self- assessments and questions documenting health 
care utilization and days lost to work.  
 
5.4.2 Exercise and meditation practice monitoring  will be accomplished using paper daily practice logs, which will be filled 
out and/or entered  on-line once weekly .  See Appendices A, B and E .  Similar daily practice logs have been used in 
research studies by Dr. Davidson at the University of Wisconsin a nd by Dr. Nieman at Appalachian State University.  
These data will verify that those assigned to trainings actually practice, and will facilitate dose-response, mediation, and 
sub-group analyses.

6. Study Measurements & Procedures  
6.1 Study Participant O verview  
A total of 99 participants will be randomized to each yearly cohort (33 participants per intervention group). Over 4 years, 
396 participants will be randomized (132 per group).  Assuming 9% loss to follow-up, 360 (120 in each of the 3 groups ) 
will complete the protocol and provide main outcome data.  Before each yearly cohort begins, an adherence- assessing run -
in phase will take place.  Based on the preliminary trial, we estimate that 490 will need to be screened and 137 entered in 
the run- in trial to achieve the 99 people consented into each yearly cohort.  Nasal wash and venous blood will be drawn at 
baseline, one month after 8- week sessions, and 3  months later, and tested for IL-6 and IL -8. Questionnaires assessing 
psychosocial domains and mental and physical health will be completed at baseline , at th e end of the 8- week intervention 
and then monthly. Blood will be tested for serum concentration of p rocalcitonin, C -reactive protein , IP-10 and other 
inflammatory biomarkers.  [Procalcitonin  assays were dropped  in 2014 due to all nondetectable values] Participants will 
be monitored for ARI illness throughout the cold and flu season (approximately 8 months), using a web- based weekly 
reporting system.  Participants who have not logged on within 8 days to report whether they had any ARI symptoms will 
be sent daily email reminders until they do so.  If 10 days have elapsed since last report, participants will be called by 
study personnel.  For those who do not have access to the web, data will be collected on paper, and weekly contacts will be made by telephone. Each ARI illness episode will be assessed by daily self -report on respiratory infection daily logs 
(RIDLs) that include the validated WURSS -24 questionnaire.
173;176;189 At the beginning of each ARI illness episode, 
participants will self -swab both nostrils and arrange a lab visit to collect nasa l wash and blood (within 72 hours of first 
symptom). Both nasal swab and wash will be tested with PCR multiplex for viral identification.   In order to standardize ARI risk across our sample, we will require and provide conventional seasonal  trivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine to all study parti cipants.  This will be given the week following the end of the 8- week sessions. 
 
6.2 Project Timeline    
This will be a 5 -year project, with 4 yearly cohorts of n=99 persons randomized into 3 groups of n=33 each. Recruitment 
will start upon UW Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and continue until study goals are reached.  Real time data

6.3 Measures of ARI illness 
 
6.3.1  Definition of ARI illness   The beginning of each ARI illness episode will be defined by: 1) answering “Yes” to either: 
“Do you think you have a cold” or “Do you think you are coming down with a cold?” AND 2) reporting at least 1 of 4 
cold symptoms  or synonyms :  nasal discharge (run ny nose); nasal obstruction (plugged or congested); sneezing; or sore 
(scratchy) throat,  AND 3) scoring at least 2 points on the Jackson scale. The Jackson score is calculated by summing 8 
symptom scores (sneezing, headache, malaise, chilliness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat and cough) rated , 
0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe.170-172 In order for these symptoms to be classified as an ARI illness episode 
(and analyzed as such), at least 2 days in a r ow must meet these criteria. From the first day of ARI illness and forward 
each participant will fill out a daily WURSS -24 until they answer “No” to the question “Do you think that you are still 
sick with this respiratory infection?” for 2 days in a row.  The last day the participant answers “Yes” will be the last day 
classified as ARI illness and included in the calculation of severity -weighted days of ARI illness.  
 
6.3.2  WURSS -24 - The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS)  is a validated qu estionnaire evaluating 
ARI-related symptom severity and quality of life impact.259 Since WURSS was first developed by Dr. Barrett and 
colleagues  in 2002,189 more than 125 institutions in 37 countries have used the WURSS in their research.  Initially, a 44-
item version (WURSS -44) was assessed for reliability, responsiveness and importance to patients.173  Psychometric 
analyses guided item reduction to yi eld the WURSS -21 which has been independently validated.176  The WURSS -24 
includes all WURSS -21 questions and 3 additional items assessing fever, headache and body aches - symptoms 
characteristic of influenza-like illness .260  Appendix B has questionnaires.  Appendix C describes scoring. 
 
6.3.3  RIDL  - Participants will be provided with Respiratory Infection Daily Log (RIDL) questionnaire booklets at 
enrollment, and will be instructed on appropriate use.  Weekly computer- assisted monitoring will remind people to be on 
the lookout for cold or flu symptoms.  When cold symptoms appear, participants will call study personnel, who will 
determine whether the symptoms meet the Jackson criteria described abov e.  If s o, participants will begin to fi ll out 
WURSS -24 questions in the RIDL booklets and answer questions about healthcare utilization and missed work days , will 
self-swab their nostrils, and will make an appointment at the laboratory for nasal wash and blood sample collection.  
 
6.3.4  Viral identification   will be done in Dr. Gern’s  lab, where high-throughput PCR-based multiplex methods have been 
developed and authenticated, and are able to identify nearly all of the pathogens associated with ARI illne ss 36;261-264 See 
Appendix D for lab protoc ols.  In our preliminary trial, only 40 of 79 nasal wash samples yielded positive viral 
identifications.  To enhance yield, the proposed trial will assess 2 samples, one done by self-swab at home, and the other 
by nasal wash at lab.  We will also improve sample processing and include newly developed viral types.  Dr. Gern’s 
published data report that up to 91.4% of nasal washes from community- acquired ARI can yield positive viral IDs.265  
 
6.3.5  Pro-inflammatory cytokines    Laboratory- assessed objective measures will primarily serve to corroborate self-reports 
of disease severity.  C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) are well- established indicators of disease severity 
during respiratory infection, and can be measured in serum as well as in nasal wash.113;115;118-120   Concentrations of 
interleukin -6 (IL -6)266-271 and  interleukin -8 (IL-8)272-276 in nasal wash have been shown to correlate with illness severity.  
More recently, interferon -gamma -induced protein 10 (IP-10) has been shown to be measurably increased in both serum 
and nasal wash during times of acute viral ARI.122-128  Inflamma tory cytokines will be measured  by ELISA  methods in  
laborator ies directed by  Dr. Co e and Dr. Hayney.   See Appendix D. 
 6.3.6  Inflammatory tendency
  The same array of pro -inflammatory cytokines will also be analyzed as indicators of low 
level inflammation or pro -inflammatory tendency and as  potential mediators of effects of behavioral interventions on 
ARI illness incidence, duration, and severity.  The importance of CRP, PCT and IL-6 has been underscored by the ability 
of these pro-inflammatory biomarkers to predict mortality.277-285  As potential mediators, pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(CRP, PCT, IL -6, IL -8, IP -10) will be assessed as change from baseline to one month after the 8 week behavioral 
interventions finish.  [Procalcitonin assays were stopped in 2014 due to nondetectable values] Repeating these assays 3 
months later will assess whether potential pro-inflammatory changes resulting from interventions will be sustained.   
 
12 
6.3.7  Polymorphonuclear neutrophil count  in nasal mucus is a relatively well -established i ndicator of inflammation of the 
nasal epithelium.286-290 Neutrophil counts correlate to symptom severity, viral titer and cytokine levels.174;291  Neutrophil 
count has been done by our study team more than a thousand times. The University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics 
(UWHC) Central Lab successfully conducted neutrophil counts for our preliminary trial. A standardize d protocol has been  
established  for their lab . Neutrophil counts will be done on nasal wash collected during ARI episodes.  See Appendix D.   
6.3.8 Glycosylated hemoglobin (HgA1C)   Regular e xercise is known to reduce hemoglobin A1C, a widely accepted 
indicator of average blo od glucose levels.142;292-294  There are at least two preliminary  reports suggesting that mindfulness 
meditation  might reduce HgA1C .295;296  To explore these possibilit ies, we will assess HgA1C  at baseline, 1 month after 
interventions, and again 3 months later. 
 
6.4 Self -reported physical, social and mental health measures   (see Table 3 below for schedule of use)  
 
6.4.1  Alcohol and tobacco use    Tobacco use is associated with depressed immune function and increased rate and severity 
of acute respiratory infection ( ARI).297  Overuse of alcohol also appears to be associated with immune system depression  
and increased levels of ARI illness.297   To assess and monitor both tobacco and alcohol use, we will use the validated and 
widely used Timeline Followback method (TLFB).298-302  We will consider tobacco use and alcohol over use as secondary 
outcomes of potential importance.  Baseline tobacco us e will be used as a covariate in multivariate efficacy analyses.   
 
6.4.2  Body Mass Index  (BMI )   Body habitus is associated with many disease processes, and may be related to immune 
function and susceptibility to respiratory infection.  H eight will be assessed at baseline only.  Weight will be measured at 
baseline, 1 and 4 months post -intervention , and at exit. Baseline BMI will be cal culated and used as a covariate in 
statistical models.  BMI will also be considered a secondary outcome of potential importance.  
  
6.4.3  Demographic indicators   Socioeconomic status is  related to health and disease, including incidence and severity of 
respiratory infectio n.102;303;304  Demographic indicators to be a ssessed will include age, sex , years of education completed, 
household income, and number of children under the age of 18 living in the home.  Age, sex and education  will be used  as 
covariates in multivariate efficacy analyses.  
 6.4.4  Seattle Index of Comor bidity  (SIC)
  People with diabetes, cardiovascular disease and pulmonary disease are known to 
have increased risks when infected with influenza or other respiratory viruses.305-307 The SIC is a simple 8 -item measure 
shown to predict hospitalization and mortality.308  We will add items on allergy and asthma, as these illnesses are known 
to be related to severity of ARI.  The modified SIC will be  assessed at baseline and exit, and used as a covariate to control 
for possible influences of chronic disease on ARI outcomes.   Relationships of individual items to outcomes and to other 
co-variates will be explored.  
 
6.4.5  Big Five Inventory (BFI)  Research on personality and health has been underway for some time , leading to various 
conceptual structures of state and trait  psychological domains.309-312 The Big Five taxonomy has helped clarify and 
organize the links between personality, health behaviors, illness and mortality across the lifespan.313-315 Of the five 
dimensions measured ( openness, c onscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism), we will use baseline 
“conscientiousness” and “neuroticism” scores on the Big Five Inventory316 to gauge propensity for self- report bias on 
instrument completion activities, and to control for between person differences in multivariate efficacy models . 
 
6.4.6  Health care utilization and antibiotics prescribed   Evaluation and treatment of ARI illness is very costly and often 
associated with unneces sary prescriptions, especially antibiotics.  For this study, we plan to document total number of 
health care visits, ARI -related health care visits, and ARI -related prescriptions, including antibiotics. Each weekly 
communication will include the question, “Have you seen a doctor or visited a clinic, hospital or urgent care center?” 
Persons answering “Yes” will be asked the reason for the visit.  Those answers will then be classified by study personnel 
as either “Related,” or “Unrelated” to ARI illness, including upper respiratory infection, influenza, pharyngitis, acute 
sinusiti s, bronchitis, and pneumonia.  All questionable cases will be verified by inspection of medical records (with case-
specific participant permission). Prescriptions for antibiotics,  prescription cough medicines, influenza antivirals and other 
ARI medications will be documented, as will self -reported use of nonprescription medications such as analgesics, 
antihistamines, decongestants, cough suppressants, and expectorants.  
 
13 
6.4.7 Days of work and school missed to illness   Weekly interviews will ask about work or school missed, and the reasons 
for that absenteeism.  Missed work/school will be quantified to the nearest half- day, and will be categorized as “Related” 
or “Unrelated” to ARI illness.  This will be done by asking people the ir reason s for missing work, and by comparing to 
Jackson criteria and WURSS -24 scores.  Medical records will be inspected as necessary.  However, we will not attempt to 
verify self -reported absenteeism by work  logs or communication with supervisors. The research specialist who monitors 
and responds to weekly computer- assisted monitoring of ARI illness, classifying health care utilization, and missed 
school/work will be blinded to experimental group status.  
 
6.4.8 Economic outcomes  assessed will include costs associated with employment  (absenteeism, presenteeism), health care 
utilization, and medications used during ARI illness.  Income will be assessed at the hourly wage level for each participant 
using standard methods used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.317  Time lost to work (absenteeism) and costs of health 
care utilization will be assessed weekly, and classified as ARI -related or not, using refined methods piloted in the first 
MEPARI trial.  Costs due to absenteeism will be assessed for each person using hourly wage and self -reported 
absenteeism.  Costs of ARI -related health care visits will be determined using U.W. Health’s billing database, seeking 
charges for ARI -coded encounters (ICD -9 codes 460, 461.1, 461.2, 461.8, 461.9, 462, 463, 465.9, 466, 480.9, 487.1, 
487.8, and 490).  Costs of medications named by participants will be calculated using data from drugstore.com, with 
cross -checking of prices in local pharmacies. All of these determinations will be done by research personnel blinded to 
group allocation.  
 
6.4.9  Absenteeism/Presenteeism   At enrollment we will assess employment, including type of work, hours per week 
worked, and compensation, assessed as hourly wage.  Each week we will ask about any missed work, ascertain number of 
hours missed, and assess and classify reasons for missing work as either ARI -related or not ARI- related.  The person 
making the classification will be blinded to allocation.    Beyond missed work (absenteeism) , illnesses such as ARI can 
decrease energy and focus at work,260 leading to lost work productivity318 from reduced “presenteeism.”319   To refine 
economic impact analysis, we will assess self-reported ability to perform work  using the Stanford Presenteeism Scale 
(StPS) .320;321  The standard 1- month recall version will be administered at baseline, then 1, 3 and 5 months after 
interventions.  A modified version with illness- specific recall will be used at end of each ARI episode, at the end of the 
RIDL q uestionnaire booklet (see 6.3.3 above). 
 
6.4.10  Depression screen (PHQ -9) The PHQ -9 is a widely used and well -validated depression screen,322-327 and also 
demonstrates good responsiveness.328;329  In our study, pros pective participants with  PHQ -9 scores of  ≥15 will be 
excluded (and referred to appropriate clinical care).  PHQ -9 scores will be assessed as secondary outcomes.  
 
 6.4.11  Health -related quality of life (SF-12) Also known as the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form, this 12- item 
questionnaire is commonly used to measure overall health, including physical (SF12-P) and mental health (SF12- M) 
subscales.  It has been extensively assessed for reliability, responsiveness and criterion validity.330-334 In our study, it will 
be used to as sess potential changes in general physical and mental health due to interventions, and as a covariate to control 
for baseline between -person differences in multivariate efficacy analyses.  
 
6.4.12  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inde x (PSQI)  Sleep quality has been linked to several important quality of life and health 
outcomes. The PSQI is widely used and has been assessed for reliability and validity.335-337 In this study, improved sleep is 
a potential mediator of intervention effects, and a potentially important outcome on its own.   
 6.4.13  Positive and Negative Affect Schedul e (PANAS)
 The widely used PANAS scale reliably assesses both positive and 
negative affect (emotion).338  Self -reported positive and negative emotion have long been known to be independent 
predictors of psychological and physical health.339  In the ARI setting, positive and negative emotion predict not only 
symptom expression, but actual infection as indicated by viral shedding.9;13;340 In an RCT setting, PANAS scores 
improved after MBSR training, (p < 0.05) as compared to controls.30 
 
6.4.14  Perceived Stress Scal e (PSS -10) The PSS-10 has been validated in multiple studies.100-103;341-343  PSS scores  predict 
rates of viral infection among volunteers inoculated with rhinovirus, and correlate with physiologic and self-report 
indicators of ARI illness, including nasal IL- 6 level.14;99-102  Because stress reduction is one of the hypothesized 
mechanisms of action,  we have expanded our study population to include working- age participants, who we presume are 
more stressed.   
14 
6.4.15 Social Provisions Scal e (SPS)  344-346 assesses perceived social support, which  has been linked with a host of health 
and illness indicators .347-352  The SPS is a 24 -item index assessing 6 domains of social health: attachment, social 
integration, reassurance of worth, reliable alliance, guidance, and opportunity for nurturance.  The SPS, developed by 
Russell and Cutrona,344-346 predicts both immunological353;354 and psychosocial outcomes.355;356 
 
6.4.16  Social Network Index ( SNI) will serve to quantify social network size in order to help characterize social support.  
Cohen’s research using the SNI suggests that the number of social contacts is predictive of susceptibility to ARI.10;357 The 
SNI will also serve as an index of interpersonal contacts that could serve to transmit ARI virus. The SNI will be modified 
to document the number and ages of the children with whom participants have contact .   
 
6.4.17  Feeling Loved  (FL) In addition to the validated perceived social support measures described above, we will use two 
novel questions with Yes/No response options:  A)   Do you feel loved?  B) Do you love yourself?  and two questions with 
visual analogue (VAS) response scales:  How loved do you feel?  H ow much do you love yourself?  The ends of each 
100mm VAS scale will be bounded by “not at all” and “very, very much.”    
 
6.4.18  Exercise Self Efficacy  (ESES)  Self-efficacy has been defined as “the belief in one’s capabilities to organize and 
execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.”358  The ESES scale was developed based on 
work by Bandura and colleagues,359-363 and has been validated by Shin,364;365 Kroll,366 and Everett.363   For our study, the 
ESES will be used to verify results of the exercise intervention, and to help explain potential mediational effects of 
exercise.  
 
6.4.19  Mindfulness -based Self -Efficacy Scale (MSES)  Research aimed at defining and assessing the concept of 
“mindfulness” is well underway, with several questionnaire instruments available.367-374  The MSES is one of the more 
recent questionnaires,  developed by Cayoun and Freestun to assess effects of MBSR training on perceived self -efficacy.247 
The MSES assesses 7 domains related to mindfulness self -efficacy, including behavior, cognition, interoception, affect, 
interpersonal, avoidance and mindfulness.  The MSES will provide a nice counterpart to the ESES to help distinguish 
effects of interven tions on ARI outcomes.    
 
6.4.20  Mindfulness  Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)  For our study, we will use the  15- item  MAAS248;249 to assess  
effects of MBSR training , and to help understand/ explain potential mediating influences of mindfulness on our major 
outcomes.  The MSES and MAAS instruments will  also serve as an  intervention check, in that scores are expected to 
change more among those randomized to meditation than in the exercise or control groups.    
 
6.4.21 Global Physical Activity Ques tionnaire  (GPAQ)   The GPAQ was developed and validated through the World Health 
Organization, and displays excellent reliability and responsiveness characteristics.255;256  GPAQ scores will b e used to 
assess degree-of- change resulting from exercise training, and for dose- dependency and mediation analyses.  
 
6.4.22 Mindfulness practice and exercise daily tracking log  After the 8 -week intervention, participants assigned to the 
meditation group will be asked to continue meditatio n at ≥150 minutes/week, in sessions of at least 10 minutes each.  
Similarly, those assigned to the exercise group will be asked to continue moderate intensity exercise at ≥150 
minutes/week, in sessions of at least 10 minutes each.    Using modified versions of practice logs developed at the 
University of Wisconsin by Dr. Davidson (meditation) and at Appalachian State by Dr. Niemann (exercise), study 
participants  will record their practice once daily on a paper log and will enter their practice minutes once weekly through 
an on- line web -based data collection portal.  
 
6.4.23  Expectancy    In order to assess and potentially control for intervention- related expectancy, we will ask participants 
about their attitudes towards meditation and exer cise before and after randomization, after the 8 -week behavioral 
trainings, and at exit.  See Appendix B. 
 
6.4.24  Blood pressure    Blood pressure is a well -recognized health indicator. There is some reason to believe that stress 
reduction or regular exercise might reduce blood pressure.  In this study, blood pressure will be assessed at baseline and at 
both standardized follow-up per iods using standard calibrated sphygmomanometers .  Blood pressure will be analyzed as a 
secondary outcome using methods described in Section 7.  
15 
6.4.25   Accelerometry & Breath -counting   The final 4th cohort will include an optional sub -study in which willi ng participants will 
do breath -counting assessment and wear an accelerometer at baseline and at two post -intervention follow -ups.  See Appendices I & J.

6.6 Written Informed Conse nt 
Written informed consent will be obtained in person from all participants.  Separate written consent will be prepared for 
the run-in trial and for the main study.  Enrollment interviews, informed consent, and all subsequent interactions will be 
conducted in private settings, with only study staff and the research participant present.  All data related to participation 
will be kept confidential.  Paper and electronic records with personally- identifying information will be destroyed at the 
end of the study.  Participants will have the opportunity to give us permission to keep their name and contact them about future research opportunities.   See Section 8 an d Appendix F for additional  details of human subjects’ protection. 
6.7 Study Visit Checklists  
Study visit checklists have been developed for the current study as tools used to ensure consistency and help study 
coordinators make sure all scheduled assessments/events are done for each particular  study visit/time point. Please see 
Appendix E for a com plete list of study visit checklists.  
6.8 Clinical Research Unit (CRU)  
 6.8.1 CRU Overview   Supported by the NIH through a Clinical and Translational Science Award ( CTSA), the CRU’s 
mission is to offer an optimal setting for investigators to conduct safe, controlled state-of-the- art research. The Center has 
provided excellent services to the research community of the UW. It is centrally located, with free parking for participants, and is easily accessed by car or bus. The CRU, located within the UW Hospital  and Clinics, provides 
personnel, supplies and equipment support necessary to perform high quality clinical research. The CRU recently expanded to 18 inpatient and outpatient rooms in its 6
th floor center with a core staff of highly -trained research nurses  and 
a sample processing facility. The CRU is the hub for federally -funded, investigator- initiated, and industry studies that 
need the in- hospital location, safety and expertise of the 15-member RN, BSN, and Nurse Practitioner staff.  
 
6.8.2  Nursing Servi ces  CRU nurses will conduct nasal wash and blood draw for the baseline, 1 and 4 month post-
intervention visits.  Services include obtaining height/weight for BMI calculation,  conducting nasal washes  and blood 
draws and preparing samples to send to the UWHC Central Lab  and Hayney lab for processing, and administering the 
influenza vaccination .  A detailed list of services provided is in the CRU application, as well as the Nasal Lavage 
Information Sheet and Nasal Wash Labwork Information Sheet .  See  Appendix E.    
 
6.8.3  Admission to CRU Admission to the CRU requires all study participants to be registered with the UW Hospital and 
Clinics (UWHC).  All screened , eligible research subjects will be registered with UWHC per UWHC registration 
requirements prior to being scheduled at the CRU  using a Reservation Request Form.  Please see Appendix E for detailed 
Admission and Billing Procedures. 
     
6.8.4  Billing: Office of Clinical Trials (OCT)  For federal ly funded and other investigator- initiated studies, nursing services 
and rooms at the CRU are provided at no cost to Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) members, 
including Dr. Barrett and some co -investigators.   Additionally, while there are no fees for nursing services and rooms at 
the CRU, ancillary services (including laboratory samples processed at the UW Core Lab) are awarded at $33 per patient 
per CRU visit, not to exceed $8,500 annually per research study.  As ancillary services may exce ed the award , billing

7. Statistical Plan  
 
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
The planned study size of n=396 consenting individuals randomized to 3 groups leading to n=360 people completing the 
protocol ( n=120 per group) is based on the results of our preliminary trial.1  For primary efficacy analyses, null 
hypotheses will be rejected if interventions are superior to control at a p ≤ 0.025, using one-sided testing, based on two-
way contrasts between: 1) meditation vs. control and 2) exercise vs. control.  One-sided testing is supported by our own 
data and by available scientific literature.  Given these parameters and our preliminary data, the sample size of n=120 per group should provide adequate power. The observed raw difference in area-under- curve global severity between the 
meditation and control groups was 59.9% yielding a standardized effect size of 0.55.  For the exercise vs. control, t he raw 
difference was 30.5% and the effect size 0.20.  Comparing exercise to meditation, the standardized effect size was 
0.24.
  Based on these data , Figure 4  below shows the relationship of power to sample size for the global severity and 
duration primary  outcome s, for each of the specified main contrasts.   However , when taking into accou nt the zero-
inflated and skewed nature of ARI illness data, and potential missing data and intention to treat considerations, actual power may be less.  Given limitations  on resources available, and a desire to minimize chances of both Type 1 and Type 2 
errors, we feel that the proposed sample size will be adequate for this phase 2 randomized controlled human subjects 
clinical trial.

minimal important difference considerations.   Additional data on power available in Appendix H.

7.2 Statistical Methods  
7.2.1  Loss to follow -up In Dr. Barrett’s first echinacea  trial, 96% of enrolled participants were substantively adherent to 
protocol.375  In our recently published NCCAM- sponsored trial (1R01AT001428) testing  echinacea, placebo, and doctor -
patient -interaction,376 only 6 of the N=719 people enrolled (<1%) withdrew or were lost to follow-up.244 In the preliminary 
trial described above, we maintained a 97% retention rate (5 of the 154 participants withdrew).  For the proposed study, 
we conservatively estimate a 9% dropout rate, yielding N=90 finishers per year.   Each year, w e expect to screen 490 
people and enroll 137 in the run-in trial in order to achieve 99 entered in the main trial and 90 finishers.  For the full 4 
year trial, this equates to 1,960 screened, 548 entered in the run-in phase, and 396 randomized. 
 
7.2.2  Ana lysis overview   Analyses will proceed as follows: 1) descriptive analyses of central tendency and dispersion for 
all variables; 2) assessment and potential response for missing data; 3) bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess 
relationships among variables; 4 ) calculation of ARI global severit y for individual participants; 5 ) primary efficacy 
analysis of effects of interven tions on primary outcomes; and 6 ) secondary analyses, including assessment of intervention 
impact on secondary outcomes, longitudinal analyses, and process (mediation) analyses.  
 
7.2.3  Descriptive analyses   A necessary first step in analysis is to describe the data in a way that is both concise and 
meaningful. For each variable, a 5-number summary (mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, skewness) and a 
graphical box plot will be constructed.  Bivariate relationships will be explored using scatter plots and correlation coefficients.  Distributional assumptions will be tested, and variable transformations will be applied if necessary.  Missing  
data will be analyzed for the level and possible reasons  for missingness. Where appropriate, imputation methods may be 
applied.  These decisions and preliminary statistical analyses will be done prior to unblinding. 
 
7.2.4  Global severity  Area -under- curve ARI global severity days for each participant will be calculated using daily 
WURSS -24 scores across all days of ARI illness.   Daily WURSS scores are calculated by summing items #2 through #23  
on the WURSS -24. Duration is assessed in hours and minutes, then converted to decimalized days.  Area -under-the- curve 
is calculated using trapezoidal approximation, where the X-axis = duration and the Y-axis = severity.    
 
7.2.5  Primary efficacy analysi s will contrast total days of illness and area-under- curve global severity in each intervention 
group with corresponding values in the control group. Unadjusted contrasts will be done by t- test, using variable 
transformation if skewness requires. Adjusted an alyses will be based on zero -inflated regression models taking into 
account the episodic and variable nature of ARI illness.377;378  Zero -inflated regression models incorporate a logistic sub -
model to account for people without ARI illness, and a linear sub-model to account for the variability in continuous 
measures of severity and duration. These will employ conservative estimates with standard error inflated using   
Huber/White maximum likelihood estimation.379;380  Co-variates to be controlled for in this model will include: age, sex, 
body mass index, smoking status, comorbidity, highest level of education achieved, neuroticism, conscientiousness, 
general physical health and general mental health. The null hypotheses of “no effect on primary outcome” will be rejected 
in favor of alternative hypothesis of “some effect” if p -values are ≤0.025. Confidence intervals will be constructed for all 
outcome variables, allowing estimatio n of effect size.  Zero -inflated regression  models for  primary efficacy analyses will 
be done using M-Plus version 6.1or similar  software.    See Appendix H for additional details.  
 
7.2.6  Secondary  efficacy analyse s  Influence of interventions on secondary  outcomes will be assessed using ANOVA -
based multivariate regression models using SAS software.381-383  Adjustment for multiple comparisons will be 
incorporated, and interpretation will be cautious.238;384-388  In ge neral, we will want to see relationships with p<0.01 in 
order to justify tentative null hypothesis rejection .  Pre -planned secondary efficacy analyses will include effects of 
interventions on:  1) absenteeism,  2) health care utilization, 3) general physical health (SF -12), 4) general mental health 
(SF-12); 5) perceived stress  (PSS-10), 6) self -efficacy (MSES, ESE), 7 ) sleep  quality (PSQ I), 8) body weight (BMI), 9) 
blood pressure and 10) pro- inflammatory cytokines . One -sided testing will be based on the underlying hypotheses that the 
behavioral trainings lead to improved physical and mental health, sleep quality and self-efficacy, and to reductions in 
absenteeism, health care utilization, stress,  body weight, blood pressure and proinflammatory cytokines.  Specific 
hypotheses related to these secondary analyses can be stated as:   7.2.6.1 Those in the intervention groups will display 
reduced absenteeism, as compared to control.  7.2.6.2  Those in the intervention groups will display reduced health 
care utilization, as compared to control.  7.2.6.3  Those in the intervention groups will display improved physical 
health, as compared to control.   7.2.6.4  Those in the intervention groups will display improved mental health, as 
20 
compared to control.   7.2.6.5 Those in the intervention groups will display reduced perceived stress, as compared to 
control.   7.2.6.6 Those in the intervention groups will display improved self -efficacy, as compared to control.  
7.2.6.7  Those in the intervention groups will display improved sleep quality, as compared to control.   7.2.6.8 Those 
in the intervention groups will display reduced BMI , as compared to control.  7.2.6. 9Those in the intervention 
groups will have lower blood pressure compared to  control.  7.2.6. 10 Those in the intervention groups will have 
lower cytokine levels compared to  control , both at standardized follow -up, and during ARI episodes. 
 
7.2.7  Subgroup analyses  We will, in general, consider sub -group or other exploratory  analyses to be hypothesis-
generatin g.   However, p re-planned secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the following sub-groups: 1) those 
who attend at least 7 of the 8 weekly  training sessions, 2) those who continue to exercise or meditate for an average of at 
least 60 minutes per  week after the  trainings end, 3)  those who at baseline have perceived stress scores at least 14 points 
(PSS-10).  One -sided testing will be based on the underlying hypotheses that: A) behavioral trainings are more likely to  
work for those who attend classes , and B) the interventions will be more effective for more highly  stressed people. 
 
7.2.8  Longitudinal analysis   Several of our secondary outcomes will be measured at multiple time points. Analysis of 
longitudinal data is complicated by including dependencies among successive observations made on the same 
individual.389-391 To address these difficulties, we will employ a general linear mixed model for repeated measures using 
various covariance structures (e.g., autoregressive one, compound symmetry, etc.) for error terms for continuously 
measured secondary outcomes.392  For discrete measures (binary or count data), a Generalized Estimating Equations 
(GEEs) approach393-398 will provide a practical method with reasonable statistical efficiency to analyze such data.393;394  
We expect to use SAS version 9.0 or higher software for these secondary analyses.  
 
7.2.9  Intention- to-treat (ITT)  analysis methods will be used to take account of all randomized participants, including those 
lost to follow -up.  The ITT approach: 1) preserves the effects of randomization, and 2) addresses the practical impact of 
interventions better than “per protocol” analyses. Our approach to ITT will involve two strate gies.  F irst, f or sporadically 
missing primary outcome WURSS -24 data within ARI episodes, expectancy -maximizing multiple imputation methods 
will be used for data that meets missing at random criteria.399   Secondly, to take account of those lost to follow -up, we 
will proportionally randomize non-completers to logistic and linear portions of the ZIM model, with imputation based 
on within- group data for the linear sub -model .  All imputation or other data manipulation will be done by analysts 
blinded to allocation group status. See Appendix H. 
 
7.2.10  Process analysis (mediation)   Intervention research is often confounded by 2 types of variables - background 
variables and mediating process variables.197;400  We are always concerned about controlling confounding background 
variables in an intervention study, and we should be equally concerned about the variables that make up the process of the 
intervention-- i.e., the mediating conditions.  In mediation analysis, we do not wish to control mediating variables as much 
as we wish to estimate their contribution to the final outcome of the program.  An analysis that encompasses the 
mediational process (i.e., the theory of intervention)  should mirror the actual progr am and provide information concerning 
its strengths and weaknesses.  This analysis would subsequently provide another level of information regarding the possible "successes" and/or "failures" of the behavioral interventions, and provide guidance for further development and 
enhancement.  For this study, we will follow principles and methodologies outlined by Judd,
401 Co-Investigator Brown,197 
and Yuan.402   See Appendix H for additional details regarding process analysis.  
 
7.2.11  Economic analyses  will focus on costs associated with employment, health care utilization, and medications used 
during ARI illness episodes.  See sections C.6.4.6 through  C.6.4.9 above .   Because economic data such as these tend to 
be non-normally distributed and can lead to erroneous results, we will employ a Monte Carlo probability model using  
bootstrap sampling with replacement.403  This will enhance estimation of variability and hence better precision and 
confidence. Clinic visit charges (Level 2, 3 or 4) will be based on a Dirichlet distribution.  Medication costs will also 
employ distributional sampling, as we trust subjects to report which medications they used, but not to be able to accurately 
estimate costs or dosages over time.  Wages lost to missed work will be individually -specific, and hence not require 
bootstrap sampling.  Economic models will be further refined using estimates of lost work productivity derived from data self-reported on the Stanford Presenteeism Scale
320;321 administered to participants who go to work during ARI episodes. 
 
7.2.12   Absenteeism/Presenteeism   At enrollment we will assess employment, including type of work, hours per week 
worked, and compensation, assessed as hourly wage.  Each week we will ask about any missed work, ascertain number of 
21 
hours missed, and assess and classify reasons for missing  work as either ARI -related or not ARI- related .  To refine 
economic impact analysis, we will assess self-reported performance using the Stanford Presenteeism Scale.320;321  
Presenteeism will be considered a secondary outcome, and will be used  to adjust economic impact in exploratory models.   
 
8. Protection of Human Subjects  
8.1 Overview  This proposed study will be submitted to and approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the 
Health Sciences Institutional Review Board of the University of Wisconsin – Madison (UW HS -IRB), and will be in 
compliance with HIPAA and all other federally manda ted human subjects regulations.404 All members of the 
research team will complete the protection of human subjects’ tutorial required by the UW HS- IRB’s Human 
Subjects Committee prior to the study’s initiation.  All named UW Co -Investigators, Consultants, and current Project 
Personnel have in fact already completed this tutorial. All study personnel, including research assistants, will be 
trained in confidentiality, informed consent procedures, and other aspects of human subject protection. 
 
The UW HS -IRB has approved several human subjects’ studies with Dr. Barrett as PI.  Previously approved studies 
include a randomized trial of echinacea ,375  an NIH -NCCAM -R01 trial testing echinacea, placebo, and doctor-patient 
interaction,244;376;405 several studies developing and validating the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey.173-176;259 
The most recently complete MEPARI trial on which this proposal is based was approved and monitored by UW HS- IRB.  
Dr. Barrett has been a voting member of UW HS-IRB since 2006, but would be recused from voting on this proposal.  
Participation in the proposed study will be completely voluntary.  Participants will be inform ed of their right to refuse to 
participate or to withdraw at any time for any reason.  Prisoners, pregnant women and mentally impaired persons will not be included.  Competent persons aged 30 to 69 meeting other eligibility criteria will be welcomed, regardless of gender, 
ethnicity, religion or socioeconomic status. Participants will be encouraged to ask any questions at any time for any reason, and to seek outside counsel when appropriate.  Participants will be told that this study in no way substitutes fo r 
medical care, and that they should contact their health care provider if they feel any need to do so, for any reason related or unrelated to the study.  Participants will also be encouraged (but not required) to consult their primary care physician 
prior  to enrollment in this study. 
 
8.2 Risk and Benefits 
 
8.2.1 Risks and Benefits Summary   Apart  from flu shots, hand-washing, smoke avoidance, and maintenance of general 
health, there are no known safe and effective prevention strategies for acute viral respiratory infection. Interventions to be tested are low risk, and more likely to confer benefit than harm.  Influenza vaccination (flu shots) will be provided free of 
charge to all participants, and could be considered a benefit. Participants will not be required to forego any proven or accepted preventions or treatments, and in fact will be encouraged to seek appropriate medical attention for any condition, 
including respiratory infection, and to continue their regular health care practices. Antibiotics, anti- influenza antivirals, 
and other ARI treatments will not be disallowed, but instead will be tracked as secondary outcomes.  In general, 
participants will be asked to continue the study interventions they are assigned, and to forego the study interventions they 
are not assigned.  However, they will be informed that they remain free to make their o wn health care, behavioral and life 
style decisions. In particular, exercise will not be discouraged for participants in the meditation or wait- list control group, 
as exercise is known to confer some health benefit.  However, we will ask that participants in the exercise and control 
group refrain from starting a meditation program, and that all participants refrain from starting any purportedly immune-
modifying supplements (eg, echinacea, ginseng, zinc, elderberry, etc.), unless advised to do so by their physicians.  If any 
participants do choose to actively begin an intervention they were not assigned (i.e. a person randomized to exercise 
chooses to take the mindfulness meditation course instead), we will ask them to continue in the study, and will use that 
“cross- over” information in secondary analyses using the principles outlined in Section 4.3 of the proposal. 
 
8.2.2 Risks and benefits to society   As mentioned above, apart from flu shots, hand-washing, and maintenance of general 
health, there are no know n safe and effective prevention strategies for acute viral respiratory infection.  Results of the 
preliminary trial suggest that substantive public health benefit could results from the proposed behavioral training interventions.  Regardless of whether the proposed trial confirms these findings, the research will yield useful data for health scientists, and perhaps for clinicians, policy makers, and citizens.  Apart from potential lost opportunity costs in 
22 
funding this research instead of other proposals, w e cannot identify any significant risks to public health.  Instead, we feel 
that the overall soc ietal benefit risk ratio is clear ly positive.  
 
8.2.3 Adverse effects     There were no adverse effects seen during the preliminary trial.  Neither the UW HS -IRB nor the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) felt that there was a need to monitor and test for any specific potential 
adverse effects.   Nevertheless, poten tial adverse effects will be monitored in the proposed research.  We will ask about 
any exercise-related injuries or accidents.  Using open-ended questions, we will ask about possible or potential adverse 
effects of either meditation or exercise.  Evidence regarding potential adverse effects will be reviewed at regular bi -
weekly Co -Investigator team meetings, and at DSMC meetings.  Any reported potential adverse effect categorized as 
“moderate” or “severe” will be reviewed immediately by at least one of the  study’s physicians, who will decide whether 
to immediately contact the DSMC or IRB (per their reporting requirements).  
 
8.2.4 Safety of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine   Influenza vaccination has a clearly advantageous benefit -risk profile, 
with ap proximately 100 million doses of influenza vaccine administered annually in the U.S.57;61-64  Risks associated with  
influenza immunization include discomfort at the injection site, whic h occurs in up to 60% of people getting flu 
shots. Guillain -Barré Syndrome has been temporally associated with influenza immunization with an estimated incidence 
of 1-2 cases per million  doses of vaccine.  Theoretically, all vaccines carry the very remote risk of anaphylaxis.  
Nevertheless, nearly all competent and respected sources agree that flu shot benefits greatly outweigh potential harms.  
 
8.2.5 Safety of exercise   The broad body of  literature strongly suggests that it is safer to exercise than to not exercise, for 
nearly all people in nearly all disease and risk categories.142-145;406;407  Nevertheless, it is possible that progressing too 
rapidly in an exercise program could carry morbidity or even mortality risks, including musculoskeletal injury and 
potential cardiovascular complications. Therefore, we will follow American Heart Associat ion approved guidelines for 
suitability for an exercise program,241-243 and will suggest (but not mandate) that  prospective participants seek their 
physician’s advice before enrollment.  All participants with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease (including history of infarction, angina, acute coronary syndrome, or congestive heart failure), stroke, or peripheral vascular disease who are 
randomized to exercise will undergo a submaximal treadmill exercise test with ECG monitoring prior to participation. Those with diabetes and ≥ 2 other risk factors (dyslipidemia, HTN, smoking, family history of cardiovascular event [heart attack, stroke] prior to age 55), will also undergo electrically monitored exercise sessions. This exercise stress test will be 
used primarily for developing an appropriate and safe individually -tailored exercise program. Anyone showing ST 
segment changes consistent with acute myocardial ischemia will be referred to appropriate medical care in a timely 
manner.  Results of this sub -max stress testing will be made available to study participants’ physicians upon request and 
with permission.  In general, exercise intensity for this study will be in the moderate to somewhat vigorous range (50-70% 
aerobic capacity based on estimated maximal heart rate), which has been shown to be s afe and effective for health 
maintenance.  Emergency equipment and trained personnel are available at the UW Sports Medicine Fitness Center.  Participants will be informed about warning signs and symptoms and when to stop exercising and/or seek medical 
attention when exercising outside of the training facilities.   
 
8.2.6 Safety of meditation   To the best of our knowledge, there are no known significant negative effects in relation to 
mindfulness meditation.  For the purposes of this study, we will assume that mindfulness meditation training carries no 
significant risks.  However, participants assigned to the meditation group will be monitored using the same rigorous 
methods as everyone else, and if any suggestive evidence of adverse effects emerges, we will  consult with study 
physicians, meditation training staff, DSMC and/or IRB and determine how to proceed. 
 
8.2.7 Adventitious findings    None of the study’s procedures or measures is designed for clinical diagnosis or treatment.  
Participants will be told they should not use any aspect of the study for medical or health decision purposes.  The most 
likely “adventitious findings” from this study can be classified as potentially related to 1) depression or other mental 
health disorders, or 2) abnormal vital signs or chest symptoms potentially related to heart or lung disease , or 3) abnormal 
lab results.  Of all study labs, only HgA1C results will be given to participants.  Any potential clinical care or medical 
decision -making related to HgA1C will be the responsibility if the participant and his/her clinician(s).  
 
Formal screening for depression with the PHQ -9 will be part of the eligibility screening process.  Anyone excluded by this 
test (score of 15 or higher) will receive advice that they should contact a licensed physician, psychiatrist or psychologist.  Participants scoring 10 to 14 on the PHQ- 9, while eligible for the study, will receive similar advice . The PHQ -9 also asks 
23 
respondents to rate themselves as follows: "Over the last two weeks, how often ha ve you been bothered by any of the 
following problems?"  Response range is "not at all", "several days," "more than half the days," and "nearly every day".  
The last  item is "Thinking that you would be better off dead or that you want to hurt yourself in s ome way."  All 
respondents reporting any response greater than "Not at all" for this item will be given advice to seek help from a physician, a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist.   They will be told that this study does not constitute clinical care in  any 
way, and that the enrolling research  specialist does not have training in physical or mental health, but that s/he has been 
told that anyone reporting anything other than "Not at all" for this item should be advised that this may be a sign of clinical  depression, and therefore will be referred to an appropriate health provider.  If the situation is urgent, the 
participant  or potential participant will be referred to an urgent care center or emergency department.  If the situation is 
emergent, the research assistant will dial 9 -1-1 and/or seek immediate local assistance.  Four practicing physicians 
(Barrett, Rakel, Muller, Zgierska) will share a call schedule for this study, so that at least one will usually be available to 
guide research specialists or  speak with research participants, should the need arise.  
  
For those randomized to the exercise intervention, the following adventitious findings may be observed: abnormal heart 
rate (pulse), respiratory rate, or blood pressure.  Additionally, it is possible that some participants might experience chest 
pain, pressure or palpitations, and/or abnormal degree of shortness of breath, nausea, or other unexpected or worrisome 
symptoms.  The exercise physiologist will monitor and report any abnormal changes, and may directly contact one of our 
MDs on staff (Barrett, Rakel, Muller, Zgierska).  If the symptoms or signs constitute an emergency, exercise physiology staff will dial 9 -1-1 and/or provide immediate aid.  
  It is theoretically possible the mindfulness practices may evoke psychological responses that will require psychological 
support. These could occur during a mindfulness training session, during any other session, and at home. The mindfulness 
teachers are trained in identifying participants who may r equire psychological support, and after consultation with a study 
MD, the participant will be referred to additional psychological support.   
8.2.8 Nasal wash  is a simple, minimal risk, and widely practiced means of obtaining nasal fluid.  Participants will be 
informed of the potential risks of discomfort with the nasal wash, and will be free to refuse these or any other procedures for any reason.  
 
8.2.9 Nasal swabs   Self -administered nasal swabs have been used safely and effectively in previous clinical studies.408  
Copan manufactures one of the most commonly used sterile nasal flocked swabs for collecting respiratory virus samples 
from mucosal surface of nasal epithelium.  The swabs have a protective “collar” that keeps the flocked cotton surface from entering more than 4 cm into the nasal cavity.  Participants will be provided with verbal, written and illustrated 
instructions at the baseline visit, and will complete one practice self -swab at the enrollment visit.   
 
8.2.10 Phlebotomy   Bloo d draw s are necessary in order to allow us to measure pro -inflammatory cytokines, both from 
baseline to standardized follow -up, and once during each ARI episode.  This will be done by trained and experienced 
phlebotomist s at the Clinical Research Unit  in the U.W. Hospitals and Clinics.  See section  6.8.  Phlebotomy blood draw  
may cause brief pain, and mild bruising. Tenderness from the blood draws may be present for a few days afterward.  
 
8.2.11 Biologic specimens   We plan to keep the biological specimens for up to 5 years after th e last participant has exited 
from the study, and to destroy the code linking specimen to identifiable participant within 2 years of last subject exit. 
 
8.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
8.3.1 Women    Women will be included in this study, and encouraged to participate.  We expect that more than 50% of our 
sample will be female.  The preliminary MEPARI trial had a female participation rate of  82% (122 of 149 participants). 
Other  previous studies directed by Dr. Barrett have ha d female participation rates in the range of 50% to 80%.  We expect 
similar female participation rates in the proposed study.  
 
8.3.2 Minoritie s  All adults aged 30 to 69 years will be potentially eligible for this study, regardless of race, ethnicity, 
religion or other social or cultural considerations. Individuals from minority groups will be actively recruited, and will be 
encouraged to participate.  We will strive toward substantial minority representation, and will target a major portion of our 
advertising budget and promotion activities towards ethnic minority neighborhoods in the greater Madison area. 
24 
Specifically, we will advertise in the 2 main newspapers in the Madison area that targeted minority audiences, The 
Madison Times  (African American) and The Voz Latina  (Hispanic/Latino). We will also focus staff -directed efforts 
towards minority communities.  These include mailings, flyers, announcements at community meetings, and talks to 
community groups.  Finally, we plan to connect with parish/church health staff in congregations serving largely minority 
populations, and to meet with key personnel in organizations such as Centro Hispano of Dane County, The Latino Health 
Council, the Urban League of Greater Madison, and the Madison Urban Ministry.  
 
In spite of the fact that Madison is an overwhelmingly white community, recruitment techniques used in Dr. Barrett’s 
research have been reasonably successful in the past.  For example, the first echinacea trial included 15% non -white 
participants.375  Our community-based study to develop the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey included 16% 
African Americans, 3% Hispanic/Latino, and 3% Native Americans.173;189 Our NCCAM -funded R01 trial (Physician 
Echinacea Placebo, PEP) enrolled 63 African Americans, 22 Hispanics, and 16 Native Americans.   While the preliminary 
MEPA RI trial had only 8 minority participants, we expect that the proposed trial will do better, as the preliminary trial 
restricted participa tion to those aged ≥50.  The age range of 30 to 69 should result in higher minority participation rates. 
 
8.4 Inclusion of Children 
This study is targeted to women and men aged 30 to 69 years, and will not include children.  Our choice of age range to include is based on several considerations.  From a public health standpoint, interventions that can potentially enhance 
resistance and prevent or ameliorate ARI illness should be directed toward – and tested in – populations that could receive 
the most benefit.  Because of the cost -effectiveness component, working-aged adults are an obvious choice.  Secondly, the 
interventions to be used have not been developed for – or tested among – children.  While mindfulness meditation training 
and moderate intensity exercise activities such as regular brisk walking may indeed be immune modulating and health -
enhancing for children, there is very little experience and data to rely on in this area.  Our research team, including 
meditation and exercise trainers, has a proven track record recruiting and retaining adult participants.  Including adults 
aged 30-69 will provide a sample population more likely to be economically productive, and susceptible to ARI illness.  
Likewise, they are likely to adhere to the interventions and to benefit from them. 
8.5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will oversee human subjects recruitment and monitoring, and will 
function independent ly of the principal investigator and co- investigators.  We expect that this committee will function  
similarly  to that establ ished for the f irst MEPARI trial , and will choose to meet once or twice yearly to monitor 
recruitment and retention, and to provide oversight and guidance in relation to safety, bioethics, and other human subjects 
concerns that may arise .  The DSMC for MEPAR I-2 will consist  of four UW faculty:  1) Paul Hutson PharmD 
(pharmacy, clinical research); Nasia Safdar MD  (infectious d isease ), 3) Tom Cook PhD (b iostatistics  ), and 4) Margo 
Hoover- Regan MD  (pediatric oncology, clinical trials) .  See Appendix F for full Data Safety and Monitoring P lan.  Study 
progress and safety will be reviewed during bi- weekly co -investigator meetings (more frequently if needed). Progress 
reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to at the end of each 8- week 
intervention and then again at the conclusion of each yearly cohort.  While there are no “expected” adverse events in this 
trial, any “unexpected” adverse events will be monitored in a timely fashion.  
 
8.6 Vulnerable Populations 
The proposed study will not enroll pregnant women, human fetuses and neonates, children, prisoners, or any other 
individual considered vulnerable by NIH or IRB standards.  Current pregnancy or plan to become pregnant during the 
course of the study will be excluded by self-report. Women who become pregnant any time during the course of the trial 
will not be dropped and will continue to be followed throughout the duration of the study.  Children are excluded because of the  nature of the mindfulness and exercise interventions, and because one f ocus of the study is to assess potential 
benefits in terms of reduced workplace absenteeism.   The rationale for excluding women who are pregnant or plan to 
become pregnant is two -fold: 1) pregnancy may influence the immune system and/or susceptibility to r espiratory 
infection, and 2) pregnancy, labor and childbirth might interfere with participants’ ability to adhere to the study protocol.

8.6.1  Pregnancy   Current pregnancy or plan to become pregnant during the course of the study will be excluded by self-
report.  We do not plan to actively monitor for new pregnancies. We will, however, ask women to let us know if  they 
become pregnant. Women who become pregnant during the study will be invited to continue participating .  None of the 
study activities are deemed to add any significant risk to pregnancy.  Exercise and influenza immunization are recommended for pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant.  Blood draws, nasal wash, nasal swab and 
questionnaires do not add significant risk.  If and when a pregnancy occurs we will ask whether the participant has a 
family doctor or obstetrician.  If not, we will strive to provide appropriate advice and assis tance in locating one.   
Pregnant women will be encouraged to seek the advice of their clinician(s) in regards to participation in the study.  
 
8.7 Adverse Events  (AEs)  
There were no adverse effects seen during the preliminary trial.  Neither the UW HS -IRB nor the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) felt that there was a need to monitor and test for any specific potential adverse effects.   
Nevertheless, potential adverse effects will be monitored in the proposed research.  We will ask about any exercise -related 
injuries or accidents.  Using open -ended questions, we will ask about possible or potential adverse effects of either 
meditation or exercise.  Evidence regarding potential adverse effects will be reviewed at regular bi -weekly Co -
Investigator team meetings, and at DSMC meetings.  Any reported potential adverse effect categorized as “moderate” or “severe” will be reviewed immediately by at least 2 of the study’s physicians, who will decide whether to immediately 
contact the DSMC or IRB (per thei r reporting requirements).  
8.8 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs)  
SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and/or possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, HS -IRB, CRU, and NCCAM in accordance with their requirements. 
Anticipated SAEs or those unrelated to the study intervention will be reported to the same entities in accordance with requirements.  
 
8.9 Protocol Registration  
Upon approval by the UW HS-IRB, the Principal Investigator will register the proposed study in ClinicalTrials.gov.  Both 
of Dr. Barrett’s NCCAM -sponsored trials ( 1R01AT001428 and 1R01AT004313) were registered, with ClinicalTrials.gov 
registration numbers [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], re spectively.  
 
8.10 Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained 
The primary goal of this project is to determine whether behavioral trainings in mindfulness meditation or moderate 
intensity exercise can lead to reductions in acute respiratory infection (ARI) il lness, such as common cold and influenza.  
Our preliminary findings suggest substantial benefit of these two interventions in terms of reduced incidence, duration and severity of ARI illness, with corresponding reductions in days of work lost to illness.  If the proposed research confirms 
these findings, there will be major implications for public and private health- related policy, as well as for scientific 
knowledge regarding health maintenance and disease prevention.  
 Acute infection from influenza and other respiratory viruses leads to much human suffering and loss of economic 
productivity.  Our own evidence suggests that training in either meditation or exercise may lead to substantial reductions 
in ARI disease burden and work absenteeism.  In addition t o testing whether our findings are replicable in a larger sample 
with refined methodology, the proposed translational comparative- effectiveness research will investigate mechanisms of 
action and provide initial estimates of cost- effectiveness.  If positive findings are confirmed, this line of research could 
have direct and immediate impact on public and private health -related policies and clinical practice, as well as on 
scientific understanding of respiratory infection.

9. Data Handling and Record Keeping  
 
9.1 Confidentiality 
 
9.1.1 Protection of Subject Privacy   Screening of potential participants and consent and enrolling of participants will be 
carried out in a private location , or via telephone .  Similarly, collection of biological samples (nasal wash, blood draw) 
will be done with full privacy.   The exercise and meditation interventions, however, will be done in group session, hence 
should not be considered private.  All potential participants will be informed of these aspects of the study. 
 
All personal identifiers will be destroyed once data collection and analysis has been completed. For those who formally agree that we may keep their name and contact information for potential future research opportunities, the code list linking 
individual to study data will be destroyed. 
 
9.1.2 Database Protection   All project data will be kept in password -protected security -ensured databases.  Project 
personnel will be required to enter separate personal logins and passwords both for computer workstatio ns specifically 
designated for the project and for the database user authentication process.  Personally identifiable information (name, 
address, date of birth, adverse effect reports, etc.) required for longitudinal study participant management will be st ored in 
an encrypted database, on a local hard drive physically separate from the database storing research outcome data.  Permission to view study participant information will be available only to the Principal Investigator or his designee, as 
regulated b y the user authentication procedure. Data analysts will be restricted to viewing outcome data, and will not be 
able to access personal identifiers.  The database used to perform confidential study participant tracking and 
reimbursement auditing functions wi ll be accessible only to the PI and to the involved research specialists, in conformity 
with UW HS -IRB requirements.  
 Identifying information will be recorded either on a single detachable sheet of paper, kept in a locked filing cabinet, or in a separate password -protected security database, which will not have direct links to process or outcome data.  Project 
databases will generate an unseen unique identifying code for each participant, separate from the study participant number used on data collection instruments, to connect the participant’s multiple data elements.  Association of that code with the 
study participant’s identifying information will reside in an encrypted database separate from the study’s research data, 
ensuring that no records in the dat aset used for analysis will contain any data that could identify the participant.  All 
computerized databases will be protected with passwords, with access restricted to appropriate study personnel.  
9.1.3  Confidentiality During AE Reporting  AE reports and annual summaries will not include subject- identifiable material.  
Each report will have only the study identifier associated with that subject.   
 
9.2 Health Information  
 
By signing the consent form research subjects are giving permission for their health information to be used by and shared 
with the individuals, companies, or institutions described in the consent form. Unless a subject withdraws permission in 
writing to stop the use of their health information, there is no end date for its use for this research study. Subjects may 
withdraw their permission at any time by writing to the person whose name is listed in the consent form.  
 Beginning on the date a subject withdraws their permission, no new information about them will be used. Any information that was shared before they withdrew their permission will continue to be used. If a subject withdraws their 
permission, they can no longer actively take part in this research study. 
 
10 Study Finances  
10.1 Funding Source  
This study is financed through an R01 grant from the U .S. National Institute of Health, National Center for 
Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 
27 
10.2 Conflict of Interest  
The University of Wisconsin Madison has legal and ethical responsibilities to review and, where appropriate, to reduce, 
eliminate, or manage potential financial conflicts of interest in research involving human subjects. To ensure that the 
safety of research participants is adequatel y protected, the UW-Madison (1) requires reporting and review of significant 
financial interests that might present a real or potential conflict of interest with the individual’s research prior to final IRB approval of the research, and (2) limits the part icipation of individuals who hold significant financial interests related to a 
research project involving human subjects in that research. Further, the UW- Madison affirms that significant financial 
interests should not negatively affect data sharing, publishing, and mentoring of students, fellows, trainees, or other research workers.  
PIs, Co -Is, and key personnel on human subjects protocols reviewed by the HS -IRB have an obligation to report all 
significant financial interests held by themselves or their immediate families in business entities with financial interests that would reasonably appear to be affected by the conduct or outcome of the human subjects research reviewed by a UW-
Madison IRB. 
PIs, Co -Is, and key personnel report significant financial int erests in Annual Outside Activities Reports and/or in protocol-
specific Outside Activities Reports in conjunction with IRB applications, as appropriate.  
10.3 Subject Compensation 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
10.4 Costs to Study Subjects 
There will be no costs to research subjects for participating in this research study.  As part of their study participation t hey 
will receive meditation or exercise (see Subject Compensation above) at no cost to them.  Addit ionally , study visits at the 
CRU and study laboratory samples will be paid for by the research study.   
11. Publication Plan  
Bruce Barrett , MD/PhD, i s the Principal Investigator (PI) of this research.  He wrote the grant proposal, will direct the 
trial, supervis e data collection and analysis, wr ite or direct  the main results manuscript upon completion of the study, and 
will be  responsible for interpretation of results . All co -investigators will be meaningfully involved with the main results 
paper, and will in addition work on other papers to result from this study.  All co -authors will contribute substantially and 
approve any final manuscripts.  Both the PI and all co-authors will have full access to all of the study data and take full 
responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.    
 
Beyond normal scientific review process, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine did not and 
will not contribute  substantively  to the design or conduct of the study, data collection, management, analysis or 
interpretation of the data, or preparation, review, or approval of manuscripts.

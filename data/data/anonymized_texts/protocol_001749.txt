Study Protocol  
We conducted an assessor -blind, two -arm, randomized controlled trial in partnership with assertive 
community treatment (ACT) teams providing services to individuals with serious mental illness in the 
Midwest and Pacif ic Northwest regions of the United States. The research was monitored by an 
independent safety monitoring board at the University of Washington ’s School of Medicine. Participants 
provided informed consent. All participants were receiving ACT services and were randomly assigned to 
one of two treatment arms: mobile interventionist (ACT augmented with mobile phone texting) or 
treatment as usual (sta ndard ACT). Interventions were deployed for 3 months. We conducted 
assessments at baseline (0 months), posttrial (3 months), and follow -up (6 months). Participants were 
compensated for completing assessments ($30 per assessment, plus reimbursement for trav el).

Secondary outcomes will be assessed by change in means and standard deviations  of measures used . 
The o ther pre -specified  outcome measure of Satisfaction with Treatment at 3 months following 
intervention period will b e assessed by evaluating  means and standard deviations, and comparing the 
intervention group to the control group.

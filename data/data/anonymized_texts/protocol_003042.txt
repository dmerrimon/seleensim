 2. SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title: Long-Term Safety Extension Study of ACTIMMUNE® (interferon γ- 1b) in Children and Young 
Adults with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
Protocol Number:  HZNP-ACT-303 Phase: 3 
Test Drug:  ACTIMMUNE (interferon γ-1b) Indication: Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA)  
Number and Country of Study Sites:  Approximately 4 study centers in the U nited States.  
Objective:  
Evaluate the long-term safety of ACTIMMUNE in subj ects with FA . 
Study Design:  
This is a multi-center, open-label, long-term safety  extension study of ACTIMMUNE in the treatment of FA in 
children and young adults. Subjects who complete 26 weeks of treatment and the Week 28 Follow-Up Visit in HZNP -
ACT-302 (Multicenter, Safety and Efficacy, Open -Label Extension Study of ACTIMMUNE® (interferon γ -1b) in 
Children and Y oung Adults with Friedreich’s Ataxia)  will be eligible to enter this long -term safety extension protocol.  
The Day 1 Visit of this study ( HZNP-ACT-303) occurs on the same day as the Week 28 Follow -Up Visit for HZNP -
ACT-302.  
The treatment duration is open -ended, and treatment will continue until ACTIMMUNE is commercially available for 
the treatment of FA in the United States ( US) or until the Sponsor decides not  to continue development for the 
treatment of FA . The initial dose  of ACTIMMUNE will be individualized for each subject and will be determined by 
the investigator, provided that the initial dose does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose in HZNP-ACT-302. The 
investigator may subsequently adjust the dose for any subject i f deemed clinically appropriate, provided that the dose 
does not exceed 100 µg/m2. Dose adjustments, including the reason for the change, will be recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case report form. All doses of ACTIMMUNE  will be administered by subcutaneous injection three times a 
week (TIW) at home. 
Subjects will be required to return for clinic visits at least every six months. At each 6-month assessment clinic visit, 
subjects will be dispensed  a 3-month supply of study drug, and an additional 3 -month supply will be directly shipped 
to the subjects’ home in between the required 6 -month clinic visits. Subjects who are not able to receive study drug 
shipments at their home will return to the clinic for interim clinic visits thre e months after the Baseline and 6 -month 
assessment visits  to obtain study drug; however, assessments (other than enquiries regarding adverse event s and 
concomitant medications ) will only be performed every six months.  Subjects who are able to receive direct- to-home 
shipments will be contacted by telephone at the 3 -month interim visits and queried regarding adverse events and 
concomitant medication use.  
At each 6-month assessment visit, subjects will be queried about any adverse events that occurred since th e last visit, 
concomitant medication use, and undergo brief physical examinations (including vital sign monitoring ) and blood 
sample collection for routine clinical laboratory safety tests. If applicable, urine samples will be collected for 
pregnancy testi ng.  
At the time ACTIMMUNE becomes commercially available  or if development is ceased  for the treatment of FA , 
subjects who are active on study will return to the clinic while still on study drug and undergo electrocardiogram 
(ECG) and Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) assessments in addition to the above 6- month safety assessments 
at an End -of-Study (EOS) Visit prior to transition ing to the commercial product  or discontinuing study drug . Subjects 
who prematurely withdraw from the study will have EOS assessments completed within two weeks of study drug 
discontinuation.  
Details of study activities are provided in Section 2.1, Schedule of Assessments . 
Subject Population:  
Male and non -pregnant female subjects who completed 26 weeks of treatment and the Week 28 Follow -Up Visit in 
Study HZNP -ACT-302 will be eligible for enrollment.

 Inclusion Criteria:  
Eligible subjects must meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Written informed consent and child assent, if applicable.  
2. Completed 26 weeks of treatment and the Week 28 Follo w-Up Visit in Study HZNP -ACT-302. 
3. If female, the subject is not pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant during  the study, or within 
30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects of child -bearing potential must have a negative 
urine pregnancy test result at Week 26 of Study HZNP -ACT-302, and agree to use a reliable method of 
contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Exclusion Criteria : 
Subjects will be ineligible if, in the opinion of the Investigator, they have a concomitant disease or condition that 
could interfere with the conduct of the study or potentially put the  subject at unacceptable risk.  
Dose Regimen/Route of Administration: 
ACTIMMUNE will be administered TIW by subcutaneous injection. The initial dose will be individualized for each 
subject and will be determined by the investigator, provided that the initial dose does not exceed the maximum 
tolerated dose in HZNP -ACT-302. The investigator may subsequently adjust the dose for any subject if deemed 
clinically appropriate , provided that the dose does not exceed 100 µg/m2. 
Dosage Form and Strength Formulation:  
The commercial formulation of ACTIMMUNE will be used in this study. Each 0.5 mL of ACTIMMUNE contains 
100 µg (2 million international units [IU]) of IFN -γ 1b. 
Duration of Treatment and Follow -Up: 
The planned treatment duration is open-ended, and treatmen t will continue until ACTIMMUNE is commercially 
available for the treatment of FA in the US or until the Sponsor decides not  to continue development for th is 
indication . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy will be assessed using the FARS.  
Safety assessments will include adverse event monitoring, concomitant medication monitoring , physical examinations, 
vital signs, ECGs, clinical safety laboratory evaluations (complete blood count, chemistry, and urinalysis), and 
pregnancy testing (if appli cable). 
Statistical Analyses:  
No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed.  
FARS results (FARS total score [FARStot] and the FARS score excluding the peripheral nervous system  subscale 
score and the facial and tongue atrophy and fasciculati ons from the bulbar subscale score [FARS-mNeuro score]) will 
be summarized with descriptive statistics for the EOS Visit. For statistical purposes, the FARS results for the last on -
treatment visit in HZNP -ACT-302 (Week 26) and the change from the Week 26 H ZNP-ACT-302 Visit to the EOS 
Visit in this study will also be summarized.  
Adverse event and concomitant medication data will be summarized. Vital sign and clinical safety laboratory data will 
be summarized with descriptive statistics for Baseline, post -dose, and change from Baseline to post -dose values , and 
shift tables will be presented for clinical laboratory values from Baseline to each post-dose visit. The ECG analysis 
will use the same approach as described above for the FARS analysis.  
Physical examination findings will be listed by subject.  
Sample Size Estimate : 
Subjects who complete 26 weeks of treatment and the Week 28 S afety Follow -Up Visit in Study HZNP -ACT-302 will 
be eligible for enrollment. The sample size is not based on statistical considerations.

1 Changes in medical history from the Baseline of HZNP-ACT-301 will be recorded on the electronic case report forms . The 
medical history from the HZNP-ACT-301 study will be available for reference. 
2 Subjects will be given a 3-month supply of study drug at each clinic visit and an additional 3 -month suppl y will be directly 
shipped to the subjects’ home in between the required 6-month clinic visits. If direct shipments are not feasible, subjects will 
return to the clinic every three months to obtain study drug; however, assessments (other than adverse event queries) will only 
be performed every six months.  
3 Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused study drug vials at each clinic visit.  
4 Adverse events occurring or worsening on or after the date of administration of the first dose of study drug through the end of the study will be considered treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). All serious adverse events ( SAEs) that occur on or 
after the date of administration of the first dose of study drug through two weeks after study discontinuation will be considered 
treatment -emergent SAEs (TESAEs) and will be recorded  and reported to Horizon drug safety . 
5 Only for female subjects of childbe aring potential.  
6 The Day 1 Visit of this study (HZNP -ACT-303) occurs on the same day as the EOS Visit (Week 28 Follow -Up Visit ) for 
HZNP-ACT-302.  
7 Findings will be recorded for both the Day 1 (Baseline) Visit of this study and the Week 28 Follow -up Visit for  HZNP-ACT-
302.  
8 Subjects who are not able to receive direct -to-home study drug shipments will return to the clinic for interim clinic visits three 
months after the Baseline and 6 -month assessment visits ; those who are able to receive direct -to-home shipments will be 
contacted by telephone . 
9 Perform at clinic visits  only; those with telephone visits will receive/return study drug supplies at next clinic visit.  
10 Subjects who complete the study will undergo final assessments while still on study drug and will then be transitioned to 
commercial product. Subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study will have the EOS assessments completed within two 
weeks of study  drug discontinuation. In the event the Sponsor decides to discontinue development for the treatment of FA , all 
subjects will be contacted and instructed to return to the clinic for final assessments while still on active drug.  
11 For statistical purposes,  the last on-treatment visit from HZNP-ACT-302 (Visit 26) will be used to assess changes to the EOS 
assessment  in this study .

 granulomatous disease (CGD) and for delaying the time to disease progression in patient s with 
severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO) ; it is approved under Biologics License Application 
(BLA) 103836, and is now being studied by Horizon in the treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia 
(FA).  
FA is an autosomal recessive d isorder associated with progressive ataxia, cardiomyopathy, 
scoliosis, diabetes , and loss of vis ual and sensorineural hearing function at later stages of the 
disease [Harding, 1981; Lynch et al, 2002a ]. FA has a prevalence of about 1 in 50,000 persons in 
the US [Tsou et al, 2009] . Patients develop difficulty walking, loss of coordination, and 
dysarthria. Degeneration of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, their axons in the dorsal 
columns, and the dorsal spinocerebellar pathways gives rise to loss of proprioception and associated ataxia. A few ot her nuclei (including the dentate of the cerebellum) within the central 
nervous system are affected and contribute to the ataxia [ Simon et al, 2004] . The abnormal ge ne 
in FA and its product (frataxin) provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms in this disease. In 98% of individuals, FA is  caused by homozygous expanded guanine – adenine – 
adenine (GAA) repeats in the frataxin  gene (FXN). This triplet repeat is located within an intron, 
leading to decreased ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription and levels of the mitochondrial 
frataxin protein. Decreased frataxin expression is implicated in the assembly and repair of mitochondrial iron-sulfur- cluster containing enz ymes and the ability to produce adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) [ Babcock et al, 1997; Koeppen, 2011; Rotig et al, 1997] . Frataxin deficiency 
leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation. This may initiate or propa gate free radical reactions 
leading to cell death, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction as a pathophysiological mechanism in FA.  
Patients with FA have frataxin protein levels in peripheral t issues that range from 2 -30% of 
control levels. The level of  frataxin protein correlates with age of onset and inversely with the 
length of the GAA repeat. In carriers, who do not develop symptoms of FA, frataxin protein 
levels range from 30 -80% of control levels [ Deutsch et al, 2010] . The lack of symptoms 
observed in carriers suggests that restoration of frataxin levels in patients  to those observed in 
carriers may lead to subst antial improvement of symptoms.  
At present, no therapy is  approved for use in FA  [Corben et al, 2014; Delatycki et al, 2014] . 
Many of the therapies being developed are designed to increase levels of frataxin, either by reversal of its transcriptional depression or by other means [ Arpa et al, 2014; Lynch et al, 2010; 
Lynch et al, 2012] . Frataxin -depleted cells have an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.  
Subtype-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been successful in vitro  at 
increasing levels of transcription of frataxin, and is beginning early stage trials in humans [ Rai et 
al, 2008; Sandi et al, 2011] . Erythropoietin and its derivatives raise frataxin levels in peripheral 
tissues by non- transcriptional means, but the effect has been too small to observe efficacy in 
human trials  [Boesch et al, 2014; Mariotti et al, 2012 ]. 
IFN-γ, a protein produced by the immune system in response to infections, increases both 
frataxin messenger RNA ( mRNA) and protein levels in a variety of different cell types, including 
cell lines derived from FA patients. In addition, an FA mouse model treated with subcutaneous 
(SC) injections of IFN- γ for 14 weeks showed improvements in motor coordination, an effect

 that was mirrored by accumulation of frataxin protein in the DRG tissue in these mice  
[Tomassini et al, 2012] . Its mechanism of action is as a transcr iptional activator of multiple 
genes. From a therapeutic perspective, ACTIMMUNE is approved for use in the US in patients  
with CGD and SMO ( see prescribing information  in Section 16.2), and has been investigated in 
other conditions, including oncology, infectious diseases , and inflammatory disorders.  
6.2 Rationale for the Study  
In an Investigator -Initiated Study (IIS) in FA conducted by , 12 subjects between 
the ages of 5 and 17 years (mean age of 12 years) with genetically- confirmed FA were treated 
with ACTIMMUNE by SC injection three times per week (TIW) over the course of a 12- week 
treatment period. The starting dose was 10 µg/m2 for the first two weeks of the study, then 
escalated to 25 µg/m2 for weeks three and four, and then escalated to 50 µg/m2 for the final eight 
weeks of treatment. All subjects followed the same dose- escalation schedule, with adjustments 
made in the event of clinical ly significant adverse events. Ten of the subjects completed 12 
weeks of treatment, with the remaining two subjects discontinuing prior to 8 weeks of treatment 
due to transportation issues. 
As reported by the authors, ACTIMMUNE  was well -tolerated with no S AEs, with only two 
subjects reporting severe dose-related adverse events and subsequent dose reductions. Efficacy 
results showed small changes in frataxin levels observed in red blood cells, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) , and platelets after 12 weeks of treatment ; however, the results 
varied between tissues.  Frataxin tissue samples were not timed to drug administration, potentially 
contributing to the variability of the results  [Seyer et al, 2014] . 
The mean improvement in FARS score was significant after 12 weeks of treatment (p = 0.008). 
The magnitude of improvement in FARS score when contrasted with the natural history of FA deterioration wa s equivalent to almost 18 months of disease progression prevention and the 
absolute improvement in FARS may suggest not only prevention of disease progression but potential subject salvage and absolute disease improvement. No statistically  significant 
relationships were observed between frataxin protein levels, FARS scores, and in vivo IFN- γ 
levels [Seyer et al, 2014] . On withdrawal of ACTIMMUNE during the follow-up period , there 
was a trend for the FARS scores to worsen , suggesting a loss of therapy- related benefit.  
Other secondary endpoints included  timed performance tests , such as the timed 25 -foot walk 
(T25FW), fai led to show any significant treatment -related changes, but this may reflect the small 
sample size in this IIS. 
Overall, the safety profile  of ACTIMMUNE  in FA subjects in this IIS  mirrors the typical profile 
and frequency of adverse events in the prescribing information for ACTIMMUNE. In two cases, the maintenance dose of ACTIMMUNE was lower than planned in response to either raised liver function tests and/or flu-like symptoms. Subjects were able to continue in the study following dose reduction. 
Based on the results of the IIS, Horizon is currently conducting two studies with ACTIMMUNE. 
The first study (HZNP -ACT-301) is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 

Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947  
Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-303 
  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 16 of 57 
 26-week study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ACTIMMUNE administered to  children and 
young adults with FA, and the second study (HZNP -ACT-302) is an open- label 26-week efficacy 
and safety extension of HZNP-ACT-301, in which all subjects who complete blinded treatment 
in HZNP-ACT-301 will be offered the opportunity to receive ACTIMMUNE for an additional 
26 weeks. As of 10 March 2016, 14 subjects had completed HZNP- ACT-301 and enrolled in 
HZNP-ACT-302, and it is projected that the first subject will complete HZNP -ACT-302 in June 
of 2016. Therefore, the Sponsor has designed this protocol to collect long -term safety data and to 
offer subjects who complete HZNP- ACT-302 the opportunity to continue receiving 
ACTIMMUNE until it is commercially available for the treatment of FA in the US or until the 
Sponsor decides to discontinue development for this indication. 
FA is a rare, debilitating, autosomal recessive deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA)-inherited, 
mitochondrial disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. The rationale for 
use of ACTIMMUNE  for the treatment of FA is based on in vitro and animal data, and clinical 
experience in FA subject s. Currently, t here is no FDA-approved therapy for FA. ACTIMMUNE 
was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of FA on October 1, 2014. 
7. STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
7.1 Study Objective 
The objective is to evaluate the long-term safety of ACTIMMUNE in subjects with FA.  
8. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multi- center, open -label, long- term safety extension study of ACTIMMUNE in th e 
treatment of FA in children and young adults. Subjects who complete 26 weeks of treatment and 
the Week 28 Follow- Up Visit in HZNP -ACT-302 (Multicenter, Safety and Efficacy, Open -Label 
Extension Study of ACTIMMUNE® [interferon γ-1b] in Children and Young Adults with 
Friedreich’s Ataxia) will be eligible to enter this long -term safety extension protocol. The Day 1 
Visit of this study ( HZNP-ACT-303) occurs on the same day as the Week 28 Follow- Up Visit 
for HZNP -ACT-302. 
The treatment d uration is open-ended, and treatment will continue until ACTIMMUNE is 
commercially available for the treatment of FA in the US or until the Sponsor decides to 
discontinue development for this indication. The initial dose of ACTIMMUNE will be individualized for each subject and will be determined by the investigator, provided that the 
initial dose does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose in HZNP- ACT-302. The investigator 
may subsequently adjust the dose for any subject if deemed clinically appropriate, provided that the dose does not exceed 100 µg/m
2. Dose adjustments, including the reason for the change, will 
be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  All doses of ACTIMMUNE 
will be administered by subcutaneous injection three times a week (TIW) at home.

 Subjects will be required to return for clinic visits at least every six months. At each 6-month 
assessment  clinic visit, subjects will be dispensed a 3 -month supply of study drug, and an 
additional 3-month supply will be directly shipped to the subjects’ home in between the required 
6-month clinic visits.  Subjects who are not able to receive study drug shipments at their home 
will return to the clinic for interim clinic visits three months after the Baseline and 6 -month 
assessment visits to obtain study drug; however, assessments (other than queries regarding adverse events and concomitant medications) will only be performed every six months. Subjects who are able to receive direct -to-home shipments will be contacte d by telephone at the 3-month 
interim visits and queried regarding adverse events and concomitant medication use.
 
At each 6 -month assessment visit, subjects will be queried about any adverse events that 
occurred since the last visit , concomitant medication  use, and undergo brief physical 
examinations (including vital sign monitoring ) and blood sample collection for routine clinical 
laboratory safety tests. If applicable, urine samples will be collected for pregnancy testing.  
At the time  ACTIMMUNE becomes commercially available or if development is ceased for the 
treatment of FA , subjects will return to the clinic while still on active study drug and undergo 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) assessments in addition to the above 6 -month safety assessments at an End -of-Study (EOS) Visit prior to transition ing to 
the commercial product  or discontinuing study drug. Subjects who prematurely withdraw from 
the study will have EOS assessments completed within two weeks of study drug discontinuation. 
8.2 Discussion of Study Design 
The study population consists of subjects who completed S tudy HZNP -ACT-302; this population 
was well-defined and consistent with the expected target population for whom ACTIMMUNE 
will be indicated  (pediatric and young adult subjects with a FA functional stage of >1 to <5). 
8.3 Selection of Study Population 
8.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Eligible subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 
1. Written informed consent and child assent , if applicable.   
2. Completed 26 weeks of treatment and the Week 28 Follow- Up Visit in Study HZNP-
ACT-302. 
3. If female, the subject is not pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant during 
the study, or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at Week 26 of S tudy 
HZNP-ACT-302 and agree to use a reliable method of contraception throughout the study 
and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

 8.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects will be ineligible if, in the opinion of the Investigator, they have a concomita nt disease 
or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the study or potentially put the subject at 
unacceptable risk.   
8.3.3 Removal of Subject s from Therapy or Assessment  
All subjects are free to withdraw from study participation at any time, for any reason, and 
without prejudice to their further medical care . In addition, t he investigator may terminate a 
subject from the study at any time . The primary reason for discontinuation should be recorded on 
the eCRF using one of the following categories: 
• Adverse event. The subject experiences  an adverse event that imposes an unacceptable 
risk to the subject’s health, or the subject is unwilling to continue because of an  adverse 
event. 
• Lack of therapeutic effect. The investigator has determined that study drug administration 
is not benefitting the subject , and continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to 
the subject.  
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria violation.  The investigator discovers that the subject did not 
meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria after study enrollment. 
• Lost to follow-up. The subject does not return to the clinic for scheduled assessments, 
and does not respond to the site’s attempts to contact the subject. 
• Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject’s legally acceptable representative) wishes to withdraw from the study. The clinical site should attempt to determine the underlying 
reason for the voluntary withdrawal and document it on the eCRF; if the under lying 
reason is documented as an adverse event or lack of efficacy, the category of withdrawal should be marked in the corresponding category and not as voluntary withdrawal. 
• Study termination. The Sponsor, IRB, or regulatory agency terminates the study. 
• Pregnancy.  
Following premature withdrawal from the study, the subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative will be contacted by telephone to enquire about any adverse events and 
concomitant medication use.  
Discontinued or withdrawn s ubjects will no t be replaced.  Subject identification numbers are 
unique and will not be reassigned.

 8.4 Treatments  
8.4.1 Treatments Administered  
All subjects will receive ACTIMMUNE. The planned treatment duration is open- ended, and 
treatment will continue until ACTIMMUNE is commercially available for the treatment of FA in 
the US or until the Sponsor discontinues development for this indication. 
8.4.1.1 Dose Adjustment Guidelines  
Subjects will receive SC doses of ACTIMMUNE TIW  at home. The initial dose of 
ACTIMMUNE will be determined by the investigator for each subject, provided that the initial 
dose does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose in HZNP- ACT-302. The investigator may 
subsequently adjust the dose for any subject if deemed clinically appropriate, provided that the 
dose does not exceed 100 µg/m2.  
8.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products 
8.4.2.1 ACTIMMUNE  
ACTIMMUNE is a single -chain polypeptide containing 140 amino acids with a molecular 
weight of approximately 16,465 Daltons. ACTIMMUNE  differs from natural human IFN -γ by 
the substitution of an additional N-terminal methionine, deletion/loss of seven amino acids and 
lack of glycosylation. 
The commercial formulation of ACTIMMUNE is a sterile, clear, colorless solution filled in a 
single-use vial for SC injection. Each 0.5 mL of ACTIMMUNE contains: 100 µg (2 million 
international units [ IU]) of IFN-γ 1b formulated in 20 mg mannitol, 0.37 mg disodium succinate 
hexahydrate, 0.14 mg succinic acid, 0.05 mg polysorbate 20, and sterile water for injection. 
The Sponsor will provide unlabeled, commercial ACTIMMUNE to CSM. The commercial 
formulation will be utilized, with each unlabeled vial containing ACTIMMUNE in a concentration of 200 µg/mL. Each vial permits the extraction of up to 0.5 mL of ACTIMMUNE with additional volume to facilitate solution withdrawal. The study drug vials will be shipped to CSM, who will be re sponsible for labeling of the vials in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
(see Section 8.4.3) and assembling vials into kits . If a subject requires two vials per dose, the 
same volume should be removed from each vial and delivered in individual syringes. For example, if the dose should be 0.8 mL, then 0.4 mL should be withdrawn from each vial into separate syringes and two injections given.  
8.4.3 Labeling  
CSM will label the ACTIMMUNE vials, assemble the study drug into kits, and ship kits to the 
study sites  as well as provide direct -to-subject shipments.  
Labels on all vials of study drug and study drug kits will clearly indicate the study number, Sponsor’s name and location, storage conditions, and appropriate precautionary labeling required

 by US Federal law. Kit labels will also include the unique subject ID . Dosing instructions will be 
provided separately to the subject/caregiver. 
8.4.4 Storage 
Study drug kits  are to be stored in a 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46°F) refrigerator  at the site, and 
subjects and their caregivers will be instructed to store all study drug in their home refrigerators.  
At the clinic, a ll study medications must be stored in a secure area with limited access , and a 
daily temperature log of the drug storage area will be maintained every working day; significant 
deviations from the specified temperature range will be reported as protocol deviations. 
Vials must be placed in a 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46°F) refrigerator immediately upon receipt to 
ensure optimal retention of physical and biochemical integrity. The vials must not be frozen. 
Excessive or vigorous agitation should be avoided. Exposure of vials to temperatures greater 
than 25°C (77 °F) should be strictly avoided. The sponsor should be contacted for disposition 
instructions for vials left at room temperature (>8 °C) for a total time exceeding 8 hours. Vials 
should not be used beyond the expiration date. 
8.4.5 Study Drug Quality Issues 
ACTIMMUNE is a sterile, clear, colorless solution. If any vials of study drug are not colorless or 
contain particulate matter, study drug MUST NOT be administered. In the event that any of the vials stored at home are considered suspect by the subject/care giver, the clinic is to be notified 
immediately  for instructions regarding dosing and possible re-supply. The clinic will notify the 
Sponsor and Med Communications, Inc. of any product complaints. 
8.4.6 Drug Accountability  
The Principal I nvestigator at each site is responsible for the control of all study medication. The 
site must maintain a dequate records of the receipt and disposition of all study medication shipped 
to the study center. Records will include receipt dates, quantities received, quantities dispensed, 
quantities returned or destroyed, and the ID numbers of the subjects who received study medication.  
All empty, partially empty, and full vials of study drug must be retained by the study center under locked storage, until drug accountability has been completed. Periodically throughout the study and at the conclusion of the study, inventory checks and accountability of study materials will be conducted by the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative. Once accountability is completed, the Sponsor or it’s representative will authorize the return of study medication (all 
used, partially used, and unused vials) to CSM . The completed Drug Accountability and Drug 
Return/Destruction Record(s) will be returned to the Sponsor. The investigator’s copy of the Drug Accountability and Drug Return/Destruction Record(s) must document accurately the 
return of all study drug supplies. Records will also include disposition dates and quantities returned to the designated facility.

 In addition, subjects or their caregivers can return biohazard containers supplied by study staff 
with all used syringes and needles from the study to study staff at the follow-up visit(s). Study 
staff will dispose of these containers appropriately. 
8.4.7 Study Drug Administration and Timing of Dose for e ach Subject  
8.4.7.1 Description of Clinical Supplies  
CSM will supply study drug kits and packages containing ancillary supplies for dosing 
(i.e., syringes, alcohol swabs, gauze pads, bandages, and biohazard containers for safe storage of 
used needles and syringes) to the study sites  as well as the direct -to-subject shipments. 
8.4.7.2 Determination of Dose Volume  
The volume of study drug to be administered will be determined by the site and will be based on 
the subject’s body surface area ( BSA). The BSA will be calculated using the Mosteller 
[Mosteller, 1987 ] formula: 
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵  (𝑚𝑚2)=  �𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖)∗𝑊𝑊𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙)
3131 
Given that each 0.5 mL of study drug solution contains 100 µg I FN-γ 1b (0.005 mL/µg), the 
following calculation will be used to determine the volume of study drug to be administered.  
Dose (µg/m2)  × BSA  × 0.005 mL/µg = ___ mL to be dosed 
For example, a subject who is 62 inches tall and weighs 100 pounds will have a BSA of 1.41 m2. 
If the dose is 100 µg/m2, the subject will receive 0.71 mL of study drug. 
100 µg/m2 × 1.41 m2 × 0.005 mL/µg = 0.705 mL, rounded to 0.71 mL of study drug 
8.4.7.3 Details Concerning Timing and Dose Administration 
All doses of study drug will be administered by SC injection . Subjects and/or their caregivers 
will be instructed on their individualized dosing volume and proper dosing techniques ; they will 
also be instructed to administer the study drug on the right and left deltoid , anterior thigh, and 
upper and lower abdomen and to rotate the injection sites .  
Subjects or their caregivers will also be instructed in safe handling and storage of used syringes 
and needles. The clinical staff will demonstrate proper technique for withdrawing the appropriate volume of study drug from the vial. If two vials are needed  to achieve the dose, an equal volume 
should be removed from each vial. For example, if the dose should be 0.8 mL, then 0.4 mL should be withdrawn from each vial into separate syringes and two injections given. The injection site will be cleaned with an alcohol swab and allowed to air dry. About an inch of skin and fat tissue will be pinched between the thumb and forefinger, the needle will be inserted all the way into the pinched skin, and the entire volume of study drug will be injected under the skin.

 Subjects and their caregivers will be instructed to administer study drug on an outpatient basis 
TIW (e.g., a dosing schedule of Monday, Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Saturday) for the duration  of the study.  
At each clinic visit , subjects and/or their caregivers will be dispensed a 3-month supply of study 
drug, and an additional 3-month supply will be directly shipped to the subjects’ home in between the required 6- month clinic visits . If direct shipments are not feasible, subjects will return to the 
clinic every three months to obtain study drug. A t all post-Baseline clinic visits, subjects and/or 
their caregivers will return all unused kits and study drug  vials. 
8.4.8 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
All subjects will receive ACTIMMUNE in this open -label extension study. 
Subjects will maintain the unique 6 -digit subject ID number assigned in Study HZNP- ACT-301 
and carried through to Study HZNP- ACT-302; the first three digits are the site numbe r and the 
last three digits are the sequential number assigned by the site to subjects who consented to the double-blind study beginning with 001. So for example, the first subject consented at site 222 in Study HZNP -ACT-301 would have been assigned subject ID 222001.  
8.4.9 Blinding 
This is an open-label safety extension study.   
8.4.10 Concomitant Therapy and Restricted Medications  
Concomitant medication use will be monitored throughout the study. No specific concomitant medications are restricted.  
8.4.11 Treatment Compliance  
Study medication will be dispensed at clinic visits  and re-supplies of study drug may be shipped 
in temperature -controlled containers to the subject’s home. All unused study drug received by 
the subjects since the previous visit will be returned at the subsequent visit for drug 
accountability.  
An inventory of the study medication supplies will be performed by the site or authorized study designee and recorded onto the Drug Accountability Log in the subject’s source document 
records or equivalent. 
8.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables 
The Schedule of Assessments was previously provided in Section 2.1. 
8.5.1 Efficacy Variables  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) (total score 
[FARStot] and score excluding the peripheral nervous system subscale score and  the facial and 
tongue atrophy and fasciculations from the bulbar subscale score [ FARS-mNeuro score]).

  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 23 of 57 
 8.5.1.1 Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) 
The FARS will be performed at the EOS (or PW) Visit. The FARS includes neurological signs 
that specifically reflect neural substrates affected in FA. Based on a neurological examination , 
bulbar, upper limb, lower limb, peripheral nerve, and upright stability/gait functions are assessed 
[Friedman et al, 2010; Lynch et al, 2006; Subramony et al, 2005] . 
The FARStot score has a maximum of 125 points (see assessment in Section 16.3), and the 
FARS-mNeuro score has a maximum of 93 points. 
8.5.2 Safety Variables 
Safety assessments will include adverse event monitoring , concomitant medication monitoring, 
physical examinations, vi tal signs, ECGs, clinical safety laboratory evaluations (complete blood 
count, chemistry, and urinalysis), and pregnancy testing (if applicable). 
8.5.2.1 Adverse Events  
Comprehensive assessments of any apparent adverse event experienced by the subject will be 
performed throughout the course of this study. Study center personnel will record all adverse 
events, whether observed by the Investigator/designee or reported by the subject /caregiver , in the 
source document and on the e CRF. A physician (the Principal Investi gator or a physician/nurse 
practitioner/physician’s assistant designated by the Principal Investigator) will manage and treat 
any treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE). 
Adverse event information will be elicited from each subject/caregiver  by indirect questioning 
using a non-leading question, such as “Has anything bothered you since your last visit or is anything bothering you now?” Adverse event data also may be volunteered by the parent/caregiver  to the Investigator (or designee). A physician (either the Principal Investigator 
or a physician /nurse practitioner/physician’s assistant designated by the Principal Investigator) 
will assess the seriousness, severity, and causality of each adverse event based on the following 
definitions and documentation requirements. 
8.5.2.1.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event : As defined by the ICH, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in 
a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational product, whether or not 
the event is considered related to the investigational product. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the investigational product.  
NOTE: The term “adverse event” includes both non-serious and serious adverse events unless 
otherwise specified  
A TEAE is any a dverse change from the subject’s baseline condition, including any laboratory 
test value abnormality  judged as clinically significant b y the investigator, that occurs on or after 
the date of the first dose of study drug administered at home and throughout the duration of the

 clinical study, whether the adverse event is considered related to the treatment or not. Adverse 
events include the following types of occurrences: 
• Adverse reaction: an adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse events for which there is reason to 
conclude that the drug caused the event. 
• Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event . Reasonable possibility means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event . A 
suspected  adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse 
reactions are the subset of all adverse event s for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the event.  
• Other medical experiences, regardless of their relationship to the study drug, such as 
injury, accidents, increased severity of pre-existing symptoms, apparently unrelated 
illness, and clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values, physiological testing, or physical examination findings.  
• Reactions from drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, an interaction with another 
drug or substance, or toxicity.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An adverse event is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death. This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a clinical study, 
including deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug ( e.g., car 
accidents).  
• Life-threatening adverse experience.  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, i ts 
occurrence places the subject  at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Other medically important event which, according to appropriate medical judgment, may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 25 of 57 
 Of note: Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not adverse 
events, but the condition for which the surgery/intervention is required is an adverse event and should be documented accordingly.  
Elective surgeries and/or treatments requiring hospitalization ( e.g., cosmetic surgery), and 
treatment received at an emergency room or similar facility, will not be considered as SAEs 
unless one of the definitions of an SAE listed above is met. 
Non-Serious Adverse Event: A non-serious adverse event includes any adverse event  that is not 
described in the previous SAE category. 
Unexpected:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpec ted if it is not 
listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed with  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. Unexpected, as used in this definition, also refers to adverse event s or suspected 
adverse reactions that  are mentioned in the Investigator B rochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
8.5.2.1.2 Documentation of Adverse Events  
Adverse events that are ongoing from S tudy HZNP -ACT-302 will be considered baseline 
signs/symptoms. The TEAE reporting period begins with the date of the first dose of study drug 
in Study HZNP- ACT-303 and continues until completion of study participation (i.e., the patient 
is transitioned to the commercially available product, the Sponsor decides not to continue development for the treatment of FA, or the subject prematurely withdraws from the study). All baseline signs/symptoms and TEAE s must be recorded in the source documents and on the 
subject’s eCRF. 
If the Investigator observes an SAE after study co mpletion that he/she believes was possibly 
caused by the study medication, the Investigator will report this SAE using the procedures described in Section 8.5.2.1.5. 
Unchanged, chronic conditions are NOT  considered adverse event s and should not be recorded 
on the adverse event pages of the eCRF unless there is an exacerbation of a chronic condition.  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject ’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which the study drug is being studied ( i.e., FA). It may be an increase in the severity 
of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of worsening ataxia may  be considered as disease progression and not an  adverse event . Events, 
which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should only be reported as adverse event s if 
they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. 
In addition, hospitalizations for planned procedures are not considered an adverse event unless 
they are prolonged hospitalizations, and emergency room visits less than 24 hours in duration are 
not considered hospitalizations. 
Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947  
Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-303 
  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 26 of 57 
 Detailed information regarding all SAEs must also be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event 
Reporting Form. Whenever possible, the Investigator should group together into a single term the signs and symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis.  For example, cough, rhinitis, and 
sneezing might be grouped together as “upper respiratory infection” if the Investigator is confident of the diagnosis. 
8.5.2.1.3 Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity  of all adverse event s, including all treatment- emergent clinically significant 
laboratory test  results and all treatment- emergent clinically significant changes in laboratory test 
results, will be assessed in accordance with the following criteria:  
• Mild (Grade 1): awareness of signs or symptoms that are easily tolerated, are of minor 
irritant type,  cause no loss of time from usual activities, do not require medication or 
further medical evaluation, and/or are transient. 
• Moderate (Grade 2):  signs or symptoms sufficient to interfere with function but not 
activities of daily living.  
• Severe (Grade 3):  signs or symptoms sufficient to interfere with activities of daily living; 
signs and symptoms may be of a systemic nature or may require further medical evaluation and/or treatment. 
• Life-Threatening (Grade 4):  disabling or with life -threatening consequences. This 
definition does not include any event that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more severe form.  
• Fatal (Grade 5):  death related to an  adverse event . 
8.5.2.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of the study drug to each adverse event will be determined by the Investigator 
based on the following definition : 
• No reasonable causal relationship (probably not related): There is no plausible temporal 
relationship or there is another explanation that unequivocally provides a more plausible 
explanation for the event. 
• Yes, reasonable causal relationship (possibly related): There is evidence in favor of a 
causal relationship; i.e., there is a plausible time course, and at least one of the following 
criteria apply:  
 There is a reasonable pharmacological  relationship (or known class effect) 
 There is no other more plausible explanation 
Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947  
Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-303 
  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 27 of 57 
  There is a positive de- challenge (without active treatment of the event)  
 There is a positive re- challenge  
 There is a distinguishable dose effect  
Within the reporting requirement under 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i), the FDA provides the following 
examples of types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongl y associated 
with drug exposure ( e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome). 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug ( e.g., tendon 
rupture). 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
8.5.2.1.5 Reporting and Documenting SAEs  
All SAEs beginning with the time of signing IC and continuing until two weeks after 
administration of the final dose of study medication must be reported. The following steps will be taken to report promptly and document accurately any SAE, whether or not it appears to be related to the study medication: 
1) Report the SAE to Med Communications, Inc.  by telephone or fax within 24 hours  
after becoming aware that a subject  has experienced an SAE (see Appendix 16.1 for 
contact information). 
2) Record the SAE accurately in the source documents and on the adverse event page of 
the subject’s  eCRF, as described in Section 8.5.2.1.2. Using the Serious Adverse 
Event Reporting Form, submit all known subject  information to Med 
Communications, Inc. (as specified in separate instructions provided to the study center) on the SAE reporting form within 24 hours of learning of the SAE 
occurrence.  
3) Perform appropriate diagnostic tests and therapeutic measures, and submit all follow-
up substantiating data, such as diagnostic test reports, hospital discharge summaries, and autopsy report to the Sponsor’s representative. 
4) Respond in a timely manner to any queries from Sponsor regarding the SAE.  
Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947  
Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-303 
  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 28 of 57 
 5) Conduct appropriate consultation and follow-up evaluation until the SAE is resolved, 
stabilized, or otherwise explained by the Investigator. 
6) Review each SAE report and evaluate the relationship of the SAE to st udy treatment.  
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE is unexpected in nature. 
7) The Investigator must report all adverse event s or SAEs that meet the criteria for 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Human Subjects or Others to the IRB. 
8.5.2.1.6 Follow-Up of Adverse Events  
Once the study -defined non-serious adverse event and SAE reporting periods have passed, 
reporting is required only if an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that he or she considers related to the study treatment.  
After the initial record ing of an adverse event, the Investigator should proactively follow the 
subject. Any ongoing study drug- related adverse event present at the time of study termination, 
including a clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, will be followed until r esolved or 
until the event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained.  
In the event of unexplained, treatment- emergent, clinically significant abnormal laboratory test 
results or clinically significant changes in laboratory test resu lts, the tests should be repeated 
immediately and followed until the values have returned to within the reference range or to baseline for that subject.  
The Investigator will document on the adverse event eCRF any/all ongoing non-serious adverse 
events that will not be followed further after the subject exits the study. If in doubt, the 
Investigator should consult the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
All SAEs should be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until the subject is 
lost to follow-up. Once the SAE is resolved, the corresponding adverse event eCRF page should be updated. 
8.5.2.1.7 Medication Error and Overdose  
A medication error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication 
use or patient harm.  
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to, or by a study subject, at a dose above the target dose of 100 µg/m
2 or above the stable 
tolerated dose for an individual subject.  
If the subjects/caregi vers accidently administer the wrong dose of study drug, they are to 
immediately  contact the site to discuss possible safety concerns and receive instructions 
regarding future doses. All cases of medication errors and overdose (with or without associated 
adverse events ) will be documented on the eCRF in order to capture this important safety 
Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947  
Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-303 
  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 29 of 57 
 information consistently in the database. Adverse events associated with an overdose or 
medication error and SAEs of overdose or medication error are to be reported according to the 
procedures outlined in Sections 8.5.2.1.2 and 8.5.2.1.5, respectively.  
In the event of drug overdose, the subject is to be treated symptomatically with supportive 
measures instituted as required . 
8.5.2.1.8 Review of Adverse Events  and Emerging New Safety Information 
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee in Pharmacovigilance will perform an ongoing 
review of all adverse event s and all other emerging n ew information relevant to the safety of the 
drug. 
8.5.2.1.9 Reporting of Investigational N ew Drug (IND)  Safety Reports  
The sponsor will notify the US FDA and all investigators on any new serious risks associated 
with the drug. 
8.5.2.2 Pregnancy Reporting  
All female subject s of childbearing potential will undergo urine pregnancy tests at 
Baseline/Day  1, each 6 -month assessment  clinic visit, and the EOS (or PW) Visit. Subjects will 
be instructed to use effective contraceptive measures in line with the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. In case a female subject  becomes pregnant during the study observation period or 
pregnancy is confirmed within 30 days after the final study visit, the Investigator will immediately inform the Sponsor of the clinical trial using the Pregnancy Re porting Form. 
Pregnant subjects  still ongoing in the trial will be withdrawn.  Information regarding the outcome 
of the pregnancy must be provided shortly after the birth of the child or the termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancies will be followed whether or not an adverse event in the mother or the 
unborn child has been observed. 
Male subjects  should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 30 
days following the last dose of study drug. Pregnancy of the subject ’s partner is not considered to 
be an adverse event ; however, the outcome of all pregnancies should (if possible) be followed up 
and documented. 
8.5.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the non-dominant arm, pulse, and  
temperature) will be assessed at  Baseline/Day 1 , each subsequent 6-month assessment clinic 
visit, and the EOS (or PW) Visit . Blood pressure and pulse measurements wil l be obtained with 
the subject’s  arm unconstrained by clothing or othe r material and while the subject  is sitting up.  
When possible, the same arm will be used for measurements in all study visits.  Temperature will 
be obtained orally or via the ear.

 8.5.2.4 Brief Physical Examinations 
Brief physical examination s will be performed at  Baseline/Day 1 , each subsequent 6-month 
assessment clinic visit, and the EOS (or PW) Visit; these exams will include evaluation of 
general appearance and the following body systems: skin, lungs, cardiovascular (including 
peripheral vascular ), abdomen, and other. 
8.5.2.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Samples of blood (4.5 mL) and urine are scheduled for collection at Baseline/Day 1, each 
6-month assessment clinic visit, and the EOS (or PW) Visit. Additional follow-up samples for clinical laboratory testing should be obtained as clinically indicated.  
All clinical laboratory testing, with the exception of on -site urine pregnancy tests during the 
treatment period for females of childbearing potential, will be performed by the central clinical 
safety laboratory (URMC).  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed:  
• Complete blood count  
• Chemistry panel  
• Urinalysis  
8.5.2.6 Electrocardiograms  
ECGs are scheduled for the EOS (or PW) Visit. 
8.5.3 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The efficacy and safety measurements in this study are widely used and generally recognized as 
reliable, accurate, and relevant.  
The study population consists of subjects who completed Studies HZNP -ACT-301 and HZNP-
ACT-302; this population was well -defined and consistent with the expected target population 
for whom ACTIMMUNE will be in dicated (pediatric and young adult subjects with a FA 
functional stage of >1 to <5 ). 
8.5.4 Study Procedures  
Subjects who provide Informed Consent/Assent and who meet all the entry criteria for participation in this study will be enrolled in the long- term safety extension study. The treatment 
duration is open- ended, and subjects will be seen at the clinic at least every six  months. 
8.5.4.1 Baseline/ Day 1 (Week 2 8 of Study HZNP -ACT-302)

  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 33 of 57 
 8.6.1 Efficacy Variables  
FARS results (FARStot and FARS -mNeuro) will be summarized with descriptive statistics for 
the EOS Visit. For statistical purposes , the FARS results for the last on -treatment visit in HZNP -
ACT-302 (Week 26) and the change from the Week 26 HZNP- ACT-302 Visit to the EOS Visit 
in this study will also be summarized.  
8.6.2 Safety Variables 
Adverse event and concomitant medication data will be summarized. V ital sign and clinical 
safety laboratory data will be summarized with descriptive statistics for Baseline, post-dose, and 
change from Baseline to post -dose values, and s hift tables will be presented for clinical 
laboratory values from Baseline to each post- dose visit. The ECG statistical analysis will use the 
same approach as described above for the FARS analysis.  
Physical examination findings will be listed by subject.  
8.6.3 Populations for Analysis 
All analyses will be based on the Safety Population. The safety  population will be all subjects 
who receive at least one dose of study drug on or after the Baseline/Day 1  Visit.  
8.6.4 Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by standard descriptive summaries 
(e.g., means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for 
categorical variables such as gender). 
8.6.5 Sample Size and Power Considerations  
Subjects who complete 26 weeks of treatment and the Week 28 Follow- Up Visit in Study 
HZNP-ACT-302 will be eligible for enrollment. The sample size is not based on statistical 
considerations. 
8.7 Changes in the Conduct of the Study  
If any modifications in the experimental design, dosages , parameters, subject  selection, or any 
other sections of the protocol are indicated or required, the Investigator will consult with the 
Sponsor before any such chan ges are instituted.  Modifications will be accomplished through 
formal amendments to this protocol by the Sponsor and approved from the appropriate IRB. 
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor will consider any requests for exceptions to protocol entry 
criteria on a case- by-case basis.  The Investigator or other health professional in attendance must 
contact the Sponsor as soon as possible to discuss the associated circumstances . All protocol 
deviations and the reasons for such deviations must be documented. In the event of a protocol 
deviation, the Investigator and Sponsor’s Medical Monitor wi ll determine whether the subject 
should continue to participate in the study.

 The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to report fully to regulatory authorities all results of 
administration of investigational drugs to humans. No investigational procedures other than those 
described in this protocol will be undertaken on the enrolled subjects without the agreement of the IRB and Sponsor. 
9. SOURCE DOCUMENTATION AND INVESTIGATOR FILES  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to document fully the conduct of 
the study and to ensure that study data can be subsequently verified. These documents should be 
classified in two separate categories: (1) Investigator study file a nd (2) subject  clinical source 
documents that corroborate data collected in the eCRFs. Subject clinical source documents 
would include, as applicable, original hospital/clinic subject records; physicians’ and nurses’ notes; appointment book; original laboratory, ECG, electroencephalogram , radiology, pathology, 
and special assessment reports; dispensing records; signed Informed Consent/Assent Forms; 
consultant letters; and subject screening and enrollment logs. 
In order to comply with regulatory requirements, it is the policy of the Sponsor that, at a 
minimum, the following be documented in source documents at the study center: 
• Study number, assigned subject number, and verification that written Informed 
Consent/Assent was obtained (each recorded in dated and signed progress notes). 
• Progress notes for each subject  visit (each dated and signed). 
• Records of each study visit including each study assessment and the identity of the staff member performing the assessment.  
• Study drug dispensing and return. 
• Review by the Investigator or qualified personnel on the 1572 of laboratory test results. 
• Adverse events (start and stop date, description, action taken, and resolution). 
• Investigator or sub- investigator’s sign ed assessment of each  adverse event . 
• Concomitant medications (start and stop dates, reason for use). 
• Condition of subject upon completion of, or PW  from, the study. 
10. CASE REPORT FORMS  
An eCRF is required for every subject who signs the informed consent/assent or for whom the 
caregiver has signed informed consent. Required data must be entered on the e CRF within  three 
days after data collection or the availability of test results.  Separate source records are required to 
support all e CRF entries.  Data captured  on the eCRF, and requested anonymized copies of 
supporting documents, will be transferred to the Sponsor at study completion.

 The Investigator will ensure that the eCRFs are accurate, complete, legible, and timely, and will 
review and provide an electronic signature for the eCRF according to the standard operating procedure of Premier Research . Final eCRFs will be provided to the Investigator and Sponsor by 
Premier Research . 
11. STUDY MONITORING  
The Investigator will ensure that the study is conducted in accor dance with all regulations 
governing the protection of human subjects. The Investigator will adhere to the basic principles of GCP as outlined in Title 21 of the CFR, Part 312, Subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”; 21 CFR, Part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects”; 21 CFR, Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards”; 21 CFR, Part 54 “Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators”; and the ICH guideline entitled “Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance”. Additionally, this study will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with all local 
laws and regulations. 
The Investigator will ensure that all work and services described in or associated with this 
protocol are conducted in accordance with the investigational plan, applicable regulations, and the highest standards of medical and clinical research practice.  The Inves tigator will provide 
copies of the study protocol and Investigator Brochure to all Sub-Investigators, pharmacists, and other staff responsible for study conduct. 
All aspects of the study will be monitored by qualified individuals designated by the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor will ensure that the study is monitored adequately in accordance with GCP guidelines. 
Prior to initiation of the study, the Sponsor and /or it’s representatives will review with study 
center personnel information regarding the investigational drug, protocol requirements, 
monitoring requirements, and reporting of SAEs. 
At intervals during the study, as well as  after the completion of subject enrollment, the stud y 
center will be monitored by the Sponsor for compliance.  During these visits, the monitor will 
discuss study progress, verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the data being entered on the eCRF (sou rce data verification); oversee the resolution 
of outstanding data discrepancies, and check on various aspects of study conduct ( e.g., drug 
accountability, sample storage).  The Investigator agrees to allow these monitors access to the 
clinical sup plies, dispensing and storage areas, and clinical records of the study subjects, and, if 
requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator must cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visit s are resolved.  
A secondary audit may be conducted by Quality Assurance designated by the Sponsor. The Investigator will be informed if this is to take place and advised as to the nature of the audit. Representatives of the US FDA and/or representatives of  other regulatory authorities may also 
conduct an inspection of the study at the investigative site. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately.

 Every effort will be made to maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of subjects participating 
in this clinical study.  However, because of the investigational nature of this treatment, the 
Investigator agrees to allow representatives of the Sponsor, its designated agents, and authorized 
employees of the appropriate regulatory agencies to inspect the facilities used in this study and to 
have direct access to inspect, for purposes of verification, the hospital or clinical records of all subjects enrolled in this study. A statement to this effect should be included in t he Informed 
Consent/Assent Form. 
12. DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data will be entered into a clinical database as specified in Premier Research’s Data 
Management Plan. Quality control and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification will be communicated to the investigational site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections will be documented in an audit trail.  
The coding of an adverse event, medical history and concomitant medication terms will be performed by Premier Research and reviewed and approved by the Sponsor. Concomitant 
medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODrug) and adverse event/medical history/surgery/non drug therapy terms will be coded using the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
13. RETENTION OF RECORDS  
No study documents at the study site should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. All subjects ’ medical records, the Investigator’s copy 
of the eCRF, other supporting data, records of drug dispensing and accountability, signed Informed Consent Forms, IRB correspondence, and correspondence with the Sponsor must be kept by the Investigator for at lea st two years following the date of the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region (including the US) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in any other ICH region.  If an application is not filed or not 
approved for the indication unde r study, all study -related files  must be retained for at least  two 
years following the date of discontinuation of the clinical development program for ACTIMMUNE  and for a period in compliance with all federal, state and local regul ations. The 
Sponsor must be notified prior to the disposal of any study- related files.  If the Investigator leaves 
the practice or institution during the required retention period, it is important that arrangements be made for continued record retention. In that event, the records generally will be retained at the 
institution at which the study was conducted. 
14. PUBLICATION   
To avoid disclosures that could jeopardize proprietary rights, the institution and/or the 
Investigator agree to certain restrictions on publications ( e.g., abstracts, speeches, posters, 
manuscripts, and electronic communications) as detailed in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

 16.2 Approved US Labeling for ACTIMMUNE   
Interferon γ-1b was approved in 1990 in the US under the trade name ACTIMMUNE as a 
treatment to reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with CGD, an 
inherited disorder characterized by deficient phagocyte oxidative metabolism (BLA 103836, approved for orphan indication). In February 2000, approval was obtained to market the product in SMO, a rare (and often fatal) bone disorder (BLA 103836/1001, approved for orphan 
indication).  
The current version of the approved US label ing (02 June 2015) is included in this appendix; any 
subsequent updates to t he labeling can be found at

 SUMMARY 
Background Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT)  is a peculiar visceral fat depot with anatomical and 
functional contiguity to the myocardium and coronary arterie s. EAT is a highly inflammatory 
tissue enriched with genes involved in endothelial function, coagulation, immune signalling, lipid 
metabolism, potassium transport and apoptosis . EAT is associated with coronary artery disease, 
diabetes and obesity.  EAT is easily measurable and an emerging therapeutic target that r esponds 
and modifies to medications targeting the adipose tissue Liraglutide , an analogue of glucagon- like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1), is indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Liraglutide  has 
recently shown to reduce cardiovascular risk .  Neverth eless, whether liraglutide could reduce EAT 
is unknown.  
Aim The primary objective of this interventional study was to evaluate whether liraglutide  can 
cause a significant and rapid reduction of EAT, organ -specific visceral fat and cardiovascular risk 
factor itself, in overweight/obese type 2 diabetic patients.  
 
Methods  To test this hypothesis we performed a 6-month randomized, open- label, controlled 
study in 100 type 2 diabetic subjects with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m2 and HemoglobinA1c 
(HbA1c) ≤ 8% on metformin monotherapy. Individuals were randomized in 2 groups to receive 
additional liraglutide up to 1.8 mg sc once daily ( n=55) or to remain on metformin up to 1000 mg 
twice daily  (n=45). Ultrasound- measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline, 3 and 6 -month 
follow ups.  
 
Results In the liraglutide group EAT decreased from 9.6±2 to 6.8±1.5 and 6.2±1.5 mm (p< 0.001), 
accounting for a -29% and -36% of reduction at 3 and 6 months, respectively, whereas there was 
no EAT reduction in the metformin group; BMI and HbA1c improved only in the liraglutide group 
after 6 months.  
 Conclusions.  For the fi rst time, we found that liraglutide added to metformin caused an 
unprecedented, close to 40%, reduction of EAT. EAT reduction was not only quantitatively 
important, but also very rapid, as the earliest reduction, of almost 30%, occurred within 3 months.  
We suggest that the recently reported (LEADER study) beneficial cardiovascular  effects 
associated with l iraglutide treatment may be EAT -mediated.

 PROTOCOL  
STUDY RATIONALE  
This study was designed to reflect a real -life and common clinical scenario of type 2 diabetic 
patients presenting with fairly good glucose control, but at mild- moderate cardiovascular risk. We 
intentionally chose HbA1c ≤ 8% to rule out the confounding eff ect of a poor diabetes control on 
study outcomes. Also, as prior treatment with metformin was a criteria for entry into the study, we 
could evaluate the independent effect of liraglutide on EAT. Epicardial fat has recently shown to 
be a modifiable and measureable cardiovascular risk factor, and therefore it could well serve as primary outcome of the study. In addition, EAT is known to be higher in subjects with diabetes, 
due to its strong correlation with visceral adiposity and insulin resistance.  
METHODS  
Study design  
This was a randomized, open- label controlled 6-month study in 100 overweight/obese (body mass 
index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m
2) type 2 diabetic subjects on metformin monotherapy.  Patients were 
screened among those routinely refer red to the Division of Endocrinology , Diabetes and 
Metabolism out -patient clinic at the University of Miami. Approximately 500 patients were 
screened between January 2014 and January 2016.  All the patients provided written informed 
consent before participation. The study was ap proved by the University of Miami Institutional 
Review Board (# 20120811) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines . 
 
Study Criteria and Treatment Arms  
Patients were enrolled on the basis of the following inclusion criteria:  type 2 diabetes, HbA1c ≤ 
8 % measured at least 1 month prior to the study, BMI ≥27 kg/m2, prior treatment with metformin 
only, age ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years old.  Exclusion criteria were the following : type 1 diabetes, current 
use of insulin, other GLP-1 receptor agonists , dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP -4) inhibitors, 
pramlintide, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, history of diabet ic ketoacidosis, history of diabet ic 
macro or micro vascular complications, known contra -indications to liraglutide , such as previous 
history of pancreatitis or medullary thyroid carcinoma, personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia  type 2, renal or liver or heart failure , acute or chronic infective diseases , cancer 
or chemotherapy, current use of systemic corticosteroids or in the 3 months prior this study, known 
or suspected allergy to liraglutide , excipients, or related products, pregnant, breast -feeding or the 
intention of becoming pregnant. Eligible i ndividuals were random ly assigned to receive additional 
liraglutide , or to remain on metformin.  The liraglutide -group was started on liraglutide (Victoza®) 
up to 1.8 mg s.c. once daily. Liraglutide  was administered with a starting dose of 0.6 mg ( for a 
least one week) and subsequent increments to 1.2 mg (after a least one week) and to 1.8 mg (after 
at least a week on 1.2 mg). Liraglutide -group subjects had to achieve the final dose of 1.8 mg by 
at least three weeks from the starting dose. Subjects who  were not able to tolerate the dose of 1.8 
mg, were advised to lower the dose to 1.2 mg. Patients received full training and titration 
4 
 instructions by a registered nurse.  Metformin regimen was continued. Metformin -group was 
treated with metformin monother apy for the duration of the study  at the dosage from 500 mg twice 
daily to a maximum of 1000 mg twice daily. Both groups received lifestyle and diabetes education, 
as part of the standard care. Patients in both groups were advised to continue with their us ual 
dietary habit  and physical activity.  Once patient eligibility and written consent were obtained, the 
study participant s were scheduled for the baseline clinic visit. Each patient underwent a 
transthoracic echocardiographic study, full physical examination and a fasting blood draw n for 
measurement of blood glucose and haemoglobinA1c (HbA1c)  and other parameters . Study 
patients were then scheduled for follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months and t he same visit procedures 
were repeated  at each follow-up visit. 
Study procedures  
Echocardiographic Epicardial Fat Thickness .   EAT thickness was measured according to the 
method first described and validated by Iacobellis et al . Briefly, EAT was identified as the echo -
free space between the outer wall of the myocardium and the visceral layer of pericardium. EAT 
thickness was measured perpendicularly on the free wall of the right ventricle at end -systole in 
three cardiac cycles. Maximum EAT thickness was measured at the point on the free wall of the 
right ventricle along the midline of the ultrasound beam, perpendicular to the aortic annulus, used 
as the anatomical landmark for this view. The average value of three cardiac cycles was calculated  
and used for analysis . Echocardiograms were done by an experienced operator who was blinded 
to the patients’ data.  Intra-observer reproducibility of echocardiographic measurement of EAT was 
assessed by the intra -class correlation coefficient.  
Physical Exa mination All anthropometric measures were obtained by the study nurse  at each 
visit. Height (in cm) and weight (in kg) were measured, and BMI was  automatically calculated as 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2). Blood pressure was 
measured in the seated position, using an automated cuff and digital readout, and entered by the 
study nurse into the electronic database. Resting heart rate was also measured  
Blood Measurements  Fasting blood samples for fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c were 
obtained from all individuals according to the study design timetable. Blood parameters were 
measured according to standard and previously described procedures. Fasting comprehensive 
metabolic panel  and lipid profile were also  measured at each visit as  standard diabetes care.  
Follow up of glucose profile  Study patients were advised to monitor their capillary glucose twice 
daily, fasting in the morning and post -prandially. Glucose profile was tracked weekly by  the 
research coordinator and/or principal investigator who were in contact with study patients 
throughout MyUHealth e- mail system or by telephone.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
Primary outcome of the study was EAT changes on liraglutide combined to metformin  vs 
metformin monotherapy; secondary outcomes were determinants of HbA1c changes during 
treatment. Assuming a difference of 1±0.5 mm in EAT to be clinically significant and using a 
significance level of p<0.05 and 90% power, the current s tudy sample size was  sufficient to detect 
statistical significant difference s in EAT between liraglutide and metformin group. Continuous 
variables were considered as age- adjusted and sex -adjusted means with their standard deviations 
(SDs).  Patients were randomized consecutively using a computer generated randomization table. 
Two-sample t test with 95 % CI for difference was performed to evaluate differences between the 
two groups at baseline. Two-way ANOVA was used to calculate changes (∆) in EAT and other 
study variables between baseline, 3 and 6 months in both groups . Relations between study 
variables were calculated using simple linear regression analysis.  Two-tailed p < 0.05 indicates 
statistical significance.  Statistical analysis was pe rformed using Minitab 17 Software.

NUMBER OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS  
 
If you decide to be in this study, you will be one of approximately 100 people in this research study.  
 
DURATION OF STUDY 
 
The study consists of three visits. Each visit will take around 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours. Your total involvement in the 
study will be about 6 months.  
 
PROCEDURES  
During the first visi t you will be assigned, by chance, to one of two study groups (Victoza + Metformin or 
Metformin only). In each visit (Visits 1-3) you will undergo the same research procedures: basic body 
measurements as your weight , height, waist and hip circumference;  have approximately one tsp of 5 ml blood 
drawn; and an ultrasound of the heart.   
 
The heart ultrasound ( called echocardiogram) is a simple test that measures the morphology of the heart and 
that can identify the amount of the cardiac fat  (called epicardial fat). The procedure is performed by placing a 
probe on the outside of the chest wall with a gel -like substance to transmit harmless waves into the body. The 
gel allows the ultrasound beams to “see” your heart. You will be asked to remove your clothing from  the waist 
up and women will be given a gown to wear during the procedure. If you need help, the investigator will assist you in getting onto the exam table, where you will be asked to lie on your left side. The test may take 15 to 30 minutes. 
 
We will als o collect information from your medical records for research purposes.  
 RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
Medication : Victoza and Metformin may cause mild and usually well- tolerable gastro -intestinal side effects. 
Victoza may increase the risk of  thyroid C- cell tumor, a rare form of thyroid tumor, in mice . No evidences of 
increased risk of cancer in humans have been reported .  
Blood Draw
 The risks of blood drawing include: fainting, the occurrence of temporary discomfort and/or bruise 
at the site of puncture; rarely,  infection or the formation of a small clot or swelling to the vein a nd surrounding 
area may occur.  
 
 
Echocardiogram   
An echocardiogram is painless and safe. It does not use radiation and so carries none of the associated risks.

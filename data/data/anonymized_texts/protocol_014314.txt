 Intervention  There will be  two study groups  who wil l be randomized . 1. Music group:  
patients in this group will receive  research -selected music after the golden 
moment has been completed  between the patient, provider, and nursing staff . 
2. Midazolam group:  patients in this group will receive IV midazolam  (0.5mg to 
2mg max)  after the golden moment has been completed.  
 
In our daily practice, it is the provider’s  preference to give patients medication 
for sedation while conducting the preoperative nerve block. Patients do not 
routinely get sedation medicatio n during the preoperative nerve block 
placement.  
Statistical 
Methodology  1:1 Randomized controlled study  
Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan  The PI, Dr. Graff and her MD collaborator Dr. Nabil Elkassabany will be 
responsible for data safety and monitoring. All data will be kept in a locked 
cabinet in the MD collaborator’s office. The PI and collaborators will perform 
safety rev iews after 25 subjects are enrolled . Any protocol -related problem or 
deviation will be reported to Dr. Graff and/or Dr. Nabil Elkassa bany  as soon as 
possible.  
 
Background and Study Rationale  
1 Introduction  
This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in compliance with the 
provisions set forth in the protocol as well as, Good Clinical Practice standards , associated federal 
regulations, and all applicable University research requirements.  
 
Patients often feel a tremendous amount of anxiety prior to their planned surgical procedure  and 
anesthetic . As a result, this can affect their perioperative period by  elevating their stress markers, causing 
various fluctuations in their hemodynamics, and poorly impacting their postoperative recovery1. A 
significant number of patients  have anxiety about the anticipation in their overall outcome and 
postoperative pain control .2,3In addition to this, an increase in preoperative anxiety can result in an 
increase in intraoperative anesthetic requirements .3 To treat preoperative anxiety, pharmacologic agents 
such as short -acting benzodiazepines and opioids are  used as needed depending on an individual basis ; 
however, there are known significant side effects from these medications such as respiratory depression, 
vital sign abnormalities, and possible apnea which limit the use of these medications and in some 
instances, prevent the use for preoperative anxiety. In addition to this, u tilization of these medications  for 
conscious sedation  also require continuous monitoring of a patient  by either anesthesia personnel or 
nursing staff.  
 
Music is a non -pharmacologic intervention that has been shown to significantly decr ease preoperative 
anxiety. This intervention can be used as an adjunct or even replace pharmacologic agent s to help with 
preoperative anxiety.1,4 Music is a modality that is virtually harm -free and relatively cheap in cost. Patients 
who are unable to tolerate pharmacologic agents to treat preoperative anxiety can greatly benefit from 
non-pharmacologic options such as music.

 In this study, we aim to evaluate the use of music as a preoperative anxiolytic prior to the administration 
of a peripheral nerve block . This study will be conducted at an ambulatory surgical center in a university 
setting.  
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
 
Patients often feel a tremendous amount of anxiety prior to their planned surgical proce dure and 
anesthetic. As a result, this can affect their perioperative period by elevating their stress markers, causing 
various fluctuations in their hemodynamics, and poorly impacting their postoperative recovery1. A 
significant number of patients have anxiety about the anticipation in their overall outcome and 
postoperative pain control2,3. In addition to this, an increase in preoperative anxiety can result in an 
increase in intraoperative anesthetic requirements3. To treat preoperative anxiety, pharmacologic agents 
such as short -acting ben zodiazepines and opioids are used as needed depending on an individual basis ; 
however, there are known significant side effects from these medications such as respiratory depression, 
vital sign abnormalities, and possible apnea which limit the use of these  medications and in some 
instances, prevent the use for preoperative anxiety. In addition to this, utilization of these medications for 
conscious sedation also require continuous monitoring of a patient by either anesthesia personnel or 
nursing staff.  
 
Music is a non -pharmacologic intervention that has been shown to significantly decrease preoperative 
anxiety. This intervention can be used as an adjunct or even replace pharmacologic agents to help with 
preoperative anxiety1. Music is a modality that is virtually harm -free and relatively cheap in cost. Patients 
who are unable to tolerate pharmacologic agents to treat preope rative anxiety can greatly benefit from 
non-pharmacologic options such as music.  
 
The Speilberger’s  validated tool, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) , is one of the best measured 
tools to evaluate preoperative anxiety . The STAI has been referred to as the “gold standard” in properly  
evaluating preoperative anxiety3. There are two components to this tool; a state portion which evaluates 
the current state of anxiety a patient has  in a clinical setting , and a tra it portion which evaluates how the 
patient generally feels  unrelated to the clinical setting . Each of these sections have 20 items to answer 
and approximately takes 10 -15 minutes to complete. In preoperative anxiety testing, the STAI -S is 
commonly used in research to properly evaluate the level of  preoperative anxiety  in the current clinical 
setting . Marteau and her colleagues have developed a shortened STAI version , the STAI -6, that has also 
been validated  5. The shortened STAI -6 tool has six questions and may be more beneficial to use in a 
high turnover, ambulatory surgical center settin g as it only takes a few minutes to complete.  
 
We will be using the STAI -6 short form questionnaire to score the  preoperative anxiety levels in our 
patient population.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
To determine preoperative anxiety score differences between patients who receive music vs IV 
midazolam during their preoperative nerve block placement . 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (if applicable)  
To evaluate differences in hemodynamics, block times, patient satisfaction scores, provider satisfaction 
scores, evaluation difficulty in communication between provider and patient, and adverse effects between 
both stu dy groups

 3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
This will be a prospective, randomized controlled study . Participants will be randomized to receiving 
research -selected music versus IV midazolam (0.5mg to 2mg max) during their preoperative peripheral 
nerve block placement.  
3.2 Allocation to Interventional Group [if applicable]  
Subjects will be randomized to either music or IV midazolam. Subjects will be randomized in a one to one 
fashion and the randomization will take place using a computer -generated algorithm .  
3.3 Study Measures  
There will be two study groups who will be randomized. 1. Music group:  patients in this group will receive 
research -selected music after the golden moment has been completed  between the patient, provider, and 
nursing staff . 2. Midazolam group:  patients in this group will receive IV midazolam (0.5mg to 2mg max)  
after the golden moment has been completed .  
 
A pre -anxiety score will be obtained using the STAI -6 validated tool after the patient has signed the 
informed consent. After the gold en moment is completed, the intervention will start. Once the nerve block 
is completed, a post anxiety score will be obtained using  STAI -6 validated tool . The post anxiety score will 
be obtained from the start of the anxiolytic intervention in both groups.   
 
For our primary outcome measure, we will use t he short form of the state scale of the Spielberger State -
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI -6) to measure pre procedure and post procedure anxiety levels  (see below) . 
The shortened STAI -6 tool has six questions and may be more beneficial to use in a high turnover, 
ambulatory surgical center setting as it only takes a few minutes to complete.  In the original 20 -item STAI -
State tool, the scores range from 20 to 80. A score greater than 50 on the original 20 -item sc ale is 
associated with a high level of anxiety . The population normal score is approximately 35  (Speilberger 
1983) . In the STAI -6 tool, there are six questions with a Likert  scale from 1 to 4. This gives a score range 
from 6 to 24. To create scores compati ble with the original STAI -S scores, the STAI -6 scores will be 
divided by 6 and multiplied by 20 to give a range from 20 to 80.  
 
 
 
For our secondary outcome measure, we will obtain the following information:  
 
1.  Patient satisfaction scores using  a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)  as follows:  
Music vs Midaz Sedation   Page 8

“Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the WORST  experience possible and 10 is the BEST  
experience possible, what number would you use to rate your overall preoperative experience while 
getting a peripheral nerv e block placed?”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Provider satisfaction scores using a 10 -point visual analogue scale (VAS) as follows:  
 
 “Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the WORST  experience possible and 10 is the BEST  
experience possible, what  number would you use to rate your overall preoperative experience while 
placing a peripheral nerve block for your patient?”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Evaluation of communication difficulties  between provider and patient by asking one  question on 
a 5-point Likert scale : 
 
From provider to patient:  
“I found it difficult to communicate with the patient while doing the preoperative nerve block.”  
A. Strongly Disagree  
B. Disagree  
C. Neutral  
D. Agree  
E. Strongly Agree  
 
From patient to provider:  
“I found it difficult to c ommunicate with the physician while the preoperative nerve block was being 
done on me.”  
A. Strongly Disagree  
B. Disagree  
C. Neutral  
D. Agree  
E. Strongly Agree

 3.4.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary end points will be to determine any differences in patient satisfaction scores, provider 
satisfaction scores, evaluation o f difficulties  in communication between provider and patient, 
hemodynamics, block times, and adverse effects including paresthesia’s, patchy block, failed block, and 
serious adverse effects including bleeding, infection, paralysis, local anesthetic systemi c toxicity between 
both groups.  
 
4 Study Population and Duration of Participation  
The study population will include patients who are >18 years of age, who will give informed consent in 
receiving a peripheral nerve block in the preoperative bay for their pri mary anesthetic and/or for their 
postoperative pain control.  
 
We will exclude the following: patients who have an associated significant psychiatric disorder such as 
anxiety, panic disorder, depression, psychosis, or bipolar disorder; patients who are unab le to give 
informed consent; patients who are pregnant; patients who have an underly ing coagulopathy and 
infection.  
4.1 Duration of Study Participation  
The study duration will be from the time informed consent occurs to after the perioperative  block has been 
completed; after the start of the anxiolytic intervention (music vs IV midazolam). Once the post -anxiety 
STAI -6 score has been obtained, the study is complete.  
4.2 Total Number of Subjects and Sites  
Total number of subjects will be 200; 100 in the music group  and 100 in the IV midazolam group . Study 
will take place at Penn Medicine University City, PMUC.  
4.3 Inclusion Criteria  
Patients who are >18 years of age, who will give informed consent in receiving a peripheral nerve block in 
the preoperative bay for their p rimary anesthetic and/or for th eir postoperative pain control.  
4.4 Exclusion Criteria  
We will exclude the following: patients who have an associated significant psychiatric disorder such as 
anxiety, panic disorder, depression, psychosis, or bipolar disorder; p atients who are unable to give 
informed consent; patients who are pregnant; patients who have an underlying coagulopathy and 
infection , patients with hypersensitivity to midazolam, glaucoma, breastfeeding, history of renal 
impairment, and CO PD, patient wit h anxiety score 50 and over.  
4.5 Subject Recruitment  
All patients will be screened initially either at the preoperative surgical clinic visit or prior to the day of 
surgery via telephone once they are scheduled for surgery. Any patient that cannot be reached will be 
approached in the  preoperative bay during the preoperative period of their planned surgery. Subjects will 
be given the details about the study and given adequate time to read the consent form and talk the study 
over with family that accompanies the m. 
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study.  
5 Study Procedures  
5.1 Screening  
The general flow of the study will be conducted as follows:  
Music vs Midaz Sedation   Page 10 
Version: 2.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
 1. Research coordinator will call or approa ch patients who are scheduled for a surgical 
procedure that is planning for a peripheral nerve block either for the primary anesthetic or for 
postoperative pain control to be placed in the preoperative bay in the ambulatory surgical 
center.  
2. Research coordi nator will discuss the purpose of our study and explain the study in detail for 
the patient. If a patient agrees to participate, then we will have the patient sign the informed 
consent for the study. If patient is on the phone and decides to participate, t he patient will 
sign the informed  consent upon arriving to PMUC.  
5.1.1  Visit  
3. Once the patient signs the informed consent for the peripheral nerve block by anesthesia 
team. The patient randomized will be revealed to either music or IV midazolam. The pre -
procedure  anxiety score will then be obtained using the STAI -6 validated tool.  
4. The golden moment will be conducted between the patient, provider, and nursing staff. Once 
this golden moment is completed, the anxiolytic intervention will start (music or IV 
midazolam) * 
5. The preoperative nerve block will be conducted by the regional anesthesia block team.  
6. Once the nerve block is complete, we will obtain the post -procedure anxiety score using the 
STAI -6 validated tool.  
7. Once the post -procedure anxiety score has been obtain ed, we will also obtain the patient 
satisfaction score, the provider satisfaction score, and the evaluation of any difficulties in 
communication between the provider and patient. After these questions have been obtained, 
the study is complete.  
 
*Research s elected music will be provided for the patient via headphones. When providing music in the 
preoperative period for patients to obtain the anxiolytic benefit (Bradt 2013). There is however limited data 
on utilizing music in the preoperative data while condu cting a procedure.  
 
Patients do not routinely get sedation medication while undergoing a preoperative peripheral nerve block. 
Sedation medication is administered based on provider preference. This decision is made on a case by 
case basis. If sedation medic ation is used, IV midazolam is the  common medication used. The IV 
midazolam dosage for preoperative anxiolysis ranges from 0.5mg to 2mg max.  
 
Peripheral nerve blocks are conducted under ultrasound guidance according to standard practice at 
PMUC.  
 
Vital sig ns such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are routinely 
obtained as a part of standard of care if sedation medication is used and when peripheral nerve blocks 
are placed.  
 
Starting block time and ending block time are r outinely obtained as a part of the patient record.  
 
 
During this entire process, patient demographics, hemodynamics (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen 
saturation, and respiratory rate), block times (start and end time), and any adverse effects including 
paresthesia’s, patchy block, failed block, and serious adverse effects including bleeding, infection, 
paralysis, local anesthetic systemic toxicity will be recorded as the routine part of practice.

 5.2 Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study a t any time without impact to their care . They may also be 
discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to intervention or 
study procedures or AEs. It will be documented whether or not  each subject completes the  study. 
5.2.1  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Data will still be collected for subjects who withdrawal from the study. In cases where subjects wish to 
withdrawn PHI consent they will be able to do so by telling a study team member in person or through 
information provided on the ICF.  
5.3 Safety Evaluation  
When evaluating safety, the doctors will look at any reported AE’s as well as patients who are unwilling or 
unable to adhere to the randomized allocation. If patients in either group have more than  25% deviation 
rate the inclusion and exclusion as well as block method will be reevaluated to better limit deviations.  
 
6 Statistical Plan  
6.1 Sample Size and Power Determination  
Based  on a previous  study  by Bringman  et.al.  the mean  (SD) of STAI  anxiety  score  is  34(8)  4. A clinically  
meaningful  decrease , as determ ined by the Cochrane  review  group  was 0.5 of SD.1,6 Our sample  size 
calculation  to detect a 4 -point change in pain score (p less than 0.05 significance level) was 86 patients  
(=0.05, power=90%). We will inflate out  sample size by 15% to account for any missing data or any 
withdrawal from the study ; therefore, ou r estimated sample size will be 100 patients  per group.  
6.2 Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be performed using STATA 13 statistical software (Dalla s, TX). Demographic or 
other categorical data will be analyzed using T test or Fishers exact test as appropriate. Repeated 
measurements ( STAI -6 scores ) will be analyzed by using the t -test or Mann -Whitney U -test as 
appropriate. Normally distributed data wi ll be presented as means ± SE of the mean (SEM), non -normally 
distributed data are presented as medians ± quartiles (interquartile range) and categorical data will be 
presented as raw data and as frequencies. The alpha level for all analys es was set as P l ess than 0.05.  
6.2.1  Baseline Data  
Demographic or other categorical data will be analyzed using T test or Fishers exact test as appropriate.  
6.2.2  Analysis of Primary Outcome of Interest  
Repeated measurements (STAI -6 scores) will be analyzed by using the t -test or Man n-Whitney U -test as 
appropriate . 
 
7 Safety and Adverse Events  
This section provides the safety management plans for the study. This section should be consistent with 
the Penn IRB guidelines tailored to the requirements specific for each study. It should desc ribe how 
safety reporting will be monitored and take place over the course of the trial.  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1  Adverse Event  
Study definition of an adverse event (AE). Can include the Penn IRB definition of an adverse event unless 
there are some differences in the adverse event definitions for this particular study. Standard definition of 
an adverse event as follows:

 An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent il lnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
7.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
7.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptom s, 
procedures results will be recorded in the source document.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that  the study intervention or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and i s considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be 
recorded and reported.  
7.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The PI will supervise the assessment of relationship of each adverse even to the study procedures. The 
adverse events, if such occurs, will be classified as definitely related, probably related, possibly related, 
unlikely or unrelated.  
7.4 Reporting of  Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
The Investigator will promptly notify the Penn IRB of all on -site unanticipa ted, Adverse Events that are 
related to the research activity. Other unanticipated problems related to the research involving risk to 
subjects or others will also be reported promptly. Written reports will be filed using the HS -ERA and in 
accordance with t he Penn IRB timeline of 10 working days.  
7.4.1  Follow -up R eport  
If an AE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reass essed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAEs are followed until either resolved or stable.  
7.4.2  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The PI, Dr. Graff and  her collaborator Dr. Nabil Elkassabany will be responsible for data safety and 
monitoring. All paper data will be kept in a locked cabinet in the MD collaborator’s office. The PI and

 collaborators will perform safety reviews after 25 patients are enrolled . Any protocol -related problem or 
deviation will be reported to Dr. Graff and/or Dr. Nabil Elkassabany as soon as possible.  
 
8 Study Administration, Data Handling and Record Keeping  
8.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential a nd managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revo kes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject  
Study date will be stored on a  Penn institutionally secured and managed server specific to th e 
Anesthesiology Department in a locked folder only for this protocol.  
8.2 Data Collection and Management  
Demographic information will be collected from patient charts. Information about sedation onset, block 
start and stop as well as survey information will  be captured on paper that will be stored on Penn campus 
in secured building in locked office in locked filing cabinets.  Subjects will be given a study number at time 
of enrollment.  De-identified data will be inputted  into a  department and folder password secured excel 
sheet.  
Once study analysis is complete identifiable information linking subject to study number will be destroyed/ 
deleted.  
8.3 Records Retention  
Records will be retained up to 3 years after the completion of research. Electronic records of direc tly 
collected data will subsequently be destroyed from electronic server.  
 
9 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
9.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The study will be monitored by  Dr. Graff and Dr. Elkassabany.  
9.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit s tudy-related monitoring, au dits, and inspections by the IRB, government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, stud y data etc.).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities . 
10 Ethical Considerations  
Study will be submitted to the Penn IRB for approval before study enrollment begins. Any changes to the 
protocol will we preapproved by the IRB before any changes to study practice is made.  
10.1 Risks  
The risks of the study are related to the administration of midazolam which include tenderness and pain 
during injection at IV site.  This risk is addressed in the local block con sent form and thus is not putting 
subjects at a greater risk.

 10.2 Benefits  
The individual subjects may not receive any benefit from participating in this study. Potential benefit could 
be increased relaxation and lower anxiety from music sedation or midazolam.  For the study population 
this study hopes to prove that non medicinal sedation is adequate for subject comfort and a decrease in 
anesthetics can be achieved.  
10.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
The potential benefits are greater to the limited risks for patients thus  this study should be conducted.  
10.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their partic ipation in this study.  This consent 
form will be submitted with the protocol fo r review and approval by the IRB for the study.  The formal 
consent of a subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject 
undergoes an y study procedure.  The subject , must sign the consent form, and the investigator -
designated research professional obtaining the consent. Subjects will be consented by the study Principal 
Investigator , or appropriate designee, in perioperative holding room assigne d at check in . Potential 
subjects will review the consent form in detail with the person designated to consent (either PI or CRC) 
and have the ability to review  consent with family or friends that accompanied them to PMUC.   
 
11 Study Finances  
11.1 Funding Source  
This study is not funded.  
11.2 Conflict of Interest

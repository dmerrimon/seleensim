Study Design:   
This is a Phase 2, multi -center, open -label study exploring the activity of SY-1425 in patients 
with relapsed or refractory non -APL AML, or higher -risk MDS, newly diagnosed 
treatment -naïve patients with non -APL AML, who are unli kely to tolerate standard intensive

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)   Confidential  Page 8 of 141 chemotherapy at the time of study entry, and patients with transfusion dependent, lower -risk 
MDS. All patients must be evaluated for the RARA  super -enhancer associated biomarker or the 
associated IRF8 biomarker at the ti me of the study screening evaluation, as determined in 
peripheral blood using an investigational assay. Patients will accrue to each of the six arms 
based on diagnosis (AML, MDS), prior treatment (relapsed/refractory, newly diagnosed 
treatment -naïve unfit AML patients), risk group (higher -risk MDS, lower -risk MDS transfusion 
dependent), and Investigator choice of treatment (SY -1425 single agent, or in combination with 
azacitidine or daratumumab). SY-1425 will be administered at 6 mg/m2/day orally (PO) in tw o 
divided doses, which corresponds to the dose approved in Japan for use of tamibarotene in 
patients with relapsed/refractory APL. SY -1425 will be given on a 28 -day treatment cycle.  
• Arms 1, 2A, and 3: SY -1425 will be administered as a single agent and dos ing will be 
continuous.  
• Arms 2B and 5: Azacitidine will be administered at 75 mg/m2 (intravenously or 
subcutaneously) on Days 1 through 7, daily, of a 28 -day cycle. SY -1425 will be 
administered at 6 mg/m2/day PO in two divided doses on Days 8 through 28 of  a 28-day 
cycle.  
• Arm 4: SY -1425 will be administered at 6 mg/m2/day PO in two divided doses on a 28 -
day treatment cycle. Dosing will be continuous, beginning with a 7 -day lead -in, and then 
administered on a 28 -day treatment cycle. Daratumumab will be admin istered at a dose 
of 16 mg/kg starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses total), followed by 
dosing every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses total), followed by dosing every 4 weeks 
until progression or intolerance.  
The dose of SY -1425 may be increas ed due to unsatisfactory response as early as C2D1 and 
again at C3D1 in consultation with the Sponsor. SY -1425 doses may be increased for AML and 
higher -risk MDS patients to 9 mg/m2/day if a CR/CRi is not achieved at the C2D1 response 
assessment. The dose may be increased one additional dose level to 12 mg/m2/day if a CR/CRi 
is not achieved at the C3D1 response assessment. Doses may be increased for lower -risk MDS 
patients to 9  mg/m2/day at C2D1 if the patient has not reduced their transfusion requirements by 
50% after 4 weeks (C2D1). The dose may be increased one level to either 9 or 12  mg/m2/day 
after Week 8 (C3D1) for lower -risk MDS patients who have not achieved transfusion 
independence but who have achieved a minor erythroid response.  
Patients will be treated with single agent SY-1425, or SY -1425 in combination with azacitidine 
or daratumumab to determine activity, to establish the safety profile of SY-1425 in patients with 
AML and MDS, to explore the hypothesis that patients with the RARA super -enhancer 
associated biomarker or the associated IRF8 biomarker at baseline are responsive to single 
agent SY -1425 or SY -1425 in combination, to establish the pharmacokinetic/ 
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships, and to evaluate the relationship  between the activity 
of single agent SY -1425 or SY -1425 in combination, and baseline level of RARA and IRF8 
biomarkers .  
In AML and higher -risk MDS patients, response will be measured by changes from baseline in 
peripheral blood counts and bone marrow aspirates. Bone marrow aspirates will be collected to 
measure response on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3 (if CR/CRi was not achieved on C2D1), and 4,

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)   Confidential  Page 9 of 141 followed by every third cycle, with additional bone marrow aspirates analyzed as clinically 
indicated based u pon changes in peripheral blood counts, or when it is needed to establish either 
CR or disease progression.  Bone marrow aspirate pathology slides (smears) used to assess 
response should be retained at the sites for up to 5 years or until Sponsor approval t o discard 
samples is provided, whichever is sooner, to support the potential for future analyses.  
In lower -risk MDS patients, response will be measured by changes from baseline in transfusion 
requirements and peripheral blood counts, which will be evaluate d at each study visit.  
Patients may continue to receive study treatment until experiencing unacceptable toxicity, 
disease progression/relapse, decision to pursue post -remission therapy other than SY -1425 
single agent, or SY -1425 in combination with azaciti dine or daratumumab, or the Investigator 
determines it is in the best interest of the patient to discontinue treatment. Newly diagnosed 
AML patients enrolled in Arm  2A who achieve a CR/CRi or PR while on SY -1425 single agent 
treatment and then relapse, or who fail to achieve a CR/CRi or PR after completing at least 4 
cycles of SY -1425 single agent treatment, are eligible to receive SY -1425 in combination with 
azacitidine.  
Lower -risk MDS patients will be withdrawn from the study at week 24 if they do not ha ve at 
least a minor erythroid response defined as either a 50% decrease in transfusion requirements or 
a 50% improvement in hemoglobin concentration per the response criteria,  defined as a 
hemoglobin increase ≥ 0.75g/dL. Lower -risk MDS patients who in the opinion of the 
Investigator are receiving clinical benefit, but do not meet the minor erythroid response criteria 
can remain on study with Sponsor approval. Lower -risk MDS patients who continue past week 
24 will continue to receive treatment until erythroi d relapse (loss of erythroid response), disease 
progression, or unacceptable toxicity.  
An end of treatment (EoT) visit will be conducted for all AML and higher -risk MDS patients 
within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, but prior to the start of any s ubsequent therapies to 
monitor for safety and resolution of adverse events (AEs). For lower -risk MDS patients, the 
EoT visit will also be the end of study visit which will be conducted 30 days after the last dose 
of study drug. All AML and higher -risk MDS patients will be followed every 3 months for 
survival for up to 2 years and patients who are withdrawn prior to relapse will also follow -up 
for event free survival (EFS).  
However, following implementation of Amendment 7, assessments will be performed per 
institutional standard of care for patients enrolled in Arm 2B or Arm 5. Aside from serious 
adverse event (SAE), adverse event of special interest , and Pregnancy and Birth Event 
collection (via the pharmacovigilance safety database) for patients still recei ving study drug in 
Arm 5, the study procedures and data collection outlined in Table  3 will be considered as 
guidance and will no longer be required f or the study or entered into the electronic data capture 
system. Patients in Arm 5 may continue to receive study drug until experiencing unacceptable 
toxicity, disease progression/relapse, decision to pursue post -remission therapy other than 
SY-1425 in com bination with azacitidine, or the Investigator determines it is in the best interest 
of the patient to discontinue treatment.

Statistical Methods:  
For each of Arms 1, 2A, 2B (biomarker positive subset), 3 and 5, an exact 2 -sided 90% 
confidence interval will be calculated for the ORR (Arms 1, 2A, 2B, 5) or TIR (Arm 3). 
Success for Arms 1, 2A and 3 (n=25 each) is achieved if the lower bound of the conf idence 
interval excludes 5%. Assuming a 25% response rate for SY -1425 as a single agent, the power 
for each of these arms of this study is 90.4%. Arm 2B has two subgroups defined by biomarker 
status (n=25 each). Success for the biomarker positive subgroup in Arm 2B is achieved if the 
lower bound of the confidence interval excludes 20%. Assuming a 45% response rate for the 
combination of SY -1425 and azacitidine in biomarker positive patients, the power for this 
subgroup of Arm 2B of the study is 86.6%. Succe ss for Arm 5 (n=25) is achieved if the lower 
bound of the confidence interval excludes 10%. Assuming a 30% response rate for the

Success for the entire Arm 2B population is achieved if the lower bound of the confidence 
interval excludes 20%.  Assuming a 38% response rate for the combination of SY -1425 and 
azacitidine in the entire Arm 2B population, the power for the secondary endpoint of Arm 2B of 
the study is 84.6%.  
The primary endpoint of Arm 4 is safety and tolerability of SY -1425 in combination with 
daratumumab. The sample size is not based on any hypothesis testing but is appropriate for 
studies of this type with a primary focus on safety.  
No adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing across arms will be made.  
ORR is defined as:  
• AML: ORR as determined by the investigator based on the rate of CR/CRi/CRh. 
MLFS, and PR, per the revised IWG AML criteria ( Cheson et al, 2003 , 
Bloomfield   et al, 2018 ). 
• Higher -risk MDS: ORR as determined by the Investigator per the revised IWG AML 
criteria ( Cheson et al, 2003 ) or modified IWG MDS criteria ( Cheson et al, 2006 ).

patients.  
• EFS: defined as time from first treatment until date of documentation of disease 
relapse following CR/CRi, or death, whichever occurs first. If the patient does not 
achieve a CR, EFS is defined as  the point of progression or death, whichever occurs 
first. 
• RFS: defined as time from first objective documentation of CR/CRi (including 
CRh/MLFS for AML patients) or PR until the date of first objective documentation 
of disease relapse or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  
• DOR: defined as time from first date of response (CR/CRi [including CRh/MLFS 
for AML patients]), PR, or HI for MDS patients - if best response) until date of 
relapse.  
• OS: defined as time from first treatment until death from any cause.  
• HI Rate: defined according to the modified IWG response criteria for MDS  
(Cheson et al, 2006 ) as the proportion of patient with a response (lasting at least 
8 weeks) after first treatment.

(a) Screening assessments must be performed within 30 days of study drug administration. Screening assessments may also occur on Day 1 prior to dosing.  
(b) Cycle 5 schedule should be followed for all subsequent cycles.  
(c) If a patient has an SY -1425 dose modification (decrease or increase) to a new dose level (as defined in Section  8.4), a dose adjustment visit must be performed within 8 -15 
days of the dose adjustment. This visit can be combined with another scheduled visit if it is scheduled to occur within that window.  
(d) An EoT visit for AML and Higher -Risk MDS patients should occur within 30 days of the last dose of  study drug, but prior to any subsequent therapies. For Lower -Risk MDS 
patients the EoT visit will also be the end of study visit and should occur 30 days after the last dose of study drug (+/ - 5 days).  
(e) AML and Higher -Risk MDS patients will enter post -treatment follow -up. Visits should occur every 3 months post EoT for response assessment and overall survival. These 
visits may be conducted by phone. Follow -up visit window is +/ - 14 days.  
(f) Weight will be measured at each visit. Weight will be used to calculat e BSA to determine dosing requirements. BSA used for dosing calculations should be updated if the 
weight changes more than 15%.  
(g) Safety laboratory assessments are outlined in Section  7.2 of the protocol and will be performed locally.

(m) Low-risk MDS patients in Arm 3 only.  
(n) Peripheral blood sample will be sent to a central lab for assessment of RARA  super -enhancer associated biomarker and IRF8 biomarker at screening to c onfirm eligibility. 
Other associated RARA  pathway genes will also be analyzed.  
(o) All patients will have a peripheral blood sample collected at screening for ChIP -sequencing analysis to be performed at a central lab (assuming sufficient material is available 
at time of sample processing).  
(p) For U.S. only: All patients will have a whole blood sample collected at screening (same collection time as the biomarker asse ssment) for additional biomarker research.

least two hours apart. A subset of approximately 15 patients, sufficient to obtain PK evaluable results from at least 10 pati ents, will have  more intensive sampling [pre -dose 
(0h), and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post -dose] on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1, and will have sparse sampling on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4 at two time points at leas t 2 hours 
apart. If a patient’s SY -1425 dose is modified  to a different dose level (see Section  8.4) during the course of the study, PK sampling should occur within 8 -15 days of the dose 
adjustment following the same schedule as Cycle 1 Day 1 (either intensive or sparse depending on which PK sampling schedule o riginally enrolled under).  
(r) Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion PGx sample to be taken pre -dose.  
(s) Peripheral blood will b e collected in all patients on Day 1 of Cycle 1 pre -dose and 5 -8 hours post -dose, on Day 15 of Cycle 1, and at EoT visit to determine changes in RNA 
including dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR family) member 3 (DHRS3). This sample should be collected in the sam e procedural timeframe as the corresponding PK sample.  
(t) Peripheral blood collected for central analysis of CD38 and myeloid marker immunophenotyping on Days 1 (pre -dose), 8 and 15 of Cycle 1; Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, followed 
by every third cycle (7, 10, 1 3, etc); and EoT. Collected only for patients enrolled under Amendment 4 or a subsequent protocol amendment.  
(u) Cytogenetics and mutational analysis will be performed at screening and at the EoT visit. Cytogenetics and mutational analyse s will be performed lo cally. These analyses are 
performed on bone marrow for AML and Higher -Risk MDS patients, and on peripheral blood for Lower -Risk MDS patients.  
(v) Bone marrow aspirates will be collected to assess response in AML and Higher -Risk MDS patients on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, followed by every third cycle (7, 10, 13, etc.), 
and as clinically indicated. If a patient achieved a CR/CRi at Cycle 2 Day 1, the Cycle 3 Day 1 bone marrow aspirate is not r equired. A bone marrow aspirate should be 
collected to confirm relapse wh ich will be recorded as an end of treatment sample and will be used for cytogenetics assessment. For patients enrolled in Arm  2A, an 
unscheduled bone marrow aspirate may be required to support eligibility to receive treatment with SY -1425 in combination wi th azacitidine after relapse/unsatisfactory 
response with single agent SY -1425.  
(w) Bone marrow aspirate samples will be collected for immunophenotyping to measure myeloid differentiation markers and will be a nalyzed locally at screening and when 
aspirates are  performed to assess response [see footnote (v), above]. Immunophenotyping may also be performed when clinically indicated on peripheral blood to measure

PGx = pharmacogeno mics; PK = pharmacokinetic; RBC = red blood cell; RARA = retinoic acid receptor alpha; SAE = serious adverse event.  
(a) Screening assessments must be performed within 30 days of study drug administration, and may occur on Day 1 prior to dosing. Screening asses sments are not required for 
patients in Arm 2A who receive SY -1425 in combination with azacitidine after relapse/unsatisfactory response with single agent SY -1425.  
(b) Cycle 5 schedule should be followed for all subsequent cycles. Following implementation of A mendment 7, assessments will be performed per institutional standard of 
care for patients enrolled in Arm 5. Aside from SAE , AESI, and Pregnancy and Birth Event collection (via the pharmacovigilance safety database) for patients still 
receiving study drug in Arm 5, the study procedures and data collection outlined in Table  3 will be considered as guidance and will no longer be required for the 
study or entered into the electronic data capture system.  
(c) If a patient has an SY -1425 dose modification (decrease or increase) to a new dose level (as defined in Section  8.4), a dose adjustment visit must be performed within 8 -15 
days of the dose adjustment. This visit can be combined with another scheduled visit if it is scheduled to oc cur within that window.  
(d) An EoT visit should occur within 30 days of the last dose of study drug and prior to any subsequent therapies.  
(e) Patients will enter post -treatment follow -up. Visits should occur every 3 months post EoT for response assessment and ove rall survival. These visits may be conducted by 
phone. Follow -up visit window is ±14 days. Following implementation of Amendment 7, no further collection of post -treatment follow -up data will occur for patients 
enrolled in Arm 2B or Arm 5; patient follow -up should continue per institutional standard of care.  
(f) Weight will be used to calculate BSA to determine dosing requirements. BSA used for dosing calculations should be updated if the weight changes more than 15%.  
(g) Safety laboratory assessments are outlined in Section  7.2 and will be performed locally.  
(h) A pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed for women of childbearing potential during screening, on Day 1 of each cy cle, and at EoT.  
(i) ECG on Cycle 1 Day 8 must be performed prior to dosing. All other ECGs can be taken at any time during the study visit. All ECGs will be done as triplicate 12 -lead ECGs.  
(j) SAEs will be captured from the time of signing of the informed consent through 30 days after last dose of any study drug, and  non-serious AEs from the time of first dose of 
any study drug throu gh 30 days after last dose of any study drug.  Following implementation of Amendment 7, see footnote (b) for safety event collection instructions for 
patients still  receiving study drug in Arm 5.  
(k) All transfusions received by the patient from 16 weeks prior to enrolment until the EoT visit will be recorded.  
(l) Subsequent therapies will be recorded for 3 months after the last dose of study drug or until implementation of Amendment 7 for patients enrolled in Arm 2B or Arm 5 . 
(m) If dosing on Days 6 and 7 is not possible due to logistical limitations, these doses may be delayed to Days 8 and 9.  
(n) Peripheral blood samples will be sent to a central lab for assessment of RARA  super -enhancer associated biomarker and IRF8 biomarker at screening. Other associated RARA  
pathway genes will also be analyzed.  
(o) All patients will have peripheral blood sample collected at screening for biomarker sequencing analysis to be performed at a central la b (assuming sufficient material is 
available at time of sample processing).  
(p) For U.S. only: All patients will have a whole blood sample collected at screening (same collection time as the biomarker asse ssment) for additional biomarker research.  
(q) All patients  will have PK sampling on Day 8 of Cycle 1 at 2 -4 hours and at 5 -8 hours post -dose. PK sampling also on Day 22 of Cycle 1, and on Day 8 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4 at 
two time points at least 2  hours apart. If a patient's SY -1425 dose is modified to a different dose level (see Section  8.4) during the course of the study, PK sampling should 
occur within 8 -15 days of dose adjustment following the same schedule as Cycle 1 Day 8. PK sampling is not required for patients in Arm 2A who receive SY -1425 in 
combination with azacitidine after relapse/unsatisfactory response with single agent SY -1425.  
(r) Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion PGx sample to be taken Cycle 1 Day 1 pre -dose. PGx sample is not required for patients in A rm 2A who receive SY -1425 in 
combination with azacitidine after relapse/unsatisfactory response with single agent SY -1425.  
(s) Peripheral blood will be collected in patients in Arms 2A and 2B on Day 1 of Cycle 1 pre -dose, on Day 8 of Cycle 1 pre -dose and 5 to 8 hours post -dose, on Day 22 of 
Cycle  1, and at EoT visit to determine changes in RNA including dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR family) member 3 (DHRS3). This sample should be collected in the same 
procedural timeframe as the corresponding PK sample. PD sampl ing is not required for patients in Arm 2A who receive SY -1425 in combination with azacitidine after 
relapse/unsatisfactory response with single agent SY -1425.  
(t) Cytogenetics and mutational analysis will be performed at screening and at the EoT visit. Cytoge netics and mutational analyses will be performed locally.  
(u) Bone marrow aspirates will be collected to assess morphologic response and minimal residual disease on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, followed by every third cycle (7, 10, 13, 
etc.), and as clinically ind icated. If a patient achieved a CR/CRi at Cycle 2 Day 1, the Cycle 3 Day 1 bone marrow aspirate is not required. A bone marro w aspirate should be

(a) Screening assessments must be performed within 30 days of study drug administration. Screening assessments may also occur on Day -7 prior to dosing.  
(b) Cycle 7 schedule should be followed for all subsequent cycles.  
(c) If a patient has an SY -1425 dose modification (decrease or increase) to a new dose level (as defined in Section  8.4), a dose adjustment visit must be performed within 8 -15 
days of the dose adjustment. This visit can be combined with another scheduled visit if i t is scheduled to occur within that window.  
(d) An EoT visit should occur within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, but prior to any subsequent therapies.  
(e) Patients will enter post -treatment follow -up. Visits should occur every 3 months post EoT for resp onse assessment and overall survival. These visits may be conducted by 
phone. Follow -up visit window is +/ - 14 days.  
(f) Weight will be used to calculate BSA to determine dosing requirements. BSA used for SY -1425 dosing calculations should be updated if the we ight changes more than 15%. 
Daratumumab dose will be calculated based on the patient’s weight at Cycle 1 Day 1 rounded to the nearest kilogram. The dose of daratumumab will remain constant 
throughout the study unless the patient’s weight changes more than 10%.  
(g) Safety laboratory assessments are outlined in Section  7.2 of the protocol and will be performed locally. Based on emerging safety information f or daratumumab, patients 
enrolled into Arm 4 prior to the Syros administrative letter dated 26 December 2018 who had been receiving daratumumab for le ss than 6 months as of that date, an HBV 
serology test should be performed at the next scheduled visit. Pa tients with resolved infection (ie, patients who are HBsAg negative but positive for antiHBs or antiHBc)

SY-1425 (tamibarotene)   
 
Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)  Confidential  Page 38 of 141 should also have HBV DNA PCR test performed. The Sponsor should be consulted to determine the clinical management of patients  who are either seropositi ve for HBV 
(defined by a positive test for HBsAg) or PCR positive for HBV.  
(h) A pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be completed for women of child bearing  potential during screening, on Day -7 (pre -dose), on Day 1 of each cycle visit, and at EoT.  
(i) For patients with COPD, FEV1 should be measured. Symptom and disease directed exams should be performed as clinically indicat ed during the treatment phase.  
(j) ABO, R h and IAT will be assessed. A wallet card with the patient’s blood type and IAT will be provided to patients.  
(k) ECG on Day -7 must be performed prior to dosing. All other ECGs can be taken at any time during the study visit. All ECGs will be done as  triplica te 12 -lead ECGs.  
(l) Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse) measured in sitting position. On Cycle 1 Day 1: before the start of daratumu mab infusion; at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3.5 hours after the 
start of the infusion; at the end of the infusion; 0.5 and 1 hour after the end of the infusion. For all other infusions, vital signs will be measured before infusion starts and at the 
end of the infusion.  
(m) SAEs will be captured from the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form through 30 days after last dose of any study drug, and non -serious AEs from the time of first 
dose of any study drug through 30 days after last dose of any study drug.  
(n) All transfusions received by the patient from 16 weeks prior to enrollment until the EoT visit will be recorded.  
(o) Subsequen t therapies will be recorded for 3 months after the last dose of study drug.  
(p) Administer pre -infusion medications approximately 1 to 3 hours before daratumumab infusion. One hour prior to infusion is preferred, however , PO pre -infusion medications 
may be ad ministered within 3 hours before the infusion. Includes acetaminophen (650 -1000 mg), antihistamine (diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg, or equivalent), 
methylprednisolone (100 mg or equivalent for the first 2 doses, and 60 mg for all subsequent doses in the absence of infusion related reactions in the first 2 doses), and a 
leukotriene inhibitor (bronchospasm prophylaxis is optional with first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 only for patients considered at risk for bronchospasm). See Section  8.2.3.2.1 . 
(q) All subjects will receive oral methylprednisolone (20 mg or equivalent) on the 2 days following all daratumumab infusions (be ginning the day after the infusion). In the 
absence of infusion related AEs after the first 3 infusions, post -infusion corticosteroids should be administered per investigator discretion. Post -infusion medications may also 
include antihistamine (diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg, or equivalent), leukotriene inhi bitor, short -acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist (e.g. salbutamol aerosol), and control 
medications for lung disease (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids ± long-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonists for patients with asthma; long -acting bronchodilators such as  
tiotropium or salmeterol ±  inhaled corticosteroids for patients with COPD). See Section 8.2.3.2.2 . 
(r) Peripheral blood sample will be sent to a cent ral lab for assessment of RARA  super -enhancer associated biomarker and IRF8 biomarker at screening to confirm eligibility. 
Other associated RARA  pathway genes will also be analyzed.  
(s) All patients will have a whole blood sample collected at screening (same c ollection time as the biomarker assessment) for additional biomarker research.  
(t) SY-1425 PK: All patients will have PK sampling pre -dose (0h), and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post -dose on Days -7 and -4. If a patient’s SY -1425 dose is modified to a different 
dose level (see Section  8.4) during the course of the study, PK sampling should occur within 8 -15 days of the dose adjustment following the same sche dule as Day -7. 
(u) Daratumumab PK: All patients will have PK sampling on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to infusion (0h) and prior to the end of infusion ( 5-10 mins before end of infusion), and on 
Cycle 1 Day 8 prior to infusion (0h).  
(v) Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion PGx sample to be taken pre -dose.  
(w) Peripheral blood will be collected in all patients on Day -7 pre -dose and 5 -8 hours post -dose, on Day 8 of Cycle 1, and at EoT visit to determine changes in RNA including 
dehydrogenase/re ductase (SDR family) member 3 (DHRS3). This sample should be collected in the same procedural timeframe as the corresponding PK sample.  
(x) Peripheral blood collected for central analysis of CD38 and myeloid marker immunophenotyping on Days -7 (pre -dose) and -4; Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1; Day 1 of Cycles 
2, 3, 4, followed by every third cycle (7, 10, 13, etc); and EoT. For timepoints on days on which daratumumab is administered , collection is performed prior to daratumumab 
dosing.  
(y) Cytogenetics and mutational  analysis will be performed at screening and at the EoT visit. Cytogenetics and mutational analyses will be performed locally.   
(z) Bone marrow aspirates will be collected to assess response on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, followed by every third cycle (7, 10, 13, etc.), and as clinically indicated. If a patient 
achieved a CR/CRi at Cycle 2 Day 1, the Cycle 3 Day 1 bone marrow aspirate is not required. A bone marrow aspirate should be collected to confirm relapse which will be 
recorded as an end of treatment sam ple and will be used for cytogenetics assessment  
(aa) Bone marrow aspirate samples will be collected for immunophenotyping to measure myeloid differentiation markers and will be a nalyzed centrally at screening and when 
aspirates are performed to assess response  [see footnote (y), above]. Immunophenotyping may also be performed locally when clinically indicated on peripheral blood and/ or 
bone marrow aspirate to measure myeloid differentiation markers.

1.1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome  
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia in adults ( Ferrara and Schiffer, 
2013 ) with an estimate of 20,830 new cases (4 new cases per 100,000) diagnosed in the United 
States (US) in 2015 ( SEER data, 2016 ). Current treatment paradigms in younger patients  
(< 60  years) include inducti on regimens of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy (cytarabine and an 
anthracycline) and consolidation with additional chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. While complete remission (CR) may be achieved initially in over 80% of 
patients,  the 5 -year overall survival is 35% to 40%. In older patients with AML (≥ 60 years), 
where the objectives of treatment are more commonly palliative, the use of hypomethylating 
agents may extend survival, but cure rates are very low. The estimated number of  AML deaths in 
the US in 2015 was 10,460 with the percent of overall patients surviving 5 years reported at 
25.9% ( SEER data, 2016 ).  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous hematopoietic disease commonly 
associated with bone marrow failure, peri pheral blood cytopenias and associated complications 
of anemia, infection or hemorrhage, and progression to AML. The incidence of MDS is similar 
to that of AML, and is estimated at approximately 5 per 100,000, representing the most 
commonly diagnosed myelo id neoplasm in the US and Europe ( Cogle et al, 2014 ). While MDS 
is generally a more indolent disease, early on lower -risk MDS patients commonly experience 
cytopenias with associated complications of anemia, infections, and/or b leeding. The prognosis 
of patients with later stage MDS is poor, and associated with low overall survival, similar to 
AML. Currently available therapies for MDS in the US include hypomethylating agents and 
lenalidomide which may limit the clinical impact o f MDS. However, there remains unmet 
medical need for new agents that can extend survival and improve quality of life in patients with 
MDS ( DeZern, 2015 ). 
1.2. SY-1425  
SY-1425 (tamibarotene) is an orally available, synthetic retinoid ap proved in Japan (Amnolake® 
Tablets) since April 2005 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Acute Promyelocytic 
Leukemia (APL) whose disease is characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation or 
expression of the PML -RARα gene. Tamibaroten e was designed to be a more potent and 
selective retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) agonist with significantly improved in vivo  
pharmacologic properties compared to all -trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a component of the 
current first -line treatment of APL in the US. In vitro , tamibarotene is approximately 10 -fold 
more potent than ATRA. It has a lower affinity for cellular retinoic acid binding protein, the 
overexpression of which is associated with resistance to ATRA, and is not subject to the 
predominant rout e of retinoid metabolism by Cyp26A1. These two features likely contribute to 
the sustained plasma levels of tamibarotene with repeated dosing. Furthermore, tamibarotene is a 
selective RAR  agonist, whereas ATRA is a non -selective agonist of RAR ,  and , and can 
isomerize in vivo  to bind Retinoid X and peroxisome proliferator -activated receptors. This 
selectivity may provide SY -1425 a distinct and favorable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile.

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 54 of 141 1.2.1.  Preclinical Data  
1.2.1.1.  Mechanism of Action  
SY-1425 is a potent and selective small molecule agonist of the RARα. Retinoic acid receptors 
are transcription factors that act as transcriptional repressors in the unbound state and as 
transcriptional activators when bound by an agonist ligand. As previously describe d in the 
context of APL with the t(15;17) PML -RARα translocation, RARα agonist binding relieves 
pathogenic repression of myeloid differentiation, enabling normalization of myelopoiesis and 
terminal differentiation of tumor cells.  
Super -enhancers (SEs) have  recently been identified as exceptionally large clustered enhancer 
regions in the human genome, which are densely occupied by transcription factors, cofactors and 
chromatin regulators. They have been implicated in directing gene expression programs that 
define cell identity and also regulate oncogenes important in the pathogenesis of cancer. Syros 
has used genome wide profiling of AML patient samples to identify a SE at the RARA  gene locus 
regulating expression of the RARA  gene in a subset of non -APL AML p rimary patient samples. 
This SE leads to upregulation of RARα mRNA levels  and defines a novel subset of AML that 
Syros found to be uniquely responsive to SY -1425 in vitro and in vivo . In non -APL AML cell 
lines, SY -1425 inhibited the proliferation of cells containing the RARA  SE and high RARα 
transcript levels, but not in those without. Furthermore, in these sensitive cell lines genes 
consistent with promotion of differentiation were upregulated in response to SY -1425, similar to 
the RARα agonist response in  APL. In patient -derived xenograft (PDX) models, tumor growth 
was inhibited and survival prolonged in those containing high levels of RARα mRNA expression 
but not in PDX models whose tumor cells contained low levels of RARα mRNA. These PDX 
models with high level s of RARα mRNA also demonstrated an increase in differentiated cell 
number and diversity, with a reduction of blasts in both peripheral blood and bone marrow with 
SY-1425 treatment. A similar correlation was made with the SE strength and mRNA levels of 
Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) which is a downstream nuclear effector of the interferon 
pathway known to have cross talk with RARα signaling.  
These studies indicate that RARα mRNA levels and mRNA levels for other RARα pathway -
associated genes, such as  IRF8, may be potential biomarkers for response to SY -1425. Analysis 
of a public mRNA expression data set derived from MDS patient samples further indicates that 
similar to AML, MDS contains a subpopulation of patients with significantly elevated mRNA for 
RARα . Moreover, SE analysis has confirmed that MDS patient cells contain a RARA  SE of 
comparable magnitude to those in AML, thus extending the potential for SY -1425 therapeutic 
use to MDS.  
These data lead to the hypothesis that the presence of a SE at the RARA  gene and concomitant 
high levels of RARα mRNA expression (along with the RARα pathway associated gene IRF8) in 
AML and MDS patients predicts for response to SY -1425 treatment.  
1.2.1.2.  Safety Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacokinetic Studies  
The nonclinic al safety assessment indicated that the activity and toxicity profile of tamibarotene 
is qualitatively similar to other retinoids, a class for which there is extensive nonclinical and 
clinical experience. No novel toxicities have been identified for tamiba rotene. In addition, the

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 55 of 141 hematopoietic effects noted with tamibarotene appear to be less than those observed with other 
retinoids suggesting that tamibarotene may be better tolerated.  
A battery of safety pharmacology studies was conducted for the evaluatio n of the potential 
effects of tamibarotene on the nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and gastrointestinal 
systems in mice, rats and/or dogs. No major pharmacologic effects were identified in the safety 
pharmacology studies.  
In single dose studies with tamibarotene, the maximum tolerated nonlethal dose was 200 mg/kg 
and ≥100 mg/kg in the rat and dog, respectively. The LD50 in the rat was calculated to be 
~342  mg/kg.  
A series of genotoxicity studies were conducted with tamibarotene. Tamibarotene was negative 
for mutagenicity in a bacterial revertant mutation assay and negative for clastogenicity in an in 
vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Tamibarotene was positive for clastogenicity in a Chinese 
Hamster Lung cell assay at the highest concentration tested (86 μg/mL) without S9 activation but 
negative in the presence of S9 metabolic activation.  
Repeat oral dose toxicity studies have been conducted for up to 26 and 39 weeks in rats and 
dogs, respectively, at doses up to 0.4 mg/kg/day. The duration of the chro nic toxicity studies is 
sufficient to support the proposed duration of dosing in the Phase 2 clinical trial. The spectrum of 
toxicities observed with tamibarotene are similar to other retinoids. Test article -related effects 
were noted in bone, testes, vagi nal and uterine epithelium, gastrointestinal tract, skin and 
mucocutaneous junctions. Clinical pathology alterations included effect on white blood cell 
(WBC) differential (increased neutrophils), serum proteins and liver enzymes. Similar findings 
have bee n described in humans, supporting the appropriateness of rat and dog for the evaluation 
of tamibarotene. As anticipated with retinoids, tamibarotene exhibited reproductive toxicity 
including teratogenicity.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of tamibarotene, inc luding absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion, has been evaluated primarily in rats and dogs following single and repeat dose oral 
and/or IV studies in which radiolabeled drug was administered. Pharmacokinetics in rats and 
dogs suggest that ab sorption following oral administration is relatively rapid in both species with 
time of maximum concentration (t max) in the 1 -2 hour range. The oral absorption in male rat was 
estimated as 67%. Plasma radioactivity levels at maximum plasma concentration (C max), area 
under the curve (AUC) and 24 hours after dosing suggested accumulation from Day 1 to Day 7 
of dosing. Whole body autoradiography studies in rats showed peak tissue radioactivity 
concentrations were observed within 1 hour post -dose for the majori ty of tissues and decreased 
over the 168 hours post -dose. The greatest concentration of radioactivity at 1 hour after dosing 
was observed in the liver, which was approximately 12 times higher than in the plasma. Levels 
of radioactivity in the adrenals, sma ll intestine, kidney, duodenum, stomach, esophagus, 
Harderian gland, and brown fat were approximately 1.4 to 4.3 times higher than the levels in the 
plasma. Placental transfer of tamibarotene -related material was observed in pregnant rats with 
fetal liver showing the highest level of radioactivity.  
Protein binding was extensive in the rat, dog, and human plasma with binding ≥ 98.7%. Protein 
binding appeared to be independent of concentration and was also determined to be reversible. 
Tamibarotene was predom inantly bound to serum albumin in the dog and human plasma with 
lesser amounts bound to γ -globulins (dog and human) and human α 1-acid glycoprotein.

based on protein -binding characteristics.  
In vitro metabolism studies of tamibarotene conducted with human liver microsomes 
demonstrated extensive metabolism of the parent compound and the generation of two major 
metabolites, M -3 (6-hydroxy -tamibarotene) and M -4 (7-hydroxy -tamibarotene). The data also 
suggest that tamibarotene is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of concomitantly 
administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP enzymes, but that the PK profile of 
tamibarotene may be altered by CYP 3A4 inhibitors and inducers.  
The predominant moiety in the plasma of rats and dogs was the parent compound. There are 
potentially two major metabolic pathways in the rat. For the first potential major pathway, 
tamibarotene undergoes 6 - or 7-hydroxylation t o yield the related hydroxy -tamibarotene (M -3 or 
M-4). The hydroxylated tamibarotene is subsequently converted to oxo -tamibarotene (M -5 or 
M-7). For the second potential major pathway, tamibarotene undergoes hydrolysis of the 
carboxamide bond to yield tetr ahydro -tetramethyl -naphthylamine and terephthalic acid. Taurine 
conjugates of tamibarotene, M -3, and M -4 (M -6, M -1, and M -2, respectively) are also formed. 
Excretion patterns following oral administration of radiolabeled tamibarotene were comparable 
for ra ts and dogs, with the primary route of excretion in the feces and the majority of the 
radioactive dose being excreted within the first 24 hours after dosing. Data generated in bile 
duct-cannulated rats dosed intraduodenally with bile from treated rats indi cated that tamibarotene 
and its metabolites underwent extensive enterohepatic recirculation. Lacteal secretion of 
tamibarotene -related material was observed in rat with milk:plasma ratios of between 13 - and 
94-fold. Unchanged tamibarotene was the major dru g-related component in milk, with small 
amounts of M -6 and tetrahydro -tetramethyl -naphthylamine also detected.

In Japan, the recommended dose of tamibarotene for the treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory APL is 6 mg/m2/day administered as divided doses after breakfast and dinner. 
Approximately 1400 patients were treated with tamibarotene in clinical trials and in the post 
marketing approval setting. The Japanese approval is based on dat a from two Phase 2 studies, the 
Koseisho study ( Tobita et al, 1997 ) and the TOS -80T-003 study (Amnolake® label). In the two 
Phase 2 clinical studies conducted with tamibarotene, 63 efficacy evaluable APL patients, who 
were either naïve to treatment (5 patients) or who had relapsed following a complete response 
with ATRA (58 patients), received tamibarotene (6  mg/m2/day; range 3 to 12 mg/m2/day) for up 
to 8 weeks. Overall, 60% of patients had a complete response to treatment. The TO S-80T-003 
study enrolled 42 Japanese patients with APL. Of 39 efficacy evaluable patients, 5 individuals 
were APL -treatment naïve and 34 had been treated previously with ATRA. Tamibarotene was 
also administered orally (PO) at a dose of 6 mg/m2/day for eigh t weeks (range; 3 to 
12 mg/m2/day). The overall complete response rate in these patients was 61.5%. In patients who 
were in first relapse following ATRA therapy, the complete response rate was 81%, compared to 
those in second or more relapse who had a 31% complete response rate. Most of the adverse 
events (AEs) seen were mild and typical of this class of drugs and the incidence of AEs was 
similar across the dose range tested. AEs included dry skin, skin rash, headache, bone pain, fever 
and elevated blood te sts for cholesterol, lipids (triglycerides), liver function enzymes and WBC 
counts. Retinoic Acid Syndrome was reported in three patients (7.3%). Thus, tamibarotene was 
shown to be safe, well tolerated and efficacious in the Japanese population with 
relaps ed/refractory APL.

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 58 of 141 In the US, tamibarotene activity was evaluated by another sponsor in patients with relapsed or 
refractory APL following treatment with ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO). A Phase 2 trial was 
conducted at eight clinical sites in the US, Ital y and Spain. A total of 14 patients, 12 of whom 
relapsed following ATRA and ATO and 2 of whom were refractory to ATRA and ATO and 
other chemotherapeutic agents, received treatment with tamibarotene ( Sanford et al, 2015 ). 
Patients  were dosed 6 mg/m2 daily for 56 days for induction then every other month as 
consolidation therapy for 1 year. The overall response rate (ORR) was 64% (n=9), the rate of 
complete cytogenetic response was 43% (n=6) and the rate of complete molecular respon se was 
21% (n=3). After induction, 5 (36%) patients achieved a CR, 4 (29%) achieved a CR with 
incomplete recovery of counts (CRi) and 5 (36%) had resistant disease. Six (43%) patients who 
achieved a CR (n = 3) or CRi (n = 3) achieved a complete cytogenetic  response at a median time 
of 43 d after starting treatment (range 28 –120 d). Seven of the 9 responders relapsed after a 
median of 4.6 months (range 1.6 -26.8 months). The median event -free survival (EFS) was 
3.5 months and the median overall survival was 9 .5 months. Adverse events reported in greater 
than 20% of the patients included rash, infection, headache, diarrhea, neutropenia, insomnia, 
oropharyngeal pain, dry skin and syncope. All of these events were Grade 1 or 2 except for 
neutropenia (Grade 2 -4). The overall response rate of CR + CRi was 64% (9/14) in this APL 
study and was consistent with that observed in the Japanese Phase 2 studies. It is also notable 
that these patients were more heavily pre -treated (median of two prior remissions and failure o f 
both ATRA and ATO).  
In China, a recent report ( Wang et al, 2015 ) describes a phase 3, randomized, open -label, 
parallel -group, active -controlled, multicenter, study of 56 days treatment duration evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of 6 mg/m2/day tamibarotene versus 25 mg/m2/day ATRA, each in 
combination with ATO (0.15 mg/kg/day) in patients with relapsed APL. Patients were randomly 
assigned to ATRA + ATO (n=35) or tamibarotene + ATO (n=35). The CR rate was significantly 
higher in th e tamibarotene + ATO group (80% vs. 54%;  P = 0.022). The number who showed 
complete molecular remission was also significantly higher in the tamibarotene + ATO group 
(23% versus 3%), demonstrating a higher quality of remissions. The most commonly -reported 
adverse reactions included hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, rash, and elevation of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, in both groups. 
The tolerability observed in the study group was considered to be simi lar between groups. The 
only adverse finding reported to show an appreciable intergroup difference was leukocytosis, 
which occurred at a significantly lower frequency in the tamibarotene + ATO group than in the 
ATRA + ATO group, suggesting a reduced risk o f RAS.  
Tamibarotene was studied in APL maintenance therapy in comparison to ATRA ( Shinagawa et 
al, 2014 ). Newly diagnosed APL patients in molecular remission at the end of consolidation 
therapy (n = 269 of 347 enrolled) were randomized to receive either tamibarotene (n = 134) at 
6 mg/m2 or ATRA (n = 135) at 45  mg/m2 daily for 14  days every 3 months for 2 years. The 
relapse -free survival (RFS) rate was similar between treatments at 4 years (91% tamibarotene 
and 8 4% ATRA [p=0.095]). An analysis of patients with a high -risk of relapse (initial WBC 
≥ 10.0 x 109/L) revealed a significant difference in RFS in favor of tamibarotene (87% 
tamibarotene versus 58% ATRA [p = 0.028]). Both treatments were generally well -tolerated, 
with most AEs considered mild or moderate. The most common drug -related events of grade 2 or 
greater in both arms were dyslipidemia, rash, increased AST/ALT and headache. Of these,

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 59 of 141 dyslipidemia and skin rash were more common in the tamibarotene arm. Discontinuations due to 
AE occurred in seven patients in the tamibarotene arm (skin rash in 5 patients; liver dysfunction, 
elevated triglycerides in 1 patient each) and four patients in the ATRA arm (nausea, headache, 
liver dysfunction and elevated triglyc erides in 1 patient each). Overall, AEs seen with 
tamibarotene during extended maintenance therapy were similar to those reported in the previous 
Japanese APL registration studies.  
Additional clinical trials have explored the activity of tamibarotene as si ngle-agent treatment in 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin in 
non-small cell lung cancer. Tamibarotene was studied in an open -label study in HCC ( Kanai et 
al, 2014 ). Thirty -six pa tients enrolled and 31 received tamibarotene 8 or 12 mg/day. One patient 
achieved a partial response and seven achieved stable disease; disease control rate was 32%. 
Adverse events were experienced by all patients and were generally mild and consistent wit h 
those reported in other studies. Fourteen (14) of 31 patients (45%) experienced AEs considered 
drug-related and of grade 3 -4. These AEs included increases in cholesterol, -GTP, AST or 
alkaline phosphatase, decrease in leukocytes, platelets or hemoglobin , thrombosis and rash. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) included thrombosis of a limb (2 patients), pulmonary artery 
(2 patients) or portal vein (one patient). One patient died of interstitial lung disease. 
Tamibarotene was also studied in a Phase 2b clinical  trial in patients with Stage IIIB (with 
pleural effusion) or Stage IV non -small cell lung cancer. Patients were treated with up to 6 cycles 
of paclitaxel plus carboplatin, plus either tamibarotene (6 mg/m2/day) or placebo, followed by 
continuous treatment  with either tamibarotene or placebo. The trial enrolled 145 non -small cell 
lung cancer patients. The study was terminated after a planned interim futility analysis, based on 
127 efficacy evaluable patients with a median follow -up of 7.7  months, showed tha t the primary 
efficacy endpoint (improvement in PFS) would not be met. There were 38 deaths, including 
19 due to disease progression (10 on the experimental arm, 9 on the control arm), 8 due toxicity 
(6 experimental, 2, control), and 11 with unknown causes  (6 experimental, 5 control). The AE 
profile in 136 safety evaluable patients (73, tamibarotene + paclitaxel and carboplatin arm, 
63 placebo + paclitaxel and carboplatin arm) showed a similar overall incidence of AEs 
(86.2%  tamibarotene arm vs. 87.3% place bo arm). A higher incidence of ≥Grade 3 SAEs 
including thromboembolic events (6.9% vs. 1.6%) was reported in the tamibarotene vs. placebo 
arms, respectively. In general, the safety profile was consistent with the AE profile demonstrated 
in APL with single agent tamibarotene.  
1.3. Azacitidine  
Azacitidine is a pyrimidine analogue that exerts antineoplastic effects on abnormal 
hematopoietic bone marrow cells through multiple mechanisms including DNA 
hypomethylation. Cytotoxicity may also result from incorporation i nto DNA and RNA, with 
inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Azacitidine is approved in the US and European 
Union (EU) for MDS. Azacitidine is also approved for use in AML in the EU, and is widely 
accepted as standard of care for treatment of AML in  the US.  
1.3.1.  Rationale for Combination of SY -1425 and Azacitidine  
Azacitidine is an azanucleotide analog that is used in the treatment of myeloid malignancies 
(Derissen et al, 2013 ). As a hypomethylating agent, azacitidine works by inhibiting DNMT1

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 60 of 141 leading to depletion of methyl -cytosine in the DNA of the tumor cells ( Derissen et al, 2006 ; 
Voso et al, 2014 ; Stresemann et al, 2008 ). Hypomethylation leads  to the re -expression of genes 
associated with differentiation and growth arrest, contributing to its antineoplastic therapeutic 
effects. The RAR , encoded by the RARA  gene, is a nuclear hormone receptor that acts as a 
transcriptional repressor when unboun d by a ligand and as a gene activator when bound by an 
agonist ( Niederreither and Dollé, 2008 ). While RARα is present in many tissues, it is especially 
important in the normal maturation of myeloid cells ( Kastner et al, 2001 ). The tumor cells from 
the novel subset of AML defined by an RARA  SE, leading to upregulated RARα expression, or 
high IRF8 expression are uniquely responsive to the RARα agonist, SY -1425. SY -1425 binds to 
RARα, and reprograms the tumor cells to express genes associated with myeloid differentiation 
and anti -proliferative  responses. The loss of methyl -cytosine residues induced by azacitidine 
primes the tumor cells for reprogramming by SY -1425 thereby enhancing gene activation by 
SY-1425, which switches RARα from a repressive state to an activating state. Thus, the two 
agen ts may work cooperatively to promote terminal differentiation and decrease proliferation of 
the AML tumor cells, with the potential for increased clinical benefit.  
In cell line models, the combination of azacitidine and SY -1425 showed synergistic anti -
proliferative effects on the cells where a more than additive reduction in tumor cell growth was 
observed over a range of concentrations of each drug. Following up on this finding, SY -1425 and 
azacitidine were administered to a disseminated patient derived xen ograft mouse model of 
RARA -high AML. Indeed, the combination demonstrated superior efficacy at reducing tumor 
burden, achieving deeper and prolonged CR, based on bone marrow and peripheral tumor cell 
reduction, as compared to the single agents . Mechanistic  studies in AML cell line models have 
revealed that while azacitidine had moderate suppressive or activating effects on a broad set of 
genes, the addition of SY -1425 resulted in very strong and specific induction of RARα target 
genes. Furthermore, s ince bo th agents work with DNA interacting targets, it was hypothesized 
that the source of cell killing potentially originated from DNA damage. Indeed, the combination 
of SY -1425 with azacitidine or decitabine in cell line models resulted in emergent induction of  
DNA damage as detected by PARP cleavage and phosphorylation of H2A.X  
As of 29 October 2018, SY -1425, in combination with azacitidine, in biomarker positive newly 
diagnosed unfit AML patients showed evidence of clinical activity with a high response rate a nd 
a rapid onset of responses. ORR was 63% (5/8) and the CR/CRi rate was 50% (4/8) with the 
majority of initial responses at C2D1. In biomarker -negative patients the ORR was 17% (1/6), 
with 1 CR observed; while these data were less mature, they preliminari ly support the use of the 
RARA pathway activation biomarker(s) for patient selection.  SY -1425 + azacitidine was 
generally well tolerated with no evidence for increased toxicities of the combination 
(Cook  et al, 2018 ). 
1.4. Daratumumab  
Daratumumab is a human  IgG1ĸ monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to a 
unique epit ope on CD38. It is a targeted immunotherapy that attacks tumor cells that overexpress 
CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, in a variety of hematological malignancies. Daratumumab 
induces lysis of CD38 -expressing tumor cells by a wide spectrum of mechanisms including 
complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC), and antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), through activation of

for use in multiple myeloma.  
1.4.1.  Rationale for Combination of SY -1425 and Daratumumab  
CD38 expression in  AML is considered to be generally low (CD38lo), but moderate in 
expression in a subset of patients (CD38dim) ( Keyhani et al, 2000 ). CD38 induction in response 
to SY -1425 was observed by mRNA and FACS in RARA -high and IRF8 -high cell line models 
of AML.  In addition, AML patient samples showed similar rates of CD38 induction in response 
to ex vivo treatment with SY -1425 by FACS. Furth ermore, ex vivo functional assays of normal 
human natural killer (NK) cell mediated killing of RARA -high AML cell lines showed that only 
the combination of SY -1425 and daratumumab, but neither agent on their own, could induce 
robust apoptosis of the AML ce lls and interferon gamma secretion of NK cells (indicative of NK 
cell activation.  
The kinetics of induction showed that maximal levels of CD38 were achieved within 24 to 72 
hours of SY -1425 ex vivo exposure.  This provided a potential rationale to explore  combination 
with a compound known to target CD38 and already approved in another hematology indication.   
1.5. Study Rationale  
Knowledge of underlying AML biology has increased significantly in the past two decades, with 
a focus on underlying cytogenetic and m olecular aberrations ( Grimwade et al, 201 6), and 
dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms being associated with the pathogenesis of the disease 
(Wouters and Delwel, 2016 ). A recent approach to investigate tr anscriptional control of genes 
important in cancer identified an important role for the SE. SEs are exceptionally large clustered 
enhancer regions in the human genome, densely occupied by transcription factors, cofactors and 
chromatin regulators. They have  been implicated in directing gene expression programs that 
define cell identity and also regulate oncogenes important in the pathogenesis of cancer ( Hnisz et 
al, 2013 ). Syros’ scientists have studied SEs and their contributions to  the pathogenesis of AML, 
and identified a SE controlling the RARA  gene locus in a subset of non -APL AML primary 
patient samples. They also found upregulation of RARα mRNA expression is associated with the 
SE at the RARA  gene locus. This excess RAR  expres sion allows the tumor to suppress 
differentiation by favoring the gene repression function of RARα in the absence of a concomitant 
increase of natural ligand. Upregulation of this RARA  repressive circuit creates a de novo  
susceptibility for the tumor, by i ncreasing sensitivity to SY -1425 a potent and selective RARα 
agonist. It was demonstrated that increased RARα mRNA expression correlated with increased 
sensitivity to SY -1425 in vitro  and predicted response to SY -1425 in PDX models of AML. The 
mechanism of  RAR-mediated differentiation block in the tumor and consequent response to 
SY-1425 is similar to that described with retinoids in APL, based on the presence of a specific 
pathogenic fusion gene, PML -RARA . These data, therefore, define a novel subset of A ML, 
distinct from APL, that Syros found to be uniquely responsive to SY -1425 in vitro  and in vivo . 
Furthermore, the existence of the SE at the RARA  gene locus and upregulation of RARα mRNA 
expression has also been identified in a subset of patients with MD S. Since RARα mRNA and 
RARA  SE strength are highly correlated, RARα mRNA levels and mRNA levels for pathway -

time of study entry, and patients with transfusion -dependent lower -risk MDS without the del 5q - 
abnormality who are refractory to erythropoietin treatment or unlikely to respond to 
erythropoietin (EPO) treatment (EPO > 500).  
All patients must be evaluated for the RARA  super -enhancer associated biomarker or the 
associated IRF8 biomarker at the time of the study screening evaluation, as determined in 
peripheral blood using an investigational assay. Patients will accrue to each of the six arms based 
on diagnosis (AML, MDS), prior treatment (relapsed/refractory, newly d iagnosed treatment -
naïve unfit AML patients), risk group (higher -risk MDS, lower -risk MDS transfusion 
dependent), and Investigator choice of treatment (SY -1425 single agent, or in combination with 
azacitidine or daratumumab). SY-1425 will be administered a t 6 mg/m2/day orally (PO) in two 
divided doses, which corresponds to the dose approved in Japan for use of tamibarotene in 
patients with relapsed/refractory APL. SY -1425 will be given on a 28 -day treatment cycle.  
• Arms 1, 2A, and 3: SY -1425 will be adminis tered as a single agent and dosing will be 
continuous.  
• Arms 2B and 5: Azacitidine will be administered at 75 mg/m2 (intravenously or 
subcutaneously) on Days 1 through 7, daily, of a 28 -day cycle. SY -1425 will be 
administered at 6 mg/m2/day PO in two divide d doses on Days 8 through 28 of a 28 -day 
cycle.  
• Arm 4: SY -1425 will be administered at 6 mg/m2/day PO in two divided doses. Dosing 
will be continuous, beginning with a 7 -day lead -in, and then administered on a 28 -day 
treatment cycle. Daratumumab will be administered at a dose of 16 mg/kg starting on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses total),  followed by dosing every 2 weeks for 
16 weeks (8 doses total), followed by dosing every 4 weeks until progression or 
intolerance.   
The dose of SY -1425 may be increased due to unsatisfactory response as early as C2D1 and 
again at C3D1 in consultation with  the Sponsor. SY -1425 doses may be increased for AML and 
higher -risk MDS patients to 9 mg/m2/day if a CR/CRi is not achieved at the C2D1 response 
assessment. The dose may be increased one additional dose level to 12 mg/m2/day if a CR/CRi is 
not achieved at  the C3D1 response assessment. Doses may be increased for lower -risk MDS 
patients to 9  mg/m2/day at C2D1 if the patient has not reduced their transfusion requirements by 
50% after 4 weeks (C2D1). The dose may be increased one level to either 9 or 12  mg/m2/day 
after week 8 (C3D1) for lower -risk MDS patients who have not achieved transfusion 
independence but who have achieved a minor erythroid response.  
Patients will be treated with single agent SY-1425, or SY -1425 in combination with azacitidine 
or daratumu mab to determine activity, to establish the safety profile of SY-1425 in patients with 
AML and MDS patients, to explore the hypothesis that patients with the RARA  super -enhancer 
associated biomarker or the associated IRF8 biomarker at baseline are responsi ve to single agent 
SY-1425 or SY -1425 in combination, to establish the pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic

SY-1425 in combination activity and baseline RARA and IRF8 bioma rkers .  
In AML and higher -risk MDS patients, response will be measured by changes from baseline in 
peripheral blood counts and bone marrow aspirates. Bone marrow aspirates will be collected to 
measure response on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3 (if CR/CRi was not ach ieved on C2D1), and 4, 
followed by every third cycle, with additional bone marrow aspirates analyzed as clinically 
indicated based upon changes in peripheral blood counts, or when it is needed to establish either 
CR or disease progression.   Bone marrow asp irate pathology slides (smears) used to assess 
response should be retained at the site for up to 5 years or until Sponsor approval to discard 
samples is provided, whichever is sooner, to support the potential for future analyses . 
In lower -risk MDS patients , response will be measured by changes from baseline in transfusion 
requirements and peripheral blood counts, which will be evaluated at each study visit.  
Patients may continue to receive study treatment until experiencing unacceptable toxicity, 
disease pr ogression/relapse, decision to pursue post -remission therapy other than SY -1425 single 
agent, or SY -1425 in combination with azacitidine or daratumumab, or the Investigator 
determines it is in the best interest of the patient to discontinue treatment. Newl y diagnosed 
AML patients enrolled in Arm  2A who achieve a CR/CRi or PR while on SY -1425 single agent 
treatment and then relapse, or who fail to achieve a CR/CRi or PR after completing at least 4 
cycles of SY -1425 single agent treatment, are eligible to rec eive SY -1425 in combination with 
azacitidine.  
Lower -risk MDS patients will be withdrawn from the study at week 24 if they do not have at 
least a minor erythroid response defined as either a 50% decrease in transfusion requirements or 
a 50% improvement in hemoglobin concentration per the response criteria,  defined as a 
hemoglobin increase ≥ 0.75 g/dL. Lower -risk MDS patients who in the opinion of the 
Investigator are receiving clinical benefit, but do not meet the minor erythroid response criteria 
can remai n on study with Sponsor approval. Lower -risk MDS patients who continue past week 
24 will continue to receive treatment until erythroid relapse (loss of erythroid response), disease 
progression, or unacceptable toxicity.  
An end of treatment (EoT) visit will  be conducted for all AML and higher -risk MDS patients 
within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, but prior to the start of any subsequent therapies to 
monitor for safety and resolution of adverse events (AEs). For lower -risk MDS patients, the EoT 
visit will also be the end of study visit which will be conducted 30 days after the last dose of 
study drug. All AML and higher -risk MDS patients will be followed every 3 months for survival 
for up to 2 years and patients who are withdrawn prior to relapse wil l also follow -up for event

Vital signs will include blood pressure, body temperature, and heart rate. See schedule of events 
for time points.  
Patients enrolled in Arm 4 will have vital signs monitored extensively on Cycle  1 Day 1 before, 
during (at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3.5 hours after the start of the infusion), and after (at the end of the 
infusion, and 0.5 and 1 hour after the end of the infusion) the first infusion of daratumumab. For 
all other infusions, vital signs will be measured before the start of the infusion and a t the end of 
the infusion.  
7.2.9.  Pulmonary Function Testing (Arm 4 Only)  
Patients enrolled in Arm 4 will have pulmonary function testing (PFT) performed at screening. 
For patients with COPD, FEV1 should be measured. Symptom and disease directed exams 
should be performed as clinically indicated during the treatment phase.  
7.2.10.  Blood  Group and Type Assessment, and Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Arm 4 
Only)  
Blood Type, Rh, and Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT) should be done before the first dose of 
daratumumab. Subject RBC phenotyping (standard or extended) is an alternative option to the  
IAT test, if locally required.   Either method must be completed prior to first daratumumab 
infusion.  
Daratumumab interferes with the IAT, which is a routine pre -transfusion  test performed  to 
identify a patient’s antibodies to minor antigens so that suitab le donor blood can be given for 
transfusion.    Daratumumab does not interfere with ABO/RhD typing.   CD38 is expressed at 
very low levels on erythrocytes.   Daratumumab binds to the CD38 on erythrocytes, which results 
in a positive IAT (Indirect Antiglobulin  Test).    This positive result masks the detection of 
antibodies to minor antigens and may prevent or delay blood banks from issuing donor blood for 
transfusion.   This effect occurs during daratumumab treatment and for up to 6 months after 
treatment ends.   Subjects will receive a patient identification wallet card for the study that 
includes the blood profile (ABO, Rh, and IAT or phenotyping) determined before the first 
infusion of daratumumab along with information on the IAT interference for healthcare 
providers/blood banks.   Subjects are to carry this card throughout the treatment period and for at 
least 6 months after treatment ends.   Blood banks can eliminate the daratumumab IAT 
interference with IAT by treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) ( Chapuy et al, 2015 ; 
Chapuy et al, 2016 ). 
Possible methods for blood banks to provide safe RBCs for transfusion to subjects receiving 
daratumumab include:  
a) Providing ABO/RhD  compatible, phenotypically (standard or extended phenotyping) or 
genotypically matched units  
b) Providing ABO/RhD compatible, K -negative units after ruling out or identifying 
alloantibodies using DTT -treated reagent RBCs

needed emergently as per local blood bank practice.  
Despite daratumumab binding to CD38 on erythrocytes, no indication of clinically significant 
hemolysis has been observed in daratumumab studies.  
7.3. Clinical A ssessments  
7.3.1.  Adverse Event Monitoring  
Assessment of AEs, both serious and non -serious, will be monitored throughout the study. SAEs 
will be captured from the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through 30  days 
after last dose of any study drug , and non -serious AEs from the time of first dose of any study 
drug through 30 days after last dose of any study drug. AEs information will include the type, 
severity, timing, seriousness, and relatedness. All AEs will be recorded in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). Refer to Section  9 for more details.  
7.3.2.  Prior, Concomitant, and Subsequent Medication Review  
Prior AML and MDS related and all concom itant medications will be recorded from screening 
until EoT. All subsequent therapies for disease under study will be recorded for AML and 
higher -risk MDS patients until 3 months after the last dose of study drug. See Section  8.7 for 
more details.  
7.3.3.  Blood Product Transfusions  
All transfusions (pRBCs, platelets, number of units, days of administration) will be recorded 
from 16 weeks prior to enrollment until the EoT visit.  
7.3.4.  Erythropoietin Levels – Lower -Risk MDS Patients Only  
Lower -risk MDS patients capture EPO levels at screening.  
7.3.5.  Dosing Compliance/Diary Review  
All patients will be instructed to maintain a dosing diary that records the time and number of SY -
1425 tablets taken for each dosing interval in the study. This diary will be reviewed at each study 
visit for compliance.  
7.3.6.  Health Related Quality of Life  
Patient reported health related quality of life (HRQOL) will be evaluated at screening, Cy cle 1 
Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, and at EoT to determine the impact of SY -1425 treatment. AML and 
Higher -Risk MDS patients will be evaluated using the Factual Assessment of Cancer Therapy -
Leukemia (FACT -Leu) questionnaire ( Appendix  7). Lower -Risk MDS patients will be evaluated 
using the Factual Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Anemia (FACT -An) questionnaire 
(Appendix  6). The FACT -Leu and FACT -An questionnaires are to be self -administered by the 
patient. The questionnaires should be completed by the patient prior to other clinical assessments 
being perform ed and should be reviewed by the site for completeness. If any questions were 
incomplete, the site should encourage the patient to complete any missing questions.

Only  
All AML an d higher -risk MDS patients will be followed for survival for up to 2 years and 
patients who are withdrawn prior to relapse will also follow -up for event free survival.  
7.4. Specialty Laboratory Assessments  
7.4.1.  RARα and IRF8 biomarker assessments  
This study will be  evaluating patients with AML and MDS for the presence of a biomarker based 
on the expression levels of RARα mRNA or IRF8 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
The analysis will be determined based on peripheral blood collected during the screening 
procedures. Both biomarkers will be assessed as “biomarker positive” based on exceeding a 
predetermined cutoff using an investigational test, conducted at a central Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) registered laboratory.  
7.4.2.  Development of Fut ure Companion Diagnostic  
Peripheral blood samples collected from all screened patients may also be used to develop a 
future companion diagnostic for RARα and IRF8.  
7.4.3.  Identification of Additional Biomarkers of Response to SY -1425  
In addition to evaluation of RAR mRNA and IRF8 mRNA, other mRNA levels for other RARα 
pathway associated genes such as CTNNB1 will also be explored.  
Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP )-sequencing, RNA sequencing and DNA 
sequencing will be undertaken in patients where material is available. ChIP -sequencing will be 
used to evaluate the correlation between SE strength for RARA , IRF8 , other super -enhancers in 
the malignant cells, and RNA e xpression levels of genes controlled by those SEs. RNA and 
DNA sequencing will be used to identify additional molecular alterations potentially associated 
with response to SY -1425.  
7.4.4.  Identification of Resistance Mechanisms for SY -1425  
Resistance to ATRA in A PL has been linked to both adaptive hypercatabolic response, resulting 
in reduction of effective ATRA exposure, and through mutations in the RARα ligand binding 
domain reducing the agonist potential of retinoids ( Gallagher, 200 2). RNA and DNA sequencing 
will be used in a blood sample collected at EoT to identify potential molecular alterations 
associated with resistance to treatment with SY -1425.  
7.4.5.  Bone Marrow Sample Collection - AML and Higher -Risk MDS Patients Only  
Patients will  have bone marrow aspirates collected during screening and on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3 
(if CR/CRi was not achieved on C2D1), and 4 with additional aspirates collected every third 
cycle starting with C7D1, and as clinically indicated based upon changes in perip heral blood 
counts, or when it is needed to establish either CR or disease progression. The sample collected 
upon relapse will represent the end of treatment collection.

DHRS3 (SDR family), a metabolic enzyme that is an important component of cellular 
maintenance of retinol homeostasis, will be included in the RNA analysis. The expression of this 
gene is tightly controlled in res ponse to retinoic acid abundance.  DHRS3 gene expression is most 
strongly induced by SY -1425 in AML cells harboring the RARA  super -enhancer. However, there 
is also a significant upregulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which may act as 
surrogate tissue for measuring SY -1425 response.

All protocol specific requirements must be completed and documented prior to study drug 
administration. Following determination that the patient meets all eligibility crit eria, the 
Investigator or designee will enroll the patient according to procedures described in the study 
manual. Patients enrolled in Arms 1, 2A and 3 will receive SY -1425 as a monotherapy. Patients 
enrolled in Arms 2B and 5 will receive SY -1425 in combin ation with azacitidine. Newly 
diagnosed AML patients enrolled in Arm 2A who achieve a CR/CRi or PR while on SY -1425 
single agent treatment and then relapse, or who fail to achieve a CR/CRi or PR after completing 
at least 4 cycles of SY -1425 single agent tr eatment are eligible to receive SY -1425 in 
combination with azacitidine. Patients enrolled in Arm 4 will receive SY -1425 in combination 
with daratumumab.  
8.2. Study Drug Administration  
8.2.1.  SY-1425  
SY-1425 will be supplied as 2 mg tablets. Each patient will receive 6 mg/m2/day PO divided into 
two doses.  
The dose of SY -1425 may be increased due to unsatisfactory response as early as C2D1 and 
again at C3D1 in consultation with the Sponsor. SY -1425 doses may be increased for AML and 
higher -risk MDS patients to 9 mg/m2/day if a CR/CRi is not achieved at the C2D1 response 
assessment. The dose may be increased one additional dose level to 12  mg/m2/day if a CR/CRi is 
not achieved at the C3D1 response assessment. Doses may be increased for lower -risk MDS 
patients to 9 mg/m2/day at C2D1 if the patient has not reduced their transfusion requirements by 
50% after 4 weeks (C2D1). The dose may be increased one level to either 9 or 12  mg/m2/day 
after week 8 (C3D1) for lower -risk MDS patients who have not achieved transfusion 
independence but who have achieved a minor erythroid response.  
Calculated doses will be rounded up to the nearest even number. For doses of 10 mg/day or 
14 mg/day, for which the number of tablets daily is uneven (5 or 7 tablets), then the larger 
number (3 or 4 tablets, respectively) should be taken in the morning. Patients will be instructed 
to take the dose with a glass of water after their morning and evening meal. Tablets should not be 
crushed, broken or split. If a tablet is damaged (broken, crushed, sp lit, etc.), the patient should 
record the information in the diary and bring the damaged tablet to the next study visit. Dosing 
should not be repeated if a patient vomits. A dose missed by greater than 4 hours should be 
skipped. SY-1425 will be given on a 28-day treatment cycle. For patients enrolled in Arms 1, 
2A, 3 and 4, dosing will be continuous. For patients enrolled in Arms 2B and 5, SY -1425 will be 
administered on Days 8 through 28 of a 28 -day cycle.  
Patients may continue to receive study treatment u ntil experiencing unacceptable toxicity,

patient enrolled in Arms 2B and 5 will receive 75 mg/m2 (intravenously or subcutaneously) on 
Days 1 through 7, daily of a 28 -day cycle.   
8.2.3.  Daratumumab  
Daratumumab supplied for IV infusion in this study is a colorless to yellow liquid and sterile 
concentrate of 20 mg/mL as a liquid vial. Each patient enrolled in Arm 4 will receive 
daratumumab 16 mg/kg starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 weekly for 8 we eks (8 doses total), followed 
by dosing every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses total), followed by dosing every 4 weeks until 
progression or intolerance.  
8.2.3.1.  Daratumumab Preparation  
Infusion solution will be prepared as a 1,000 -mL (first dose) or 500 -mL (second a nd subsequent 
doses) dilution of daratumumab in sterile, pyrogen -free 0.9% NaCl. Preparation of infusion bags 
should be done on the day of the planned infusion. Daratumumab must be administered as an 
IV infusion given through a well -functioning IV catheter  by using an infusion pump. The study 
drug must be filtered by using an inline filter (0.2 μM) during the infusion.  
8.2.3.2.  Daratumumab Administration  
Daratumumab (16 mg/kg) will be administered as an IV infusion. Each subject’s dose will be 
calculated based on t he subject’s weight at Cycle 1 Day 1 rounded to the nearest kilogram. The 
dose of daratumumab will remain constant throughout the study, unless the subject’s weight 
changes more than 10% from Cycle 1 Day 1. All infusions will be planned as outpatient visit s. 
Subjects will receive pre -infusion medications and post -infusion medications as detailed in the 
protocol ( Sections 8.2.3.2.1  and 8.2.3.2.2  respectively).  
The dilution volumes, initial infusion rates, and increment for the first, second, and subsequent 
doses are provided in Table 8. The first infusion, with a volume of 1,000 mL, takes

b. Dilution volume of 500 mL should be used only if there were no Grade 1 (mild) or greater 
infusion reactions during the first 3  hours of the first infusion. Otherwise, continue to use a 
dilution volume of 1000 mL.  
c. Use a modified initial rate for subsequent infusions (ie, third infusion onwards) only if 
there were no Grade 1 (mild) or greater infusion reactions during a final infusion rate of 
≥100  mL/hr in the first two infusions.  Otherwise, continue to use instructi ons for the 
second infusion.  
As noted in Table 5, vital signs should be monitored extensively on Cycle  1 Day 1 before, 
during, and after the first infusion of daratumumab. For all other infusions, vital signs should be 
measured before the s tart of the infusion and at the end of the infusion. If a subject experiences 
any significant medical event, then the investigator should assess whether the subject should stay 
overnight for observation. If the subject has not experienced a significant med ical event but is 
hospitalized overnight only for observation, then the hospitalization should not be reported as a 
serious adverse event.  
8.2.3.2.1.  Daratumumab Pre -Infusion Medications  
In an effort to prevent infusion related reactions, all subject will receive the  following medications 
1 to 3  hours prior to each study drug administration (1  hour prior to study drug administration is 
preferred):  
• An antipyretic: paracetamol (acetaminophen) 650 -1000 mg IV or PO  
• An antihistamine: diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg IV or PO, or e quivalent. Avoid IV use of 
promethazine. (see Appendix  9 for list of antihistamines that may be used)  
• A corticosteroid: methylprednisolone 100 mg IV  or PO or equivalent for the first 2 doses and 
60 mg for all subsequent doses (in the absence of IRR adverse events in the first 2 doses). 
Substitutions for methylprednisolone are allowed (refer to Appendix  10).  
• A Leukotriene Inhibitor (optional) on Cycle 1 Day 1: montelukast 10 mg PO, or equivalent.

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 90 of 141 If necessary, all PO pre -infusion medications may be administered outside of the clinic on the 
day o f the infusion, provided they are taken within 3 hours before the infusion  
8.2.3.2.2.  Daratumumab Post -Infusion Medications  
In an effort to prevent delayed infusion -related reactions, all subjects will receive long - or 
intermediate -acting corticosteroids orally (20 m g methylprednisolone or equivalent in 
accordance with local standards) on the 2 days following all daratumumab infusions (beginning 
the day after the infusion).  
In the absence of infusion -related AEs after the first 3 infusions, post -infusion corticosteroi ds 
should be administered per investigator discretion.  
For subjects with a higher risk of respiratory complications (eg,  subjects with mild asthma or 
subjects with COPD who have an FEV1  <80% at screening or developed FEV1  <80% during the 
study without any medical history) the following post -infusion medications should be considered:  
• Antihistamine (diphenhydramine or equivalent)  
• Leukotriene inhibitor (montelukast or equivalent)  
• Short -acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist such as salbutamol aerosol  
• Control medications for lung disease (eg, inhaled corticosteroids ± long -acting β2 adrenergic 
receptor agonists for subjects with asthma; long -acting bronchodilators such as tiotropium or 
salmeterol ± inhaled corticosteroids for subjects with COPD)  
In addition, these at -risk subjects may be hospitalized for monitoring for up to 2  nights after an 
infusion. If subjects are hospitalized, then their spirometry test (FEV1) should be performed before 
discharge. If these subjects are not hospitalized, then a f ollow -up telephone call should be made to 
monitor their condition within 48 hours after all infusions. If the subject has not experienced a 
significant medical event but is hospitalized overnight only for observation, then the 
hospitalization should not be  reported as a serious adverse event. Investigators may prescribe 
bronchodilators, H1 -antihistamines, and corticosteroids that are deemed necessary to provide 
adequate supportive care in the event a bronchospasm occurs after subjects are released from the 
hospital/clinic. If an at -risk subject experiences no major infusion -related reactions, then these 
post-infusion medications may be waived after 4 doses at the investigator’s discretion.  
Any post -infusion medication will be administered after the infusion  has completed.  
8.2.3.2.3.  Management of Daratumumab Infusion -Related Reactions (IRR)  
Subjects should be carefully observed during daratumumab infusions. Trained study staff at the 
clinic should be prepared to intervene in case of any infusion reactions, and resource s necessary 
for resuscitation must be available. Attention to staffing should be considered when multiple 
subjects will be dosed at the same time.  
For infusion reactions of any grade/severity, immediately interrupt the daratumumab infusion 
and manage symptoms. Management of infusion reactions may further require reduction in the 
rate of infusion, or treatment discontinuation of daratumumab.

If the investigator assesses a Grade 1 -2 IRR adverse  event to be related to administration of study 
drug, then the daratumumab infusion should be paused. Once IRR symptoms resolve and the 
subject's condition is stable, the daratumumab infusion may be restarted at the investigator's 
discretion. Upon restart of daratumumab infusion, the infusion rate should be half of that 
employed before the interruption. If the patient does not experience any further IRR symptoms, 
infusion rate escalation may resume at increments and intervals as clinically appropriate up to  the 
maximum rate of 200 mL/hour ( Table 8). 
If the subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher event of laryngeal edema, or a Grade 2 or higher 
event of bronchospasm that does not respond to systemic therapy and does not resolve within 
6 hours from onset, then the subject must be withdrawn from daratumumab treatment.  
8.2.3.2.3.2.  Daratumumab Infusion -Related Reactions of Grade 3 or Higher  
For IRR adverse events that ar e Grade 4, the daratumumab infusion must be stopped and the 
subject withdrawn from daratumumab treatment.  
For IRR adverse events that are Grade 3, the daratumumab infusion must be stopped and the 
subject must be observed carefully. Once reaction symptoms resolve, consider restarting the 
infusion at no more than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. If the subject does not 
experience additional symptoms, resume infusion rate escalation at increments and intervals as 
outlined in Table 8. If the intensity of the adverse event returns to Grade 3 after restart of the 
daratumumab infusion, then the procedure described in this section should be repeate d, or the 
subject may be withdrawn from treatment. Should the intensity of the adverse event increase to 
Grade 3 for a third time, then the subject must be withdrawn from daratumumab treatment.  
8.3. Reference/Control Therapy  
All patients will receive open label  SY-1425 single agent, or SY -1425 in combination with 
azacitidine or daratumumab.  
8.4. Recommended Dose Modifications

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 92 of 141 The dose of SY -1425 may be increased due to unsatisfactory response as early as C2D1 and 
again at C3D1 in consultation with the Sponsor.  
AML and Higher -Risk MDS patients: Doses may be increased for AML and higher -risk MDS 
patients to Dose Increase Level +1 if a CR/CRi is not achieved at the C2D1 response assessment. 
The dose may be increased by one dose level (to Dose Increase Level +1, or +2 for those who 
already had a prior dose level increase) if a CR/CRi is not achieved at the C3D1 response 
assessment. If in the opinion of the Investigator, a dose increase is not recommend ed as outlined 
above, the case should be discussed with the Sponsor for approval.  
Lower -Risk MDS patients: Doses may be increased for lower -risk MDS patients at C2D1 to 
Dose Increase Level +1 if the patient has not reduced their transfusion requirements b y 50% after 
4 weeks. The dose may be increased by one dose level (to Dose Increase Level +1, or +2 for 
those who already had a prior dose level increase) after week 8 (C3D1) for lower -risk MDS 
patients who have not achieved transfusion independence but hav e achieved a minor erythroid 
response.  
If a patient has an SY -1425 dose increase, a dose adjustment visit must be performed within 8 to 
15 days of the dose adjustment to capture safety assessments and PK data. This visit can be 
combined with another sched uled visit if it is scheduled to occur within that window.  
8.4.1.2.  Dose Reductions  
Table 10: Dose Reductions of SY -1425  
Dose Level  SY-1425 Dose  
Initial Dose: Level 0  6 mg/m2/day 
Dose Reduction: Level -1 4.5 mg/m2/day 
Dose Reduction: Level -2 3.0 mg/m2/day 
Dose reductions may be recommended to optimize management of patients with adverse events 
as outlined in Section  8.4.1.3  and 8.4.1.4 . If a patient has an SY -1425 dose reduction, a dose 
adjustment visit must be performed within 8 to 15 days of the dose adjustme nt to capture safety 
assessments and PK data. This visit can be combined with another scheduled visit if it is 
scheduled to occur within that window.  
Note: For patients who previously dose escalated as outlined in Section  8.4.1.1 , dose reductions 
should be one dose level at a time. For example, a patient at 12 mg/ m2/day should be reduced to 
9 mg/m2/day, and a patient at 9 mg/m2/day should be reduced to 6 mg/m2/day for their initial 
dose reduction.  
8.4.1.3.  Non-Hematologic Adverse Events  
SY-1425 doses will be withheld for patients experiencing:  
• Non-hematologic AEs of ≥ Grade 3 and deemed related to SY -1425, or  
• Laboratory abnormalities that are ≥ Grade 3 and deemed related to SY -1425 
[ie, unrelated to the underlying hematologic malignancy, complications of the 
malignancy (eg, infection and bleedi ng), and unrelated to concurrent medications,

which should only be held if AE severity reaches Grade 4]  
SY-1425 treatment may resume at the Initial Dose Level once the event h as resolved to 
≤ Grade  1 or baseline. The Investigator may choose to reduce the dose by 1 level based on the 
AE severity, time to resolution, and clinical judgment.  
For recurrence of the same AE responsible for a dose interruption in patients on the Initia l Dose 
Level, SY -1425 may be resumed, but the dose must be reduced by one Dose Reduction Level. 
An additional dose reduction for recurrence of the same AE may be taken if needed.  
Dosing may be increased to a prior dose level if the AE remains ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline for 
28 days.  
8.4.1.4.  Hematologic Adverse Events:  
It is not anticipated that SY -1425 dose modifications would be needed for hematologic events 
(ie, cytopenias, complications associated with cytopenias including infection, bleeding). 
However, if in the opinion of the Investigator, a dose modification is clinically indicated, the 
dose may be reduced by one dose level, following the guidance for non -hematologic AEs.  
Based upon the mechanism of action of SY -1425, which may promote myeloid cell 
differentiati on, early signs of WBC increases are anticipated and may not represent progression 
of disease.  
8.4.1.5.  Discontinuation of Therapy Due to Treatment -Related Toxicity  
Study treatment should not be resumed in the case of the following treatment -related events:  
• Cardiac  event (Grade 4 arrhythmia or heart failure)  
• ≥ 56-day (2 cycle) dose delay due to a treatment -related adverse event  
8.4.1.6.  Alternative Dosing Regimens  
Continuous daily dosing in 28 -day (4 week) cycles will be initially evaluated. Alternative dosing 
regimens may be explored with Sponsor approval, should it be deemed necessary to manage 
chronic toxicities.  
8.4.2.  Azacitidine Guidelines  
Azacitidine dosing may be modified if no beneficial effect is seen or due to toxicity as per the 
below guidelines ( VIDAZA Prescribing Information 2016 ). Local guidelines and best practices 
may also be followed for azacitidine dose adjustments due to toxicity, as applicable ( VIDAZA 
Summary of Product Characteristics 2016 ). 
8.4.2.1.  Dose Adjustm ents Based on Hematology Laboratory Values  
For patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC ≥ 3.0 x 109/L, ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, and 
platelets ≥  75.0 x 109/L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle as 
described in  Table 11.

For patients whose baseline counts are WBC < 3.0 x 109/L, ANC < 1.5 x 109/L, or platelets 
< 75.0 x 109/L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the 
time of the nadir as noted in Table 12, unless there is clear impr ovement in differentiation 
(percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at 
the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose.

If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start 
of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are >25% above the 
nadir and rising. If a >25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28,  reassess counts every 
7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by Day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%.  
8.4.2.2.  Dose Adjustments Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity  
If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to <20 mEq/L occur, reduce the d osage by 
50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of blood urea nitrogen or serum 
creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the 
dose by 50% for the next course. If recovery to normal or  baseline has not occurred by Day 42, 
please consult Sponsor on how to proceed for the next course.

hold are also met. If discontinuation of SY -1425 is required per criteria in Section  8.4.1.5 , then 
the patient should be dis continued from all study drug and have an end of treatment visit 
performed.

8.4.4.  Daratumumab Guidelines  
Dose modification of daratumumab is not permitted. Dose delay is the primary method for 
managing daratumumab -related toxicities.  
8.4.4.1.  Daratumumab Cycle Delay  
On the first day of each new treatment cycle and before each dar atumumab dose, the subject will 
be evaluated by the treating physician for possible toxicities that may have occurred after the 
previous dose(s). Toxicities are to be assessed according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03. Dose 
modifications or delays will be made based on the toxicity experienced during the previous cycle 
of therapy or newly encountered on Day 1 of a cycle.  
 
The study treatment must be held if any of the following criteria below are met, to allow for 
recovery from toxicity, regardless of relationsh ip to daratumumab or SY -1425, unless 
attributable to underlying disease.  For example, cytopenias attributable to AML may not be 
considered toxicities of treatment.  
 
The criteria for a dose delay are:  
 
• Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, except for grade 4 lymphopenia  
• Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia  
• Febrile neutropenia  
• Neutropenia with infection, of any grade  
• Grade 3 or higher non -hematologic toxicities with the following exceptions:  
o Grade 3 nausea that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days  
o Grad e 3 vomiting that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days  
o Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to antidiarrheal treatment within 7 days  
o Grade 3 fatigue that was present at baseline or that lasts for <7  days after the last 
administration of daratumumab  
o Grade 3 asthenia that was present at baseline or that lasts for <7  days after the last 
administration of daratumumab  
 
Administration of daratumumab may be restarted upon recovery from toxicity to Grade 2 or 
baseline, with the exception that Grade 2 laryngeal edema or Grade 2 bronchospasm must be 
fully recovered.  
 
If daratumumab administration does not commence within the prespecified window ( Table 13) 
of the scheduled administration date, then the dose will be considered a missed dose. 
Administration may resume at the next planned dosing date. A missed dose will not be made up.

Cycles may be delayed up to 4  weeks (Cycle 1 to Cycle 6) or up to 6 weeks (Cycle 7 and beyond).  
If Day 1 of a cycle is delayed, Day 1 of subsequent cycles should be adjusted accordingly to 
maintain  the 28 -day cycle duration.  However, if a within -cycle dose is delayed, then the dates of 
the subsequent within -cycle doses should not be adjusted.  Any adverse event deemed to be related 
to daratumumab that requires a dose hold of more than 4 weeks (Cycl e 1 to Cycle 6) or more than 
6 weeks (Cycle 7 and beyond) will result in permanent discontinuation of daratumumab.  
Any dose hold  of more than 56 days due to unresolved direct daratumumab toxicity will result in 
permanent discontinuation of daratumumab. Any dose hold of more than 28 days and less than 
56 days due to unresolved direct daratumumab toxicity may lead to discontinuation or continued 
daratumumab and requires review by the sponsor. Dose holds of more than 28 days for other 
reasons should be discussed with the sponsor.  
8.4.4.2.  Daratumumab Interruption or Missed Doses  
A daratumumab dose that is held for more than the permitted time  (Table 13) from the per -
protocol administration date for any reason other than toxicities suspected to be related to 
daratumumab should be brought to  the attention of the Sponsor at the earliest possible time. 
Subjects whose dose was delayed for more than 4 weeks (Cycle 1 to Cycle 6) or more than 
6 weeks (Cycle 7 and beyond) should have study treatment discontinued, unless, upon 
consultation with the s ponsor and the review of safety and efficacy, continuation is agreed upon.  
8.4.4.3.  Dose Delay Guidelines for Patients Receiving SY -1425 in Combination with 
Daratumumab  
If criteria for SY -1425 dose hold are met, daratumumab dosing may continue unless criteria for 
hold are also met. If discontinuation of SY -1425 is required per criteria in Section  8.4.1.5 , then 
the patient should be discontinued from all study drug and have an end of treatment visit 
performed  
If criteria for daratumumab dose hold are met, SY -1425 dosing may continue unless criteria for 
hold are also met. Day 1 of the next treatment cycle is delayed until daratumumab dosing may 
resume.  
8.5. Stud y Drug Dosing Compliance  
8.5.1.  SY-1425  
Patients will maintain diaries to include the date and time each dose of SY -1425 is taken

It is possible that SY -1425 drug substance may contain a small amount of sodium hydrosulfite. 
In accordance with Federal regulations, the foll owing warning is provided:  
Contains sodium hydrosulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic -type reactions including 
anaphylactic symptoms and life -threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain 
susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfit e sensitivity in the general population is 
unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non -
asthmatic people.  
SY-1425 is teratogenic; therefore, it should not be administered to women who are pregnant. 
Tamibaro tene has been reported to cause abnormalities in spermatogenesis in animal 
experiments using rats and dogs. Patients who are fertile must agree to use 2 highly effective 
methods of birth control, one being barrier method. Intrauterine devices and birth con trol pills 
are not barrier methods, but are highly effective especially when combined with a barrier method 
(eg, latex condom or a diaphragm or cervical cap) while taking investigational product 
(SY-1425) and continuing contraception use for at least 90 da ys after the last dose of study drug 
for men and 6 months for women . Men/women should not donate sperm or ova during this

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 102 of 141 9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
associated with the use of a drug or with study participation, whether or not considered related to 
study drug.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational 
product, whether or not related to the investigational product. An AE can a rise from any use of 
the drug, and from any route of administration, formulation or dose, including an overdose.  
Medical conditions present prior to screening, as well as ongoing changes in laboratory 
values/conditions that are being treated at baseline, will be captured as medical history unless the 
frequency, severity or character of the condition worsens during the trial (after first dose of any 
study drug) for which the condition would then be captured as an AE.  
9.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, except for:  
− Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF (as 
documented as medical history on the eCRF), or  
− Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience, or for observation only  following 
daratumumab administration in the absence of a significant medical event  
o Any untoward occurrence during an elective or pre -planned treatment, or 
scheduled therapy for target disease must be reported as an AE/SAE. In 
general, hospitalization sign ifies that the patient has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt a s to whether 
'hospitalization' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient who received SY -1425  
• Important medical events, defin ed as an AE that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent o ne of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such events include intensive treatment in an emergency

not result in inpatient hospitalization, and development of  drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
9.3. Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.3.1.  Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Patients will be instructed to report all AEs and will be asked a general health status question at 
each study visit. A ll AEs occurring in treated patients will be recorded in the eCRF from the time 
of first dose of any study drug until 30  days after the last dose of any study drug in the eCRF. 
However, following implementation of Amendment 7, record ing of  AEs in the eCRF  will no 
longer be required for Arm 5 patients receiving study drug . Only SAEs , AESI, and Pregnancy 
and Birth Events will continue to be reported via the pharmacovigilance safety database.  
All SAEs occurring from the signing of ICF through 30 days post last  dose of any study drug 
will be processed as outlined in Section 9.5. An SAE will be followed until it is either resolved, 
has returned to baseline, or is determine d to be a stable or chronic condition.  
At each required visit during the trial, all AEs that have occurred since the previous visit must be 
reviewed. The Investigator, or appropriate designee, must determine if the AE is serious or 
non-serious.  
9.3.2.  Adverse E vent Relationship Assessment  
The Investigator is required to provide an assessment of relationship of AEs and SAEs to study 
drug. A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment including: 1)  the 
temporal relationship of the event to the  administration of study drug; 2)  whether an alternative 
etiology has been identified; and/or 3)  biological plausibility. The following guidelines should be 
used by Investigators to assess the relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug.  
 “Not Related” assessment  
• None: The event is related to an etiology other than study drug administration (the 
alternative etiology must be documented in the patient’s medical record).  
• Remote: The event is unlikely to be related to study drug and likely to  be related to 
factors other than study drug.  
“Related” assessment  
• Possible: There is an association between the event and the administration of study 
drug, and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to study drug; but 
there may also be  alternative etiologies, such as characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
status or underlying disease.  
• Probable: There is an association between the event and the administration of study 
drug, there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to  study drug, and the 
event could not be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the patient’s 
clinical status or an alternative etiology is not apparent.

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 104 of 141 • Definite: There is an association between the event and the administration of study 
drug, the re is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to study drug, and 
causes other than study drug have been ruled out and/or the event re -appeared on 
re-exposure to study drug.  
9.3.3.  Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The severity of the AE will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03, effective date 
14 June 2010 as well as changes in clinically significant clinical laboratory values, ECG 
parameters and vital sign measurements. Toxicities that are not specified in NCI CTCAE v4.03 
will be defined as follows:  
• Grade 1: The AE is noticeable to the patient, it does not require discontinuation or 
reduction of the dose of study drug, but may require additional therapy.  
• Grade 2: The AE interferes with the patient’s daily a ctivities; it does not require 
discontinuation of study drug, but may require additional therapy.  
• Grade 3: The AE is intolerable and necessitates discontinuing or reducing the dose of 
study drug or additional therapy.  
• Grade 4: The patient is at immediate r isk of death from the AE.  
• Grade 5: The AE is fatal.  
9.4. Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events on the eCRF  
Following implementation of Amendment 7, record ing of  AEs (serious and nonserious)  in the 
eCRF  will no longer be required for Arm 5 patients receiving study drug ; the eCRF instructions 
described in Section 9.4 are no longer applicable for these patients. On ly SAEs (see Section 9.5), 
AESI (see Section 9.6), and Pregnancy and Bir th Events (see Section  9.7) will continue to be 
reported via the pharmacovigilance safety database.  
9.4.1.  Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms  
If a diagnosis is known at the time of reporting, then the diagnosis should be rec orded in the 
eCRF rather than the individual signs and symptoms (eg, record myocardial infarction rather 
than chest pain, shortness of breath); however, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot 
be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome, at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an AE on the eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow -up and should replace the applicable individual signs 
and/or symptoms as the even t term on the eCRF.  
9.4.2.  Adverse Events Occurring Due to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events should be identified by their primary cause. 
For example, if severe vomiting is known to result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only 
vomiting as the AE on the eCRF; however, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an 
initiating event should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF. For example, if severe 
vomiting leads to acute renal failure, both events should be re corded on the eCRF.

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 105 of 141 9.4.3.  Persistent of Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution or change in severity, 
between patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the AE 
eCRF. If a pers istent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be recorded as a 
new AE on the eCRF.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation timepoints, and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded as new  events on the AE eCRF.  
9.4.4.  Disease Under Study  
Progression of the underlying disease, including death from progression of the underlying 
disease, is considered an efficacy outcome parameter and should not be captured as an AE/SAE. 
Documentation of the progres sion of disease must be obtained and recorded in the eCRF.  
9.4.5.  New Cancers  
The development of a new primary cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet 
at least one of the serious criteria (See Section 9.2). New primary cancers are those that are not 
the primary reason for the administration of study drug treatment and have developed after the 
patient has received at least one dose of study drug upon enrol lment in the study. They do not 
include metastases of the original cancer, or diagnosis of AML in a patient previously diagnosed 
with MDS.  
Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are 
considered to be di sease progression.  
9.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Syros or designee (contact information provided below) within 
24 hours after the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event, even if the experience does not 
appear to be r elated to study drug, from the time of signing ICF through 30  days after the last 
dose of any study drug. This timeframe also applies to additional information that is obtained as 
a part of the follow -up on previously reported SAEs.  
To report an SAE, the s ite must email, phone, or fax the information to the information listed 
below within 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.  
SAE Reporting Contact Information  
Email  Fax Number  
SyrosPV@primevigilance.com  1-855-234-6419  
The initial SAE report must be as complete as possible, including minimally the patient number 
and initials or date of birth, details of the event(s), an d an assessment of the causal relationship 
between the event and the investigational drug. Information not available at the time of the initial 
report (eg, an end date for the SAE, or laboratory values received after the report) must be 
documented on a fol low-up SAE report form. All follow -up information must be reported using 
the same timelines as the initial report.

study drug), an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that is suspected by the Investigator to be 
related to study drug, the event must be reported to the Syros, or designee, as described above.  
Follow -up information may be requested by Syros or designee.  
9.6. Reporting of Adverse Events of Special Inter est 
AESIs must be reported to Syros, or designee, within 24 hours from first knowledge of the 
event(s) on an SAE Report Form regardless if assessed as non -serious or serious. AESI for the 
study include:  
• Combination of ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirub in >2 x ULN  
• Triglycerides severity Grade ≥ 3  
• Total cholesterol severity Grade > 3 
• Rash severity Grade ≥ 3  
• Bleeding events with severity Grade ≥ 3  
• Infectious events with severity Grade ≥ 3  
AESIs are to be reported from the first dose of SY -1425 until the E oT visit. As there will be no 
EoT visit for Arm 5 patients still receiving study treatment at the time of implementation of 
Amendment 7, AESIs are to be reported from the first dose of SY -1425 until the last dose of any 
study drug for these patients.  
9.7. Pregnancy and Birth Events Procedures  
Pregnancies occurring in patients, or partners of male patients, during the study treatment period 
until 30 days after the patient’s last dose of any study drug are considered immediately 
reportable events. If a pregna ncy occurs in a patient, all study drug must be discontinued 
immediately. SY -1425 and azacitidine have both been shown to be teratogenic in animal studies, 
and animal studies have not been conducted to assess the risk with use of daratumumab during 
pregnan cy. Therefore pregnant women should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
The pregnancy must be reported to Syros, or designee, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledg e of the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Notification Form using timelines as described 
in Section  9.5. 
The Investigator will follow the pregnant patient until comple tion of the pregnancy, and must  
notify Syros, or designee, of the outcome within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
pregnancy outcome. The Investigator will provide this information on the Pregnancy Outcome 
Report Form. This notification inclu des pregnancies resulting in live, “normal” births.  
If the pregnant patient experiences an SAE, during her pregnancy, or the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion 
[any congenital anomal y detected in an aborted fetus is to be reported], stillbirth, neonatal death,

described in Section  9.5. 
All neonatal deaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of 
relationship to study drug) should be reported as SAEs. In addition, any infant death or 
congenital anomaly occurring after 30 days that the Investigator suspect s is related to the in utero  
exposure to study drug should also be reported to Syros, or designee as described in Section  9.5. 
The Investigator will follow the pre gnancy at least until birth or pregnancy termination.  
9.8. Overdose  
There has been no experience with acute overdose of tamibarotene in humans. However, 
overdose with other retinoids has been associated with transient headache, facial flushing, 
cheilosis, abdo minal pain, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms have resolved quickly without 
apparent residual effects. Management of overdose with tamibarotene should focus on 
monitoring target organ function to preserve their viability and prevent complications.  
One case of overdose with azacitidine was reported during clinical trials ( VIDAZA Prescribing 
Information 2016 ; VIDAZA Summary of Product Characteristics 2016 ). A patient experienced 
diarrhea, nausea, a nd vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 
290 mg/m2, almost 4 times the recommended starting dose. In the event of overdose, the patient 
should be monitored with appropriate blood count tests and should receive supportive treat ment, 
as necessary. There is no known antidote for azacitidine overdose.  
The dose of daratumumab at which severe toxicity occurs is not known. In the event of an 
overdose, monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and provide appropriat e 
supportive treatment ( DARZALEX Prescribing Information 2017 ; DARZALEX Summary of 
Product Characteristics 2017 ). 
9.9. Clinical Laboratory Changes  
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is a ssociated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, 
the sign or symptom should be reported as AEs. If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a 
disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the eCRF and SAE Report 
Form. Following implementatio n of Amendment 7, record ing of  AEs (serious and nonserious)  in 
the eCRF  will no longer be required for Arm 5 patients receiving study drug ; the eCRF 
instructions described in Section 9.9 are no longer applicable for these patients. Only SAEs (see 
Section 9.5), AESI (see Section 9.6), and Pregnancy and Birth Events (see Section  9.7) will 
continue to be repo rted via the pharmacovigilance safety database.  
Abnormal laboratory values will not be reported as AEs unless the laboratory result:  
• Requires a dose adjustment or schedule change to study drug  
• Leads to discontinuation of treatment  
• Requires additional test ing or therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with accompanying signs/symptoms  
• Is considered to be an AE by the Investigator

Frequency distributions will be used for categorical variables and appropriate summary statistics 
(ie, mean, median, and range) for quantitative/continuous variables. Each arm (six analysis 
groups) will be reported and analyzed independently, with no adjustment for multiple hypothesis 
testing. Two -sided 90% confidence intervals will be provided for key endpoints, ie, primary and 
secondary endpoints at a minimum.  
Additional details of the analyses will be pro vided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Any 
deviations in the planned analysis as stated in the protocol will be delineated in the SAP. Any 
deviations from the SAP will be reported in the clinical study report.  
10.2. Analysis Populations  
Screened:  All scre ened patients (consented) regardless of receipt of the investigational product 
comprise the screened analysis population. This population will be used only for the generation 
of demographics and RARA and IRF8 biomarker results.  
Safety Population:  All scree ned patients who received any amount of study drug (SY -1425 or 
combination treatment) comprise the safety population. This population will be further divided 
by arm as noted in the analysis.  
PK Evaluable:  All patients enrolled who receive any amount of SY -1425 and have an adequate 
number of SY -1425 concentration determinations for PK calculations comprise the PK evaluable 
analysis population.  
PD Evaluable:  All patients enrolled who receive any amount of SY -1425 and have an adequate 
number of samples for PD determination comprise the PD evaluable analysis population.  
Response Evaluable:  The response evaluable analysis population is comprised of all patients 
enrolled who:  
• Complete 1 cycle of SY -1425, and have a follow -up assessment of disease status, and 
do no t have any major protocol violations, or  
• Are withdrawn from the study before completion of cycle 1 because of documented 
disease progression  
10.3. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 162 response -evaluable patients are required (ie, approximately 25 bioma rker 
positive patients each in Arms 1, 2A, 3, and 5; approximately 50 patients in Arm 2B (~ 25 
biomarker positive and ~ 25 biomarker negative); and approximately 12 biomarker positive 
patients in Arm 4) and will be analyzed separately with no adjustment fo r multiple hypothesis 
testing across arms, in part for practical reasons as arms may have very different rates of 
enrollment. This is a fixed design trial.  
For each of Arms 1, 2A, 2B (biomarker positive subset), 3, and 5, an exact 2 -sided 90% 
confidence i nterval will be calculated for ORR or TIR. Success for Arms 1, 2A and 3 (n=25

Amendment 7 ( 31 August  2022)                       Confidential  Page 110 of 141 each) is achieved, if the lower bound of the confidence interval excludes 5%. Assuming a 25% 
response rate for SY -1425 as a single agent, the power for each of these arms of this  study is 
90.4%. Arm 2B has two subgroups defined by biomarker status (n=25 each). Success for the 
biomarker positive subgroup in Arm 2B is achieved if the lower bound of the confidence interval 
excludes 20%. Assuming a 45% response rate for the combinatio n of SY -1425 and azacitidine in 
biomarker positive patients, the power for this subgroup of Arm 2B of the study is 86.6%. 
Success for Arm 5 (n=25) is achieved if the lower bound of the confidence interval excludes 
10%. Assuming a 30% response rate for the combination of SY -1425 and azacitidine in relapsed/ 
refractory biomarker -positive AML patients, the power for this arm of the study is 80.7%.  
Therefore, as an example, an ORR or TIR of 4/25 (16%) (90% CI: 5.7 to 33.0%) for Arms 1, 2A, 
and 3 would be consid ered a success for each of these arms, an ORR of 9/25 (36%) (90% CI: 
20.2 to 54.4%) would be considered a success for the biomarker positive Arm 2B subgroup, and 
an ORR of 6/25 (24%) (90% CI: 11.0 to 42.0%) would be considered a success in Arm 5. No 
adjust ment for multiple hypothesis testing across arms will be made.   
Success for the entire Arm 2B population is achieved if the lower bound of the confidence 
interval excludes 20%. Assuming a 38% response rate for the combination of SY -1425 and 
azacitidine in  the entire Arm 2B population, the power for secondary endpoint of Arm 2B is 
84.6%.   
The primary endpoint of Arm 4 is safety and tolerability of SY -1425 in combination with 
daratumumab. The sample size of 12 biomarker positive patients is not based on any  hypothesis 
testing but is appropriate for studies of this type with a primary focus on safety.

Category  Definition  Comment  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Evidence for an increase in bone marrow blast 
percentage and/or increase of absolute blast 
counts in the blood:  
• >50% increase in marrow blasts over 
baseline (a minimum 15% point increase is 
required in cases with <30% blasts at 
baseline; or pe rsistent marrow blast 
percentage of >70% over at least 3 months; 
without at least a 100% improvement in 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to an 
absolute level [>0.5 x 109/L (500/ìL), 
and/or platelet count to >50 x 109/L 
(50,000/ìL) non -transfused]; or  
• >50% i ncrease in peripheral blasts (WBC x 
% blasts) to >25 x 109/L (>25,000/ìl) (in 
the absence of differentiation syndrome) a; 
or 
• New extramedullary disease  In general, at least 2 cycles of treatment 
should be administered.  
 
Blast increases should be observed i n 2 
consecutive marrow assessments at least 4 
weeks apart; the date of progression should 
then be defined as of the first observation 
date.  
 
“Progressive disease” is usually  
accompanied by a decline in ANC and  
platelets and increased transfusion  
requiremen t and decline in performance  
status or increase in symptoms.  
a Differentiation syndrome, ie, a transient increase in the percentage of bone marrow blasts and an absolute increase 
in blood blasts, may be observed with targeted therapies; in this setting, a n increase in blasts may not necessarily 
indicate progressive disease.

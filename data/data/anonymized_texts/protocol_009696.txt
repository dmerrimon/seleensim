[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Study Protocol/ Method  
Three veteran outpatients (ages 31, 43, and 46 year s) who met PTSD criteria of at least moderate 
symptom severity (Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -5 [CAPS -5] score ≥ 40)  were recruited 
from the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System between April 2018 and July 2019. Individuals 
were exclu ded if they had comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions that increased the risk of 
participation. All participants completed a single 1 -hour subanesthetic inhalation of 50% nitrous oxide 
and 50% oxygen administered by an anesthesiologist via face mask a nd standard semi -closed anesthetic 
circuit with a total gas flow rate of 4 –8 L/min. A trained independent evaluator rated PTSD symptoms 
using CAPS -5 at baseline and 1 week after drug administration.  
Statistica l Analysis Plan   
Response was defined a priori as a CAPS -5 score reduction of 12 points at 7 days.

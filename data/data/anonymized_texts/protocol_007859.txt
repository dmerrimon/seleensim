CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  4 of 76 • Glucose added to the stan dard of care metabolic panel in Section 4.2 and Table 1, footnote ‘c’  
Changes to inclusion criteria:  
• ‘Mild -moderate disease: SpO2≥94% with low -flow supplemental oxygen (3 liters or less)’ changed to 
‘…(5 liters or less)’ . Three liters is too restrictive as many stable patients are requiring higher oxygen 
support  
• ‘Chest radiography or CT findings consistent with COVID -19’—a definition for the findings is replaced 
with ‘in the opinion of the investigator’, because the definition is too prescriptive  
• New criterion added: Hospital admission no mor e than 4 days prior to screening. This is to ensure that 
included patients are relatively recent admissions, as the intent is to administer the treatment as quickly 
as possible after the presentation  
• ‘Confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection by laboratory testing <7 2 hours prior to randomization…’ changed 
to ‘… testing within 10 days prior to screening…’, because 72 hours is too narrow a window given the 
clinical course of the disease  
Other changes:  
• An extended follow -up period of an additional 60 days of observationa l follow up (on top of the current 
active treatment duration of 30 days) has been added in response to a health authority request to consider 
following this patient population for longer than the 30 -day treatment period. The intent of this extended 
observa tional follow -up period is to examine any potential longer -term effects of dapagliflozin 10 mg 
compared with placebo, after cessation of investigational product (added Sections  4.4and 8.5.7 , and 
updated the Synopsis, Section 1.2, Section s 1.4 and 5.1.4 , Figure  1, and Table 1, including footnote ‘g’ ). 
Section  3.9.3  text updated to clarify that discontinued patients should be followed up to Day 90. 
• As soon as the pre -planned number of events has been reached, the database will be locked and 
unblinded for the analysis of 30 -day treatment period data. After that, data collected on patients ongoing 
in the 60 -day observational follow -up period will be unblinded (Section 8.1). 
• The proportion of patients randomized without a confirmed SARS -CoV -2–positive test will be closely 
monitored, and may be capped if it becomes greater than anticipated (added to Synopsis, Section 8.2 and 
as a footnote to the relevant inclusion criterion in Section  3.1). This is to ensure that the dominant 
majority of patients in the study are confirmed SARS -CoV -2– positive, given that this is the intended 
patient population.  
• IRT, instead of a call center, i s providing the kit identification number (Section s 3.6 and 3.7). 
• Recruitment period updated from ‘approximately 3 months’ to ‘approximately 6 months’, and the 
estimated date of last patient completed updated from ‘3Q 2020’ to ‘4Q 2020’ in the Synopsis  and 
Section 9.3 to reflect the latest status . 
• Number and location of sites increased to approximately 90 sites in North America, Latin America, and 
Europe (Synopsis and Sections 1.2 and 1.3.2 ). 
• ‘Refer to the Study Contact List for additional country fax numbers’ added to  contact 
details in Section 6.5. 
• Reference to the DAPA ACT HF -TIMI 68 clinical trial added (Sections 1.1and 11). 
Clarifications:  
• In Table 1 (study plan), footnote ‘h’ added to clarify that concomitant medication is recorded at Day  15 
for previously discharged patients. Section  4.2 updated accordingly.  
• Made clear that all safety assessments in Section 5.2 should be recorded d aily approximately between  
06:00 and 08:00 in the morning . 
• Removed the reference to daily collection of concomitant medications in Section 7.7 to align with Table 
1. 
• The system for generating the randomization scheme was revised from  ‘AZRand’ to ‘a validated 
system’, as AZRand will not be used (Section 3.5).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  6 of 76  An episode of doubling s -Creatinine compared to baseline  during index hospitalization  
 or SAE with preferred term of acute kidney injury following discharge and through Day 30  
This is to identify all acute kidney injury events during the 30 -day treatment period.  
Change s to the exploratory outcome measure s in the Synopsis and Section 2.4: 
• Quantitative PCR for SARS -CoV -2 is removed as availability of quantitative PCR data is uncertain. 
Evaluation of quantitative PCR data, if availab le, will be pre -specified in the SAP.  
• ‘Out of hospital’ is removed from ‘ Total number of days alive , out of hospital,  and not on renal 
replacement therapy ’ to simplify the endpoint. It does no t change the nature of the endpoint . Clarified 
that the total number of days not on renal replacement therapy refers to the index hospitalization only.  
• Phrase in brackets in ‘Change in NT -proBNP, hs troponin, D -dimer, LDH, ALT, lymphocyte count, CRP 
between Day 1 and Day 15 (or discharge fro m hospital, whichever is earlier) ’replaces ‘(or last available 
assessment)’ to make the timepoint  consistent with other  exploratory outcome measures . 
Change s to sites and number of patients planned in the Synopsis and in Section s 1.4 and 8.2: 
• Number of patients to be randomized increased  from 900 to approximately 1200  to provide adequate 
power for  the dual  primary  endpoint s. 
• Sites will also be located in India.  
• Recruitment period updated to ‘approximately 8 months’, and the estimated date of last patient 
completed updated to ‘1Q 2021 ’ in the Synopsis and Section 9.3 because of the increase in the number of 
patients  and lower than expected recruitment rate . 
Changes to exclusion criter ia in Sectio n 3.2. 
• Criteria 1 and 2 are updated to simplify the description of mechanical ventilation and include BiPAP.   
Other changes  
• Global Clinical Lead changed to Anna Maria Langkilde on protocol approval page.  
• Section  1.1 is updated with the latest information about COVID -19 and to ref lect the unpredictable and 
fast-evolving pandemic necessitating a change in the primary objective.  When referring to the SARS -
CoV -2 infection in the study, the term ve rified is removed since verification is not protocol mandated.  
• Section 1.2 is updated  with the latest information about COVID -19 that supports the changes to the 
primary endpoint.  
• India is added to ‘Patients with T2DM will be monitored in the hospital as part of standard of care, which 
in North America, Latin America, Europe, and India includes blood glucose monitoring. ’ in 
Section  1.3.2 . 
• ‘T2DM’ and ‘T1DM’ replaced with ‘clinical studies in various clinical settings’ in the statement about 
the safety profile of dapagliflozin in Section 1.3.2 , since dapagliflozin has been studied also in patients 
with HF and  CKD  without diabetes,  etc. 
• Randomization will be stratified within each country to ensure balanced treatment allocation (Synopsis 
and Sectio n 3.5).  
• Attempts to contact a patient who cannot be reached should continue to be documented but not in the 
medical records (Sectio n 3.9.3 ). 
• Removed the constraint that ‘Incorrect  enrollment’ as a reason for withdrawal is only valid for screen 
failures in Section  3.10.1 . This is  to more accurately reflect study procedures . 
• Remo ved the statement ‘If a patient withdraws from the study, he or she may request destruction of any 
samples taken, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records.’ to more accurately 
reflect study procedures.  
• Expected standar d of care lab oratory assessment broadened to allow for other means of acid -base 
monitoring (per local standard of care ) than a basic metabolic panel ( Table 1). Made clear that the 
associated footnote ‘c’ refers to daily assessment while hospitalized.  
• Time points for assessments are replaced with cross -references to the study plan in Section s 4.2, 5.1.3 , 
and 5.1.4  to avoid  inconsistencies .

because the analysis of this endpoint will automatically be included as a componen t of one o f the dual 
primary endpoints, and  will be pre -specified in the SAP.   
• Definitions of reportable SAEs, DAEs, and/or key safety events are added ( Section 6.4.2 ). 
• Text referring to reportable SAEs, DAEs, and key safety events are updated in Sections 5.2.3  and 6.4. 
•  ‘ ’ is replaced by ‘ The Sponsor or delegate ’ in retaining  the right to request additional 
information  about unresolved events, in Sect ion 6.4.4  to more accurately reflect the trial conduct . 
• Fatal events due to disease progression must be reported as SAEs , added to Section  6.4.1 . 
• Causality assessment in relation to other medication is not assessed so is removed from Sectio n 6.4.5 . 
• Overdose Sectio n 6.7 is revised so th at only an overdose associated with a SAE is to be reported.  
• Executive Committee will make final decisions, not recommendations, with regard to early stopping or 
modifications to the study in Section  6.9. 
• Orogastric tube as an option for administration of investigational product during mechanical ventilation 
added in the Synposis and in Section 7.2. 
• Rem oved the accountability of the study personnel for returned investigational product since patients are 
not asked to return their unused investigational product (Section 7.6). 
• This is no longer an event -driven study, so references to it being event -driven are removed from the 
Synopsis and Section 8.2. The study will remain blinded until the 30 -day database lock (updated in 
Section 8.1).  
• The methods for statistical analysis are revised in Section  8.5 to reflect the dua l primary endpoint.  
Clarifications:  
• ‘Mild to moderate  COVID -19’ removed from target population description in the Synopsis as ‘mild to 
moderate’  description is not aligned with the FDA definition of severity of the disease . 
• Made clear that allocation of IP is blinded in Secti on 1.3.1 . 
• Made clear that patients must  have  SpO2 ≥ 94% while receiving  low-flow supplemental oxygen (5 liters 
or less) to meet inclusion criterion number 7 in Section 3.1. Removed ‘mild to moderate disease’  as it is 
not aligned with the FDA definition of severi ty of the disease , and defining severity of disease is not 
necessary for this criterion.  
• Removed reference to weekly monitoring of blinded safety data by the IDSMC  in Section 3.7.1 —the 
monitoring frequency is included in the IDSMC charter.  
• Made clear in Section 3.7.1  that, in addition to the Sponsor, the Sponsor representatives are blinded in all 
data transfers provided to the IDSMC.  
• A footnote is added to the NEWS 2 row in the study plan ( Table 1) to clarify that NEWS 2 is only 
collected while the patient is hospitalized.  
• A footnote is added to the SAEs row in the study plan ( Table 1) to cross -reference the definition of a 
reportable event.  
• Stipulated a ± 3 -day window for the Day 15 and Day 30 follow -up calls after hospital discharge in 
Section  4.3. 
• Stipulated a ± 7 -day window for the Day 60 and Day 90 follow -up calls after hospital discharge in 
Section  4.4 and Table 1. 
• Made clearer throughout Section  6.4 that only reportable events are recorded.  
• Made clear that reportable events  are recorded on a daily basis during index hospitalization and at 
Discharge, as well as during pre -specified po st discharge phone follow up visits  in Section  6.4. 
Administrative:  
• Additional definition of stage 3 to 4 CKD (ie, eGFR ≥  25 mL/min/1.73m2) is removed in Section 1.2, as 
it is not fully consistent with the inclusion  criteri on and is not a necessary detail for this section.  
• The title of Section 5.1.1  is changed from ‘Endpoint Event’ to ‘Primary Endpoint Events’.  
• HbA1c is removed from Table 2 in Section 5.1.5 . It had been included in the list of lab variables in error.  
• Typographical error is corrected in the Levey et al 2009 citation  in Section 5.1.5 .

dose of investigational product at Day 30, patients are followed up  for an extended additional 
(observational) period of 60  days (total duration of follow up 90 days), with telephone visits 
on Day  60 and Day 90.  
Objectives  
All of the objectives are assessed during the 30 -day treatment period.  
Primary objective:  Outcome measure:  
To determine whether dapagliflozin  10 mg is 
superior to placebo, in terms of reducing  
complications  or all-cause mortality, or 
improving clinical recovery in  patients 
hospitalized with COVID -19. Dual primary endpoints of:  
 
Prevention of COVID -19 complications or death  
During the 30 -day treatment period, t ime to first 
occurrence of new/worsened organ dysfunction during 
index hospitalization  or death from any cause.  
New/worsened organ dysfunction is defined as at least one 
of the following:  
• Respiratory decompensation requiring initiation of 
mechanical ventilation (includes invasive or 
non-invasive ventilation, CPAP, or BiPAP), and/or 
initiation of ECMO  
• New or worsening congestive HFa 
• Requirement for vasopressor therapy and/or inotropic 
or mechanical circulatory support  
• Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation lasting at least 
30 seconds and/or associated with hemodynamic 
instability or pulseless electrical activity, or 
resuscitated cardiac arrest  
• Doubling of s -Creatinine or init iation of renal 
replacement therapy  
 
Improving clinical recovery  
Hierarchical composite outcome measure:  
1 Death from any cause through Day 30  
2 New/worsened organ dysfunction (as defined above)  
3 Clinical status  at Day 30 for patients still hospitalized 
and without any worsening organ dysfunction  (using 
points 3 to 5 of a 7 -point ordinal scaleb) 
4 Hospital discharge before Day 30 and alive at Day  30 
 
a Congestive HF is defined as  at least one of the following 1) initiation of new intravenous the rapy for heart 
failure 2) reinstitution of previous intravenous therapy for heart failure 3) increase in current intravenous 
therapy for heart failure. This is based on modification on previous definition of in -hospital worsening heart 
failure  (McMurray et al 2007 )

To ensure balance within  countries, stratification will be employed. Given the unpredictable 
and rapidly -shifting incidence of COVID -19 across different countries, balanced 
representation across countries cannot be ensured.  
The proportion of patients rando mized without a confirmed SARS -CoV-2–positive test will be 
closely monitored, and may be capped if it becomes greater than anticipated.  
Duration of T reatment  
Eligible patients will be randomized to start treatment with either dapagliflozin 10 mg or 
placebo daily  (double -blind) as soon as possible.  
Investigational product  will be administered for 30 days, with  follow -up assessments every 
24 hours until either hospital discharge, Day 30, or death.  Patients discharged from hospital 
will continue with th eir treatment for the remainder of the 30 days and be followed up by 
telephone on Day 15 and/or Day 30.  After the last dose of investigational product at Day 30, 
patients are followed up for an extended additional (observational) period of 60  days (total 
duration of follow up 90 days), with telephone visits on Day  60 and Day 90.  
Investigational Product , Dosage and Mode o f Administration  
Patients will be randomi zed 1:1 to either d apagliflozin 10 mg or placebo once daily per oral 
use. Every attempt should be made to maintain patients on dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching 
placebo d uring the course of the study.  The investigational product should be taken as soon as 
possible after randomization and then once daily in the morning, at approximately the same

For patients requiring a mechanical ventilator, the tablet will be crushed and flushed with 
water down the patient’s nasogastric (or orogastric) tube. The tube will then be rinsed with 
water to ensure all the tabl et has been consumed.  
Statistical M ethods  
The primary objectives are to determine the superiority of dapagliflozin versus placebo in 
reducing the incidence of complications or all-cause mortality (prevention of worsening 
COVID -19) or improving clinical recovery in p atients hospitalized with COVID -19. The 
treatment effect on prevention of worsening COVID -19 or clinical recovery will be tested as 
dual primary endpoints.  
The treatment effect on prevention will be assessed as the time to first event of the composite 
endpoint of complications or all-cause mortality, analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards

endpoint, us ing a win ratio analysis method .  
It is estimated that a sample size of approximately 1200 patients w ill provide adequate power 
to detect the treatment effect on prevention or recovery, when the dual endpoints are tested 
with alpha split between these outcomes . 
All patients randomized will be included in the full analysis set according to their randomized  
investigational product assignment, irrespective of the treatment actually received. The full 
analysis set will be considered the primary analysis set for the primary, secondary, and 
exploratory efficacy variables.  
All patients who received at least 1 dos e of randomized treatment will be included in the 
safety pop ulation. Patients will be analyz ed according to the tr eatment actually received. The 
safety analysis set will be considered the primary analysis set for all safety variables.  
Interim analysis for safety only will be performed by an independent data and safety 
monitoring committe e after the first 100  patients have completed the 30 -day treatment period ; 
no interim efficacy analyses are planned.

1.1 Background and Rationale for Conducting this Study  
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) was first identified in 
Wuhan, China, in December 2019 as the cause of an outbreak of COVID -19, a type of viral 
pneumonia. The following COVID -19 pandemic has since then affected millions of peop le 
worldwide. Early epidemiologic data indicated that ~12% of SARS -CoV-2-positive patients 
develop symptoms requiring hospitalization, and of these, nearly 24% may need intensive care 
(CDC 2020 , Guan et al 2020 ). In the US, approximately 14% of COVID -19 infected patients 
have required hospitalization and  about 14% of the hospitalized patients (2% of the total) have 
been admitted to ICUs (NIH COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines ). Hospital admission occurs  at 
a median time of Day 7 from the onse t of symptoms, and many recover  with supportive care 
(Huang et al 2020 ). In others, progressive deterioration is seen . Although respiratory failure is 
a key manifestation in most patients with COVID -19, it is increasingly being recognized that 
COVID -19 is a systemic disease in which cardiovascular and kidney complications are 
common, and may be key drivers of poor outcom es, including death ( Arentz et al 202 , Guzik 
et al 2020 , Li et al 2020 , Madjid et al 2020 , Ronco et al 2020 ). As an example, nearly 80% of 
patients hospitalized with COVID -19 have evidence of ca rdiac involvemen t (Puntmann et al 
2020 ). In addition, average NT -proBNP among critically ill patients in one of the initial 
reports from the US was ~4700  pg/mL (higher than what is typically seen in trials of patients 
with HF and r educed ejection fraction). It is possible (and likely), based on these findings, that 
HF may be a significant component of the disease process. Furthermore, nearly 30% of 
patients had evidence of acute myocardial injury ( Shi et al 2020 ). The risk of disease 
progression, need for intensive care, and death was dramatically higher in COVID -19 patients 
that develop cardiac injury versus those that do not (ris k of death is 51% versus 14%). 
Collectively, these findings suggest that cardiovascular complications are prominent in 
patients hospitalized with COVID -19 and appear to be key drivers of poor outcomes and 
death. It thus follows that prevention of these com plications may lead to lower risk of disease 
progression and death.  
Risk factors for adverse outcomes associated with COVID -19 include older age and presence 
of cardiometabolic comorbidities such as T2DM, ASCVD, hypertension, HF and CKD 
(Arentz et al 202 , Grasselli et al 2020 , Guan et al 2020 , NIH COVID -19 Treatment 
Guidelines ). Individuals that have a combination of such underlying health conditions, and 
with evidence of acute cardiac involvement and/or kidney injury, have a high risk of death due 
to COVID -19 (Guo et al 2020 , Pranata et al 2020 , Ronco et al 2020 , Shi et al 2020 , Vrsalovic  
and Vrsalovic Presecki  2020 ). The underlying mechanisms for this greater risk are not yet 
fully understood, but compromised baseline organ function and metabo lism combined with 
greater susceptibility to endothelial injury, inflammatory insults and tissue hypoxia are likely

Currently, remdesivir is the only drug  approved for treatment of hospitalized patients with 
COVID -19 by the FDA . Dexamethasone ha s been authorized for emergency use in 
hospitalized COVID -19 patients , and remdesivir and dexamethasone are recommended 
therapies in the NIH guidelines (NIH COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines ). Remdesivir is an 
anti-viral therapy (with limited supply) recommended to be used for 5 days or until hospital 
discharge in hospitalized patients with COVID -19 who require supplement oxygen but who do 
not require mechanical  or high -flow devic e ventilation. Dexamethasone, an anti -inflammatory 
drug, is also recommended for treatment up to 10 days or until discharge in hospitalized 
COVID -19 patients. The evidence is stronger for a positive effect of this treatment when the 
patients are mechanically ventilated . 
Over the past several months, the unpredictable nature of the evolving global pandemic and 
the change in available medications for treatment of COVID -19 resulted in lower rates of 
complications and death than what was obse rved during the pandemic’s  initial phase. As a 
consequence, faster and more complete recovery has now become an important treatment goal 
on par with prevention of complications and death in patients hospitalized with COVID -19. 
Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2,  the major transporter responsible for renal sodium and glucose 
reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. In addition to the primary 
action, SGLT2 inhibitors including dapagliflozin have been shown to provide substantial 
cardiorenal pro tection in patient populations similar to those at risk for COVID -19 
complications , namely, patients with T2DM, ASCVD, HF, and CKD. SGLT2 inhibitors were 
shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney events in patients with T2DM in 4 large 
outcome trials investigating empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin ( Neal et al 2017 , 
Perkovic et al 2019 , Wiviott et al 2019 , Zinman et al 2015 ). In the DAPA -HF trial, 
dapagliflozin reduced the risk of death and worsening of HF by 26% in patients with HFrEF, 
with identical effects in patients with and without T2DM ( McMurr ay et al 2019 , Petrie et al 
2020 ). These benefits were observed within days and were significant by 28 days of treatment 
(Sabatine et al 201 9). SGLT2 inhibitors also consistently reduce the risk of kidney disease 
progression and acute kidney injury ( Neal et al 2017 , Perkovic et al 2019 , Wiviott et al 2019 , 
Zinman et al 2015 ). Recently released results from the DAPA -CKD trial demonstrate a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit  of dapagliflozin on the risk of 
worsening of renal function or death in adult patients with CKD; with and without T2DM 
(Heerspink et al 2020 ). 
The mechanisms that could explain the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors overlap 
substantially with those involved in COVID -19. Firstl y, the decrease in glucose and insulin 
levels, shift of energy metabolism to increased lipid oxidation with reduced reliance on

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  23 of 76 glucose, and inhibition of glycolysis may be especially important in COVID -19, as SARS -
CoV-2 may depend on the glycolytic pathwa y for its replication, stimulating lipogenesis that 
appears to be one of the key drivers of cellular damage ( Codo et al 2020 , Daniele et al 2016 ). 
Secondly, SGLT2 inhibitors improve endothelial function within 48 hours of treatment, 
probably because of reduced oxidative stress, and have significant anti -inflammatory effects 
with reduction of C -reactive protein and interleukin -6 (Bonnet and Scheen 2018 , Solini et al 
2017 ). In addition, experimental studies have shown reduced activation of the NLRP3 
inflammasome, and protection against septic acute kidne y injury on SGLT2 inhibitor 
treatment ( Kim et al 2020 , Maayah et al 2020 ). SGLT2 inhibitors also increase erythropoiesis 
resulting in increased haematocrit, which together with improved endothelial function may 
improve oxygen delivery to tissues ( Ghanim et al 2020 , Lambers Heerspink et al 2013 , Solini 
et al 2017 ). Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the extracellular volume in patients with fluid 
overload, such as those with CKD and HF ( Griffin et al 2020 , Ohara et al 2020 ), and appear to 
rapidly reduce pulmonary artery pressure in patients with HF, leading to hemodynamic 
decongestion ( Mullens et al 20 20). Taken together, SGLT2 inhibitors may  favorably impact 
multiple processes, including but not limited to energy metabolism, endothelial function, 
oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy, that are dysregulated during a major acute 
illness such as COVID -19 (Aragón -Herrera  et al 2019 ,  Esterline et al 2018 , Ferrannini 2017 , 
Kim et al 2020 , Packer 2020 , Tanaka  et al 2018 ). Such metabolic restoration may help to 
prevent multi -organ damage in the setting of COVID -19, and could provide critical and 
complementary efficacy to other therapeutic approaches across various stages of the disease 
course, including remdesivir and dexamethasone, in patients hospitalized with COVID -19 but 
not yet critically ill ( Ayres 2020 ). 
Therefore, we hypothesize that dapagliflozin, a potent, highly -selective, and orally -active 
inhibitor of human renal SGLT2, has the potential to afford end-organ protection against 
SARS -CoV-2-mediated injury (ie, lowering the risk of cardiova scular and kidney 
complications  and multi -organ failure ), thereby, reducing  the risk of morbid complications and 
improving clinical recovery. Our dual primary objecti ves are, therefore, aligned to capture 
both critical components of treatment benefit (prevention of complications and improving 
clinical recovery). Finding a therapeutic effect for either or both dual primary endpoints 
would, therefore, be considered a sig nificant and clinically meaningful benefit for patients 
hospitalized with COVID -19. If found to be effective, SGLT2i are already approved (for 
different indications) and available in most countries, and have a well -established safety 
profile, having been s tudied in tens of thousands of patients, and having been prescribed to 
millions around the world since their introduction in 2011.  
In this study, patients hospitalized with SARS -CoV-2 infection that are at high risk for 
complications will be treated with d apagliflozin or matching placebo for 30 days to investigate 
the effects on risk of complications  and all -cause death , or improvement in clinical recovery in

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  24 of 76 adult patients hospitalized with COVID -19 compared to placebo.  
1.2 Rationale for Study Design, Doses an d Control Groups  
This is a randomized, multicenter , double -blind, placebo -controlled , parallel -group, P hase III 
study  in countries with high prevalence of COVID -19 (countries in North America, Latin 
America, and Europe , plus India ). Randomiz ation and doubl e-blinding study treatment will 
minimiz e potential bias.  
Patients with serious COVID -19 complications, including death, frequently have 
cardiometabolic disease (hypertension, T2DM, ASCVD , HF, and/or kidney disease at 
baseline) ( Arentz et al 202 , Grasselli et al 2020 , Guan et al 2020 , NIH COVID -19 Treatment 
Guidelines ). Individuals that have a combination of such underlying health conditions, and 
with evidence of acute cardiac involvement and/or kidney injury, have a high risk of death due 
to COVID -19 (Guo et al 2020 , Pranata et al 2020 , Ronco et al 2020 , Shi et al 2020  Vrsalovic  
and Vrsalovic Presecki  2020 ). These findings sugge st that cardiovascular and kidney 
complications are prominent in patients hospitalized with COVID -19 and appear to be key 
drivers of poor outcomes and death. It thus follows that prevention of these complications may 
lead to either lower risk of disease pr ogression or improved clinical recovery. In summary, the 
patients at highest risk of COVID -19 complications appear to be those with cardiometabolic 
disease at baseline and the rate of cardiorenal complications in the setting of COVID -19 is 
high—especially in patients with pre -existing card iovascular and kidney disease.  
SGLT2 inhibitors may favorably impact multiple processes, including but not limited to 
energy metabolism, endothelial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy, that 
are dysregulated during a major acute illness such as C OVID -19 (Aragón -Herrera  et al 2019 ,  
Esterline et al 2018 , Ferrannini 2017 , Kim et al 2020 , Packer 2020 , Tanaka  et al 2018 ). Such 
metabolic restoration may help to preven t multi -organ damage or  improve  clinical recovery in 
the setting of COVID -19, and could provide critical and complementary efficacy to other 
therapeutic approaches across various stages of the disease course.  
The study population will include hospitalized patients with respirato ry manifestations of 
COVID -19 of any duration, but without the need for mechanical ventilation. The eligible 
patients should have a medical history including risk factors for developing serious 
complications of COVID -19. These risk factors include patients  with a history of 
hypertension, T2DM, ASCVD , HF and/or CKD stage 3 to 4. Patients with reduced renal 
function usually present a clinical profile of increased intra glomerular pressure, hypertension, 
proteinuria and fluid/sodium overload. Existing data dem onstrate that SGLT2 inhibition can 
improve all these abnormalities ( Kosiborod et al 2017 , McMurr ay et al 2019 , Neal et al 2017 , 
Perkovic et al 2019 , Wiviott et al 2019 , Zinman et al 2015 ). Thus, patients with HF and 
reduced renal function could be expected to benefit from treatment with dapagliflozin.

IND 149478  
EudraCT 2020 -001473 -79 Date 20 November 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  25 of 76 Patients will be treated for 30 days, with either dapagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo , each to 
be given in addition to the usual standard of care  in the participating hospital. In the natural 
course of the disease, s erious complications of COVID -19 can occur up to 10 to 15 days after 
the start of symptoms , so the treatment period of 30 day s should be sufficient to assess 
efficacy. Per the  protocol, treatment with dapagliflozin or matching placebo will continue even 
if mechanical ventilation becomes necessary . In that case, t he tablets will be  crushed and 
given to the patient via the gastric tube. The 10 -mg dose of dapagliflozin has a 
well-characteriz ed efficacy and safety profile in the T2DM clinical development program and 
is the recommended dose in the majority of countries worldwide.  All patients will be treated 
according t o local guidelines on standard of care treatment for patients with COVID -19. 
The study assessments include only those that are absolutely critical for ensuring the safety of 
the patient s, to measur e efficacy outcomes,  and collect biomarker data , so as not to place too 
high a burden on the study personnel and to minimize additional risk of exposure  to 
SARS -CoV-2.  
The dual primary efficacy endpoints of the study are time to first event of either compli cations 
or death from any cause,  and improved clinical re covery through 30 days of follow -up. An 
extended follow -up period of 60 days (after the 30 -day treatment period) is included, in order 
to examine longer -term trajectory of recovery from COVID -19 among trial participants.  
The safety data will be monitored by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
and an interim safety analysis  of the first 100 patients will be performed . 
1.3 Benefit/risk and Ethical A ssessment  
Dapagliflozin has global marketing approval in more than 90 countries. More detailed 
information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of 
dapagliflozin may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. The following is a su mmary of 
benefit -risk considerations relevant to the COVID -19 target population.  
1.3.1 Potential Benefits to Subject s 
All patients in the study are expected to be treated optimally according to background local 
standard of care therapy, including treatments to c ontrol co -morbidities. Dapagliflozin or 
matching placebo will be administered in addition to these treatments.  
These patients are hospitalized and will receive close medical attention , irrespective of blinded 
treatment allocation . 
1.3.2 Potential Risks to Subjec ts 
The safety profile of dapagliflozin is already well established from prior clinical studies  in

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  26 of 76 various clinical settings. These studies have demonstrated that dapagliflozin  is generally safe 
and well tolerated . 
Dapagliflozin, as an inhibitor of SGLT2, i ncreases urinary glucose excretions, which is 
commonly believed to increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections 
have been reported in dapagliflozin -treated patients in a slightly higher proportion than in 
placebo -treated patients  in some global P hase III studies , although the rates of urinary tract 
infections (and serious urinary tract infections) observed in large clinical trials of dapagliflozin 
and other SGLT2i have been similar to placebo  (Wiviott et al 2019 , McMurr ay et al 2019 ). 
Increased urinary glucose excretion may also l ead to an increased risk of developing genital 
infec tions. G enital infections are cons idered common side effect s (in ≥1/100 to <1/10 
patients).  
Dapagliflozin reduces BP and may reduce blood volume from its diuretic effect, which could 
be a concern in patients with COVID -19, but could also be an important mechanism  of a 
potential treatment effect. A pooled analysis of patients with T2DM and HF in the 
dapagliflozin development program, showed no incre ase of volume depletion events, but an 
increase in renal events, mainly creatinine increases, in patients treated with dapagliflozin 
(n=171) compared with patients treated with placebo (n=149). About half of the patients were 
on loop diuretics ( Kosiborod et al 2017 ). In the dapagliflozin T2DM program, the rate of 
events related to volume depletion and impaired renal function ha s been similar between 
dapag liflozin and placebo.  
Dapagliflozin has not been shown to induce hypoglyc emia in non -diabetic patients. In clinical 
pharmacology studies, healthy subjects have been treated with single oral doses of up to 
500 mg and multiple oral doses of 100 mg up to 14 days without any hypoglyc emic events.  
However, in patients with T2DM and on insulin or sulfonylurea medication, there is an 
increased risk of hypoglyc emia. Patients with T2DM will be monitored in the hospital as part 
of standard of care, which in North Ame rica, Latin America, Europe , and India  includes  blood 
glucose monitoring.  
There have been reports of ketoacidosis, including DKA , in patients with T2DM taking 
dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors. Diabetic ketoacidosis is considered a rare (in 
≥1/10000 to <1/1000 patients) adverse drug reaction for dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM.  
Patients treated with dapagliflozin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with 
ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and shor tness of breath, 
should be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L 
(250 mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, interruption of dapagliflozin treatment should be 
considered, and the patient should be evaluated promptly.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  27 of 76 Predisposing factors to ketoacidosis include a low beta -cell function reserve resulting from 
pancreatic disorders (eg, type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), insulin 
dose reduction, reduced caloric intake, or increased insulin req uirements caused by infections, 
illness or surgery and alcohol abuse. Dapagliflozin should be used with caution in p atients in 
these circumstances.  
1.3.2.1  Protection Against Risks  
Appropriate measures are in  place to monitor and minimi ze potential risks to partic ipating 
patients , including the use of a n IDSMC  that will continuously evaluate safety data . Patients 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus and patients with a history of DKA  are excluded from this study.  
Careful , frequent  monitoring of acid -base balance of dia betes patients with T2DM during 
hospitaliz ation is important and represents a standard of care in most institutions . Should there 
be an abnormal increase in anion gap and/or reduced bicarbonate levels, measurement of 
blood levels of ketones, lactate, and anal ysis of pH must be performed if DKA is suspected. 
Also,  if careful monitoring of acid -base balance according to Table 1 can’t be performed, 
dosing of study medication  should be temporarily interrupted until monitoring can be 
resumed. At discharge, patients with diabetes should be instructed about symptoms assoc iated 
with DKA and to seek immediate health care contact if such symptoms occur.  
A diagnosis of DKA should only be made in a clinical setting consistent with DKA (based on 
patient history, symptoms, and physical exam) and in the absence of more likely alte rnative 
diagnoses and causes of acidosis (such as lactic acidosis). The following biochemical data 
should support diagnosis:  
• Keton emia ≥3.0 mmol/L and/or significant ketonuria (more than 2+ on standard urine 
sticks) in the absence of elevated lactate (lact ate should be <2 mmol/L to be considered a 
potential DKA)  
and 
• At least one of the following criteria suggesting high anion gap metabolic acidosis:  
(a) Arterial or Venous pH ≤7.3  
(b) Serum bicarbonate ≤18 mEq/L  
(c) Anion gap [Na – (Cl + HCO3)] >10  
 
1.3.3 Conclusion  
Considering the nonclinical and clinical experience with dapagliflozin and the precautions 
included in the study protocol, participation in this study should present a minimal and thus 
acceptable risk to eligible patients.  This clinical study will test the  hypothesis that 
dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in reducing the risk of complications  or death , or

This is an international, multicenter, parallel -group, randomized, dou ble-blind, 
placebo -controlled, P hase III study in approximately 1200  hospitalized  adult COVID -19 
patients.  The study is evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10  mg versus placebo, given once 
daily for  30 days in addition to background local standard of care therapy, including 
treatments to control co -morbidities.  The scre ening period should be as short as possible (no 
more than 2  days), and patients should start investigational product the same day as 
randomization.  Following last dose of investigational product at Day 30 patients are followed 
up for an extended additional  (observational) period of 60  days.

Investigator (s) or designee should keep a record  (the patient’s screening l og) of patients  who 
entered pre -study screening.  
The Investigator (s) or designe e will: 
1 Obtain informed co nsent from the potential patien t or their guardian/legal representative  
before any  study sp ecific procedures are performed  
2 Assign potential su bject a unique enrolment number  
3 Determine patient  eligibility ( see Section s 3.1 and 3.2). More than 1 attempt to meet th e 
randomization criteria is allowed  
4 Assign eligible patient a  unique randomiz ation code  
5 If a patient  withdraws from participation in the study,  then his/her 
enrolment/randomization code cannot be reused  
 
Randomi zation codes will be  assigned strictly sequen tially as patients become eligible for 
randomiz ation  (see Section 3.5).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  35 of 76 3.4 Procedures for Handling Incorrectly Enrolled o r Randomized 
Subjects  
Patients  who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be 
enrolle d or receive investigational product . There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients  
who are enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all the eligibility criteria must not be 
randomized or initiated on treatment  (note that more than 1 attempt to meet the randomization 
criteria is allowed).  
Where a patient  does not meet all the eligibi lity criteria but is randomized in  error, or 
incorrectly started on treatment, the Investigator s hould inform the Sponsor  immediately, and 
a discussion should o ccur between the Sponsor  and the Investigator regarding whether to 
continue or discontinue the p atient from  treatment.  The Sponsor  must ensure all decisions are 
appropriately documented.  
3.5 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups  
All patients will be randomly assigned to investigational product centrally using an Interactive 
Response Technology system . Randomization to investigational product will be performed in 
balanced blocks to ensure app roximate balance between the treatment groups (1:1). The 
Sponsor or delegate  is responsible  for generating the randomization scheme for this study 
using a valid ated system . Before the study starts, the instructions for accessing and using the 
Interactive Response Technology system will be provided to each site.  
Investigational product (dapagliflozin or placebo) should be administered the same day  the 
investigational pr oduct kit number is assigned  and as soon after randomization as possible . 
To ensure balance d randomization , stratification will be employed  by countr y.  
3.6 Methods for Ensuring Blinding  
The blinding of treatment is ensured by using a double -blind technique  of matching placebo . 
The IRT will provide the Investigator with the kit identification number to be allocated to the 
patient when investigational product  is dispensed.  
No member of the extended Sponsor study team, personnel at study sites,  study 
team , or the Sponsor’s delegate handling study data will have access to the randomization 
scheme during the study. The Sponsor  or delegate generating  the randomi zation scheme and 
the Supply Chain Study Management may be able to access the rando mization scheme as 
appropriate. Neither the patient nor any of the Investigator’s staff/designee who are involved 
in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the patients will be aware of the 
treatment received. In the event that the treatmen t allocation for a patient becomes known to

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  36 of 76 the Investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor immediately .  
3.7 Methods for U nblinding  
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatm ent randomization for each randomiz ed 
patient , will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists at the study site  from the  IRT. 
Instructions for code breaking/unblinding are provided to each study site . 
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient  requires kno wledge of the treatment randomiz ation. The date and 
reason that the blind was broken must be recorded i n the source documentati on and eCRF as 
applicable. The Investigator is to document and report  the action to the Sponsor or Sponsor 
representative , without revealing the treatment given to the patient . 
The Sponsor or Sponsor representative  retains the right to break the code for S AEs that are 
unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to the investigational product and that 
potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authoriti es.  
3.7.1 Unblinding for Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
An ID SMC will be established to monitor blinded safety data to ensure the safety of patients 
enrolled in this study, and to ensu re the integrity of the study. An interim analysis of safety 
only (not efficacy) will occur when appr oximately 100 patients complete  the 30-day treatment 
period. The IDSMC  will be provided with partially unblinded data (data that are summariz ed 
by treatment group using masked treatment group labels). The IDSMC  may choose to unblind 
the data for ad ditional review as specified in the IDSMC  charter. The Sponsor and Sponsor 
representatives will remain blinded to all data transfers provided to the IDSMC . Details about 
the IDSMC  will be included in the IDSMC  Charter  (see Section  6.9.2 ). 
3.8 Restrictions  (Not Applicable)  
There are no restrictions affecting the patient’s daily life activities associated with 
participation in the study during the course of the study.  
3.9 Discontinuation of Investigatio nal Product  
If the patient temporarily or permanently discontinues from investigational product , it is 
important that the scheduled study visits, data collection and procedures continue according to 
the stu dy protocol until study closure (see the Study pla n in Table 1). 
Patient s may be discontinued f rom investigational product  in the following situations:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  37 of 76 • Patient  decision . The patient  is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice 
to further treatment  
• Adverse e vent or other safety reasons that, in the opinion of the investigator, 
contraindicates further dosing with investigational  product . 
• Severe non -compliance with th e study protocol  
• DKA, consider temporarily interrupting investigational product if DKA is suspected. If 
DKA is confirmed, investigational product should be discontinued permanently  
• Positive pregnancy test (discontinue investigational product and notify th e Sponsor)  
 
3.9.1 Evaluation of Volume Status and Investigational Dose 
Reduction/interruption  
Dapagliflozin is a SGLT2i which by its mechanism of action reduces the reabsorption of 
glucose and sodium in the proximal tubules in the kidney. SGLT2 inhibition has a mild 
diuretic effect and an initial h emodynamic change with an initial increase in creatinine may 
occur.  
Unexpected acute declines in eGFR  
If an unexpected, acute decline in kidney function is observed, the patient should be evaluated.  
V olume depletion, h ypotension, intercurrent medical problems and concomitant drugs may 
cause increases in blood creatinine. Urinary tract infection and urinary obstruction should be 
considered (the latter especially in men). Several drugs may cause a decline in kidney 
functi on, especially NSAIDs and certain antibiotics such as trimethoprim. If any drug is 
suspected of causing or contributing to worsening kidney function, their use should be 
re-considered.  
Volume depletion/hypotension  
Patients with clinically relevant symptoms /signs of suspected volume depletion and/or 
hypotension, should have their regular medication reviewed, and consideration given to 
reducing the dose of, or stopping concomitant non -essential medications, as assessed on an 
individual basis, including diuret ics and drugs that lower BP (except essential treatments ). The 
need for conventional diuretics (or the dose  of diuretic used) should be re -evaluated in light of 
the patient’s symptoms and signs. In patients with HF, discontinuation of diuretic should only 
be undertaken cautiously. Hypotension may also occur with other BP lowering drugs and once 
again the need for (and dose of) non -essential agents of this type (eg,  calcium channel 
blockers, alpha adrenoceptor antagonists and nitrates)  should also be re -considered.  
3.9.2 Investigational Product R estart  
Restart of randomized investigational product is always encouraged. If stopped, w henever

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  38 of 76 possible, randomized investigational product should be restarted . 
Every attempt should be made to maintain patients on dapagli flozin 10 mg or matching 
placebo during the course of the study. If the dose has been interrupted, the dose should be 
re-introduced as soon as, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient’s condition is stable.  
3.9.3 Procedures for  Discontinuation of Investigational Product  
At any time, patients  are free to discontinue investigational product or withdraw from the 
study (ie , investigational product and assessments —see Section 3.10), without prejudice to 
further treatment . A patient  that decides to discontinue investigational product will always be 
asked about the reason(s) . If investigational product is in a patient’s possession, they should 
dispose of the study drug according to local regulations.  
Discontinuation from investigational product  is not the same as compl ete withdrawal from the 
study. If a patient is completely withdrawn from study, see the procedures in Section 3.10.2 .  
It is essential to collect data for all patients throughout the study. F or that reason, a patient 
who discontinue s investigational produ ct should optimally continue to follow up study 
assessments up to and including Day 90. Alternatively, if the patient does not agree to this 
approach, modified  follow -up should be arranged  (eg, less frequent assessments , one contact 
at Day 30 , or other means) . Patients who agree to some kind of modified follow -up are still 
participating in the study.  The modified visits and procedures that are done will be recorded in 
the eCRF . 
If a patient for some reason cannot be reached during the study, every attempt should be made 
to retrieve as much information regarding this patie nt as possible. The site should 
continuously try to reach the patient, the patient’s family , or pre -identified contact person and 
search for information regarding the patient’s stat us in applicable sources to  protect the 
validity of data. These attempts should be documented . 
3.10 Criteria for W ithdrawal  
3.10.1  Screen F ailures  
Once enrolled in the study, patients can be re -screened one more time, if they do not fully 
meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria during the first attempt at screening. Ultimately, 
screening failures are patients who do not fulfil l the eligibility criteria for the study, and , 
therefore , must not be randomized . These patients should have the reason for study 
withdrawal record ed as ‘Incorrect Enrol lment’ (ie, patient does not meet the required 
inclusion/exclusion criteria) .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  39 of 76 3.10.2  Withdrawal of the Informed Consent  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (investigational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.  Withdrawal of consent should only occur 
if the patient has received appropriate information about, and does not agree to, any kind of 
further assessments or con tact, including modified follow -up options. Discontinuation of 
investigationa l product  in itself is not considered withdrawal of consent.  
A patient who considers withdrawing from the study must be informed by the Investigator 
about modified follow -up options (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a relative or treating 
physician, o r information from medical records).   
If a patient  withdraws from participation in the study,  then his/her enrollment and/or 
randomiz ation code cannot be re used. Withdrawn patients will not  be replaced.  
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  A patient who 
withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the  presence of any AE. The 
Investigator will follow up patients as medically indicated.  
To ensure validity of study data, it is very important to collect as much data as possible 
throughout the study (including after hospital discharge)  and especially vital status (dead or 
alive) (also for patients w ho have with drawn their informed consent). T herefore , if informed 
consent has been withdrawn completely  or the patient is non -contactable following hospital 
discharge , the investigator will attempt to collect information on all patients’ vital status from 
publicly available sources at study closure, in compliance wi th local privacy laws/practices . 
3.11 Discontinuation of the S tudy  
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of the Sponsor, patients  are placed at undue risk 
because of clinically relevant finding s. The judgment may be based on recommendations from 
the IDSMC, see IDSMC Charter for details. The study can also be stopped based on results of 
the interim analysis (see Section 8.5.4 ). 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients ’ interests.

• Doubling of s -Creatinine or i nitiation of renal replacement therapya 
a Duration of mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy events will be collected.  
 
The hierarchical composite endpoint includes all the outcomes defined above. In addition, it 
includes the outcome of hospital discharge as well as any clinical status change in patients 
who are still hospitalized at Day 30 and did not experience any of the events described above. 
Clinical status change will be used as collected in Sec tion 5.1.4  (points 3 to 5).  
5.1.2 Time to Event Endpoint s  
A number of efficacy endpoints, listed below, relate to the timing of an event. Patients are 
reviewed daily for the occurrence of each of these events.  The date and time (24 hr)  (time if 
known) of the event will be recorded.  
• Death  from any cause  
• Hospital discharge  
• Composite kidney endpoint , defined as  composite of acute kidney  injury  or initiati on of 
renal replacement therapy , or death from any cause through Day 30  (See Section  2.2 for 
the definitions of acute kidney injury and r enal replacement therapy)  
 
5.1.3 National  Early Warning Score 2  
The NEWS 2 can be used on all hospitalized patients to allow for the early detection of 
clinical deterioration and potential need for higher level of care. It determines the degree of 
illness of a p atient and prompts critical care intervention.  Patients with low NEWS 2 can 
continue receiving their usual care and observation. Patients with high NEWS 2 should be 
watched more attentively and considered for transfer to a higher care unit such as an ICU.  
A NEWS 2 assessment is recorded as specified in the Study Plan ( Table 1). 
5.1.4 Patient Clinical Status  
A 7-point scale is recorded as specified in the Study Plan ( Table 1) to assess the clinical status 
of the patient:

Section 6 for additional details of safety reporting.  
6 SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  
The PI is responsible  for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the 
content of this section . 
6.1 Definition of Adverse E vents  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical conditio n or the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the  product . An undesirable medical  condition 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg , tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal  results of an investigation (eg , laboratory findings, electrocardiogram) . In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
6.2 Definitions of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE occu rring during any study phase (ie , run-in, treatment, washout, 
follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliz ation  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defec t 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Adverse events for malignant tumors reported during a study should generally be assessed as 
SAEs . If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ criterion should be 
used. In certain situations, however, medical judgement on an individual event basis should be 
applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should be assessed and reported a s a 
non-serious AE. For example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression 

Clinical Study Protocol   
Drug Substance dapagliflozin  Version 4.0

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  50 of 76 occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumor, the AE may not fulfill the attributes for being ass essed as Serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, 
some types  of malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospitalization, may be as sessed as non-serious; examples include Stage  1 
basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy.  
The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed 
by the Investigator(s) and communicate d to the Sponsor.  
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix  A Additional Safety 
Information .  
6.3 Definition of Suspected Unexpected S erious Adverse Event  
A suspected adverse reaction related to an investigational p roduct that is both unexpected and 
serious.  
6.4 Recording of Adverse Events  
Occurrence s of reportable SAEs , DAEs  and safety events of acute kidney injury and  DKA , 
will be recorded on a daily basis during index hospitalization and at Discharge , as we ll as 
during pre -specified post -discharge phone follow up visits.  
6.4.1 Disease P rogression  
Disease progression can be consid ered as a worsening of a patient ’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied . It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease . 
Worsening of the patient’s condition that is directly attri butable to the COVID -19 disease  and 
which occurs during the original (index) hospitalization, is not considered an SAE and must 
not be reported as such  unless it is a fatal event (a fatal event should always be  reported as a 
an SAE).  
If the SAE occurs after the discharge from the primary (index) admission (during the 
follow -up period or re -admission), all events that fit the SAE criteria must be reported as such, 
regardless if they are directly attri butable to t he COVID -19 or not.  
6.4.2 Definition of Reportable Events  
Reportable SAEs are all events leading to death and non -fatal SAEs that are not due to 
worsening of the patient’s condition directly attributable to COVID -19 during the index 
hospitalization. All SAEs occ urring after discharge from the index hospitalization are

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  51 of 76 reportable SAEs.  
All DAEs (for patients receiving investigational product) and key safety events will be 
reported regardless of whether they fulfill the SAE criteria, are directly attributable to th e 
COVID -19 disease, or whether they occur during index hospitalization or after discharge.  
6.4.3 Time Period for Collection o f Adverse Events  
Events fulfilling the reportable SAE criteria , DAEs (for patients receiving investigational 
product),  and/or key safety  events will be collected  from time of informed consent through 
Day 30 . In addition, following the 30 -day treatment period, all SAEs will continue to be 
collected through Day 90 (which includes the extended observational follow -up period of an 
additional 60 days).  
6.4.4 Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at Day 90 in the study are followed up by the Investigator for as 
long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. The Sponsor or delegate  
retains the right to request additional information for any patient  with ongoing reportable 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
6.4.5 Variables  
The following variables will be collect ed for each reportable event (see Section 6.4.2  for the 
definition of reportable event) assessed in the study ; 
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped  
• Maximum intensity or intensity : 
1 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
2 moderate (disturbing but still tolerable)  
3 severe (intolerable)  
• Investigato r causality rating against the investigational p roduct (yes or no)  
• Action taken with regard to investigational product  
• Outcome.  
 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for reportable SAEs:  
• Date AE met criteria for SAE 
• Date Investigator became aware of SAE 
• AE is serious due to

• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy performed  
• Causa lity assessment in relation to s tudy procedure(s)  
• Description of SAE. 
 
It is important to distinguish between SAEs  and severe AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need 
not necessarily be considered serious . For example, nausea that persists for several hours may 
be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. 
On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be 
considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 
6.2. 
6.4.6 Causality C ollection  
The Investigator  will asse ss causal relationship between investigational p roduct and each AE, 
and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?’  
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.  
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix  A Additional 
Safety Information  to the Clinical Study Protocol.  
6.4.7 Adverse Events Based on Signs a nd Symptoms  
All reportable SAEs, key safety events , and DAEs  spontaneously reported by the patient or 
care provider  or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel: ‘Have 
you had any health problems since the previ ous day/you were last asked?’ , or revealed by 
observation will be collected and recorded in the CRF. When collecting reportable AEs, the 
recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms . 
However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally 
part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be  recorded separately.  
See Section 6.4.1  for the reporting of COVID -19-related signs and symptoms.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  53 of 76 6.4.8 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests  
The results from protocol -mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summari zed in the 
clinical study report . Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory 
values and  vital signs should  only be reported as AEs if they fulfil l the criteria  for reportable 
SAEs, D AEs, or key safety events  (see S ection 6.4.2 ).  
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated w ith clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported if it fulfil ls the criteria for a reportable SAE , DAE, 
and/or key safety event , and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as 
additional information . Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical, rat her 
than the laboratory term (eg , anemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clin ical 
signs or symptoms, clinically  relevant deteriorations in non -mandated parameters should be 
reported if they fulfil l the criteria for a reportable  SAE , DAE, and/or key safety event . 
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to dis ease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE  unless it fulfills the definition of a reportable SAE, DAE, 
and/or key safety event . 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the bas eline assessment will be reported if it fulfills the criteria of a 
reportable SAE, DAE, and/or key safety event.  
6.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the IRB /IEC  and/or the 
Regulatory Authority  
Section 5.6 o f the Investigator’s Brochure  serves as the Ref erence Safety Information for this 
study .  
All reportable SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the 
investigational product . The Sponsor representative is responsible for informing the IRB /IEC  
and/or the Regulatory Authori ty of the SAE as per local requirements.  
If any reportable SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site 
personnel inform the appropriate Sponsor representatives within one day i.e., immediately  but 
no later than 24  hours of when he or she becomes aware of it . 
The designated Sponsor representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the database within one calendar day  of ini tial receipt 
for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar  days of initial receipt for all other

All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until the 30-day 
database lock and protocol violations have been identified and documented.  
A comprehensive SAP will be developed  and reviewed by the Sponsor  prior to 
first patient randomized. Any  subsequent amendments will be documented, with final 
amendments completed prior to unblinding of the data.  
The analysis will be performed by the Sponsor or its representative, and the results of the key 
study outcome will be independently validated by an  biometrics team . 
All analyses described in Sections 8.5.1 to 8.5.6 will be carried out on data collected up to a nd 
including Day 30. As soon as the pre -planned number of patients have completed their 30 -day 
treatment period , the database  will be locked and unblinding performed for thes e analyses. 
After that, data collected on patients ongoing in the 60 -day observational follow -up period 
will be unblinded.  
8.2 Sample Size Estimate  
The primary objective s of the study are to determine the superiority of dapagliflozin versus

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  59 of 76 placebo in reducing the incidence of complications or all-cause mortality (prevention of 
worsening COVID -19) or improving clinical recovery. It is estimated that a sample size of 
approximately 1200 patie nts will provide adequate power to detect the treatment effect on 
prevention or recovery, when the dual endpoints are tested with alpha split between these 
endpoints.  
Since the original protocol was designed, the unpredictable nature of the evolving globa l 
pandemic and the change in standard of care  for treatment of COVID -19 resulted in lower 
than expected event rates. As a consequence, faster and more complete recovery has now 
become an important treatment goal on par with prevention of complications and death in 
patients hospitalized with COVID -19, prompting the addition of ‘recovery’ to the primary 
objectives.  
The initial version of the protocol (CSP version 1.0, 10  April 2020) specified an event -driven 
approach with 380 events needed to detect HR of 0. 75 with 80% power. In a fixed follow -up 
study that would have required 42% of initially randomized 900 patients to experience an 
event. The provision for a potential increase of sample size was included in the initial design 
and intended as a way of balanc ing the possible decrease in event rates, while the recruitment 
rate of 900 patients was anticipated to occur over a period of approximately 3 months. It is 
now estimated that around 10 to 20% of patients will develop COVID -19 related 
complications during the index hospitalization or will experience death during the 30 -day 
treatment period, while 80 to 90% of patients will recover without experiencing worsening. 
Therefore, the sample size of approximately 1200 patients will provide approximately 100 to 
250 events for the first dual primary endpoint (prevention).  
With dual primary endpoints of prevention of COVID -19 complications or death and 
improvement in clinical recovery, an effect on any one will be sufficient evidence of the 
effectiveness of study medic ation. This is per the FDA guidance on Multiple Endpoints in 
Clinical Trials (FDA 2017 ). To control the t ype I error  for dual primary endpoints , the 
allocated alpha of 5% will be split between them . Table  4 below shows the true hazard ratio 
required for 80% power for a hypothetical scenario of an even split of alpha (2.5% two-sided 
for each primary endpoint) depending on the number of events observed. Since no prior 
studies are  available for SGLT2 inhibitors in the COVID -19 setting, possible scenarios of 
event rates and treatment effects are considered to infer the sample size ( Table  4).

For the second dual primary endpoint (recovery) the sample size of 1200  patients will detect a 
win ratio (WR) of 1.23 with at least  80% power for hypothetical alpha of 2.5% (The power is 
calculated based on asymptotic normality property of the w in proportion [WP] where 
WR = WP/[ 1-WP] and the estimated standard deviation (SD) for the WP is assumed to be 
SD = 1/sqrt[3] = 0.57735  [Kawaguchi et al 2011 ], as it is a conservative estimate .) This is 
based on an overall 1:1 allocation between dapagliflozin and placebo.  
Study -wise (overall) t ype I error multiplicity control strategy and the final allocation of alpha 
will be specified in the SAP , which  will be finalized before database l ock. 
8.3 Definitions of Analysis Sets  
8.3.1 Full Analysis Set  
All patients who have been randomi zed to study treatment will be included in the FAS 
irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. Patients will

8.5 Methods for Statistical Analyses  
For the primary endpoints the fo llowing 2 hypotheses will be tested with alpha allocated to 
each hypothesis to maintain an overall 5% 2 -sided significance level:  
Prevention  
H0:HR [dapagliflozin:placebo] =  1 
versus  
H1:HR [dapagliflozin:placebo] ≠  1 
Recovery  
H0:WR [dapagliflozin:placebo] =  1 
versus  
H1:WR [dapagliflozin:placebo] ≠  1 
A strong type 1 error control rate will be applied in testing the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints. Details of the multiplicity plan, including allocation of alpha between the du al 
primary hypothes es, will be provided in the SAP . 
8.5.1 Analysis of the Primary Variable(s)  
The first primary variable is the time to first event included in the primary composite 
endpoint.  
In this analysis treatments (dapagliflozin versus placebo) will be compared using a Cox 
proportional hazards model. The p -value, HR, and 95% confidence inter val will be reported. 
The full details of the analysis model will be specified in the SAP . 
The contribution of each component of the primary composite endpoint to the overall 
treatment effect will be examined. Methods similar to those described for the pri mary analysis 
will be used to separately analyze the time from randomization to the first occurrence of each 
component of the primary composite endpoint. HR and 95% confidence intervals will be

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  74 of 76 Appendix  A Additional Safety Information  
A 1 Further Guidance on the Definit ion of a Serious Adverse Event  
A 1.1 Life T hreatening  
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of deat h from the AE as it 
occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death . ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (e g, hepatitis that res olved without hepatic failure).  
A 1.2 Hospitali zation  
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema) . Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations 
planned before or durin g a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study.  
A 1.3 Important Medical Event o r Medical Intervention  
Medical and scienti fic judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospitali zation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious . These 
should usually be considered as serious.  
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an import ant medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.  
• Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment  
• Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home f or allergic bronchospasm  
• Blood dysc rasias ( eg, neutropenia or an emia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitali zation  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 
A 1.4 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question  
When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  75 of 76 is a ‘reasonable possibility’  that an AE may have been caused by the drug.  
• Time Course . Exposure to suspect drug . Has the subject actua lly received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?  
• Consistency with known drug profile . Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge 
of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the sa me pharmacological 
class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?  
• De-challenge  experience . Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug?  
• No alternative cause . The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.  
• Re-challenge  experience . Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? Sponsor would not norm ally recommend or support a re-challenge . 
• Laboratory tests . A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship . 
 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:  
• Is this a recognized  feature of overdose of the d rug? 
• Is there a known mechanism?  
 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’  of a causal relationship for the individual case . The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a  causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship.  
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment . With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable pos sibility.  
A 1.5 Medication Error  
For the purposes of this study, a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the 
treatment process for an  study drug that either causes harm to the participant or 
has the potential to cause harm to the pa rticipant.

failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant.

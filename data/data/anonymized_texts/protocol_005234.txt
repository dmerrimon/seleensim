1.1 ALLOGENEIC  HEMATOPOIETIC  CELL TRANSPLANTATION  
 
1.1.1  Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplant  for Hematologic  Malignancies  
Chemotherapy  and novel  targeted agents  have a curative potential  for patients  with standard and low- 
risk hematologic  malignancies.  However,  high- risk and advanced relapsed/refractory  diseases  remain  
incurable with these modalities.  Few effective therapies  exist for patients  with high- risk disease.  Since  
immune  tolerance to cancer plays  a major  role in cancer  pathogenesis,  allogeneic  hematopoietic  cell 
transplantation (allo-HCT),  which  is considered the most  potent  immunotherapy  via the graft-versus- 
tumor  (GVT)  effect, is the only treatment  option with a curative potential  or the one which  may provide a 
prolonged progression -free survival.[1 -6] 
 
The major  obstacles  for the success of allo-HCT are graft-versus- host disease  (GVHD)  and relapse.  
Myeloablative HCT was first explored >30 years  ago but its use resulted in a very high early  transplant -
related mortality  (TRM) from direct  regimen- related  toxicities  (RRT)  and severe acute graft- versus- host 
disease (aGVHD).[7 -11] The attempts  to improve  transplant  outcomes  and to expand this option to 
ineligible elderly  population and to those with comorbidities  with the development  of reduced- intensity  
HCT resulted  in an increase  in relapse,  despite a decrease in TRM  and regimen- related toxicity,  and 
thus there was no improvement  in  overall  outcome.[12 -16]  Moreover,  acute GVHD  rates  did not 
decrease but were  only delayed in onset.[17] 
 
1.1.2 Ac
ute Graft -versus- Host  Disease (aGVHD)  
Acute  GVHD  is an allo-immune  reaction  of donor  allo-reactive T- cells against  normal  host tissues  and 
contributes  significantly  to post-transplant  morbidity  and mortality  [18,19]. It remains  a major  obstacle of 
success for both myeloablative and reduced- intensity  HCTs,  with cumulative  incidences  [CI] of 40- 50% 
for grade II-IV and 10-20% for severe grade III-IV aGVHD  in related donor  HCTs.  The frequency  and 
severity of aGVHD  is higher  in unrelated donor  HCTs,  with the CIs of 50-60% for grade II-IV and 20% 
for grade III-IV aGVHD.[20 -27] In addition to the increased  risk of serious  life-threatening infections  
from the use of systemic  high- dose  steroids  and more  potent  immunosuppressive  therapy,  most  
aGVHD  therapies  do not have differential  suppressive effects  on GVHD  and graft versus  tumor  (GVT)  
and thus obviously  have a deleterious  effect  on the latter. Consequently,  the risk of primary  disease 
relapse increases. As a result,  prevention of severe  aGVHD  is of critical importance for the success of 
allo-HCT. 
 
Our University  of Michigan  experience on allo-HCT using  a fludarabine and busulfan  conditioning  in 
patients  with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  revealed the CIs of grade II-IV and grade III-IV aGVHD  of 
45% and 10% in the related donor  HCT setting, and 50% and 10-15% in the unrelated HCT setting,  
respectively. [ 28,29]  
 
1.1.3  Lymphoid Malignancies and Allogeneic  Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (Allo -HCT) 
 
1.1.3.1  Non- Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma  (NHL)  and Allo-HCT 
NHL is a heterogeneous  group of malignancy  of the lymphoid organs.[31]  It is the seventh leading  site of 
new cancer  cases  among men and women,  accounting for 79,190 new cancer cases and 20,130 
cancer -related  deaths  in 2012.[32]  Effective  treatments  are very limited  for primary  refractory  or 
advanced  chemotherapy -resistant NHLs  of any histologic  types,  and new treatment  approaches  are 
needed.[33- 40] 
 In addition  to anti-lymphoma effect, myeloablative  allo-HCT provides  an alloimmune  donor  T-cell reaction 
against  lymphoma (GVL  effect).[41 -46] Several  studies  of myeloablative allo-HCT reported a 
significantly  low relapse rate compared to that with  HDT/ASCT.[31,36 -57]  Unfortunately,  this 
observations  occurred  at  the  expense  of  unacceptably  high  TRM,   particularly  GVHD   and  regimen-

10 
 
related toxicity,  resulting in similar  OS to that from HDT/ASCT.[36,58,59] The degree of tissue  injury  after 
conditioning regimen  correlates  the severity of GVHD,[60 -62] which  has high impact  on TRM.[62 -64] To 
decrease TRM  and expand eligible  candidates  for  allo-HSCT,  reduced- intensity  HSCT has been 
extensively  explored during the past 10 years.[61,65- 76] Fludarabine  is a potent  immunosuppressive agent  
with less toxicity,  compared with high-dose cyclophosphamide in myeloablative conditioning,  and has 
replaced the latter  in fludarabine -based regimens  e.g. fludarabine/Busulfan [22] and 
fludarabine/Melphalan.[77]  However,  the relapse rate increased  due to the less intensity  of the regimen and 
thus progression- free survival  (PFS)  and overall  survival (OS)  did not improve  .[31,36 -57,58,65- 76] . 
 
Allogeneic  HSCT  for NHLs  at University  of Michigan  
During 1996- 2012,  we performed 120 (82 myeloablative and 38 fludarabine- based)  allo-HCTs  on patients  
with relapsed/refractory  or advanced diffuse  large B cell NHL, which  constituted the majority  of lymphom a 
patients  undergoing allo-HCT at University  of Michigan.  The 3- yearOS  and PFS)  were  40% and 38 % for 
myeloablative transplant  []Blue] and 18% and 15% only for  fludarabine- based transplant  [Green] [Figure 1] , 
indicating relapse  was the major  problem  after allo-HCT,  especially  fludarabine- based transplant.  These  
results  were  consistent  with the literature.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
1.1.3.2  Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma  (HL) and Allo-HCT Figure  1: Kaplan- Meier  
estimates  of overall  
survival  and progression

patients  undergoing 
myeloablative non- 
fluadarine- based  (n=82;  
Blue)  and fludarabine- 
based (n=38;  Green)  
allogeneic  HCTs  at 
University  of Michigan.  
[unpublished  data]  
Approximately  80% of HL patients  are cured  with standard chemotherapy  with/without  radiotherapy  and 
those who relapse  may still then be salvaged  with HDT/ASCT, resulting in durable response in 40-50% of 
relapsed and 25-40% of  primary  refractory  patients,  respectively.[78 -81]  Unfortunately,  very limited  
effective treatment  options  are available for patients who relapse after HDT/ASCT. Even  though,  several  
series  reported the existence  of graft-versus- HL effect, outcomes  of myeloablative allo-HCT have remained 
disappointing due to the unacceptable TRM  as high as 43-61%.[46,82 -87]. Reduced -intensity  allo-HCT has 
been used  in patients  with relapsed HL after autologous  HSCT, but the outcomes  are not promising.[76,88-
101].  Most  series  demonstrated the existence of graft-vs HL effect, but still noted high relapse rate and TRM. 
Novel  approach to decrease relapse after allo-HCT is needed to improve outcome of advanced refractory  HL 
in this unfortunate young population.  
 
1.1.3.
3 Multiple  Myeloma  and Allo-HCT 
The American Cancer Society  has estimated  22,350  new  cases  of  multiple  myeloma  (MM)  in  the 
United  States  in 2013.[32]  MM is a clonal  neoplastic  proliferation of plasma  cells and is considered 
chronic  and incurable,  with current  novel  chemo -biologic  targeted agents.  In the previous  conventional  
chemotherapy  era, the median overall  survival  was ~4-5 years  for average- risk patients  while  this has 
been estimated  to be much  improved  to >7 years  in the current  targeted  therapy  era.[102 -108] 
However,  outcomes  of high- risk or advanced MM therapy  remains  poor,  with a median survival  only 
~8-14 months  after therapy.[109 -113].  
 
The current  standard therapy  for MM consists of 3 phases:  1) primary  induction therapy  2) 
consolidative high-dose melphalan/ASCT  and 3) post-transplant  maintenance  therapy.[114]  Despite 
these  measures,  relapse  or  progression  during  maintenance  therapy  is  inevitable.  Few effective

treatment  options  are available for advanced relapsed or refractory  MM. In addition,  MM with certain 
cytogenetic  abnormalities  (t(4;14),  t(14;16),  (14:20),  17p-, 13- by conventional  karyotyping,  comp lex 
karyptype and hypodiploidy)  and plasma cell leukemia are associated with an extremely  poor prognosis,  with 
a median survival  of 8-14 months  post HDT/ASCT.[109 -113] Certain  novel  targeted agents  e.g. bortezomib 
have been shown to overcome resistance of some  types  of high- risk MMs [115,116]  but none is proven to be 
curative or to provide meaningful  long- term MM control.  
 
The use of myeloablative allo-HCT for advanced MM resulted in very high early  TRM  up to 50% in the first 6 
months  post transplant.[117]  However,  those who had survived  subsequently  enjoyed a sustained long-term 
MM control  and likely  a cure of MM. Attempts  have been made  to reduce TRM  by the use of reduced-
intensity  allo-HCT;  however,  the success was at the expense of increasing MM relapse,  thus resulting  in no 
improvement  of overall  outcomes.[6,118- 120].  To improve MM control,  HDT/ASCT was  incorporated prior to 
reduced- intensity  allo-HCT (tandem  auto-allo HCTs).  As expected,  auto- allo transplant  patients  experienced 
increased  TRM  but a trend  towards  a better  MM control  and no definite improvement  in the overall  
survival.[5,121- 123] 
 
Univ
ersity  of Michigan  (UM)  experience on allo-HCT for high -risk MMs  
Between 2008 -2011,  UM BMT  program  enrolled 22 patients  with  high-risk  or  advanced  MM  on  a phase  
2 study  using the fluadarabine and busulfan x 4 (FluBu4).[30]  TRMs were  very low (19% at 1 year),  with 
similar  rates  of GVHD, compared with those reported in the literature.[6,118- 120] However,  relapse rates  
remained high.  There was no improvem ent in OS [40%  3-year OS and 5% 3-year PFS;,  Figure 2 ], similar  to 
those reported in the literature.[6,118- 120]

1.1.4  Myeloid  Malignancies and Allo-HCT 
Myeloid malignancies  constitute  the majority  of hematologic  diseases  requiring  HCT due to the strong 
evidence of potent  graft-versus -tumor  effect.[8] In addition,  as in the case  of lymphoid malignancies,  allo-
HCT is the only treatment  option,  which  may offer a curative potential  or long-term survival for patients  with 
high-risk or advanced relapsed/refractory  myeloid malignancies.  [1,7-11] One-year relapse- free survival in 
elderly  patients  with very high-risk AML at UM was ~50%  only.[28,29]  
 
1.2 PROTEASOME  
The proteasome- ubiquitin system  is a multi -catalytic  proteinase complex that is responsible for degradation 
of a wide variety  of protein  substrates  within  normal  and transformed  cells. Intracellular  proteins  targeted  for 
degradation by  the  proteasome  are  first  ubiquitinated  via  the  ubiquitin  conjugation  system.  
Ubiquitinated proteins  are cleaved within  the proteasome by one or more  of three separate threonine 
protease activities:  a chymotrypsin- like activity,  a trypsin -like activity,  and a caspase- like activity.[124 -128] 
Proteasome activity  has an important  a role in promoting constitutional  activation of survival pathways  in 
some  cancer cells. In the NF-κB transcription factor  pathway,  this effect  is mediated  by 1) the degradation of 
the inhibitory  chaperone IκB, thus releasing the active p50/p65 hetero- dimer,  in the classic pathway  or 2) the 
degradation of the inactive substrates  precursor  p100 and p105 into the active  p50 and p52, respectively,  in 
the alternative pathway.  The resultant transcription homo- and hetero- dimers translocate into nucleus where 
they bind to NF- κB binding sites of the target genes .

12  
Proteasom e inhibition leads  to the accumulation of inhibitory  IκB within  MM cells with relatively  increased 
constitutive NF-κB transciption factor  expression,  resulting  in the selective induction of apoptosis  in MM 
cells, while  sparing most  normal  cells. The down -regulation of NF-κB transcription factors  inhibits  
interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and causes direct  apoptosis  of MM cells. In addition,  this leads  to an 
indirect  anti-angiogenesis  effect, contributing to anti-tumor  activity.[126 -128] 
 
In addition to its important  role in tumor  survival,  NF-κB transcription factor  system  is pivotal  in T cell 
function.[129 -132] NF-κB pathway  expression is increased in activated  T  cells,  compared  with  the resting  
counterparts.  The activation  through T- cell receptor/CD3/co- stmulating  molecules results  in translocation 
of NF-κB transcription factor  complex  into nucleus,  leading  to increased Th1 and Th17 cytokine 
signaling  and T- cell activation  and proliferation.[131- 132] Moreover,  the activated NF-κB pathway  
promotes  antigen- presenting dendritic  cell  function  -  antigen  uptake  through  phagocytosis  and the 
response to activating  cytokines.[133- 134] Lastly,  proteasome activity is important  in maintaining  
activated  B cell survival.  BIM, which  induces  apoptosis  of activated  B cells,  is degraded by 
proteasome.  Thus,  proteasome inhibition results  in increased level of BIM and shortened survival  of 
activated  B cells.[135]  
 
1.3 PRO
TEASOME INHIBITORS  
Bortzomib  is a first-generation dipeptide boronic  acid which  reversibly  inhibits  the chymotrypsin- like 
(CT-L) activity of the 20s proteasomes  of  the  ubiquitin- proteasome  pathway.  Bortezomib  has  anti- 
tumor  activity in pre-clinical  and clinical  settings  in various  hematologic  malignancies  especially  
lymphoid cancers.[136- 143] Bortezomib is currently  used in the therapy  for  MM,  with  a  potential  superior  
activity  to other  targeted agents  for high- risk refractory  disease.  
 
In addition,  a few series  reported the safety  of its use after allogeneic  HCT as either  maintenance or 
salvage therapy  for relapse.[144- 147] Unlike  lenalidomide,  which  was found to increase GVHD,  the 
use of bortezomib post-allo-HCT did not appear  to do so. Interestingly,  some  patients  with a baseline  
severe refractory  chronic  GVHD   improved or resolved  with bortezomib therapy.  This indicated that 
bortezomib might  have  immunomodulatory  property,  in addition to anti-tumor  effect.[147]  
 Bortezomib also has anti-tumor  activity in other  lymphoid  malignancies,  especially  mantle cell 
lymphoma,[148- 154] and myeloid malignancies.[155- 161] It has been used  in combination with other  
chemotherapeutic  and/or  immuno -biologic  agents  in phase 2 and 3 trials.[149 -153, 156-158] More  
importantly,  it has been also incorporated into high-dose melphalan  conditioning  chemotherapy  in 
various  fashions.[162 -165] These were  feasible,  without  excess toxicities  or effects  on engraftment  or 
other  transplant -related events. However,  no clear  clinical  benefits  were  seen  in this approach.  
 A phase 
1 study  by Massachusette General  Hospital  of the addition  of bortezomib to a standard 3+7 
induction  regimen,  idarubicin  and cytarabine in 31 patients  with very high-risk myeloid malignancies  
(22 patients  older  than 60 years,  8 had therapy -related or secondary  AML/MDS).  Bortezomib was 
dosed as standard full cycle  scheduling on day1,  4, 8 and 11.[160]  The MTD  was 1.5 mg/m2, which  
was higher  than 1.3 mg /m2 standard dose for lymphoid malignancies  in chronic  therapy.  The CR and 
CRi rates  were  61% and 10%,  respectively in this high-risk population.  
 
1.3.1  Proteasome Inhibitors  and Their  Immunomodulatory  Effect  
The NF-κB transcription factor  system  is pivotal  in activated T cell function.  Activation of membrane 
receptors  leads  to cytoplasmic  proteasome degradation of the inhibiting  chaperone,  IκB [classical pathway]  
or the precursor  NF-κB transcription factors  into active NF-κB transcription dimmers  [alternative pathway]. 
Activated  NF-κB transcription dimers  subsequently  translocate  into  nucleus  where they bind to NF-κB 
binding  sites and initiate target  gene transcription.[129- 132] NF-κB pathwa y expression is increased in 
activated T cells, compared with the resting counterparts. The activation through T -cell receptor/CD 3/co-
stmulating molecules results in translocation  of  NF -κB  transcription factor complex into nucleus, leading to 
increased Th1 cytokine signaling and T -cell activation and proliferation.[130- 132] Moreover, the activated 
NF-κB pathway promotes antigen-p resenting dendritic cell function- antigen uptake through phagocytosis 
and the response to activating cytokines. [133- 134]

13  
  Bortezomib has been shown to inhibit  T cell and dendritic  cell functions  via abrogating  NF-κB     
 mediating transcription pathway  by inhibition of proteasome degredation.  In addition,  the inhibition  of  
 IL-6 production promotes  TGF-β induced regulatory  T cell (Treg) differentiation.[131]  Of note,T reg  plays   
a pivotal  role in modulating GVHD.[60]  
 
Based on the above,  bortezomib appears  to have immunomodulatory  effect  toward abrogation  of 
activated  alloreactive T- cell and dendritic  function,  which  plays  a pivotal  role in  pathogenesis  of aGVHD.  
In addition,  bortezomib has been shown to inhibit  alloreactive B cells through the stimulation  of Bim, 
which  triggers  B-cell apoptosis.  Bim signaling is up-regulated in activated B lymphocytes  and is 
degraded by proteasome.  Moreover,  Bim is down -regulated by BAFF,  which,  in turn, promotes  B- cell 
survival and maturation.  High BAFF  level was detected in patients  with chronic  GVHD.  [135]  
 
1.3.2  Proteasome Inhibitor  Use After  Allo-HCT 
Unlike  lenalidomide,  the use of bortezomib post-allo-HCT did not increase GVHD. Some  cases  with baseline 
severe refractory  chronic  GVHD improved with bortezomib therapy.  This was likely  due to its 
immunomodulatory  effect  through promoting  Treg proliferation and differentiation and inhibition  of allo- 
reactive antigen presenting dendritic  cells and B-cells as stated  above.[130- 135] 
 
1.3.3  Proteasome Inhibitor  and GVHD  Prophylaxis  
Based on its immuno -modulatory  property  against  alloreactive T cell and dendritic  cells, bortezomib 
was tested  in a mouse model  for GVHD  prevention.[166- 167] Bortezomib was administered daily from 
day 0-3 and was able to protect  severe acute GVHD  in a fully-H2  mismatched  HCTs,  without  impairing  
engraftment.  For a less severe mismatched setting,  it  protected  100%  of  mice  against  GVHD  while  
preserving graft-versus- tumor  effect. However,  when bortezomib  was  given  in  a  later period (day 12-
14), it increased  mortality  from severe gastrointestinal  (GI) GVHD  in mice.[167]  
 
Based on this very promising pre-clinical  data,  Dana  Faber  Cancer  Institute  group conducted a phase  
1/2 study  of bortezomib GVHD  prophylaxis  in a very high- risk patient  cohort  for developing severe  
GVHD.[168] All the 45 patients  with advanced hematologic  malignancies  received a 1 or 2 HLA- 
mismatched unrelated transplant  with a standard reduced- intensity  fludarabine/busualfan conditioning 
and tacrolimus/methotrexate GVHD  prophylaxis.  The phase 1 part identified the same  standard dose  
of bortezomib for primary  MM therapy,  1.3 mg/m2, given at day 1, 4 and 7, as the optimal  dose level.  
This was the dose used in the standard schedule [Day 1, 4, 8, 11 of a 3- or 4-week  cycle)  in chronic  
therapy.  The day-11 dose  was omitted  due to the preclinical  data showing  increased  GI  GVHD  mortality  
with delay  administration  in a mouse  model.  The tacrolimus,  methotrexate and bortezomib GVHD  
prophylaxis  was well-tolerated,  with no grade 3/4 toxicities  attributed  to  bortezomib.  The median  
(range)  neutrophil  and platelet  engraftment  time were  13 (6-29) and 20 (13-27) days,  respectively. The 
engraftment  was robust,  with  day-30  and  day-100  donor  chimerism  of  97%  and 99%.  With the 
median follow -up time of 36 months,  cumulative grade II-III and grade III acute GVHD  were  22% and 
7% respectively. Of note,  there were  no grade IV GVHDs  occurring and the 1-year cumulative 
incidence of chronic  GVHD  was 29% only, resulting in a TRM  of 9% only in this cohort  receiving a 
very high– risk mismatched  unrelated transplant.  The 1-year PFS and OS were  impressive  at 60% and 
76% respectively.  In summary,  the addition of the proteasome inhibitor  bortezomib to standard GVHD  
prophylaxis  regimen  was safe and feasible,  with unexpectedly  impressive low rates  of GVHD  and TRM.

1.4 CARFILZOMIB  
Carfilzomib  (PR-171) is a tetrapeptide ketoepoxide- based inhibitor  specific  for the chymotrypsin- like active 
site of the  20S proteasome. Carfilzomib is structurally  and mechanistically distinct from  the dipeptide 
boronic  acid proteasome inhibitor  bortezomib.  When measured against  a broad  panel  of proteases  including  
metallo,  aspartyl,  and serine proteases,  carfilzomib demonstrated less reactivity  against  non-targeted non-
proteasomal  proteases  when compared to bortezomib.[169 -174] 
 
1.4.1  Carfilzomib  Preclinical Antitumor  Activity  
Based upon the results  of in vitro and in vivo studies,  it is anticipated that the more intense and longer  
duration of proteasome inhibition  that can be achieved  with carfilzomib will result  in enhanced anti- tumor  
activity  relative to bortezomib.  Continuous  72-hour exposure to carfilzomib is associate d with potent  
cytotoxic  and pro-apoptotic  activity  across a broad panel  of tumor -derived  cell lines in culture.[169,170,175]  
Incubation of hematologic  tumor  cell lines with carfilzomib  for as little as one hour leads  to rapid inhibition  of 
proteasome activity followed by  accumulation  of  polyubiquitinated proteins  and induction of apoptotic  cell 
death.  Carfilzomib  has also been demonstrated to be cytotoxic  in bortezomib-resistant tumor  cell 
lines.[169,170,175]  
 
The anti-tumor  efficacy  of carfilzomib  has been tested  in immunocompromised  mice  implanted with various  
tumor  cell lines.  In addition  to MM,[175] carfilzomib  has  been  shown  to  have  anti-tumor  activity against  
other  hematologic  malignancies.[176,177]  It is synergistic  with histone deacetylase inhibitors  in tumor  
killings.[178,179]  
 
1.4.2 C
arfilzomib  Toxicology  Studies  
In the initial  Good  Laboratory  Practice (GLP) -compliant  toxicity  studies,  carfilzomib was tested  in rats and 
monkeys  as two two-week  cycles  of QDx5 days.[180].  When  administered to rats at 12 mg/m 2, the severely  
toxic dose in 10% of animals  (STD 10), caused > 90% proteasome inhibition in red blood cells one hour after 
dosing.  Overall,  stronger  inhibition of the proteasome and longer  duration of inhibition  was  tolerated  with  
carfilzomib  compared  with  bortezomibA  dose -dependent   decrease  in 
proteasome activity was demonstrated in animals,  and equivalent  levels  of proteasome inhibition  were  
achieved with administration of carfilzomib  as either  an IV push or an IV  infusion.  The  DLTs  of carfilzomib  
in both the rat and monkey  28 day GLP toxicity  studies  included toxicity  to the GI tract, bone marrow,  
pulmonary,  and cardiovascular  systems. No behavioral  or histopathological  signs  of neurotoxicity  were  
observed,  and carfilzomib  does  not cross the blood -brain barrier.  
 
In chronic  toxicity  studies,  carfilzomib  was administered on Days  1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle,  
mimicking  the active anti-tumor  regimen being  used  in ongoing Phase II studies  in myeloma and solid 
tumors  [3]. Tolerability  was excellent,  with no evidence  of neurotoxicity,  observed even  at high doses. This is 
in stark  contrast to that observed with bortezomib.[181,182]  DLTs  included effects  on the GI, renal,  
pulmonary,  and cardiovascular  systems  and appeared to related to Cmax effects. Of note,  neutropenia was 
not observed;  rather,  transient  neutrophilia was seen  following  acute dosing.  Renal,  cardiovascular  and GI 
toxicities  were  similar  to  those  observed  with  bortezomib.  Finally,  cyclical thrombocytopenia,  likely  due to 
inhibition  of platelet  budding  from  megakaryocytes,  was similar  to that seen  with bortezomib.  Proteasome  
inhibition  in the blood  in excess  of  90%  was achievable at well-tolerated  doses,  which  contrasts  with the 
~70%  proteasome inhibition  achieveable with bortezomib  at its maximum  tolerated dose (MTD). In 
summary,  these animal  toxicity  studies  support  the tolerability  of carfilzomib  in clinical studies,  even on 
intensive dosing schedules  and at doses  achieving  proteasome inhibition in excess  of what  can be achieve 
with bortezomib at its MTD  on a less intensive schedule.

hase 1 Experience with Carfilzomib  As A Monotherapy  
In the Phase 1 PX -171-002 study  testing  carfilzomib  in subjects with relapsed/refractory  hematologic  
malignancies,[183,184]36 subjects received carfilzomib on Days  1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
  
 
15  
cycle.  Subjects  with advanced  MM,  NHL,   Waldenström’s  macroglobulinemia,  and  Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma 
(HL) were  enrolled on the study.  
 
No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in the initial 7 cohorts (1.2 to 15 mg/m 2 ). At the 20 mg/m 2 
dose level,  1/8 patients  had a Grade 3 renal  failure at Cycle  1, Day 2 which  was considered possibly  related 
to study  drug and lasted  for six days.  The patient  continued on study  for  the remainder  of Cycle  1 before 
having disease  progression.  At the 27 mg/m2 dose level,  1/6 subjects experienced a DLT during Cycle  1, 
consisting of severe hypoxia with pulmonary  infiltrates  following  Day 2 of dosing.  In subjects  where the 27 
mg/m2 dose was efficacious,  a “first dose effect”  was seen that included  a constellation of findings  that 
appeared to be the clinical  sequelae  of  tumor  lysis syndrome  (TLS)  and/or  cytokine  release.    This  
effect  was  notable  for  fever,  chills,  and/or  rigors  occurring during  the evening  following  the first day of 
infusion.  On the second  day, 3/5 subjectsexperienced an increase in serum  creatinine to Grade  2 (including  
the subject with the DLT).  This elevation was rapidly  reversible  and all 3 subjects  were  re-challenged with 
carfilzomib  without  recurrence  of the events. Interestingly,  all three subjects had a rapid decline  in serum  
and/or  urine M- protein levels;  two subjects  achieved  a PR and the third subject  achieved a minimal  
response (MR).  There were  no consistent changes  in potassium,  calcium,  phosphorous,  or uric acid levels 
although some  increases  in LDH and other  markers  of tumor  lysis were  noted.  Because of the possible  TLS 
and reversible creatinine  elevations,  hydration and very -low dose dexamethasone prophylaxis were 
instituted in subsequent studies and have essentially eliminated clinically significant TLS/creatinine 
elevations and the other “first -dose” effects.  Hematologic  toxicities  were primari ly mild or moderate.  The 
thrombocytopenia reported  with carfilzomi b is cyclical and similar to  that reported with bortezomib.  
 
Of the 36 evaluable patients  enrolled in PX-171-002, 20  subjects  had  MM.[183,184]  Four  MM patients  
achieved a partial  response (PR),  1/2 at the 15 mg/m 2 dose,  1/6 at the 20 mg/m2 dose, and 2/5 at the 27 
mg/m2 dose.  The responses  have been rapid in onset,  beginning in some  subjects after 1-2 doses.  The 
duration of response  (DOR) ranged from 134 to 392 days.  The minimal effective dose  
was 15 mg/m2 wherein >80% proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] was  
observed  one  hour  after  dosing.  At  27  mg/m2,  ~90%  inhibition  of  proteasome  activity  was 
achieved in PBMCs.[184] The median number of prior therapies  for subjects on this trial was 5, and 
responses  were  seen in subjects  who had relapsed  from (including some  refractory  to) bortezomib and/or  
immunomodulatory  agents.  Stable disease also occurred in four NHL and five MM subjects, with subjects  on 
therapy  for up to 409 days.  Such prolonged therapy,  at “full” twice -weekly  doses,  is not possible with 
bortezomib.  These  results  led to the initiation  of two Phase  2 studies. 
 
Another  phase 1 study  of carfilzomib  in 29 patients  with advanced lymphoid malignancies  [MM,  WM, NHL 
and HD] who  received a more  intens ive schedule  of carfilzomib IV push  at doses  of 1.2, 2.4, 4, 6, 8.4, 11, 15 
and 20 mg/m 2 for 5 consecutive days of a 14-day cycle  until unacceptable toxicities  or progressive disease 
[median=4.8 cycles  (range,  <1-16)] determined that the 15 mg/m2 dose level was the MTD.[17] Despite  
intensive scheduling,  severe AEs were  infrequent.  Common (>20%)  grade 3/4 non-hematologic  treatment -
emergent  AEs were  essentially  absent  [grade 3/4 dyspnea=6%  and grade  
3/4 fatigue=3%].  Grade 3/4 hematologic  AEs were  also rare, including  thrombocytopenia  (7%),  anemia,  
febrile neutropenia and neutropenia (3% each).  Proteasome inhibition  of >75%  was detected in  WB  and  
PBMCs   after  a  single  dose  of  carfilzomib  at  dose  levels  of  15  mg/m2  or  higher.  The  
inhibition  was incr eased to >90%  after the fifth consecutive  day dosing due to accumulative effect  with 
repeating dosing.  Anti-tumor  activity  was observed  at doses  >11 mg/m 2.[17] 
 
1.4.4  Phase 2 Experience With  Carfilzomib  As A Monotherapy  
Two phase 2 clinical  studies  were  conducted with carfilzomib  in MM patients,  PX-171-003-A0 
[186,187](N=46) in relapsed/  refractory  MM  and  PX-171-004  (N=39)  in  relapsed  MM.[188 -190]  In both 
studies, patients  were  dosed with 20 mg/m2 on Days  1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 on a 28 day schedule.  In these 
studies  there were  four cases of suspected or documented TLS prior to institution of  the 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
  
 
16  
prophylaxis  guidelines.  Since  these guidelines  were  implemented,  no further  cases of TLS have  been 
reported including in >350 additional  patients  with relapsed or refractory  MM treated in other  phase II 
studies. In both studies,  the most  common  adverse events  were  fatigue,  anemia,  thrombocytopenia 
(primarily  cyclical),  gastrointestinal,  and dyspnea.  Almost all  were  Grades  1  or  2.  There  were  reported  
cases of increased in serum  creatinine that were  primarily  < Grade 2 and were  transient,  rapidly  reversible,  
and non-cumulative.  A very low rate of severe treatment -emergent  peripheral  neuropathy,  1 case (2.2%)  
with pre-existing  Grade 2 neuropathy  progres sing to Grade 3,  was observed in PX-171-003-A0 despite the 
fact that 87% of patients  had Grade 1/2 neuropathy  upon study  entry.[186,187]  
 
The response rate in PX-171-003-A0 was 16.7%  PR, 7% MR and 41% SD in these patients  that entered  the 
study  with progressive disease  and were  refractory  to their most  recent  therapy,  often including bortezomib 
(100%),  lenalidomide (91%)  and thalidomide (91%).  The best overall  response rate was 16.7%  (95%  CI, 7.0-
31.4)  months,  with the duration of response (DOR) of 7.2 (CI, 1.9-not estimated)  months.  The clinical  benefit  
response rate was 23.8%  (95%  CI, 12.1-39.5)  months,  with the DOR of 13.8 (95%  CI, 4.8-16.6)  months.  The 
median time to progression  on the PX-171-003-A0 study  was 3.5 (95% CI, 2.4-6.7) months  (mean  follow  up 
of 7.6 months).[186,187]  
 
A “stepped up” dosing  schedule,  referred to as 20/27  mg/m2, has subsequently  been incorporated into the 
PX-171-003 study  (referred  to as PX-171-003-A1) in order  to maximize  the clinical  benefit  of carfilzomib.  
Patients  receive 20 mg/m2 for the first cycle  and  27  mg/m2  thereafter.  The  study  completed enrollment  of 
266 patients  by the end of 2009  and may form the basis  for an accelerated  approval  NDA filing  by the end of 
2010.  This dosing  schedule has been well tolerated.[183,184]   An 
independent  Safety  Oversight  Group (SOG)  evaluated the safety  data from the 40 of 250 patients  to be 
enrolled on the 20/27  schedule  and agreed that the trial should proceed without  modification.  No cases  of 
TLS were  observed and rates  of BUN  and creatinine  elevation dropped sharply,  with Grade 3/4 renal  
impairment  dropping to 3.4%  in A1 (from 15% in A0), most  likely  due to hydration and very low dose 
dexamethasone.  The other  most  common  adverse events  were  similar  to the A0 portion of the study.  
Treatment -emergent  peripheral  neuropathy  remains  low on this portion of the study  with 12.4%  new onset  or 
worsening of pre-exisiting  Grade 1/2 peripheral  neuropathy  (77%  had  pre- exisitng Grade 1/2  peripheral  
neuropathy)  and 1.1%  Grade 3 event  reported on PX-171-003- A1.[186,187]  In addition,  anemia rates  in the 
PX-171-003-A1 (higher  dose)  were  lower  than those reported in the PX-171-003–A0 portion of the study,  
possibly  indicating that the higher  dose of carfilzomib  is achieving  better  clearing of neoplastic  cells in the 
bone marrow  allowing  superior  normal  marrow  reconstitution.  Grade 3/4 thromobocytopenia rate was 29% 
and grade 3/4 neutropenia rate was 11%.[186,187]  
 
In PX-171-004, a first cohort  of patients  received  20 mg/m 2. The subset of patients  (N=54)  that had not seen 
bortezomib had an ORR of 46% (2% CR, 9% VGPR  and 35% PR), while  the bortezomib treated patients  
(N=33)  had an ORR of 18% (3% CR, 3% VGPR  and 12% PR). [188,189]  The median TTP was 7.6 and 5.3 
months  in these two groups,  respectively. Thus,  carfilzomib can induce very high levels  of response in 
patients  who have not previously  been treated with bortezomib[190]  and, even  in bortezomib- treated 
patients,[191] substantial  anti-tumor  activity is observed.  Of note,  disease  control  (PR + MR + SD) was 
achieved in ~65%  of patients  with progressive MM entering the study.  Patients  on these studies  have  been  
treated for >12 cycles with good tolerability  and no cumulative toxicity  (e.g., bone marrow,  severe fatigue,  or 
neuropathy)  have not been observed.  
 
In these phase 2 studies, prolonged carfilzomib exposure at higher  doses  was associated with low incidence  
of new onset  severe peripheral  neuropathy  or worsening of pre-existing  peripheral  neuropathy.[192,193]  
Carfilzomib  was found to be safe in MM patients  with renal  insufficiency,  including  those requiring 
hemodialysis.[194]  In addtion,  pooled  safety  data from phase 1/2 and phase 2 studies  of single  agent  
carfilzomib  confirmed  safety  and low rates  of grade 3/4 treatment -emergent  AEs [195-197].

17    Lastly,  unfavorable  cytogenetic  characteristics  in  MM  patients  had  no  impact  on response to    
  carfilzomib.[198- 200] 
 
1.4.5  Experience With  Carfilzomib  In Combination With  Lenalidomide  [201-203] 
PX-171-006 is a phase 1b study  in patients  with relapsed  MM in which  carfilzomib is administered in 
combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid ®) and dexamethasone.[201,202]  
 
Patients  with MM who relapsed after 1 to 3 prior regimens  enrolled into dose -escalation  cohorts. CRd was 
administered on 28-day dosing cycles: carfilzomib  15 to 27 mg/m2 on  days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16; 
Lenalidomide 10 to 25 mg on days  1 to 21; and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly.[201,202]  
 The maximum  per protocol  doses  of carfilzomib  (27mg/m 2) with lenalidomide 25 mg and low dose 
dexamethasone were  used.  After  8 patients  tolerated these doses  well, an additional  44 patients  were  
enrolled in an “expansion”  cohort  at this level,  and this regimen  is being taken into Phase  3 study  PX- 171-
009. 
 
Forty  patients  enrolled in 6 cohorts.[201,202]  Prior  treatment  included bortezomib (75%)  and 
lenalidomide (70%);  20% and 36% were  refractory  overall.  The MTD  was not identified,  and the highest  
dose combination tested  was recommended for the phase II study.  The most  common  toxicities  of any 
grade were  fatigue  (62.5%),  neutropenia (55.5%),  and diarrhea  (52.5%).  Grade 3/4 toxicities  included 
neutropenia (42.5%),  thrombocytopenia (32.5%),  and lymphopenia (27.5%),  with no grade 3/4 
neuropathy  reported.  Proteasome inhibition 1- hour after dose  was more  than 80% in cycles  1 and 2. 
The overall  response rate was 62.5%,  the clinical  benefit  response rate was 75.0%,  and the median 
duration of response and PFS were  11.8 and 10.2 months,  respectively . Importantly,  lenalidomide-
associated neutropenia and thrombocytopenia did not appear  to be exacerbated by 
concurrent  treatment  with carfilzomib,  even  up to 27mg/m2. 
 
The phase 2 dose  expansion at the maximum  planned dose (MPD) , focusing  on the 52 patients enrolled in 
the MPD  cohort.[203] Median  follow -up was 24.4 months.  In the MPD cohort , overall  response rate 
(ORR)  was 76.9%  with median time to response  of 0.95 month (range  0.5-4.6) and duration of 
response (DOR)  of 22.1 months.  Median  progression- free survival  was 15.4 months.  ORR  was 69.2%  
in bortezomib- refractory  patients  and 69.6%  in lenalidomide -refractory  patients with  median DOR  of 
22.1 and 10.8 months,  respectively. A median of 9.5 (range  1-45) carfilzomib  cycles were  started  with 
7.7%  of patients  requiring  carfilzomib  dose  reductions  and 19.2%  discontinuing CRd due to adverse 
events  (AEs).  Grade 3/4 AEs included lymphopenia (48.1%),  neutropenia  (32.7%),  thrombocytopenia 
(19.2%),  and anemia (19.2%).  CRd at  the  MPD  was  well  tolerated  with  robust,  rapid,  and durable  
responses.  
 
1.4.6  Experience With  Carfilzomib  In Combination  with Chemotherapy  
Carfilzomib  has recently  been shown  to be safe and effective  for the use in combination  with conventional  
chemotherapy,  including cyclophosphamide,  melphalan and rituximab.[204- 207] 
 
Reeder  et al [204]  conducted a phase I/II trial of a combination of Cyclophosphamide,  Carfilzomib,  
Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (CYCLONE) in patients  with newly -diagnosed MM. [carfilzomib  IV Days  
1,2 8,9,15,16,  cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2  PO Days  1,8,15,  thalidomide 100 mg PO Days  1- 
28 and dexamethasone 40 mg PO Days  1, 8, 15, 22 . No DLTs  were  observed in the initial  phase I/II 
regimen,  with patients  nearly  fully accrued to the Phase  2 at 27mg/m 2 and expansion MTD  (36mg/m 2). 
Ninety  percent  completed at least  4 cycles. Grade 3/4 toxicities  occurring in >5% were  uncommon  
(hypertension (8%),  thromboembolic  event  (6%) and hyperglycemia (6%).  There  were  no  cardiac  events  
seen in greater  than 5% of patients.  All patients  advancing to ASCT  successfully collected stem  cells. The 1-
year PFS was 90% and 1-year OS was 98%.  Thus,  the 4 drug CYCLONE regimen  is highly  efficacious  at 
the dosing level of carfilzomib  IV 20/27- 36 mg/m2  in newly  diagnosed myeloma.  
 Toxicities  are manageable,  with minimal  cardiac  or pulmonary  toxicity.

18  
A Phase  2 Study  with  prolonged  administration  of  Carfilzomib,  Cyclophosphamide  and Dexamethasone 
(CCd)  for newly -diagnosed elderly  MM (median age 71 years;  28% of patients  >75 years).[205]   The   
regimen   included   oral   cyclophosphamide   (300   mg/m2    on   days   1,8,15),   oral  
dexamethasone (40 mg on days  1, 8, 15, 22) and IV carfilzomib  (20 mg/m2  on days  1, 2, and 36 
mg/m2  on days  8, 9, 15, 16, cycle  1; 36 mg/m2  on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, cycles  2-9) every  28 days  
for 9 cycles, followed  by maintenance with IV carfilzomib  (36 mg/m2  on days  1, 2, 15, 16) every  28 days  until 
progression or intolerance.  After 9 induction cycles , 96% of patients  achieved  at least  PR, 76% VGPR, 64% 
CR/nCR, including 24% sCR. The 1- year PFS was 86% and the 1-year OS was 87%.  G3/4  non-hematologic  
AEs were  infections  (7%),  cardia c (5%),  constitutional  (4%),  renal  (4%) and GI complications  (2%).  Overall,  
the CCd regimen  was well tolerated.  After  a median duration of maintenance of 6 months,  the PR rate was 
100%,  including 68% CR/nCR. The  most  frequent  toxicity  (all grades)  during maintenance was fever  (G1/2  
in 24%,  G3 in 8%), not associated with chills, rigors,  dyspnea and/or  creatinine  increase.  There was only 1 
(4%) G3 neutropenia.  Thus,  The CCd regimen is highly  effective,  (>nCR  64% and sCR24).  It is well 
tolerated with limited  grade 3- 4 AEs.  
 
A phase  1
/2 study  of a combination of Carfilzomib,  Melphalan and  Prednisone  (CMP)  in  elderly  patients  
(median age, 72 years)  with newly  diagnosed MM revealed the safety  and efficacy  of combined carfilzomib  
and chemotherapy  in the elderly  population.[206]  Carfilzomib  was started  at 20mg/m2, then escalated to 
45mg/ m2, in 42-day cycles  on D1,2,8,9,22,23,29,30  for 9 cycles. Melphalan 9mg/m2  and prednisone 
60mg/ m2 were  given PO D1–4. The phase  I part identified  an MTD  of 36mg/m 2 in this combination.  In Phase  
2 expansion,  44 additional  patients  received  CMP   at 36mg/ m2 carfilzomib.  CMP was  well tolerated.  Overall  
response rate was 89.5%  including  56% ≥ very good partial  response.  The 2-year OS was 87%,  and the 
median EFS was 22 months.  Thus,  carfilzomib 36mg/m 2/melphalan/prednisone regimen is tolerable and 
effective in elderly  patients.  
 
Lastly,  carfilzomib  was reported to be safe in the use  in  combination  with  rituximab  and dexamethasone 
(CaRD) in patients  with Waldenstrom’s  macroglobulinemia.[207]  
 
1.4.7.  Experience With  Carfilzomib  In Combination with High -dose  Chemotherapy  And 
Hematopoietic  Cell Transplant.  
Costa  et al has conducted  a phase 1 study  of combination of carfilzomib  and standard high-dose melphalan 
conditioning,  followed  by autologous  blood stem  cell transplant  in MM patients.[208]  Treatment  consisted of 
two doses  of carfilzomib administered  IV over 30 minutes  on days -3 and - 2. 
The day -2 dose  was administered one hour prior to administration of myeloabaltive high- dose  melphalan  
200 mg/m 2. Carfilzomib  dose  consisted of 20 (day-3)/27  (day -2) mg/m 2 (cohort  0), 27/27  mg/m 2  (cohort  1), 
27/36 mg/m 2  (cohort  2), 27/45 mg/m 2  (cohort  3) and 27/56 mg/m2  (cohort  4). All 
subjects  received  pegfilgrastim  6 mg subcutaneously  on day +1. At the time of reporting,  enrolment  of cohort  
4 (27/56 mg/m 2 ) was ongoing.  Twelve  subjects were  accrued in cohorts  0-3 with no DLT being  identified.  
Median age was 56 (range  45-68) years.  Median number  of prior lines of therapy  was 3 
(range 2- 6) and 5 subjects had previously  received HDT/ASCT. There was no acute toxicity  associated with 
carfilzomib  infusion.  Median CD34+ dose infused  was 4.15 x 106/kg  (range  2.21-9.34).  Neutrophil  
engraftment  occurred at a median of 11 days (range 8- 15) and platelet  engraftment  at a 
median of 17.5 days (range 11-24). There  were  no non-hematologic  grade  4  toxicities.  The  most  frequent  
grade 3 toxicity  was infection in 7/12 subjects consisting  of  1  episode  of  pneumonia,  1 episode  of 
bacteremia,  1 episode  of urinary  tract  infection  and  4  episodes  of  febrile  neutropenia.  Other  grade 3 
toxicities  were  rash (n=2),  hypertension (n=1),  hypophosphatemia  (n=1)  and hypocalcemia  (n=1).  At the 
time of reporting,  nine subjects, from cohorts  0, 1 and 2 reached  day +100 response assessment and the 
cumulative  responses  were  PR in 3/9, VGPR  in 3/9 and CR in 3/9 subjects. Pharmacodynamic  studies  in 
peripheral  blood mononuclear  cells revealed  that carfilzomib.  Thus,  transplant  conditioning with combined 
carfilzomib  and standard high-dose melphalan is well tolerated,  without  impaired  engraftment.

1.4.8        Dosing Rationale  
Preliminary  data suggest  that carfilzomib  as a single agent  can produce substantial  response rates  in 
myeloma subjects  across  a variety  of dosing cohorts.  Responses  were  seen  over a wide therapeutic  
window,  from 15 to 27 mg/m2. Maximum  proteasome inhibition  was seen  at doses  11 mg/m2 and higher  in 
whole blood  samples  taken  1 hour after the first dose.   The final analysis  of the human  
pharmacokinetic  (PK) data is ongoing but appears  to be rapid and similar  to the results  from the animal  
studies. Carfilzomib  is rapidly  cleared from plasma  with an elimination  half-life of <60 minutes  at the 20 
mg/m 2 dose.  Large,  single  arm studies  of the 27 mg/m2 dose are ongoing and suggest  that this dose is very 
well tolerated with patients  being treated for >10 cycles  without  cumulative toxicities.  
 
In multiple  preclinical  studies, the tolerability  of carfilzomib  in rats has been shown  to be significantly  higher  
when administered as a 30 min infusion as compared to a rapid IV bolus.  Toxicities  observed with  IV  bolus  
injection  of  carfilzomib  above  the  MTD  at  a  dose  of  48  mg/m2   include  evidence  of 
prerenal  azotemia (transient  increases  in BUN  > creatinine)  as well as lethargy,  piloerection,  dyspnea,  and  
gastrointestinal  bleeding.  Notably,  death  occurred  in  ~50%  of  animals  at  48  mg/m2   when carfilzomib  
was given as a bolus.  Administration  of the same dose  (48 mg/m2) as a 30 min continuous  infusion  was well 
tolerated,  with no changes  in BUN  and creatinine  and substantially  reduced signs  of lethargy,  piloerection,  or 
dyspnea.   Moreover,  all animals  in the infusion  treatment  groups  survived.  The only toxicity  observed 
following  infusion  of carfilzomib  for 30 min was gastrointestinal  bleeding.  The reduced toxicity  seen with 
dosing by infusion may reflect  the reduced C max  of carfilzomib  vs that with  bolus  dosing.   Inhibition  of  the  
pharmacological  target  of  carfilzomib  (the  chymotrypsin- like activity of the proteasome)  was equivalent  in 
the bolus  and infusion  treatment  groups.  
 
In the clinic
, the MTD  of carfilzomib  has not been reached  in the multiple  myeloma (MM)  setting,  particularly  
when administered as a 30’ infusion.  27mg/m2  of carfilzomib  (bolus  administration over 2- 10’) is well 
tolerated in MM patients  overall  and can be tolerated for >12 cycles  in late stage  MM patients  with 
substantial  comorbidities.  
 
A phase 1 dose  escalation study  (PX-171-007) of single  agent  carfilzomib  administered is ongoing and as of 
10 July 2009,  over 65 patients  with solid tumors  had started  treatment  in the initial Phase  2 portion of the 
study  at 36 mg/m2  (bolus  administration over 2-10’). A review  of the tolerability  of 36 mg/m2  carfilzomib  in 
these patients  indicates  that this regimen was very well tolerated with only one DLT (fatigue)  and an overall  
adverse event  profile similar  to that seen with the 27mg/m2 carfilzomib  experience with bolus  dosing  (see IB 
for details).  Three patients  completed >12 cycles  of therapy  at 36 mg/m 2 with no evidence of cumulative 
toxicity.  There  were no significant  DLTs  observed;  the majority  of discontinuations  on the study  were  due to 
progressive disease.  Because of the long- term tolerability  carfilzomib,  the  Phase  1b  portion  of  this  
study  was  reopened,  and  a  separate  arm  for multiple  myeloma was added.  
 
In the PX -171-007 trial, more  recently patients have  been treated  with  carfilzomib  given  as  a  30- minute 
infusion  in order  to potentially  minimize  Cmax -related infusion  events. The protocol  was amended and does  
of 20/36  (20 mg/m2  given  on Days  1 and 2 of cycle  1 only;  followed by 36 mg/m2  
for all subsequent  doses),  20/45,  20/56 mg/m2 and so forth are being investigated.  Doses  of 20/56 mg/m 2  
are currently  being given  in two separate cohorts  of patients  with advanced MM and advanced  
solid tumors;  the lower  doses  were  well tolerated.  Preliminary  tolerability  information at this dose level (20/56 
mg/m 2) indicated  that it is reasonably  well tolerated,  with minimal  infusion  reactions.  In some  cases  at  
20/56mg/m 2,  dexamethasone  was  increased  from  4  mg/dose  to  8mg  with  the  56mg/m2  doses  in 
order  to reduce fevers  and hypotension.  As of  March  20,  2010,  seven  patients  have received 
20/56mg/m 2 and are tolerating it. Patients  with advanced,  refractory  MM being  treated at 36mg/m 2 and 
45mg/m2 have  shown  very good tolerability  (>6 months  in some  cases) with documented minimal  and 
partial  responses  in these heavily  pretreated patients.  These data indicate that carfilzomib  30-minute  
infusion  can be given  at very high levels, with >95%  inhibition of blood proteasome levels achievable and 
with (at least) acute tolerability. All protocols using ≥36mg/m2 carfilzomib are now administering the drug as 
a 30- minute infusion.  
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
  
 
20  
In addition to the above observations,  a phase I study  of carfilzomib  in patients  with relapsed and refractory  
multiple myeloma  was reported in abstract form at the 2009  American Society  of Hematology  meeting which  
demonstrated that carfilzomib  can be safely  administered to patients  with substantial  renal  impairment  
(CrCl<30, including patients  on dialysis) without  dose adjustment.[195].  
 
1.5 STUDY  RATIONALE  
 
We are conducting a phase  1/2 study  of fludarabine- based allo-HCT with the addition of carfilzomib  in 
patients  with hematologic  malignancy.  
 
The rationale for this strategy  includes:  
 
1. No effective  therapies  are available for high-risk or advanced relapsed/refractory  hematologic  
malignancies.  Current  combination  chemotherapy,  chemo- immunotherapy  or chemo- biologic  
targeted therapies  can only provide short -term disease control,  with inevitable  subsequent  relapse 
and refractoriness.  
 
2. The use of conventional  myeloablative allo-HCT resulted in poor outcomes  due to high immediate  
treatment -related mortality  (TRM) including regimen- related toxicities  (RRT)  and acute graft-
versus- host disease (aGVHD).  The attempts  to decrease  TRM  by use of reduced- intensity  
conditioning,  in turn, have resulted in higher  relapse rates,  despite decreased TRM,  thus there 
was no improvement  in overall  outcome.  In addition,  despite a delay  in onset,  aGVHD  
incidence has remained  high and has continued to be a major  obstacle  for transplant  
success. GVHD  therapy  with high- dose  steroid  and more  aggressive  immunosuppressive agents  
abrogate graft-versus- tumor  effect  and increase relapse.  At UM, the incidence  of grade II-IV 
aGVHD  was ~45%  while  1-year PFS was ~20-30% only for high- risk lymphoid malignancies  
and it was ~50%  for high-risk myeloid malignancies,  emphasizing the need of measure to 
decrease relapse and GVHD.  
 
3. Proteas
ome- ubiquitin  degradation system  has a pivotal  role in maintaining  survival signaling  in 
malignant  cells. Inhibition of proteasome function results  in down- regulation of the NF-κB 
signaling  pathway  and selective apoptosis  of malignant  cells with constitutive over-expression of 
this pathway.  The NF-κB signaling  pathway  also mediates  inflammatory  and immune response 
by promoting activated T and dendritic  cell function  and survival.  In addition,  proteasome 
degradation system,  independent  of the NF-κB axis, promotes  activated B cell survival.  
 
4. Bortezomib,  a reversible  first-generation proteasome inhibitor,  has anti-tumor  activity in 
hematologic  malignancies,  especially  lymphoid diseases. Moreover,  it has  been  shown  by  
Dana  Farber  group to decrease acute  GVHD  and relapse in a mouse  model  and in high-risk 
HLA- mismatched  unrelated allo-HCTs  for high-risk hematologic  malignancies  when  
incorporated into the conditioning  regimen.  
 
5. Carfilzomib,  an irreversible  and more  potent  second- generation proteozome inhibitor,  has been 
shown to overcome bortezomib resistance,  with significantly  less off-target  toxicities,  especially  
myelosuppression and neuropathy,  compared with bortezomib.  Pooled safety  data from phase 1 
and 1/2 studies  reported  <20%  incidences  of grade 3/4 myelosuppression  and GI toxicities.  In 
addition,  carfilzomib  has been used safely  when combined  with other  highly  myelosuppressive 
agents  in their full dosage.  Lastly,  carfilzomib,  like bortezomib,  may potentially  prevent  aGVHD  
through proteasome and non-proteasome mechanisms, while  preserving GVL effect.

1.6 H YPOTH ESIS  
Based on the above  rationale,  we hypothesize that adding carfilzomib to standard  fludarabine- based  
conditioning regimen  for allo-HCT for advanced or high-risk hematologic  malignancies  will decrease post-
transplant  relapse and TRM  by decreasing severe GVHD, leading to overall  improvement  in transplant  
outcomes.

2.1 PRIMARY   OBJECTIVE  
To determine whether  the addition of carfilzomib to fludarabine- based conditioning,  followed by allogeneic

after the last dose of carfilzomib  or on/after  day +8. 
 
3.5.8  ALLOGENEIC  HEMATOPOIETIC  STEM  CELL  MOBILIZATION  AND  APHERESIS  
PROCEDURE  FOR  RELATED  DONORS  
 
3.5.8.1  STEM  CELL SOURCE  
 
Peripheral  blood  stem  cells (PBSC)  will be the preferred  choice  of stem  cell source.  
Bone  marrow  stem  cells may be used;  cord blood  is not allowed.  
3.5.8.2  STEM  CELL MOBILIZATION  AND  COLLECTION  
 
For related donors,  PBSC  mobilization and collection  will follow the Institutional  Guidelines  for BMT  
Procedure.  The apheresis  procedure shall begin  on day 0 of transplant,  with a goal of collecting 3.0 to 
8.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg,  based on the recipient’s  body  weight  following  Institutional  Guidelines  for 
BMT Proced ure. For bone  marrow  stem  cells, the recommended cell dose is ≥ 2.0 x 108 mononuclear  
cells/kg recipient  weight.  
 
For related  donors,  fresh  PBSC  and bone marrow  stem  cells should be infused into the patient  on the 
same  day of collection or following  Institutional  Guidelines  for BMT  Procedure.  
 
For unrelated donors,  fresh  PBSC  and bone marrow  stem  cells should  be infused into the patient  
within  48 hours  of collection.  Further  delay  of stem  cell infusion  is at investigator’s  discretion  but this 
must  not beyond 72 hours  of collection  or following  Institutional  Guidelines  for BMT  Procedure.  
 
3.5.8.3  Donor  Lymphocyte  Infusion (DLI)  
 
The use of DLI is not mandated by this protocol,  even  in the setting  of  diminished  T  cell  donor  chimerism 
or relapse.  In such circumstances,  DLI may be considered at Investigator’s  discretion or following  
Institutional  Guidelines  for BMT  Proceudure.  Patients  will be considered “off protocol  therapy ” at the 
time of DLI infusion.  Patients  who receive a DLI will still be  followed  for  study  endpoints.

5.1 REGISTRATION/ENROLLMENT    PROCEDURES  
This study  will be conducted at the University  of Michigan.  Once  a patient  is deemed eligible  for the 
protocol,  a signed IRB-approved informed consent  must  be obtained form patients prior  to the initiation  
of treatment  with carfilzomib . Patient’s  data and eligibility  criteria  will be recorded at entry  of the 
study.  All screening evaluations  will be completed as part of the standard workup for allogeneic  
transplant.  Enrollment must be performed prior the initiation of treatment with carfilzomib.
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
    
 
27  
This study  is a phase 1/2 study.  The phase 1 part consists of 4 dose levels  [Table  1]. Subjects  will be 
enrolled on the first dose level 1, following  a standard 3+3 dose escalation rule until the optimal  or 
maximal  tolerated  dose  (MTD) [0/3 or 1/6 subject developing dose- limited  toxicities  (DLT)]  is identified.  
 
The phase 2 part is an extension  of the optimal  dose level which  is identified  from the phase 1 part 
and a total of 35 patients  will be needed on this dose  level [See 10.2].  
 
5.2 STUDY  DEFINITIONS  
 
5.2.1  Screening:  A subject  will be considered to be in the “Screening”  period from  the  time 
he/she signs  consent  until the date the subject is determined as either  “eligible”  or “ineligible”  (screen 
failure)  by PI or a Co-I. Patients  may be consented to this study  based on disease status  and other  
criteria  at the time of consent,  but later removed  from the study  prior to admission and initiation  of 
transplant  conditioning  regimen  if the change  of disease status  makes  the subject “ineligible”.  In the 
event  that his occurs, the subject  will be replaced.  
 
5.2.2  Enrolled:  A subject will be considered to be “Enrolled”  onto the study  once  they have  
signed consent  AND  have successfully met all screening  criteria , as documented by the 
inclusion/exclusion document,  AND  the eligibility  criteria  has been reviewed  and accepted by the PI or 
a co- I. The date of enrollment  will be documented  as the date that the PI or a co-I has reviewed  and 
approved  the subject’s eligibility.  Enrollment must be performed prior the initiation of treatment with 
carfilzomib  
 
5.2.3  Treatment  Period:  The “Treatment  Period”  is defined as the first day through  the last 
day of treatment  with carfilzomib  [Day +1 to +7]. 
 
The assessment and reporting period  for adverse events  (AE) related  to the study  drug  
(carfilzomib)  will start from day +1 at the time of carfilzomib  administration through day +100.  
 
5.2.4  Follow  Up Period : The “Follow  Up period”  is defined as the first day a subject is no 
longer  receiving  carfilzomib  (day +8) through at least  1-year  post-transplant  (primary  efficacy  
endpoint)  
 
However,  subjects  will be followed further  for 3 years  on  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (relapse,  GVHD,  
infections,  late toxicities  and survival).  Data  not concerning endpoints  collected  through other  BMT  
clinical  research studies  may be used for analysis. 
 
5.2.5  On Study : The “On Study  period”  starts  from the day that a subject  signs  the protocol  
consent  document  and subsequently  meets  the protocol  eligibility  criteria  (“Enrolled”),  completes the 
study  drug on day +1, +2, +6 and day +7 and ends  on day +100 or prior to day 100 if one of the 
following  event  occurs  earlier:  
 
1. Death  
2. Lost to follow -up 
3. Withdrawal  of consent  
4. Entry  on to a competing trial 
5. Relapse  and its treatment  or development  of new malignancy  and its treatment  
6. Grade III-IV acute GVHD  and its treatment  
7. Unacceptable  or dose limiting  toxicity  or complication  
 
After  day +100,  the patient  will be considered “Off Study/Off  Protocol.”  But they will be followed  for the 
primary  and secondary  endpoints  off study/off  protocol  until 3 year as  mentioned  in  “Follow  Up Peroid”.  
 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
    
 
28 5.2.6   Off Treatment : The “Off Treatment”  period starts  after a patient  has completed the study  
drug on day +7 or prior  to day+7  if one of the listed  event in 5.2.5 occurs  earlier,  and ends  a day +100.  
 
Subjects  who take part in this study  will be followed  for adverse events  (AEs)  directly  related to the 
study  drug (carfilzomib)  through day 100. 
 
Adverse events  occurring  after the “Off Treatment”  period (day+100) will  not  be  reported  unless  related  
(probably  or definitely)  to the study  drug (carfilzomib).  
 
5.2.7  Evaluable : Subjects  who have received  all the 4 doses  of carfilzomib  will be considered  
“evaluable”  for endpoint  analysis. The number  of subjects who are considered  not  “evaluble”  for endpoint  
analysis  will be monitored  closely. Additional  subjects will be replaced.  
 
6.          TREATMENT  PROCEDURE  
 
6.1       DRUG  PREPARATION  AND  ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1     STUDY  DRUG:  CARLFILZOMIB  
 
6.1.1.1  CARFILZOMIB   DESCRIPTION  
Carfilzomib  is a modified tetrapeptidyl  epoxide,  isolated as the crystalline  free base.  The chemical  
name  is (2S)-N- ((S)-1-((S)-4-methyl -1-((R)-2- methyloxiran-2- yl)-1-oxopentan-2- ylcarbamoyl) -2- 
phenylethyl) -2-((S)-2-(2-morpholinoacetamido) -4-phenylbutanamido) -4-methylpentanamide.  The 
molecular  formula  is C40H57N5O7 and the molecular  weight  is 719.91.  It specifically  functions  as an 
inhibitor  of the chymotrypsin -like activity  of the 20S proteasome which leads  to the accumulation  of 
protein  substrates  within  the cell and induction of apoptosis.  
 
6.1.1.2  FORMULATION  
Carfilzomib  for Injection  will be provided as a white  to off-white  lyophilized cake  or powder  which,  
when reconstituted,  contains  2 mg/mL  isotonic  solution of  carfilzomib  free  base  in  10 mM  sodium  citrate  
buffer  (pH 3.5) containing 10% (w/v)  sulfobutylether -b-cyclodextrin (SBE -b-CD, Captisol®). 
 
6.1.1.3  STORAGE  
Lyophilized Carfilzomib  for Injection must  be stored at 2–8ºC and in the original  package  to protect  
from light under  the conditions  outlined in the separate Pharmacy  Manual,  in a securely  locked area to 
which  access is limited  to appropriate study  personnel.  
 
6.1.1.4  DOSING AND  ADMINISTRATION  
Carfilzomib  for Injection  is supplied as a lyophilized  parenteral  product  in single -use vials.  The lyophilized  
product  is reconstituted with Water  for Injection  to a final carfilzomib  concentration of 2.0 mg/mL  prior 
to administration.  
For a standard dosing of carfilzomib,  the dose will be calculated using the subject’s “ actual”  body  
surface area (BSA)  at baseline.  Subjects  with a BSA >2.2 m2 will receive  a dose  based  upon a 2.2 m2  
BSA.  
 
Carfilzomib  will be administered  as an IV infusion over  30 minutes

. 
6.1.1.5  PRE-MEDICATION  
Dexamethasone 4 mg IV will be administered 30-60 minutes  prior to each  dose of 20 and 27 mg/m2 
carfilzomib.  Dexamethasone 8 mg IV will be administered  prior to each dose of 36 and 45 mg/m2 
carfilzomib.  In any case, subsequent  doses  of pre-medication dexamethasone may be increased  as 
clinically  indicated at the investigator’s  discretion.  
 
6.1.1.6  HYDRATION  
 
Per standard  BMT  procedure,  subjects  will receive adequate maintenance  IV hydration,  starting  on 
the admission  day, continuously  through conditioning  chemotherapy  course,  stem  cell infusion  
(transplant),  the first dose  of carfilzomib on day +1 of transplant  until the last dose of carfilzomib  on 
day +6, following  Institutional  Guidelines  for blood and marrow  transplant  procedure.  
Pre and post dose  IV hydration (between 250 mL and 500 mL normal  saline or other  appropriate IV 
fluid formulation)  will be given  for subjects,  for any reasons,  NOT  receiving maintenance  IV  fluid hydration  
on days  of IV carfilzomib  administration.  
 
6.1.2  STANDARD   TRANSPLANTATION   DRUGS  
 
6.1.2.1  FLUDARABINE  (FLUDARA®,  FAMP)  
Formulation:  The chemical  name for fludarabine  phosphate is 9H-Purin -6-amine,  2-fluoro-9- (5-O- 
phosphono-D- arabinofuranosyl).  The molecular  formula of  fludarabine  phosphate  is  C 10H13FN5O7P (MW  
365.2).  A fluorinated nucleotide analog of the anti-viral agent  vidarabine 9-D- arabinofuranosyladenine 
(ara-A) that is relatively  resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase.  
 
Availability: FLUDARA®  for injection  contains  fludarabine phosphate.  Each  vial of sterile  lyophilized  
solid cake  contains  50 mg of the active  ingredient  fludarabine phosphate,  50 mg of mannitol,  and 
sodium  hydroxide to adjust  pH to 7.7. The pH range for the final product  is 7.2-8.2. Reconstitution  with 
2 mL of Sterile  Water  for Injection USP results  in a solution containing 25 mg/mL  of  fludarabine phosphate  
intended for intravenous  administration.  
 
Fludarabine is available as a 25mg/ml  solution  for injection and as powder  for injection  (Fludara).  
Both products  are stored  in the refrigerator  (2° to 8° C / 36° to 46° F). Reconstituted  Fludarabine IV is 
chemically  and physically stable at room  temperature or 48 hours  if refrigerated.  In addition,  
reconstituted fludarabine (IV) contains  no antimicrobial  preservative and thus care must  be taken  to 
ensure  that there is sterility  of the prepared solutions.  Prepared solutions  should be discarded 8 hours  
after initial  use. Reconstituted powder  vials are stable for 16 days at room  temperature or refrigerated.  
Solutions  diluted in 0.9%NaCl  or Dextrose in Water  are stable for 48 hours  at room  temperature or the 
refrigerator.  However,  as stated  above,  reconstituted and diluted solution do not contain  antimicrobial  
preservative and should  be used within  8 hours.  
 
Administration:  The recommended dose of fludarabine in a non-transplant  setting  is 25 mg/m2 
administered intravenously  over a period of approximately  30 minutes  daily for 5 consecutive  days  per 
cycle.  Dosing  for standard allogeneic  stem  cell transplant  conditioning  regimen  is 120-160 mg/m2 in a 
total course.  
 
Potential  and Expected  Toxicities:  Fludarabine can  cause diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting,  and skin rash.  
Fludarabine can temporarily  lower  the number  of white  blood  cells, which  help defend  the body  against  
infection and other  diseases  in your blood.  This can increase  your  chance  of  getting  an infection.  It can 
also lower  the number  of platelets,  which  are

30 necessary  for proper  blood clotting,  resulting in easy  bruising and excessive bleeding from wounds.  
Less  common side effects  are aching muscles, general  feeling of discomfort  or illness, headache and 
loss of appetite.  Rare  side effects  include  cough  or hoarseness,  fever  or chills, loss of vision,  lower  
back  or side pain,  painful  or difficult  urination.  Rarely,  fludarabine can cause a temporary  loss of hair 
in some  people.  
 
6.1.2.2  BUSULFAN  (BUSULFEX®)  
Formulation: Busulfan is a bifunctional  alkylating  agent  known chemically as 1,4-butanediol,  
dimethanesulfonate with a molecular formula of CH3SO2O(CH2)4OSO2CH3  and a molecular weight of  
 246 g/mole. The pharmacokinetics of IV busulfan was studied in 59 patients participating in a prospective    
trial    of    a    busulfan- cyclop hosphamide    preparatory    regimen    prior    to    allogeneic  hematopoietic  
progenitor stem cell transplantation. Patients received 0.8mg/kg busulfan IV every six hours, for a total of 16 
doses over four days. Fifty -five of fifty -nine patients (93%) administered IV busulfan maintained AUC values 
below the target value (<1500 µM•min). Busulfan pharmacokinetics showed consistency between dose 9 
and dose 13 as demonstrated by reproducibility of steady state Cmax and a low coefficient of variation for 
this parameter. In a pharmacokinetic study of IV busulfan in 24 pediatric patients, the population 
pharmacokinetic (PPK) estimates of busulfan for clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) were determined. For actual body weight, PPK estimates of CL and V were 4.04 L/hr/20 kg (3.37 ml/min/kg; interpatient variability 23%); and 12.8 L/20 kg (0.64 L/kg; interpatient variability 11%). IV busulfan daily 
infusion of 3.2 mg/kg has been tested in multiple studies and considered to be equal in terms of toxicity and 
efficacy. Thus most centers use every 24h dosing.  
 
Availability: IV busulfan (Busulfex®)  is supplied  as a clear,  colorless, sterile  solution in 10-mL single- 
use glass  vials each containing 60 mg of busulfan at a concentration of 6 mg/mL  for intravenous  use. 
IV busulfan is packaged in a tray pack  of 8 vials. Unopened vials of Busulfex must  be stored under  
refrigerated conditions  between 2°-8°C (36°-46°F).  
 
Administration:  IV busulfan  must  be diluted prior to use with either  NS or D5W.  The diluent  quantity  
should be 10 times  the volume of Busulfex,  so that the final concentration of busulfan is approximately  
0.5 mg/mL.  Infus
 ion pumps  should be used  to  administer  the  diluted  busulfan  solution.  DO  NOT  infuse 
concomitantly  with another  intravenous  solution of unknown compatibility.  Warning:  Rapid  infusion of IV 
busulfan has not been tested and is not recommended.  Follow  the institutional  guidelines  for more  
detailed preparation and administration procedures  of busulfan.  
 
Potential  and Expected  Toxicities:  For BMT  setting,  busulfan can cause nausea  and vomiting,  
myelosuppression/ablation,  seizures,  diarrhea,  impotence,  sterility,  generalized skin pigmentation,  
scarring  of the heart  muscle and lungs,  testicular  atrophy,  cataracts  and the development  of a new 
cancer.

6.1.2.3  MELPHALAN   [ALKERAN®]  
Formulation:  Chemistry:  Melphalan  (L-phenylanine  mustard)  is a bifunctional  alkylating agent.  It 
forms  covalent  linkages  with susceptible  cellular  proteins.  IV administration of melphalan revealed  
rapid  elimination  from plasma with terminal  half-life of 1.8 hours.  13% is excreted  in the urine.  It is 
rapidly  distributed  in total body  water  and eliminated in a biphasic  manner.  IP administration of 20-30 
mg/M2 revealed a peak  concentration in the peritoneal  cavity  of 6.4 ± 2.4 µg/ml  and half-life of 85 ± 
30 minutes.  The peak  plasma concentration  was 1.22 µg/ml,  and half-life was 86 ± 31 minutes.  It 
induces  formation of DNA interstrand and DNA protein  cross -links.  
 
Availability:  The drug is available as an injectable kit. This kit contains an ampule of 100 mg (equivalent) 
melphalan, a 1 ml ampule of acid- alcohol diluent (containing 0.047 ml 37% HCl, q.s. to 1 ml with alcohol) 
and a 9 ml ampule of final duluent containing dipotassium phosphate, 108 mg propylene glycol 5.4 ml sterile 
water for injection q.s. 9.0 ml. This kit should be stored at room temperature and projected from light.  
 
Adminstration:  The 100 mg injectable formulation is put into solution initially with the addition of 1 m acid- 
alcohol diluent. When dissolution is complete, the 9 ml final diluent is added. This final solution has a pH of > 7 and should be used promptly. According to the manufacturer (8.5% hydrolysis 24 hours after mixing) a 
further dilution in D5W is also reportedly stable for 24 hours.  
 
Potential  and Expected Toxicities:  Human Toxicology: Melphalan's major systemic toxicity is bone 
marrow depression with secondary  anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, usually occurring within three 
to five weeks of the onset of therapy and lasting four to eight weeks. These effects are exacerbated by prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Other adverse reactins include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, 
esophagitis, colitis, increases in liver function and kidney function tests, renal/bladder necrosis, pulmonary 
fibrosis, respiratory distress, peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, alopecia, fever and hypersensitivity including edema, rash and anaphylaxis. At high doses, supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial 
fibrillation, may occur. The occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in patients treated with 
anthracycline/ alkylator  combination  chemotherapy.  
  
6.1.2.3  CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE [CYTOXAN®]  
Formulation: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent related to nitrogen mustard. Cyclophosphamide is 
inactive until it is metabolized by P450 isoenzymes (CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4) in the liver to active 
compounds. The initial product is 4- hydroxycyclophosphamide (4- HC) which is in equilibrium with 
aldophosphamide which spontaneously releases acrolein to produce phosphoramide mustard. 
Phosphoramide mustard, which is an active bifunctional alkylating species, is 10 times more potent in vitro 
than is 4- HC and has been shown to produce interstrand DNA cross -link analogous to those produced by 
mechlorethamine. Approximately 70% of a dose of cyclophosphamide is excreted in the urine as the inactive 
carboxyphosphamide and 5-2 5% as unchanged drug. Cyclophosphamide is well absorbed orally with a 
bioavailability greater than 75%. The plasma half- life ranges from 4.1 to 16 hours after IV administration and 
1.3 to 6.8 hours after oral administration.  
 Availability: Cyclophosphamide for injection is available as powder for injection or lyophilized powder for 
injection in 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g vials. The powder for injection contains 82 mg sodium bicarbonate/100 mg 
cyclophosphamide and the lyophilized powder for injection contains 75 mg mannitol/100 mg 
cyclophosphamide. Storage at or below 25oC (77oF) is recommended. The product will withstand brief 
exposures to temperatures up to 30oC (86oF).  
 
Administration: Cyclophosphamide for Injection: Reconstitute with Sterile Water  or Bacteriostatic Water for 
Injection (paraben preserved only) to a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Solutions reconstituted with preservative should be used within 24 hours if stored at room temperature or within 6 days if stored under refrigeration. If admini stered as undiluted drug at the 20 mg/mL concentration, reconstitute with NS only to avoid a 
hypotonic solution. Cyclophosphamide may be further diluted in dextrose or saline containing solutions for IV use

31 Potential and Expected Toxicities: Common immediate toxicities related to the use in a conditioning 
chemotherapy  include anorexia, nausea & vomiting (acute and delayed) , bone marrow suppression 
(leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia) , hemorrhagic cystitis, alopecia, immune suppression, abdominal 
discomfor t and diarrhea. Potential delayed toxicit y is gonadal dysfunction.  
 
6.1.2.5   RITUXIMAB (RITUXAN® )  
Formulation: Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody, which 
binds specifically to the antigen CD20 (human B lymphocyte restricted differentiation antigen, Bp35) located 
on the surface of pre B and mature B lymphocytes of both normal and malignant cells. The antibody is an 
IgG kappa immunoglobulin containing murine light - and heavy -chain variable region sequences  and human 
constant region sequences. Rituximab is composed of two heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light 
chains of 213 amino acids and has an approximate molecular weight of 145 kD. It is produced in mammalian 
cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle 
initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. Rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and recruits immune effector functions to mediate B- cell lysis. Possible 
mechanisms of cell lysis include complement -dependent cytotoxicity and antibody -dependent cell mediated 
cytotoxicity. The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL- 4 human B -cell lymphoma line.   
 
Availability: Rituximab is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative free liquid concentrate for intravenous 
administration. Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in either 100 mg (10 ml) or 500 mg (50 
ml) single use vials. The product contains 9.0 mg/ml sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/ml sodium citrate dihydrate, 
0.7 mg/ml polysorbate 80, and Sterile Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted to 6.5. Store refrigerated at 
temperatures of 2 -8°C (36 -46°F). Protect from direct sunlight.  
 
Administration: Dilute to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/ml in saline or dextrose containing solutions. 
Rituximab solutions for infusion may be stored at 2 -8°C (36- 46°F) for 24 hours and have been shown to be 
stable for an additional 24 hours at room temperature. DO NOT ADMINISTER  AS AN INTRAVENOUS 
PUSH OR BOLUS. Premedication consisting of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine should be 
administered prior to each infusion. Since transient hypotension may occur during Rituximab infusions, 
consider withholding antihypertensive medications 12 hours prior to infusion.   
 For each course of Rituximab after premedication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine, the first infusion should be started at 0.5 mg/kg/hr, maximum 50MG/HR for 30 minutes. The rate may be increased 
by 0.5 mg/kg/hr, maximum 50MG/HR increments every 30 minutes up to a maximum rate of 400MG/HR, as 
tolerated by the patient.  
 
If infusion related events occur at any time during the infusion the rate should be slowed or the infusion 
stopped until resolution occurs. Additional diphenhydramine may need to be given or other medications to 
treat the events occurring. The patient may be re- challenged after resolution of the event with the rate at 
50% of the rate at which the infusion was running when the event occurred.  
 
Potential and Expected Toxicities: Single doses of up to 500 mg/m2 and weekly x 4 doses of 375 mg/m2 
have been administered without dose limiting toxicity. Adverse events are most common during the initial 
antibody infusion and usually consist of grade 1 or 2 fever (73%), asthenia (16%) chills (38%) nausea (19%), 
vomiting (11%), rash (14%) and tumor site pain (3%). Hematologic toxicity is usually mild and reversible. Rituximab has caused severe infusion reactions including urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, or 
bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular 
fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events, transient decreases in the WBC or platelet count (patients with high levels of circulating tumor cells or bone marrow involvement), tumor lysis 
syndrome (patients with high numbers of circulating malignant lymphocytes or high tumor burden, bulky 
lesions), hepatitis B virus reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, other viral 
reactivations (JC virus,  cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West  
Nile virus, and hepatitis C virus), mucocutaneous reactions (paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), bowel

32 obstruction and perforation, serious cardiovascular events e.g. cardiac arrhythmia (reported in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients), renal toxicity including acute renal failure requiring dialysis.  
 
 
6.1.2.6    TACROLIMUS  (FK506,  PROGRAF®)  
Formulation:  Tacrolimus, previously known as FK506, is  the  active  ingredient  in  Prograf®. Tacrolimus 
is a macrolide immunosuppressant produced  by  Stretocyces  Tsukubaensis.  Tacrolimus has an empirical 
formulation of C44H69NO12 -H2O and a formula weight of 822.05. Tacrolimus appears as white crystals or 
crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in ethanol, and very soluble in methanol 
and chloroform.  Tacrol imus inhibits  T -lymphocyte  activation,  although  the exact mechanism of action is 
not known. Experimental evidence suggests that tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP -12. A 
complex of tacrolimus -FKBP -12,  calcium,  calmodulin,  and calcineu rin is then formed and the phosphatase 
activity  of  calcineurin  inhibited.  This  effect  may  prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear 
factor of activated  T- cells  (NF -AT),  a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for  the 
formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin- 2, gamma interferon). The net result is the inhibition of T -
lymphocyte activation (i.e., immunosuppression).  
 
Availability: Prograf is available for oral administration as capsules (tacrolimus capsules) containing the 
equivalent of 1mg or 5mg of anhydrous tacrolimus. Inactive ingredients include lactose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The 1 mg capsule shell contains gelatin 
and titanium dioxide, and the 5- mg capsule shell  contains  gelatine,  titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide. 
Prograf® is also available as a sterile solution (tacrolimus injection) containing the equivalent of 5mg 
anhydrous tacrolimus in 1 ml for administration by IV infusion only. Each mL contains polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil (HCO -60), 200 mg, and dehydrated alcohol, USP, 80.0% v/v. Prograf injection must 
be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection before use.  
 
Administration:  Tacrolimus  is administered as a continuous  infusion.  Oral preparation will be 
administered on empty  stomach every  12 hours.  
 
Potential and Expected  Toxicities: Possible side effects of tacrolimus include: depressed kidney function, 
high blood sugar, high blood potassium, skin rash, headache, nausea, vomiting.  Less common side effects 
are loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, vivid dreams, hallucinations, high blood pressure, seizure, 
decreased level of consciousness, anemia, agitation, tremors, irritability,  slurred speech,  tingling  in  the  hands  and  feet,  pain  in  the  palms  and  soles  of  the  feet,  weakness, and abnormal blood cell levels. 
All of these side effects are reversible by reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. Rare fatal cases of 
severe allergic reactions have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporine and it is possible that similar 
reactions could also occur in patients receiving tacrolimus.   
 
  6.1.2.7   METHOTREXATE   [TREXALL®]  
 
Formulation:  Methotrexate (formerly amethopterin) is an antimetabolite. Methotrexate  inhibits  dihydrofolic 
acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to  tetrahydrofolates  by  this  enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one- carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, 
methotrexate interferes with  DNA  synthesis,  repair,  and  cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. Refer to the FDA -approved package 
insert for more information. Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage 
and route of administration. With intravenous administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is 
excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is  
approximately  0.18l/kg (18%  of body  weight)  and steady  state  volume of distribution is approximately  0.4 to 
0.8 l/kg (40%  to 80% of body weight).  Methotrexate competes  with reduced folates  for active transport  across 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
33 cell membranes  by means  of a single  carrier -mediated active transport  process.  At serum  concentrations  
greater  than 100 micromolar,  passive diffusion  becomes  a major  pathway  by which  effective  intracellular  
conce ntrations  can be achieved.  Methotrexate in serum  is  approximately  50%  protein bound.  Laboratory  
studies  demonstrate that it may be displaced from plasma albumin by various  compounds  including 
sulfonamides,  salicylat es, tetracyclines,  chloramphenicol,  and phenytoin. 
 
Availability: Each 20 mg and 1 g vial of lyophilized powder  contains  methotrexate sodium  equivalent  to 20 
mg and 1 g methotrexate respectively. Store  at controlled room  temperature,  20°C -25°C (68°C - 77°C) ; 
excursions  permitted to 15°C -30°C  (59°F -86°F).  Protect  from light.  
 
Potential  Drug Interactions:  Methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin, and toxicity may be 
increased because of displacement by certain drugs, such as salicylates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and 
sulfonamides. Renal  tubular transport is also diminished by probenecid; use of methotrexate with this drug 
should be carefully monitored. Oral antibiotics such as  tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and nonabsorbable 
broad- spectrum antibiotics, may decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the 
enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria. 
Penicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate 
with c oncomitant hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity have been observed with high and low dose 
methotrexate. Use of methotrexate with  penicillins  should  be carefully  monitored.  
 
Potential  and Expected  Toxicities:  The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with 
methotrexate use as GVHD prophylaxis include ulcerative stomatitis, leucopenia and suppressed hematopoiesis, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse effects are malaise, 
undue fatigue, chills, and fever, dizziness and  decreased  resistance  to  infection. Methotrexate may be  
associated  with  increased  rates  of  pulmonary  complications  after transplantation. The risk of infections is due to the suppression of hematopoiesis after transplantation.  
 
6.1.2.8    LEVETIRACETAM   (KEPPRA®)  
Formulation:  Levetiracetam, a single enantiomer, is ( -)-(S)-α- ethyl -2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide, its 
molecular formula is C8H14N2O2 and its molecular weight is 170.21. Levetiracetam is chemically unrelated 
to existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Levetiracetam is  a  white  to  off -white  crystalline powder with a faint 
odor and a bitter taste. It is very soluble in water (104.0 g/100 mL). It is freely soluble in chloroform (65.3 
g/100 mL) and in methanol (53.6 g/100 mL), soluble in ethanol (16.5 g/100 mL), sparingly soluble in 
acetonitrile (5.7 g/100 mL) and practically insoluble in n- hexane. (Solubility limits are expressed as g/100 mL 
solvent.)  
 
Availability: Keppra is an antiepileptic  drug available  as 250 mg (blue),  500 mg (yellow),  750 mg (orange),  
and 1000 mg (white)  tablets  and as a clear,  colorless, grape- flavored liquid  (100 mg/mL)  for oral 
administration.  Keppra (levetiracetam)  500 mg/5  mL injection is  a  clear,  colorless,  sterile  solution.  It is 
supplied in single -use 5 mL vials. Store  at 25°C  (77°F);  excursions  permitted to 15-30°C  (59-86°F).  
 
Administraion:  Keppra injection is for intravenous  use only and  must  be  diluted  prior  to administration.  
Keppra injection  (500 mg/5  mL) should be diluted in 100 mL of a compatible diluent  (NS, Lactated Ringer’s  
injection or D5W) and administered intravenously  as a 15-minute  IV infusion.  
 
Potential  and Expected  Toxicities:  Toxicities reported in more than 1% in adults are asthenia, headache, 
infection, pain, anorexia, somnolence, dizziness, nervousness, anorexia vertigo, amnesia, anxiety, hostility, 
paresthesia, emotional lability, pharingitis, rhinitis, increased cough, sinusitis, diplopia.  
 
  6.1.2.9   FILGRASTIM  (r-metHuG -CSF,  NEUPOGEN®)  
 
Formulation:  Filgrastim, (recombinant human granulocyte- colony stimulating factor, r -metHuG - 
CSF), is a protein produced by E. coli into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony - 
stimulating factor gene.  Filgrastim differs from the natural protein in that the N -terminal amino acid is a 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
34 methionine and it is not o- glycosylated. G -CSF functions as a hematopoietic growth hormone; it increases 
the proliferation, differentiation, maturation and release of precursor cells into mature blood cells of the 
neutrophil  lineage. G -CSF has demonstrated in vitro  effects  on  mature  neutrophils, including an increased 
expression of chemotactic receptors, enhanced phagocytosis and intracellular killing of certain organisms, as well as enhanced killing of target cells that are bound by antibodies.  
 
Approximately 6,400 patients in U.S. and international based trials have participated in clinical trials of 
filgrastim to date, and the worldwide commercial populations receiving filgrastim totaled approximately 
190,000. The drug has been found to be well tolerated at dosages up to 69 µg/kg/day given IV or SC, with 
no toxic effects attributable to filgrastim. A maximum tolerated dose has not yet  been determined.  
 
Availability: Recombinant G -CSF, filgrastim, NEUPOGEN®, is supplied as a clear, colorless preservative-
free liquid for parenteral administration. Single use vials contain filgrastim 300 µg/ml in a preservative- free 
solution with 0.59 mg/ml acetate, 50 mg/ml  sorbitol,  0.004%  Tween®  80,  0.035 mg/ml sodium, and water 
for injection, USP, pH 4.0 to make 1 ml filgrastim Neupogen® is commercially available in 2 vial sizes: 300 
µcg/1 ml and 480 µg/1.6 ml. Dilution: If required, filgrastim may be diluted in 5% dextrose.  Filgrastim diluted to concentrations between 5 and 15 µg/ml should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by addition of albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. When diluted in 5% dextrose or 5%  
dextrose  plus  albumin  (Human), filgrastim is compatible with glass bottles, PVC and polyolefin IV bags, 
and polypropylene syringes. Dilution of filgrastim to a final concentration of less than 5 µg/ml  is not 
recommended at any time. Do not dilute with saline at any time; product may precipitate. Storage and Stability: Filgrastim should be stored in the refrigerator at 2 - 8°C (36 - 46°F). Avoidshaking.  Prior to 
injection, filgrastim may be allowed to reach room temperature for a maximum of 24 ho urs.  Any vial left at 
room temperature for  greater  than 24 hours should be discarded. Parenteral drug products should be 
inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and 
container permit; if particulates or discoloration are observed, the container should not be used.  
 
Administration:   Filgrastim  is administered as a single  daily injection by SC bolus  injection,  by short  
IV infusion (15 - 30 minutes),  or by continuous  SC or continuous  IV infusion.  
 
Potential  and Expect ed Toxicities: The most  frequently  reported adverse effect  was medullary  bone  
pain,  occurring in 20 - 25% of patients  in Phase II and III trials.  When  bone pain was reported it often 
preceded a rise in the circulating neutrophil  count;  it occurred more  frequently  in patients  treated with 20 - 
100 µg/kg/day  of intravenously  administered filgrastim and less often  in lower  subcutaneous  doses. The pain 
was generally  mild to moder ate in severity, and usually  controlled with non-narcotic  analgesics  such as 
acetaminophen.  Other  side effects  include transient  but reversible  increases of alkaline phosphatase,  lactate  
dehydrogenase and uric acid levels. These occurred in 27 - 58% of patients,  without  clinical  sequelae  
observed.  Elevations of  leukocyte  alkaline  phosphatase  levels  have  also been noted but the significance 
is not yet known.  Less  frequently  reported adverse events  related to filgrastim  administration include  
subclini cal splenomegaly,  exacerbation of pre-existing skin rashes,  alopecia,  and thrombocytopenia,  and  
cutaneous  vasculitis.  Rarely, allergic -type  reactions  have occurred.  Since  the commercial  introduction of 
filgrastim  there have been reports  (<1 in 4,000 patients)  of symptoms  suggestive of an allergic -type reaction,  
but in which  an immune  component  has not been demonstrated.  These have generally  been characterized 
by systemic  symptoms  involving at least  two body s ystems, most  often skin (rash,  urticaria,  edema),  
respiratory  (wheezing,  dypsnea),  and cardiovascular  (hypotension,  tachycardia).   Some  reactions  occurred  
on  initial  exposure.  Reac tions  tended to occur within  the first thirty  minutes  after administration and 
appeared to occur more  frequently  in those patients  who received filgrastim  intravenously.  Rapid resolution  
of symptoms  occurred in most  cases after administration of standard supportive care,  and symptoms  
recurred  in more  than half the patients  when  rechallenged.  
 
6.2 DEFINITION  OF DOSE -LIMITING TOXICITY  
Subjects  will be evaluated for toxicity  according to the Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse 
Events  (CTCAE)  of the National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  version 4.0 [Appendix  D] 
 
 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
35 DLTs  are defined as any of the below  treatment  emergent  toxicities,  with attribution  to carfilzomib , 
which  occur  within  day +28. 
 
NON -HEMATOLOGIC  
• ≥ Any Grade 3 toxicity  (excluding nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea)  
• ≥ Grade 3 nausea,  vomiting,  or diarrhea,  despite maximal  antiemetic/antidiarrheal  therapy  
• ≥ Grade 4 fatigue lasting for ≥ 7 days  
• ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy  with pain 
EXCEPTIONS 
The following adverse events  are NOT  considered  DLTs.  
• Any grade hematologic  adverse events  which  are fully expected after conditioning chemotherapy  
• Fever  < 38.5 °C plus all the followings 
• No evidence of infection e.g. positive culture and 
• No unstable vital signs  at the discretion of the investigator  or the attending physician.   
• Any grade alopecia  
• Any grade hyperglycemia attributed to dexamethasone  
6.3 DOSE  WITH HOLD  AND  RESTART  
If a DLT occurs  before day +7, the remaining dose(s)  of carfilzomib  will NOT  be administered.  
The remaining  doses  may be re-initiated at the investigator’s  discretion  if the event  is assessed not to 
be a true DLT.  However,  carfilzomib  will NOT  be administered  after  day +7. 
 
6.4 SAFETY  CONSIDERATIONS 
Based upon the experience in the Phase 1 and 2 clinical  studies  with carfilzomib,  the followings  are 
recommended:  
 
• Dexamethasone 4 or 8 mg IV (See  3.5.5)  will be administered prior to each dose  of carfilzomib.  If 
treatment -related fever,  rigors,  chills,  and/or  dyspnea are observed with a 4 mg dexamethasone,  an 8 
mg dose IV may be administered prior to subsequent  doses  after resolution of the symptoms  and no 
document  infection  is identified.  
 
• In patients  with high tumor  burden,  a “first dose effect”, which  is notable for fever,  chills, rigors,  and/or  
dyspnea occurring during the evening following  the first day of infusion  and an increase in creatinine on 
the next day, may be the clinical  sequelae of  rapid  tumor   lysis  and/or  cytokine  relea se. Treatment  
with high- dose  glucocorticoids  (e.g. methylprednisolone 50–100 mg IV) is recommended.  In addition,  
intravenous  fluids,  vasopressors, oxygen,  bronchodilators,  and acetaminophen  should be available  for 
immediate  use and instituted,  as medically  indicated.  However,  patients  who are eligible for this study  
generally  do not have high tumor  burden at the time of carfilzomib  administrations.  
• Acyclovir or similar,  which  is used for standard infectious  transplant  prophylaxis,  should be given  per 
institutional  prophylaxis  guidelines.  
• Renal function  or creatinine clearance (CrCl)  changes  are mostly  transient,  reversible,  and non- 
cumulative.  All subjects  should  be well hydrated during carfilzomib  administrations.  Clinically  significant  
electrolyte  abnormalities  should be promptly  corrected prior to dosing with carfilzomib.  Renal  function  
must  be monitored close ly during treatment  with  carfilzomib.  Serum  chemistry values,  including  
creatinine,  must  be obtained and reviewed prior to each dose of carfilzomib.   Carfilzomib  must  be 
held for subjects with a CrCl <15 mL/min  at any time during study  participation . 
 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
36 • Subjects  with documented infection  should not be dosed with carfilzomib  until the infection  has been  
controlled with appropriate treatment.  Low-grade fever alone (<38.5 C) without unstable vital signs or 
documented infection occurs frequently during transplant admission due to various non- infectious 
etiologies, and should not the sole reason to hold carfilzomib.  
• Carfilzomib  administration  can cause nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  or constipation sometimes  requiring  
the use of antiemetics  or antidiarrheals.  Fluid  and electrolyte  replacement  should be administered to 
prevent  dehydration. 
6.4.1  CONTRAINDICATIONS  
 
Besides  allergy  to carfilzomib,  there are no known contraindications  for carfilzomib.  
 
6.4.2  SPECIAL  WARNINGS  AND  PRECAUTIONS  FOR  USE 
The warnings  and precautions  in this section are based  on the analysis  of safety  data from Phase  1 and 2 
clinical  studies  submitted  as part of the initial FDA NDA submission for monotherapy  treatment  of multiple  
myeloma patients  who have  received  at least  2 prior therapies,  including  bortezomib and 
an immunomodulatory  agent.  
 
6.4.3  CARDIAC  ARREST,  CONGESTIVE  HEART  FAILURE,  MYOCARDIALISCHEMIA  
Death due to cardiac  arrest  has occurred  within  a day of carfilzomib  administration.  New onset  or worsening  
of pre-existing congestive  heart  failure  with  decreased  left  ventricular  function  or myocardial  ischemia 
has occurred following administration  of carfilzomib.  Cardiac  failure events  (eg, cardiac  failure  congestive,  
pulmonary  edema,  ejection fraction decreased)  were  reported in  7%  of patie nts. Monitor  for cardiac  
complications  and manage  promptly.  Unless  otherwise specified  in the individual  protocol,  withhold 
carfilzomib  for Grade 3 or 4 cardiac  events  until recovery and consider  whether  to restart  carfilzomib  based 
on a benefit/risk  assessment. Patients  with NYHAClass  III and IV heart  failure,  myocardial  infarction in the 
preceding  6  months,  and  conduction  abnormalities  uncontrolled by medications  were  not eligible for the 
clinical  trials.  These patients  may be at greater  risk for cardiac  complications.  
 
6.4.4  PULMONARY   COMPLICATIONS  
Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension (PAH)  was reported in 2% of patients  treated  with carfilzomib  and was 
Grade 3 or greater  in less than 1% of patients.  Evaluate  with cardiac  imaging and/or  other  tests  as indicated.  
Unless  otherwise specified  in the individual  protocol,  withhold carfilzomib  for pulmonary  hypertension until 
resolved or returned to baseline and cons ider whether  to restart  carfilzomib  based on a benefit/risk  
assessment.  Dyspnea was reported in  35%  of  patients  enrolled  in  clinical  trials.  Grade 3 dyspnea 
occurred  in 5% of patients;  no Grade4 eventsoccurred,  and 1death (Grade  5) was reported.  Monitor and 
manage dyspnea immediately.  Unless  otherwise specified  in the individual  protocol,  interrupt  carfilzomib  
until symptoms  have resolved or returned to baseline.  
 
6.4.5  INFUSION  REACTIONS  
Infusion  reactions  in clinical  trials  were  characterized by a spect rum of systemic  symptoms  including fever,  
chills,  arthralgia,  myalgia,  facial  flushing,  facial  edema,  vomiting,  weakness,  shortness  of breath,  
hypotension,  syncope,  chest tightness,  or angina.  These reactions  can occur immediately  following  or up to 
24 hours  after administration of carfilzomib.  Administer  dexamethasone prior to carfilzomib  to reduce the 
incidence and severity  of infusion  reactions. Inform  patients  of the risk and symptoms  and to contact 
physician if symptoms  of an infusion  reaction occur . 
 
6.4.6  TUMOR  LYSIS  SYNDROME  [TLS]  
Tumor  lysis syndrome occurred following  carfilzomib  administration in <1% of patients . Patients  with multiple 
myeloma and a high tumor  burden are at greater  risk for TLS.  Prior  to receiving  carfilzomib,  patients  must  be 
well hydrated.  Patients  should be monitored for evidence of TLS during  carfilzomib  treatment, and manage  
promptly.  Carfilzomib  is to be on hold until TLS is resolved.  
 
 
 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
37 6.4.6.1  GUIDELINES   FOR  MONITORING,  PROPHYLAXIS,   AND   TREATMENT   OF  TUMOR  
LYSIS  SYNDROME  (TLS)  
TLS, which  may be associated with multi -organ failure,  has been observed in some  patients  with high tumor  
burden who have been treated with carfilzomib.  This is not expected in typical patients undergoing 
allogeneic HCT.  In addition,  transplant  subjects routinely  receive IV hydration during conditioning 
chemotherapy  and stem  cell infusion.  
 
For few subjects  who are at high risk of developing TLS, standard TLS prevention measures  must  be 
followed including adequate  hydration and initiation  of allopurinol  or alternative,  per the institutional  
guidelines.  
 
6.4.6.2  Hydration and Fluid  Monitoring  
Subjects  should  receive  adequate  IV hydration during  conditioning  chemotherapy  until  at  least  24 hours  
after the last dose of carfilzomib  per standard institutional  guidelines for TLS.  For few exceptional  subjects  
who  achieve  adequate  oral  fluid  intake  and  do  not  receive  maintenance  IV 
hydration during carfilzomib  administrations  [day +1 to +7], a bolus  of 250–500 mL of IV normal  saline  (or 
other  appropriate IV fluid formulation)  must  be given  before AND  after each  dose.  
 
6.4.6.3  Clinical and Laboratory  Monitoring  
Symptoms  and signs  that may be indicative of TLS,  such as fevers,  chills/rigors, dyspnea,  nausea,  vomiting,  
muscle tetany, weakness,  or cramping,  seizures,  and decreased urine output.  Appropriate chemistries, 
including  creatinine,  and complete blood counts  (CBC)  with platelet  count  are routinely  performed and 
reviewed daily in transplant  setting.  Results  of laboratory  studies  must  be reviewed and deemed acceptable 
prior to administering the carfilzomib  dose.  Subjects with laboratory  abnormalities  consistent with lysis of 
tumor  cells (e.g., serum  creatinine ≥ 50% increase,  LDH ≥ 2-fold increase,  uric acid ≥ 50% increase,  
phosphate ≥ 50% increase,  potassium  ≥ 30% increase,  calcium  ≥ 20% decrease)  prior to dosing should not 
receive the scheduled  dose and appropriate management for TLS must  be initiated per institutional  
guidelines.  
 
6.4.6.4  Management  of Tumor  Lysis  Syndrome  
Management of  TLS should  be performed appropriately  or per the institutional  guidelines.  All cases of TLS 
must  be reported to Amgen  as a Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE)  through the normal  process  within 24 hours  
of the clinical  site becoming aware of the event.  
 
6.4.7  HEPATIC  TOXICITY  AND  HEPATIC  FAILURE  
Cases  of hepatic  failure,  including fatal cases, have been reported (<1%).  Carfilzomib  can cause elevations  
of serum  transaminases  and bilirubin.  Unless  otherwise specified in the individual  protocol,  withhold 
carfilzomib  in patients  experiencing Grade 3 or greater  elevations  of transaminases,  bilirubin,  or other  liver 
abnormalities  until resolved  or returned to baseline.  After  resolution,  consider  if restarting  carfilzomib  is 
appropriate.  However, carfilzomib will NOT be administered after day +7.  
 
6.4.8  EMBRYO -FETAL   TOXICITY  
Carfilzomib  can cause fetal harm  when  administered to a pregnant  woman based on its mechanism  of action  
and findings  in animals.  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies  in pregnant  women using  
carfilzomib.  Carfilzomib  caused embryo- fetal toxicity  in  pregnant  rabbits  at  doses  that  were  lower  than in 
patients  receiving the recommended dose.  
 
In general,  it is extremely  rare for female  subjects  receiving  conditioning chemotherapy  to conceive in the 
first 2-4 weeks  after transplant.  However,  all male  and female subjects and their partners  must  use dual 
barrier  methods  of contraception in the first 8 weeks  after transplant  when h aving sexual  intercourse.  
 
6.5 CONCOMITANT   MEDICATIONS  
Concomitant  medication is defined as any prescription or over-the-counter  preparation including  vitamins  
and supplements.  Concomitant  medications  should be recorded from 14 days  before transplant  (day 0) 
through the end of the subject’s study  participation.  
 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
38 6.5.1  REQUIRED  CONCOMITANT   MEDICATIONS  
Dexamethasone 4 or 8 mg IV (See  3.5.5)  will be administered prior to each  dose  of carfilzomib.  If 
treatment -related fever,  rigors,  chills,  and/or  dyspnea are observed with a 4 mg dexamethasone,  an 8 
mg dose  IV may be administered prior to subsequent  doses  after resolution of the symptoms  and no 
document  infection is identified.  
 
Subjects  should  receive antibiotic  prophylaxis,  which  are already  part of routine standard infectious  
prophylaxis  in an allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant  setting.  The  carfilzomib-specific  infectious  prophylaxis  
includes  ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin  or similar  and acyclovir or similar  (famiciclovir,  valacyclovir). Other  
transplant -specific fungal,  PCP and encapsulated bacteria prophylaxis  follows  institutional  guidelines.   
 
6.5.2.     OPTIONAL  AND  ALLOWED  CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS  
Allogenei c   transplantation   procedure   will   follow   standard   allogeneic   transplant   
protocol   per institutional  BMT  guidelines  including  the use of 
1. Granulocyte- and Granulocyte- Macrophage Colony -Stimulating Factors  [G-CSF,  GM-CSF]  
2. Blood products  
3. Concomitant   supportive   medications   e.g.   anti-emetics,   anti-diarrheal,   ursodiol   
(Actigall),  narcotic  pain medication,  parenteral  nutrition  
4. Allopurinol  or rasburicase  is allowed.  
5. Vitamins  and supplements  are allowed and at the Investigator’s  discretion.  
6 Other  supportive  medications  e.g.  bisphosphonates  and  erythropoietic  agents  are  
generally  not used during transplant  admission  but are allowed if indicated  subsequently.  
 
6.5.3  EX
CLUDED  CONCOMITANT   MEDICATIONS  
Concurrent  therapy  with other  approved or investigative anticancer  agents  in the first 28 days  
is NOT  allowed.  Disease- specific  maintenance  therapy  with  targeted  agents  e.g.  tyrosine  
kinase  inhibitors  may be used after day 28 at Investigator’s  discretion  
 
7. STUDY  TESTS  AND  OBSERVATIONS  
 
7.1 REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS  (TABLE  2) 
Per standard BMT  practice,  subjects will  be  followed  closely  during a transplant  admission,  
which  typically  lasts for 3-4 weeks  and will be followed  in outpatient  BMT  clinic  after discharge  
per institutional  guidelines  and as clinically  indicated.  The required BMT  Clinic  visits  for  
history  and physical examination and tests  are shown  in Table  2. 
 
After  1 year,  subjects  will be followed  in clinic  for history  and physical examination,  with 
appropriate tests  and investigations  per institutional  guidelines  or at Investigator’s  discretion  
for  relapse  and GVHD  until 3 years  post transplant.  
 
First clinical  GVHD  or relapse (before or after 1 year)  requires  a complete  workup per 
Table  2.

platelet  count  >20,000/uL,  without  transfusion support  
 
7.2.1.3  REGIMEN -RELATED  TOXICITY  [RRT]  
An RTT is defined as an adverse event  (AE) that occurs within  37 days  after transplant  or 30 days  
after the last dose of carfilzomib  (day +7), and is considered to be a direct  consequence and a related 
event  as a result  of the combination of conditioning  chemotherapy,  GVHD  prophylaxis  regimen  and 
carfilzomib.  
 
7.2.1.4  TREATMENT -RELATED   MORTALITY   [TRM]  
TRM  is defined  as any death due to the transplant  procedure,  including  death attributable directly  to 
carfilzomib  therapy.  Death due to, but not limited  to, the following  events  are considered a TRM:  RRT,  
GVHD,  infection and other  transplant  specific  complications  
 
7.2.2  EFFICACY  END  POINTS  
 
7.2.2.1  EVENT  
“Event ” is defined as the occurrence of “Relapse/Progression”  or “Grade  III-IV acute  GVHD”  or 
“Chronic  GVHD  requiring systemic  treatment ”. 
7.2.2.2  RELAPSE  / PROGRESSION  
See Appendix  B for disease -specific  definitions  of Response  Criteria,  including relapse/progression.  
 
Patholigical  confirmation of relapse is preferred.  However,  clinical diagnosis  alone  is allowed  at the 
investigator’s  discretion if the manifestation is deemed  unlikely  to be an alternative diagnosis.  
 
Progression is applied for disease not in complete remission  or complete response at transplant.  
 
7.2.2.3  GVHD  
 
7.2.2.3.1  Acute  GVHD  
Pathological  diagnosis  of  acute  GVHD   is  preferred.  Clinical  diagnosis  alone  is  allowed  at  the 
investigator’s  clinical  judgment  or following  Institutional  Guidelines  for diagnosis  of acute GVHD.  
 
See Appendix  C for Acute  GVHD  Assessment Guidelines.  Acute  GVHD  onset  may be beyond day 
+100.  Grading of acute GVHD  severity  is mandatory  and is the maximal  grade that eventually  occurs. 
 
Only grade  III-IV acute GVHD  is defined as part of the “Event”  in this study.  However,  the onset  of 
Grade III-IV aGVHD  is defined as the first day of acute  GVHD  onset  of any grade.  
 
7.2.2.3.2  Chronic  GVHD  
Diagnosis  of chronic  GVHD  is mainly  based on clinical  evaluation.  A biopsy  is at the investigator’s  
discretion.  See Appendix  C for Chronic  GVHD  Assessment Guidelines.  
 
7.2.2.4  EVENT -FREE  SURVIVAL  [EFS]  
 
7.2.2.4.1  EFS is defined as the period from day 0 to the “onset”  day of the first “Event” . 
 
7.2.24.2  Day 0 is the day of stem  cell infusion (transplant)  or the “LAST”  day of stem  cell infusion [Day 
0B, Day 0C etc; in this case, Day 0A is the first day] if there are >2 days  of stem  cell infusion  
(transplant).  
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
41  
7.2.2.4.3  Event  is  defined  as  relapse/progression  or  clinical  grade  III-IV  acute  GVHD   or  chronic  
GVHD  requiring  systemic  treatment.  
 
7.2.2.4.4  The onset  of “clinical  Grade III-IV acute GVHD”  is defined  as the first day of any grade 
acute GVHD  manifestation  leading  to the maximal  clinical  Grade  III-IV aGVHD.  Pathological  dianosis  
of  acute  GVHD   is  preferred  but  not  mandatory.  Clinical  diagnosis  of  acute  GVHD  at the 
investigator’s  discretion,  after appropriate exclusion  of other  causes, is sufficient.  
 
7.2.2.4.5  The  onset  of  “chronic  GVHD”   is  defined  as  the  first  day  of  initial  chronic  GVHD  
manifestation leading  to subsequent  systemic  therapy.  
 
Non- systemic  or  non-absorbable  topical  immunosuppressive  medications,  which  are  not  considered 
systemic  therapy,  include  
 
1. Topical  preparation of immunosuppressive agents  for skin, ocular  and oral mucosa  
2. Oral beclomethasone and oral budesonide for GI GVHD  
3. Other  immunosuppsive topical  preparation  which  is not absorbed systemically. 
 
Clinical  diagnosis  of  chronic  GVHD   at  investigator’s  discretion,  after  appropriate  exclusion  of  other  
causes, is sufficient  [Appendix  C]. Pathological  diagnosis  may be required as indicated.  
 
7.2.4.4.6  The onset  of Relapse/Progression is defined  as the day of pathological  diagnosis  or, in 
case of no pathology  confirmation,  the day of first clinical  manifestation of relapse/progression.  
 
7.2.2.
5 PROGRESSION -FREE  SURVIVAL  [PFS]  
PFS is defined  as the period from day 0 to the day of the first Progression /Relapse  [see 7.2.2.2].  
 
7.2.2.6  OVERALL  SURVIVAL  [OS]  
OS is defined  as the period from day 0 to the day of death from any cause.  
 
7.3 CORRELATIVE   STUDIES  
 
We will obtain 6 heparinized (green top) blood samples  (approximately  42 mL total)  from each patient  
during the course of the study  for pharmacodynamic  and GVHD  marker  studies.  [Table 3] Samples  [a 7 
mL extra  draw  each]  will be collected coincidently  with routine daily blood draws  on the patients  
during transplant  admission.  All samples  will be processed,  frozen,  and banked.  
 
Correlative  pharmacodynamic  and  GVHD   markers  study  on  day  -6,  0,  +3,  +8,  +14  and  +30  are 
secondary  endpoints,  thus failure  to acquire specimens  will not be considered a protocol  violation.  
 
7.3.1  Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assay  
A  PD  assay  measuring  the  inhibition  of  proteasome  chymotrypsin -like  activity  in  peripheral  blood  
mononuclear  cells [PBMNs]  will be used.  
 
Peripheral  blood  will be collected in heparinized green top tubes  prior to conditioning chemotherapy  
(day-6), prior to transplant  (day 0) and after the first two doses  of carfilzomib  (day +3) when there  
remain  an adequate number  of PBMCs.  
 
PBMCs   will  be  isolated  and  frozen  for  PD  assay  of  proteazome  inhibition  according  to  the 
manufacturer’s  protocol  and samples  and standards  will be run in duplicate.  
 Samples  will  be  batched  and  run  simultaneously  in  order  to  maximize  efficiency  and  enhance 
comparison of samples  
 
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
   
 
42 7.3.2  Plasma GVHD  Cytokine  Assay  
Peripheral  blood will be collected in heparinized green top tubes  prior to conditioning chemotherapy  
(day-6), prior to transplant  (day 0) and after two and four doses  of carfilzomib  (day +3, +8, +14 and 
+30).  
 
We will use commercially  available ELISA  kits to measure GVHD  cytokine levels. 
 
In each case, assays  will be performed according to the manufacturer’s  protocol  and  samples  and 
standards  will be run in duplicate.  
 
Samples  will  be  batched  and  run  simultaneously  in  order  to  maximize  efficiency  and  enhance 
comparison of samples.  
 8.   STUDY   DISCONTINUATION  
 
8.1 STOPPING  RULE  FOR  EXCESSIVE  GRAFT  FAILURE  
Stopping rules  for  excessive graft  failure will apply  to all subjects entered on  study.  Engraftment  failure 
will be defined as the inability  to achieve an ANC  ≥500/uL and a platelet  count  ≥20,000/uL,  without  
transfusion support,  within  35 days  post transplant.  We consider  engraftment  failure  in more than 10% of 
subjects  to be unacceptable.  Once  10 subjects have  been enrolled and followed for 35 days,  we will 
continually  monitor  the rate of EF35  and stop if we have strong evidence  that the actual  rate of EF35  is 
above 10%.  Subjects  who have not engrafted and die within  35 days  of transplant  will be considered to have  
graft failure  and contribute to the number  of events  of EF35.  The official  stopping  rules  are displayed  in Table  
3 and are the number  of events  that would  produce  a 95% confidence interval  of which lower  bound exceeds  
our upper  limit of 10%.  If AE35  equals  or exceeds  the numbers  in Table  3, enrollment  will be halted and the 
protocol  will be re-evaluated and either  closed  or modified and re-approved before re-opening. 
 
8.2 STOPPING  RULE  FOR  EXCESSIVE  MORTALITY  
Stopping  rules  for excessive mortality  will apply  to all subjects entered on study.  We  consider   all- cause  
mortality  in more  than 30% of all subjects within  100 days  of transplant  (ACM100)  to be unacceptable.  Once  
10 subjects have  been enrolled  and followed  for 100 days,  we will continually  monitor  the rate of ACM100 
and stop if we have  strong  evidence that the actual  rate of ACM100 is above 30%.  The official  stopping  rules  
are displayed in Table  3 and are the number  of events  that would produce a 95% confidence interval  of 
which  lower  bound exceeds  our upper  limit of 30%.  If ACM100 equals  or exceeds  the numbers  below,  
enrollment  will be halted and the protocol  will be re- evaluated and either  closed or modified and re-
approved before re-opening.  
 
Although  this stopping rule requires  100 days  of follow- up for each  subject, we will not halt accrual  to wait for 
full follow -up of previously -enrolled subjects. For example,  we will enroll  the 11th subject as soon  as they are 
eligible,  regardless  of whether  the first 10 subjects  have  all been followed  for 100 days.  With a projected  
enrollment  of just over 1 subject  per month,  we would  expect  to enroll  the 11th and 12th subjects before the 
10th subject is fully followed for ACM100.   As  a  result,  there  is  a possibility  of enrolling  one or two 
additional  subjects  on this study  before we discover the stopping rule has been met.

9. ADVERSE  EVENTS 
 
9.1 ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  
 
Adverse events  occurring  following  study  registration,  during  standard  conditioning  chemotherapy,  
stem  cell infusion  until prior to carfilzomib  administration,  will not be reported.  Study -related therapy  does  
not begin until initiation  of cafilzomib  administration.  Adverse events  will be reported  through day 
100, directly related to the study drug (carfilzomib) as mentioned in section 5.2.6 previously . Following day 
100, patients  will still be followed for relapse,  GVHD and survival  data only.  
 
9.2 DEFINITIONS  OF ADVERSE EVENTS  WITH  COMMERCIALLY  AVAILABLE  AGENTS  
 
This trial utilizes  commercially  available agents  for transplant  therapy  for patients  with hematological  
malignancies.  Commercial  agents  are those agents  not provided under  an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial  source.  In some  cases, an agent  obtained commercially  may be used for indications  not 
included in the package label.  In this case, the agent  is still considered to be  a commercial  agent  and the 
procedures  described below  should be followed.  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical  occurrence  in  a  patient  or  clinical  investigation 
subject  whether  or not it may have a causal  relationship with this  treatment.  An  AE  includes  
significant  exacerbation of any baseline medical  condition  including,  but not limited  to, the disease 
under  study.  Reporting requirements  may include  the following  considerations:  1) the characteristics 
of the adverse event  including  the grade (severity);  2) the relationship to the study  therapy  
(attribution);  and 3) the prior experience (expectedness)  of the adverse event.  
 
Expec t
ed events  are those that have been previously  identified as resulting  from administration of the 
agent.  For commercially  available agents,  an adverse  event  is considered  unexpected,  for reporting 
purposes  only, when either  the type of event  or the severity  of the event  is not listed  in: 
 The current  NCI Agent -Specific  Adverse Event  List (provided in the Drug  Information Section of this 
protocol);  or the drug package insert  (for treatments  with commercially  available agents).  
 Except  where otherwise  specified,  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE)  v.4.0  
will be used to grade adverse events  in this study.  
 
9.3 DEFINITIONS  OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  WITH  INVESTIGATIONAL  AGENTS  
As previously  stated,  an AE is any untoward medical  occurrence in a study  subject  administered an 
investigational  product  and that does  not necessarily  have a causal  relationship with this treatment.  
An AE with investigational  agents,  therefore,  can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including  
laboratory  finding),  symptom  or disease  temporally  associated with participation in an investigational  
study,  whether  or not considered drug- related.  In addition to new events,  any increase in the severity 
or frequency  of a pre-existing condition that occurs after the subject  signs  a consent  form for 
participation is considered  an AE.  This includes  any side effect, injury,  toxicity,  or sensitivity reaction.  
 An unex pec
ted AE is any adverse drug event,  the specificity  or severity of which  is not consistent with 
the current  investigator’s  brochure (IB) or prescribing information for a marketed compound.  Also,  
reports  which  add significant  information on specificity  or severity of a known,  already  documented  
AE, constitute  unexpected AEs.  For example,  an event  more  specific  or more  severe than described 
in the IB would  be considered “unexpected”.   
As in the case  of commercially  available agents,  whenever  possible,  the Common  Terminology  
Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE)  version 4.0 should  be used to describe the event  and for 
assessing the severity  of AEs.  Any events  representing a change in the CTCAE  Grade need to be 
reported on the AE case  report  form.  This includes  any change in laboratory  values.  
For AEs not adequately  addressed in the CTCAE,  the severity Table  4 below  may be used:  
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
  
 
44  
Table  4 
 
 
Any condition,  laboratory  abnormality,  or physical finding with an onset  date prior to the subject  
signing  consent  for study  participation is considered  to be pre-existing  in nature and part of the 
subject’s  medical  history.  
 
9.4 CAUSALITY  
Using  the following  criteria,  the relationship of the AE to the study  drug should be assessed as 
follows:  
• Yes:  The event  is suspected to be related if: 
- there is a clinically  plausible time sequence  between onset  of the AE and administration of 
study  treatment;  and/or  
- there is a biologically  plausible  mechanism  for the study  treatment  to cause or contribute to 
the AE; and/or  
- the event  responds  to withdrawal  of the study  medication (dechallenge)  and/or  recurs  with 
rechallenge (when clinically  feasible);  and/or  
- the AE cannot  be reasonably  attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other  drugs,  or 
procedures  
• No: The event  is suspected to be not related if: 
- the AE is more  likely  to be explained  by the subject’s  clinical  state, underlying disease,  
concomitant  medication,  study  or non-study  procedure;  and/or  
- the time of occurrence of the AE is not reasonably  related to administration of study  treatment;  
and/or  
- the event  is un likely  to be related to the investigational  product(s).  
 
9.5 REQUIRED ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
Therapy  for hematological  malignancies,  with or without  stem  cell transplantation,  is associated with 
significant  toxicity.  These  toxicities  are generally  viewed  as an anticipated  consequence  of therapy  
rather  than an adverse  event.  To summarize,  any grades  1 or 2 toxicities  and any “expected”  
hematologic  grade  3  or 4  toxicities  will not be reported  to the IRB nor to the  FDA,  as these  are 
expected in patients  undergoing stem  cell transplantation for hematological  malignancies.   
 
DLTs  and grade  3, 4 and 5 non-hematologic  toxicity  events  with  a  possible,  probable  or  definite 
relation to the commercial  agent  will be reported  to the IRB and the FDA.  In addition,  high rate of 
engraftment  failure  or excessive mortality  will trigger  a stopping rule (section 8). Only a dverse events , 
directly related to the study drug (carfilzomib)  will be reported through day 100, as mentioned in section 
5.2.6 previously .

45 9.6 HEMATOLOGIC  TOXICITY  AND  DEFINITION  OF PRIMARY  ENGRAFTMENT  FAILURE  
 
For hematologic  toxicity purposes,  neutrophil  recovery  will be evaluated in all study subjects. 
Neutrophil  toxicity  will be graded by a modification of the Autologous  Bone  Marrow  Transplant  Studies 
Supplementary  Toxicity Criteria.  The occurrence of any grade 3-5 neutrophil  toxicity will be reported  
as an adverse event  within  7 days  of its occurrence. Neutrophil  toxicity  will be  evaluated  post transplant  
using  the following  criteria:  
 
Grade 3:   Neutrophils<  500/uL for 35 – 56 days  post therapy.  
Grade 4:   Neutrophils<  500/uL for > 56 days  post therapy.  
Grade 5:   Death due to infection  associated with neutrophil  count  < 500/uL.  
 
The failure  to achieve  a neutrophil  count  >500/uL  within  35 days  of the stem  cell infusion  will be 
defined as primary  engraftment  failure,  and reported as an adverse event  and counted  in the stopping 
rules  for Engraftment  Failure  (section 8). 
 
9.7 SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  PROCEDURES  
 
All serious  adverse events  (SAE)  which  require  reporting must  be reported immediately (i.e. within  24 
hours)  to the Principal  Investigator  or a designee,  followed by written  documentation  to the IRB from 
the Principal  Investigator  (including the PI’s or designee’s  medical  summary  of the SAE)  within  7 days  
of the Investigator’s  knowledge of occurrence.  The Clinical Trials  Office  (CTO)  staff will coordinate  
the reporting process  between the investigator  and the IRBMED  and between  the investigator  and the 
FDA within  the applicable regulatory  reporting regulations.  Copies  of all correspondence and reporting 
documents  will be maintained in a regulatory  file held by the CTO. 
 
Patients  removed from study  due to graft failure  or other  reasons  will continue  to be observed  for 
adverse events  for an additional  30 days.  Deaths  due to primary  graft failure will be reported as a SAE 
regardless  of when the patient  was removed  from study.  Other  significant  events  or deaths  related  to 
causes other  than graft failure  occurring after the 30-day  observation period will be considered 
not related to the study  drug and will therefore not be reported.  
 
In addition  to complying  with all applicable regulatory reporting laws and regulations,  Sponsors  and 
Investigators  are  requested to immediately  (within  24 hours)  notify  Amgen  Global Safety of all serious  
adverse events/experiences  (SAEs)  prior to or at the same  time they are reported to either  an IRB or 
a regulatory  authority.

9.8 DATA  SAFETY  MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
 
A Data  and Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSMC) consisting of protocol  investigators  and the data 
managers  involved in the conduct  of the trial will meet  monthly  to review  the conduct  and activity  
of the trial.  A written  summary  will be made  at each meeting  and signed  by the Principal  Investigator  
(or a co- investigator  designated by the principal  investigator,  if necessary) and the data manager  
responsible for the study.  
 
During the course of these  meetings,  the investigators  will discuss  issues relating to (a) enrollment  
activity,  (b) safety  and adverse event  reporting,  (c) protocol  violations  or deviations  by  individual  
Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  
  
  
 
46 subjects, (d) data entry  and completeness.  A determination will be made  at each meeting to continue  
the trial without  modification,  modify the trial, or terminate  the trial based the attainment  of stopping  
rule criteria.  
 
Reports  of these DSMC  meetings  will be kept on file in the Cancer  Center  Clinical Trials  office  (CTO).  
The data manager  assigned to the trial will be responsible for maintenance of these records.  These  
Data  and Safety Monitoring Reports  and any other  pertinent  documents  will be submitted  to  the 
University  of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer  Center  Data  and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for 
review  on a monthly  basis  unless  specified  more  frequently  by a DSMB  ruling.  
 
10. STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
 
10.1 STUDY  DESIGN  
Subjects  will be enrolled  on the first dose level 1 of phase 1 part (Table  2), following  a standard 3+3 
dose escalation.  For any  given  dose level,  if none  of  the 3 subjects  has developed a  DLT,  dose  
escalation will follow. If a DLT occurs in any dose level,  the cohort  will be expanded to 6. Further  dose  
escalation will be made  only if DLTs  occur  in <2 out of 6 subjects. If >2 of 6 develop DLTs,  dose de- 
escalation will be made  to the previous  level.  The optimal  or maximal  tolerated dose  (MTD)  is the 
dose level in which  0 of 3 or 1 of 6 subjects  develops  DLTs.  
 
Table  1: DOSE  ESCALATION  SCHEDULE  
 
Dose  Level  Carfilzomib  (mg/m2) 
Day +1 Day +2 Day +6 Day +7 
1 20 20 20 20 
2 20 20 27 27 
3 20 20 36 36 
4 20 20 45 45 
 
After  MTD  or the optimal  dose level is identified,  a total of 35 subjects are needed on this dose  level.  
[See 10.2]. 
 
10.2 SAMPLE  SIZE  CONSIDERATIONS  
Based on the University  of Michigan experience on fludarabine- based related donor  allo-HCT, the  event -
free survival  at 1 year was 15% [unpublished data]. Event  is defined as relapse/progression,  grade 
III-IV acute GVHD  or chronic  GVHD  requiring systemic therapy.  
 
We expect that adding  carfilzomib  to a standard regimen  will increase EFS at 1 year from 15% to 35% 
and 35 subjects need to be evaluated for primary  efficacy endpoint,  with α error of 0.05 and statistical  
power  of 80%.  Thus,  we will enroll  37 patients  in the optimal  dose used  in the phase II part, assuming 
2 patients  will not be evaluable for endpoint  analysis.   
 
N = Number  required  
p0   = Historical probability  of event  within  1 year 
= (1-0.15)  = 
0.85 
p1  = Desired probability  of event  within  1 year 
= (1-0.35)  = 
0.65 
Zα   = 1.96 for 5% significance level  
Zβ   = 0.84 for 80% power  
For phase 1 part, up to 18 additional  subjects may be needed for possibility of 6 subjects  per 
cohort.  Thus,  we plan to enroll  a maximum  55 patients  (18 max Phase I, 37 Phase  II).

10.3 PLANNED  METHODS  OF ANALYSIS  
 
10.3.1  PRIMARY  AND  SECONDARY  OUTCOMES  
OS  and  PFS  will  be  modeled  using  the  Kaplan -Meier  method.  TRM,   relapse  and  GVHD   will  
be estimated with the cumulative  incidence.  
 
10.3.2  LABORATORY   CORRELATES  
The association of the values  and percentage change of each NFκB  and GVHD  biomarker  with the 
primary  and secondary  outcomes  will be estimated  with Cox regression  (for OS and PFS)  and 
competing risks regression  (TRM,  relapse,  and GVHD).  
 
10.4     SAFETY  ANALYSIS  
Subjects  will be followed  closely for AEs and SAEs,  the details  of which  including  incidences,  relationship,  
severity,  etc, will be reported to IRB and Amgen Global Saftey within  required intervals.  Once  10 patients  
have been followed for 35 days,  graft failure rate will be determined for excess  graft failure [section 8.1].  
Once they  have been followed for 100 days, all - cause -mortality  will be determined for excess all-cause-
mortality  [section  8.2]. 
 
11. INVESTIGATIONAL  PRODUCT  
 
11.1 CARFILZOMIB  DESCRIPTION 
Carfilzomib  is  a  synthetic  small  molecule  peptide  bearing  the  chemical  name  (2S)-N- ((S)-1-((S)-4-

AMGEN INC.  DRUG  SAFETY   
 
ADVERSE  EVENTS  REPORTING PROCEDURES 
All AEs (e.g., any new event  or worsening in severity or frequency  of a pre-existing condition or 
laboratory  finding)  with an onset  date after the subject signs  consent  for study  participation must  be 
promptly  documented on the appropriate summary.  Details  of the  event  must  include severity,  
relationship to study  drug,  duration,  action  taken,  and  outcome.  Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  
will be recorded on the appropriate form.  
 
All AEs that are considered related to study  drug must  be followed  to resolution or stabilization if 
improvement  is not expected.  
AEs should be reported from the time the subject signs  consent  through 30 days  post-last dose of 
study  drug or initiation  of a new anti-cancer  therapy,  whichever  occurs first. In addition,  the 
Investigator  should report  any AE that may occur after this time period that is believed to have a 
reasonable possibility  of being  associated with study drug.  If a subject is randomized  but 
discontinues  study  prior to receiving  any study  drug,  AEs must  be reported through the end-of- 
study  visit. AEs which  completely resolve and then recur  should be recorded  as a new AE. For 
subjects  who complete the end of study  visit less than 30 days  following  their last dose  of study  
drug,  a follow  up of ongoing  AEs should be attempted  by telephone,  and documented in the 
subject’s  source.  AEs  continuing at 30 days  post-last  dose  should  have  a  comment  in  the source  
by the Investigator  that the event  has stabilized  or is not expected to improve.  
 The Pr 
incipal  Investigator  is responsible for evaluating all AEs,  obtaining  supporting documents,  
and determining that documentation of the event  is adequate.  Adverse events  will be assigned a 
severity  grade using the NCI-CTCAE  grading scale  v4.0.  
All Grade 3 and 4 laboratory  abnormalities  must  be recorded as AEs on the CRF.   Grade 1 and 2 
abnormalities  should only be recorded if they require treatment  or are otherwise considered 
clinically  significant  by the Investigator.  
 
The Principal  Investigator  may delegate  these duties  to Sub-investigators  and must ensure that 
these Subinvestigators  are qualified  to perform  these  duties  under  the supervision of  the Principal  
Investigator  and that they are listed  on the FDA Form  1572.  
 
A. SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENTS  DEFINITIONS  
An SAE is one that meets  the following  criteria:  
• Death  
• Life threatening experience  defined as any adverse experience that places  the subject, in 
the view of the Investigator,  at immediate risk of death at the time of occurrence;  i.e., it does  
not include  a reaction  that, had it occurred in a more  severe form,  might  have caused death.  
 Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation    
  
  
 
85  
 
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or  prolongation  of  an  existing  hospitalization  (except 
scheduled hospitalizations  for non-acute,  unrelated cause such  as an elective  surgery)  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity 
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  in the offspring  of an exposed subject 
• Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death,  be life-threatening,  or require  
hospitalization,  may be considered an SAE,  when,  based  upon appropriate medical  
judgment,  it jeopardizes  the subject and may require  medical  or  surgical  intervention  to prevent  
one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition.  
Any death occurring  within  30 days  of the subject receiving  study  drug,  regardless  of the subject  
having discontinued from the study  must be reported to the Sponsor  as an SAE.  
 
B. SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  AND  DOCUMENTATION 
REQUIREMENTS  
 
All SAEs  occurring  from the time that the subject signs  consent  for study participation through  
30 days  after the last administered dose  of study  drug will be reported.  All SAEs  regardless  of 
relationship to study  drug must be followed  to resolution or to stabilization if improvement  or 
resolution is not expected.  
If a subject  is permanently  withdrawn from the study because of a SAE,  this information must be 
included in the initial or follow -up SAE report  as well as the appropriate form for Study  
Discontinuation.  
 
The sponsor  is responsible for notifying the appropriate Regulatory  Agencies,  when required,  
and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations  of any Expedited  Safety  Reports.  Generally,  
these are all SAEs  that are judged to be unexpected and related to study  drug(s),  as specified  in 
ICH E2B guidelines:  Clinical  Safety Data  Management   Data  Elements  for Transmission  of Individual  
Case  Safety Reports.  However,  certain Regulatoru Agencies  may have additional  requirements  
for expedited  safety report  submissions. 
This submission  of IND Safety  Reports  (North  America)  or Suspected Unexpected  Serious  Adverse  
Reactions  (SUSARS  [Europe])  will be cross referenced according to local regulations  to Amgen 
Inc. Saftey  at the time of submission.  
 
The Investigator  is also responsible  for notifying  the Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  or Independent  
Ethics  Committee  (IEC)  in accordance with local regulations,  of all SAEs.  
[ONLY  FOR  EUROPE: The Investigator  is responsible  to create an Annual  Safety  Report  of the 
overall  conduct  of the specific  study for distribution  to  the  EC(s)  and  Regulatory  Agencies.  Amgen 
Inc. in addition  creates  an Annual  Safety Report  including listings  of all Serious  Adverse Drug  
Reactions from  both Amgen Inc.  sponsored research and Investigator  Sponsored Trials,  and Amgen 
Inc. submits  this report  to the Regulatory  Agencies  in any country  where there is clinical  development  
or where the product  is marketed.  Amgen Inc.  will provide  the Sponsor with  the summary  sections  
and overall  conclusions  of this Annual  Safety Report.]Additionally,  the Investigator  is responsible  for 
reporting adverse events  to Amgen Inc. as described  below:  
 
Expedited  Reporting  by Investigator  to Amgen Inc.  
The Investigator  must  inform  Amgen Inc.  in writing  by Fax at the contact  information listed  below  
of all Expedited  Safety  Reports  submitted  to the relevant  Regulatory  Agencies.  These  notifications  
should be performed in parallel  to the Regulatory  Agency  submissions  [e.g., within  7 calendar  
days  for any  Fatal  or  Life-threatening  SUSARs   and  within  15  calendar  days  for  all  other  
 Phase  1/2 Study  of Carfilzomib  in Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation

SUSARs},  but in no case any later than 1 business  day from the submission  date. This must  be 
documented on a FDA 3500A  MEDWATCH or CIOMS I (for EU studies) form.  This  form must  be 
completed  and supplied  to Amgen Inc.  in English.  
 
The initial  report  must  be as complete  as possible,  at a minimum  including the serious  adverse event  
term (s), patient  identifier,  date of awareness of the event,  an assessment  of the causal relationship 
between the event  and the investigational  product(s),  and name  of the reporter  (investigator).  
Information not available at the time of the initial  report  (e.g., an end date for the adverse event  or 
laboratory  values  received after the report)  must  be documented on a follow - up MEDWATCH or 
CIOMS I form,  and submitted to Amgen Inc. in the same  timelines  as outlined  above.  The Amgen Inc.  
protocol  and the institutional  protocol  number  should be included on all reports  to Amgen Inc. . 
 All other  SAE’s  will be sent to Amgen Inc.  on a biannual  basis  in the form of a line listing  in 
English.  The line listing  must  include  the following  information;  patient  initials,  date of birth,  
sex, SAE onset  date,  SAE stop date,  event  name  (term),  outcome,  date of first dose of study  
drug(s),  date of last dose of study  drug(s)  prior to the event,  action taken  with study  drug(s)  the 
Investigator’s  assessment  of causality (relationship  to carfilzomib),  and the Investigator’s  
assessment  of expectedness to  carfilzomib. The sponsor  reserves the right to review  the CRFs or 
source documents  in response to any inquires  by regulatory  agencies  that the sponsor  may 
receive.

C. PREGNANCY 
If a subject or spouse or partner  of a subject becomes  pregnant  while  enrolled  in this clinical  trial or up 
to three months  following administration of carfilzomib,  Amgen Global  Safety must  be notified within  
24 hours  of the Investigator,  designee,  or site personnel  learning of the pregnancy  (See  Amgen 
Global  Safety  and Pharmacovigilance Contact  information above).  If the subject  is pregnant,  
carfilzomib  must be withheld.  
 
Subjects, spouses,  or partners  will be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy.  The 
Investigator  will be required  to report  the results  to Amgen Global Safety .  
 
If the outcome  of  the pregnancy  meets  a criterion for immediate  classification  as  an SAE— 
spontaneous  abortion (any congenital  anomaly detected in an  aborted  fetus  is  to  be documented),  
stillbirth,  neonatal  death,  or congenital  anomaly —the Investigator  should repeat  the procedures  for 
expedited reporting  of SAEs  as outlined above.

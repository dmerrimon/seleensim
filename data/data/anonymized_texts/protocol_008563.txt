Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  6 of 291 Introduction
1.1 Overview
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.  We aim to 
image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using Gallium-68 labeled HBED-CC 
PSMA (more commonly called 68Ga-PSMA-11) in order to demonstrate its utility.   We plan to 
utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 compound, so that this agent 
will become available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients.  
This compound has been shown to be superior to choline based PET agents for the staging of 
prostate cancer, both Carbon-11 and Fluorine-18 compounds.  But this compound was not 
patented and therefore no company or private entity will make the investment required to bring 
HBED-CC PSMA to market.  In the vacuum of availability, academic groups must take the lead 
in order to collect the necessary data for future FDA approval.  This protocol was developed in 
collaboration with the Clinical Trials Network of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular 
Imaging.  The inclusion criteria and study endpoints have been aligned so that inter-institutional 
sharing of data can be performed in order to pool data for final NDA submission..
1.2 Background
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer 
death in American men (1).   Existing conventional imaging (CT, MRI and bone scans) has a 
low sensitivity in detecting local recurrence or metastatic disease (2).  The one exception being 
NaF PET/CT for the detection of osseous metastasis.  Due to this limitation, numerous 
approaches to stage patients have been evaluated.
Choline imaging has been frequently used, as prostate cancer exhibits increase choline uptake 
that has been associated with the presence of choline kinase (3).  Choline uptake is increased 
in comparison to FDG in both androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer patients 
(4).  Choline has also been shown to be sensitive for the detection of recurrent tumor in patients 
with PSA (prostate specific antigen) values of less than 1.0 ng/ml (5).  There are two forms of 
choline that are used in imaging prostate cancer, C-11 and F-18 choline.  C-11 choline has a 
short half-life of 20 minutes, which limits its detection for metastatic disease but results in 
improved local detection due to decreased urinary activity at the time of imaging.  F-18 choline 
has significant urinary excretion that limits evaluation of the prostate but, but has been shown to 
have better detection rates for distant metastatic disease (6).  C-11 choline has limited 
sensitivity for osseous metastasis, possibly due to the decreased uptake time (7).  Additionally, 
the sensitivity of C-11 choline is limited in patients with PSA values < 1.0 ng/ml (8-10).  Although 
choline PET may be limited in sensitivity, it clearly delineates more lesions than cross section 
imaging or bone scan in patients with known disease (11).   In 2012, the Mayo Clinic obtained 
NDA (new drug application) approval from the FDA for the use of C-11 choline.  
A separate approach is to image the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA).  PSMA is 
expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells, and so would be an ideal cell membrane 
protein to image.  The initial imaging approach to PSMA imaging target the intracellular domain 
using Indium-111-capromab (Prostascint), a murine monoclonal antibody (12,13).  Although 
there was early promise for the detection of nodal metastasis (14), the agent was never able to 
adequately visualize osseous metastasis (15).  Although combination with SPECT/CT does 
improve lesion detection (16).  One main limitation to In-111-capromab is that it takes a 
prolonged time to localize to the target tissue, which likely relates to both the size of the 
monoclonal antibody and the fact that agent targets the intracellular domain of the PSMA 
protein. Additionally, Prostascint also recognizes an intracellular epitope so the antibody must 
cross the membrane to be effective. This likely only occurs in permeable dead or dying tumor 
cells. 
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  7 of 29Because of the limitations of In-111 capromab, there has been continued effort to develop 
agents that target the extracellular domain of the PSMA protein. The Ga-68 labeled HBED-CC 
PSMA compound has become of particular interest because in the last year there have been 
two important articles. The first demonstrates that HBED-CC PSMA has a higher sensitivity for 
the detection of disease than F-18 choline in a head-to-head intra-patient comparison that 
included 37 patients (17).  The second paper looked at the sensitivity of HBED-C PSMA in the 
detection of metastatic lesions in patients with recurrent prostate cancer (18).  Their results 
demonstrated a detection rate of 50% for patients with a PSA less than 1 ng/ml, and detection 
rate above 85% for patients with a PSA greater than 2 ng/ml.  These detection rates are 
significantly higher than that reported by groups using choline (5).
Because of the improved resolution and image quality with PET, ability to quantitate uptake, 
increased sensitivity compared to choline, we intend to evaluate the utility of Ga-68 HBED-CC 
PSMA for the imaging of prostate cancer. We expect that the data from this study will support 
applications for clinical approval of this imaging agent, leading to wider availability within the 
United States. 
Of note, although this project does not include biopsy correlation, a separate small trial is being 
initiated 
at the San Francisco VA Medical Center in pre-prostatectomy patients to determine the 
sensitivity and specificity of nodal uptake seen on Ga-68 HBED-CC PSMA imaging.  This will 
help to demonstrate the specificity of imaging uptake on the PET imaging.

Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  10 of 295 Treatment Plan
5.1 Dosage and Administration
The imaging agent (Ga-68 PSMA-11 or PSMA-HBED-CC) will be administered on an outpatient 
basis.  It will be administered a single time intravenously prior to the PET imaging.  The one-
time nominal injected dose will be 3 to 7 mCi of 68Ga-PSMA-11.
5.1.1 Other Modality(ies) or Procedures
5.1.1.1 Change in management surveys
Referring clinicians will be required to fill out a pre-imaging survey within 30 days of imaging.  
Please see Appendix 3.  Additionally within 30 days of the completion of imaging, the referring 
physician will be requested to fill out a post-imaging survey, and finally six months after imaging, 
a third survey will be filled out.
5.1.1.2 PET imaging
a)68Ga-PSMA-11 PET preparation and injection:
The injected dose will be 111-259 MBq (3-7 mCi) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET.  A dose of 20
mg of Furosemide (Lasix) is recommended to be injected together with, shortly before or
after administration of the radiotracer in order to minimize PET scatter artifacts from
excreted radiotracer accumulation in the kidney and urinary bladder that can occur with
the gallium-68 radionuclide.  Oral hydration and voiding is recommended immediately
before start of the scan.  Furosemide should not be administered in patients with medical
contraindications to Furosemide administration including allergies and adverse reactions
including sulfa allergies.  (Note: Application of Furosemide can be omitted as part of the
PET imaging protocol if a second-generation scatter correction algorithm is available for
the PET scanner used in this protocol).    PET imaging will begin 50-100 minutes after
injection.  Scan time per bed position will be determined based on each sites PET
scanner capabilities.
b) Patient preparation: no fasting is required.
c)
PET protocol: Scan coverage will extend from mid thigh to the base of the skull, starting
from the mid-thighs to prevent urinary bladder radiotracer accumulation at the start of
PET imaging.  Bed position scan time will be dependent on each sites scanner
capabilities.  At a minimum, 3 minutes per bed position will be used.  In certain
circumstances, coverage may be extended to the toes.  Contrast may be administered if
requested by the referring clinician and is decided site dependent.
d) Patient monitoring: Vital signs will be assessed immediately before and after injection of
68Ga-PSMA-11
 (HR and supine BP).  Patients will be monitored for adverse events
during injection and for two hours after radiotracer administration.   Additionally, patient’s
vitals (HR and supine BP) will be checked at the completion of the imaging study prior to
leaving the imaging center.
e) Patient follow-up: Patients will be contacted by phone one to three days after 68Ga-
PSMA-11 
PET to assess for the development of delayed adverse events.  Patients will
be seen in the clinic if there are any concerning study related adverse events requiring
further evaluation.

7.3 Definitions of Adverse Events
7.3.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related.  More specifically, an adverse event (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, without any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
7.3.2 Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by the use of a drug.  Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.
7.3.2.1 Suspected 
A 
suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.
7.3.2.2 Unexpected 
An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or 
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  14 of 29as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure.  For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial 
would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally 
not be listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.
7.3.2.3 Serious
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal 
life function
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
7.3.2.4 Life-threatening
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
7.4 Recording of an Adverse Event
All grade 3 and above adverse events will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE v4.0.   The 
Investigator 
will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of the 
investigational drug. 
Relationship Attribution Description 
UnrelatedThe AE is clearly NOT related to the 
intervention Unrelated to investigational 
drug/interventionUnlikelyThe AE is doubtfully related to the 
intervention 
Possible The AE may be related to the intervention 
Probable The AE is likely related to the intervention Related to investigational

Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  15 of 29Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by the Investigator 
according 
to the CTCAE.  When specific adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE they will be 
graded by the Investigator as none , mild, moderate  or severe according to the following grades 
and definitions:
Grade 0 No AE (or within normal limits)
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, cautery) 
indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-
care ADL
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5: Death related to AE
7.5 Follow-up of Adverse Events
All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved.  
Patients 
removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  For selected adverse events for which administration of the 
investigational drug was stopped, a re-challenge of the subject with the investigational drug may 
be conducted if considered both safe and ethical by the Investigator.
7.6 Expedited Reporting 
Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within 30 days after the last 
administration 
of the study drug(s) and it is determined to be related either to the study drug(s) 
or to a study procedure, the Investigator or his/her designee must notify the DSMC Chair (or 
qualified alternate) within 1 business day of knowledge of the event.  The contact may be by 
phone or e-mail.
Reporting to UCSF Committee on Human Research (Institutional Review Board)
The Principal Investigator must report events meeting the UCSF CHR definition of 
“Unanticipated Problem” (UP) and the San Francisco VA Medical Center within 5 business days 
of his/her awareness of the event. 
Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor-Investigator is responsible for 
determining 
whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited 
reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32). 
The Investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor-Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions: 
Suspected adverse reaction (as defined in 6.1.30)
Unexpected (as defined in 0)
Serious (as defined in 6.1.5)
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  16 of 29If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited 
IND safety report.
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)). 
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will 
be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)). 
8 Statistical Considerations and Evaluation of Results
8.1 Study Endpoints
Per patient and per region 68Ga-PSMA-11  positivity.
Biopsy correlation.
8.1.1
Randomization
There will be no randomization performed.  There will be no blinding performed.
8.2
Determination of Sample Size and Accrual Rate
8.2.1 Sample Size and Power Estimate
The primary endpoint is to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) on a (1) per-patient and 
(2) per-region-basis (prostate bed, pelvis, extrapelvic soft tissue, and bone metastases) of 68Ga-
PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy. Based on the
results of previous studies, the following distribution of disease across the four regions are
anticipated (19-21):
a) Prostate bed: 30%
b) Pelvis: 15%
c)
Extrapelvic soft tissue: 20%
d) Bone metastases: 35%
It is anticipated that the PPV for the four regions and for all regions combined using 
conventional 
imaging ranges from 30-60%. An overall PPV for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET of at most 
50% will be considered as unacceptably low. Hence, the null hypothesis that the PPV is at most 
50% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis that the PPV is greater than 50%. It is 
hypothesized that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging on the per-region and per-patient basis will 
substantially increase the PPV for the four regions to at least 70%. A sample size of 75 true 
positives is required for rejecting the null hypothesis that the PPV is at most 50% with 90% 
power at the one-sided 0.01 (=0.05/5 – a Bonferroni adjustment for evaluating the PPV for the 
four regions and for all regions combined) significance level, assuming an average regions 
specific prevalence of 20%.  It is expected that approximately 25% of the accrued patients will 
undergo a biopsy.  Hence, the proposed total number of patients requiring a biopsy is 375 in 
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  17 of 29order to power the analysis at a per region level. Assuming a prevalence rate of 20% for 
disease 
in each individual region, a total sample size of 1,500 patients is required.  The 
following table shows the attainable power levels for detecting an increase in the PPV from 50% 
to 70% at the one-sided 0.01 significance level for the four disease regions and for all regions 
combined with the proposed sample size of 1500 patients:
Table: Attainable power levels for detecting an increase in PPV from 50% to 70% with sample 
size of 1,500 patients (375 biopsies)
Prevalence Number of Biopsies with 
True 
PositivesPower
Prostate bed 30% 113 98%
Pelvis 15% 56 78%
Extrapelvic soft tissue 20% 75 90%
Bone metastases 35% 131 >99%
All regions combined 100% 375 >99%
In summary, the proposed target accrual of 1,500 patients (375 with biopsies) will provide 
adequate power for detecting the anticipated improvement in the PPV for both the per-patient 
and per-region based 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging when compared to conventional imaging.  
However, a sample size of 107 patients with biopsies in total is sufficient for detecting the 
anticipated improvement in PPV when evaluating per-patient based positive predictive value.  
8.2.2 Accrual estimates
We estimate that roughly 125 patients with prostate cancer will be enrolled in this trial per year.  
Over a four-year period this will result in up to 375 patients being enrolled in the study.
8.3 Analyses Plans
8.3.1 Analysis Population
Patients with histopathology correlates will be analyzed for the Primary Aim.  All remaining 
patients will be analyzed for the secondary endpoints.
8.3.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoints
PPVs on a per-patient and per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor 
location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy will be calculated and reported along with the 
corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed 
using the Wilson score method.
a) Imaging interpretation 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET:
PET images will initially be interpreted by a board certified nuclear medicine physician or
a board certified radiologist experienced in reading PET at the time of the imaging study
at the institution that the study is being performed. These interpretations will not be used
for final evaluation.   For the data sets included in the analysis for the Primary Endpoint,
imaging data will be anonymized and collected at a central site. PET data will be
interpreted by three different readers in a random order at separate reading sessions.
68Ga-PSMA PET/CT reading training set and guides will be provided and completion of
this training will be required for all central review readers.
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  18 of 29Visual interpretation: 
Regions 
of suspected disease will be graded on a two-point scale by each reader 
(0=Negative 
or 1= Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion in 
this region is visually positive.
i) Lymph nodes will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake is focal and
greater than blood pool (adjacent or mediastinal blood pool). Pelvic lymph nodes
will be subclassified according to their localization as follows: R/L obturator, R/L
external iliac, R/L internal iliac and other (total of 7 subgroups).
ii) Visceral lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake is focal
and greater than physiologic background activity of the involvement organ or
anatomic site.
iii) Bone lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake is focal and
greater than physiologic bone marrow.
iv) Prostate bed and prostate lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA-
11 uptake is focal and greater than physiologic background activity of the
involvement organ or anatomic site.
b) Follow-up Imaging:
All patients will be followed up 3-12 months with conventional imaging (dedicated CT,
MRI 
and/or bone scan).  Interpretation of follow-up imaging will be performed by local
read. The follow-up conventional imaging should be the same modality/modalities as the
initial staging work-up to allow for reproducible and accurate comparisons.
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET positive findings will be validated as true or false positive as
outlined in more detail below. False negative 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET findings cannot be
determined as this would require biopsies of 68Ga-PSMA-11 negative but conventional or
functional non-68Ga-PSMA-11 PET positive imaging lesions. Inclusion of such patients
however would be violation of the inclusion criteria.
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET validation based on follow-up imaging:
i) Lymph nodes will be assessed by change in size. 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lymph
nodes will be considered:
(1)
True positive:
-
If on follow-up imaging within 3-12 months, lymph nodes seen on CT or MRI
decrease 
by more than 30% (for patients undergoing systemic treatment of
focal therapy at this site) or increase by more than 20% in short axis diameter
(with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size).
- If patients with solitary lymph node regions show a decrease of PSA by
greater 
than 50% after targeted treatment (i.e. external beam radiation) and
the lymph nodes do not change in size (less than 30% decrease or less than
20% increase in short axis diameter).
(2) False positive:
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  19 of 29- If on follow-up imaging within 3-12 months, sites of initial68Ga-PSMA-11
positive 
lymph node lesions seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30%
without systemic therapy or focal therapy at this site.
- If 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lymph node lesions do not meet the criteria for
above false positive or true positive findings.
ii) Visceral lesions (non-lymph node soft tissue or organ) will be assessed by
change in size. 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive visceral lesions will be considered:
(1) True positive:
-
If on follow-up imaging within 3-12 months, visceral lesions seen on CT or
MRI 
decrease by 30% (for patients undergoing systemic treatment of focal
therapy at this site)or increase by 20% in largest diameter.
- If patients with solitary visceral metastasis show a decrease of PSA by
greater 
than 50% after targeted treatment (i.e. external beam radiation) and
lesions do not change in size (less than 30% decrease or 20% increase in
largest diameter).
(2) False positive:
- If on follow-up imaging within 3-12 months, sites of initial68Ga-PSMA-11
positive 
lymph node lesions seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30%
without systemic therapy or focal therapy at this site.
- If 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lymph node lesions do not meet the criteria for
above false positive or true positive findings.
iii)68Ga-PSMA-11 positive bone lesions will be considered:
(1) True positive:
-
If there was a corresponding positive sclerotic lesion on the CT portion of
the 68Ga-PSMA-11 
PET.
- If there is focal uptake seen on the baseline bone scan performed within
one 
month of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET.
- If there is a lesion noted on the initial MRI performed within one month of
68Ga-PSMA-11 
PET.
- If within 12 months follow-up CT demonstrates development of sclerosis.
-
If within 12 months follow-up MRI demonstrates a new bone lesion.
-
If within 12 months follow-up bone scan demonstrates new focal uptake.
(2)
False positive:
- If 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive bone lesions do not meet the criteria for true
positive findings.
iv)68Ga-PSMA-11 positive prostate bed and prostate lesions will be considered:
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  20 of 29(1) True positive:
-
If on follow-up imaging within 12 months, lesions seen on CT or MRI
decrease 
by 30% (for patients undergoing systemic treatment of focal therapy
at this site) or increase by 20% in largest diameter..
- If patients with prostate bed lesions show a decrease of PSA by greater
than 
50% after targeted treatment (i.e. external beam radiation) and lesions
do not change in size (less than 30% decrease or 20% increase in largest
diameter).
(2) False positive:
- If on follow-up imaging within 3-12 months, sites of initial68Ga-PSMA-11
positive 
lymph node lesions seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30%
without systemic therapy or focal therapy at this site.
- If 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lymph node lesions do not meet the criteria for
above false positive or true positive findings.
c) Histopathology/Biopsy:
i) Localization of lesions for histopathology/biopsy will be a classified according to the
regions in table 1.
ii)68Ga-PSMA-11 positive findings are aimed to be confirmed by histopathology/biopsy
if clinically feasible.
iii) Histopathological procedures and biopsies will be performed as clinically indicated
and as per institutional protocol.
(1) Positive HP/Biopsy: Confirmed sites of metastatic or tumor involvement by
histopathology/biopsy will be discussed with the responsible physician/surgeon.
(2) Negative Biopsy: Patients with suspected tumor recurrence on 68Ga-PSMA-11
PET with negative histopathology/biopsy will be handled as outlined below:
(a) Lymph nodes:
For patients undergoing nodal dissection: Patients will be rescanned with
dedicated 
CT or MRI to determine if the suspicious 68Ga-PSMA-11 
positive node was removed.  
1. If 68Ga-PSMA-11  positive lymph node is still present, a repeat biopsy
can be pursued if clinically feasible and applicable, or follow-up using
imaging as described above will be performed.
2. If the corresponding node was removed, then this will be considered a
False 
Positive.
For patients undergoing needle biopsy: Images of the procedure will be 
reviewed 
to determine if the correct node was biopsied.  
1. If the correct node was biopsied, then a negative biopsy will be
considered 
a False Positive.
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  21 of 292. If the incorrect node was biopsied, then follow-up imaging as
described 
above will be performed.
(b) Bone lesions:  Given the high rate of false negative biopsies for osseous
metastases in patients with prostate cancer, patients with negative bone
biopsies of PSMA PET positive lesions will be further evaluated:
If pathology demonstrates an alternative diagnoses that is known to be
PSMA 
positive (eg Renal Cell Carcinoma metastases, Paget’s disease), 
then this will be considered a False Positive.
If pathology is indeterminate, then follow-up imaging as described above 
will 
be performed to determine if the lesion is a True Positive or False 
Positive.
(c) Additionally a repeat 68Ga-PSMA-11 can also be obtained, as allowable, in
addition to repeat conventional imaging (CT and/or MRI) in cases of negative
biopsy to determine if the biopsy was true negative or false negative.
(d) Although not routinely performed during standard practice,
immunohistochemical staining for PSMA of tumor specimens (primary and
lymph node metastases) may be performed, although not required.
8.3.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
PPVs on a per-patient and per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor 
location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy and conventional imaging follow-up will be 
calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The 
paired McNemar’s test will be used to compare the PPVs of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging to the 
PPVs of conventional imaging.
Sensitivity, specificity, and NPVs on a per-patient basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of 
tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy will be summarized in tabular format. 
Furthermore, the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) will be calculated and 
reported. Ninety-five confidence intervals of sensitivity, specificity, and NPV will be calculated 
using the Wilson score method. The comparisons of sensitivity, specificity, and NPV on a per-
patient basis of  68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging will be compared to of sensitivity, specificity, and 
NPV on a per-patient basis of conventional imaging using a paired McNemar’s test.
Detection rates on a per-patient basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET stratified by PSA value (0.2 - <0.5, 
0.5 - <1.0, 1.0 - <2.0, 2.0 - <5.0, 5.0) will be summarized in tabular format and compared 
between PSA strata using chi-square analysis. The impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on clinical 
management in BCR patients will be evaluated using descriptive statistics. 
9 Study Management
9.1 Pre-study Documentation
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki as stated in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4); consistent with GCP and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.
Before initiating this trial, the Investigator will have written and dated approval from the 
Institutional Review Board for the protocol, written informed consent form, subject recruitment 
Version date: 2016.07.11 Protocol CC#: 165510  
Phase II – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page  22 of 29materials, and any other written information to be provided to subjects before any protocol 
related procedures are performed on any subjects.  
The clinical investigation will not begin until either FDA has determined that the study under the 
Investigational Drug Application (IND) is allowed to proceed or the Investigator has received a 
letter from FDA stating that the study is exempt from IND requirements.
9.2 Institutional Review Board Approval
The protocol, the proposed informed consent form, and all forms of participant information 
related to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and 
approved by the UCSF CHR (UCSF Institutional Review Board).  Prior to obtaining CHR 
approval, the protocol must be approved by the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer 
Center Site Committee and by the Protocol Review Committee (PRC).  The initial protocol and 
all protocol amendments must be approved by the IRB prior to implementation.  
9.3 Informed Consent
All participants must be provided a consent form describing the study with sufficient information 
for each participant to make an informed decision regarding their participation.  Participants 
must sign the CHR-approved informed consent form prior to participation in any study specific 
procedure.  The participant must receive a copy of the signed and dated consent document.  
The original signed copy of the consent document must be retained in the medical record or 
research file. 
9.4 Changes in the Protocol
Once the protocol has been approved by the UCSF CHR, any changes to the protocol must be 
documented 
in the form of an amendment.  The amendment must be signed by the Investigator 
and approved by PRC and the CHR prior to implementation.  
If it becomes necessary to alter the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients, an 
amendment 
may be implemented prior to CHR approval.  In this circumstance, however, the 
Investigator must then notify the CHR in writing within five (5) working days after 
implementation.  The Study Chair and the UCSF study team will be responsible for updating any 
participating sites.
10 Protection of Human Subjects
10.1 Protection of Privacy
Patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health information generated 
from this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked 
to sign the HIPAA form and informed consent documents. The original signed document will 
become part of the patient’s medical records, and each patient will receive a copy of the signed 
document. The use and disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the 
individuals described in the informed consent document.

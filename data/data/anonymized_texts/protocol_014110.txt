TITLE:   An Open-Label Extension (OLE) Study to Ev aluate the Efficacy and Safety of Nefecon 
Treatment in Patients With IgA Nephropa thy Who Have Completed Study Nef-301 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:   Nef-301 OLE 
EudraCT NUMBER:   2020-003308-14  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:   Nefecon™ (budesonide mo dified-release capsules; 
Nefecon™ is a trademark of Calliditas Th erapeutics AB [hereinafter Calliditas]) 
PHASE:   3b 
INDICATION:   Treatment of primary immu noglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) 
OBJECTIVES: 
Primary Objectives: The primary objectives are the following: 
 To assess the effect of 9 mont hs of retreatment with Nefecon on urine protein to creatinine 
ratio (UPCR) and estimated glomerular filtra tion rate (eGFR) in patients who completed 
Study Nef-301 with Nefecon treatment; and 
 To assess the effect of 9 months of treatment  with Nefecon on UPCR and eGFR in patients 
who completed Study Nef-301 with placebo treatment. 
Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives  are the following: 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of 9 months  of retreatment with Nefecon in patients who 
completed Study Nef-301 with Nefecon treatment; 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of 9 mont hs of treatment with Nefecon in patients who 
completed Study Nef-301 with placebo treatment; 
 To assess the effect of 9 months of retreatment with Nefecon on additional aspects of renal 
function in patients who completed Study Nef-301 with Nefecon treatment; and 
 To assess the effect of 9 m onths of treatment with Nefeco n on additional aspects of renal 
function in patients who completed St udy Nef-301 with placebo treatment. 
POPULATION: 
Patients who have completed Study Nef-301 and meet al l eligibility criteria wi ll be able to enter 
Study Nef-301 OLE and start treatment. Patients must continue to be  treated with a stable dose o f 
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor ther apy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
[ACEIs] and/or angiotensin II t ype I receptor blockers [ARBs]). In addition to meeting all other 
eligibilit y criteria, patients mu st have proteinuria based on 2 consecutive measurements separated 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 5 by at least 2 weeks and calculated by th e central laborator y showing either 1 g/day 
(1000 mg/day) or UPCR 0.8 g/gram ( 90 mg/mmol) in 2 consecutive measurements. Patients 
must also have eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This is a Phase 3b, multicenter,  open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of Nefecon treatment in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 Study Nef-301 
and continue to be treated with a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or ARBs). 
Patients who previously received  Nefecon in Study Nef-301 will receive retreatment, whereas 
patients who previously received placebo in Study Nef-301 will be treatment naïve to Nefecon. During Study Nef-301 OLE, the patients and Investig ators will remain blin ded to treatment given 
in Study Nef-301. 
Assuming that 75% of the patients who have completed Study Nef-301 will enter Study Nef-301 
OLE, the total number of patients to be included is estimated to be approximately 250 patients, but up to 360 patients may be enrolled. 
Preferably, Visit 17a in Study Nef-301 should be combined with  Visit 1 in Study Nef-301 OLE, 
and Visit 17b in Study Nef-301 should be combin ed with Visit 2 in Study Nef-301 OLE. If the 
visits are not combined, Visit 3 in Study Nef-301 O LE must occur within 3 months after Visit 17b 
in Study Nef-301. 
Patients who do not meet all of the eligibility requirements may be rescreened in Study Nef-301 
OLE within 3 months after Vi sit 17b in Study Nef-301. Patient s who do not meet all of the 
eligibility requirements within this 3-month peri od will be screen failures and will not be followed 
any further. 
In addition to meeting all other eligibility criteria, patients mu st have proteinuria 
based on 
2 consecutive measurements separated by at least 2 weeks and calculated by the central laboratory 
showing either 1 g/day (1000 mg/day) or UPCR 0.8 g/gram ( 90 mg/mmol) in 2 consecutive 
measurements. Patients must also have eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the CKD-EPI 
formula. 
During Study Nef-301 OLE, patients will receive Nefecon 16 mg/day for a 9-month period. The 
16 mg/day dose may be reduced to  8 mg/day if clinically releva nt adverse events (AEs) develop 
during the 9-month Treatment  Period that the Investigator c onsiders related to the study drug and 
that mandate dose reduction. 
From the first day of dosing, a telephone visit will occur at 1 month, and onsite visits will occur 
at 3, 6, and 9 months. After comp leting 9 months of study drug tr eatment, patients will enter the 
2-week Tapering Period with Nefecon 8 mg/da y. To perform replicate laboratory sampling, an 
onsite visit will occur 14 to 35 days after the 9- month visit. An onsite follow-up visit will also 
occur at 12 months.  
Patients will remain on a stable dose of RAS i nhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or ARBs) throughout 
the study. If a patient receives resc ue treatment (syste mic steroids and/or  immunosuppressive 
treatment), the patient will be withdrawn from Nefecon treatment and continue with study visits 
for a total of 12 months fo llow-up after first dose.

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 6 Patients who prematurely discont inue Nefecon at 16 mg/day s hould have the dose reduced to 
8 mg/day for 2 weeks, if feasible, to prevent adrenal insufficiency.  
Unless a patient withdraws his/her consent to par ticipate in the study, all patients should complete 
the remaining study visits (especially at 9 and 12 months), rega rdless of whether they are still 
receiving study drug. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUT E OF ADMINISTRATION: 
Nefecon 16 mg (four 4 mg budesonide modified -release capsules once per day [QD]) will be 
administered orally fo r 9 months during th e Treatment Period. 
Patients must take the first dose of study drug in th e presence of site staff during Study Visit 4. As 
a result, the first dose of study dr ug may be administered at any time of day a nd without regard to 
the timing of meals. Patients may self-dose for all other doses of study drug and should take study 
drug in the morning at least 1 hour before breakfa st. The capsules must be swallowed whole and 
may not be chewed or crushed. 
The 16 mg/day dose may be reduced to 8 mg/day if clinically relevant AEs develop during the 
9-month Treatment Period that th e Investigator considers rela ted to the study drug and that 
mandate dose reduction. The Medica l Monitor should preferably be consulted prior to reducing 
the dose. If a dose reduction is made, then the dose should not be increased back to 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg). 
After completing 9 months of st udy drug treatment, the daily dose of  study drug will be reduced 
from 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks to prevent adrenal insufficiency (Tapering Period). Patients  who have their daily dose of study drug reduced 
to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) due to safety and/or tolerability reasons during the 9-month 
Treatment Period will remain on this dose during the 2-week Ta pering Period. Patients who 
prematurely discontinue study dr ug while taking 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) should have the 
daily dose of study drug reduced  to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks, if feasible, to 
prevent adrenal insufficiency. 
EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoints will include the following: 
 Ratio of eGFR at 9 months compared to base line, calculated using th e CKD-EPI formula; and 
 Ratio of UPCR at 9 months compared to baseline. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The secondary efficacy endpoint s will include the following: 
 Ratio of urine albumin to creatinine ratio ( UACR) at 9 months compared to baseline; 
 Short Form 36 quality of life assessment  at 12 months comp ared to baseline; 
 Proportion of patients with microhematuri a at 9 months compared to baseline; 
 Proportion of patients receiving rescue treatment and time to  receiving rescue treatment; 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 7  Proportion of patients on dial ysis, undergoing kidney transp lantation, or with eGFR 
<15 mL/min per 1.73 m2; and 
 Cortisol suppression at 9 and 12 months, measured as urinary co rtisol excretion over 24 hours 
compared to baseline. 
SAFETY VARIABLES: 
The safety variables will include the following: 
 Treatment-emergent AEs, defined as AEs that  occur for the first time after dosing in 
Study Nef-301 OLE, or exist before dosing in Study Nef-301 OLE but worsen in severity after 
dosing in Study Nef-301 OLE; 
 AEs leading to study drug discontinuation; 
 AEs of special interest (AESIs) (severe inf ections requiring hospitalization, new onset o f 
diabetes, confirmed fracture, new osteonecros is, gastrointestinal bleeding that requires 
hospitalization, reported occurrence  of cataract form ation, and reported onset of glaucoma); 
and 
 Vital signs, body weight, clinical laboratory variables, and p hysical examination findings. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: 
No formal statistical analyses will be perfor med. eGFR, UPCR, and UACR are expected to be 
log-normally distributed; therefore, the ratio of  9 months to baseline for eGFR, UPCR, and UACR 
will be summarized using geometric mean and its associated 95% confidence interval. If outlying 
data are present for an endpoint, a supplementary description of the data will be performed using 
a robust regression approach. Separate summar ies will be provided according to whether the 
patient received Nefecon or placebo in Study Nef-301. 
Each efficacy variable will be summarized in 2 different analysis sets, a Completers Analysis Set 
and a Full Analysis Set. The Completers Analysis Set will include all patients who receive Nefecon for 9 months. The Full Analysis Set will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose 
of Nefecon, with at least 1 e fficacy measurement (UPCR or eG FR) collected after dosing. Any 
data recorded after rescue trea tment will not be included in th e analysis for either analysis 
population. 
Baseline eGFR, UPCR, and UACR will be defined as  the geometric mean of the 2 consecutive 
measurements prior to dosing. The 9-month eGFR , UPCR, and UACR values will be defined as 
the geometric mean of the values recorded at Study Visits 8 and 9. 
For UPCR, the primary analysis will calculate the mean of the change from baseline in 
log(UPCR), with results back-trans formed to provide a geometric mean ratio and 95% confidence 
interval. For eGFR, due to the possible presence of  outlying data, the primar y analysis will use the 
same approach but deriving the mean change and it s confidence interval us ing a robust regression 
model. 
If a reasonable proportion of patients do not provide  9-month data, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed by fitting a mixed model that incorpor ates any data recorded at 3, 6, and 12 months 
with different assumptions made about efficacy after discontinuation of treatment. 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 8 AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and will include all 
safety data from patients who have  received at least 1 dose of study dr ug at the time of the analysis. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will be  summarized by system organ class. In addition, 
the time to first occurrence of the most co mmon event will be summarized using cumulative 
incidence plots. Safety data will be summarize d or listed separately for the period between 
screening and the first dose of study drug. In additi on, the safety data will be summarized for the 
entire period following the first dose of study dr ug and separately for periods during and after 
dosing. 
Summary statistics will be presented for changes in vital signs and laboratory tests throughout the 
study. Physical examinat ions will be listed. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: 
All patients who have completed Study Nef-301 and meet all eligibil ity criteria will be able to 
participate in Study Nef-301 OLE. Assuming that  75% of the patients who have completed 
Study Nef-301 will enter Study Nef- 301 OLE, the total nu mber of patients to be included is 
estimated to be approximately 250 patients,  but up to 360 patients may be enrolled. 
In Study Nef-202, a completed, randomized, double- blind study of Nefecon in comparison to 
placebo, the standard deviation for the change fr om baseline in log(UPCR) and log(eGFR) was 
0.59 and 0.18, respectively. If 125 patients are recr uited within each efficacy group (prior Nefecon 
or prior placebo) and a 25% reduction (ratio of 0. 75) in UPCR is observed in this study, the upper 
95% confidence limit for the baseline ratio will exte nd to 0.83. Likewise, if there is no change in 
eGFR observed in this st udy (ratio of 1), the lower 95% confiden ce limit for the baseline ratio will 
extend to 0.97. Therefore, this st udy will provide a sufficiently prec ise estimate of the efficacy o f 
Nefecon according to whether the patient pr eviously received Nefecon or placebo. 
SITES:  
It is anticipated that there will be approximately 140 sites globally.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger’s di sease, is the most 
common cause of glomerulonephriti s worldwide, with prevalence estimates varying from 5% to 
more than 40% of patients with glomerular disease.1 It is characterized by the deposition of 
IgA-containing immune complexes in the glomer ular mesangium, leadi ng to inflammation. 
Primary IgAN may present in different forms. One form is characterized by recurrent episodes of 
hematuria, often associat ed with viral infections, but no or  minimal proteinu ria and long-term 
stable renal function. Another fo rm is characterized by persis tent proteinuria and frequently 
hypertension and/or reduced  glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Pa tients with this more severe form 
are at risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require treatment. 
Primary IgAN can occur at any age, but the clin ical onset is common du ring the second or third 
decades of life.2 IgAN progresses to ESRD in 15% to 20% of patients within 10 years and in 30% 
to 40% within 20 years from disease onset.3,4,5 It is the main cause of ESRD in patients with 
primary glomerular disease who re quire renal-replacement therapy.6 It is estimated that IgAN 
accounts for 10% of renal transp lants among patients with primar y glomerulonephritis in the 
United States, and between 7% to 20% of patients in Europe and Australia in long-term dialysis 
and renal transplantation programs.6,7 
Risk factors for disease progressi on include persistent proteinur ia, elevated serum creatinine, 
microhematuria, and speci fic histological lesions.8,9,10 Other risk factors for progressive renal 
failure include hypertension, reduced GFR, and to a lesser extent, hyperlipidemia.11,12,13 
Clinical and nonclinical evidence suggests a pivotal role for the mucosal immune system in the 
pathogenesis of IgAN.14,15,16,17 In IgAN patients, mucosal B-cells located in Peyer’s patches are 
primed to produce aberrantly glycosylated, ga lactose-deficient polymeric immunoglobulin A1 
(Gd-IgA1), which in circulation can form  large immune complexes with anti-glycan 
immunoglobulin G antibodies.14,18,19,20 These complexes bind to glom erular mesangial cells and 
stimulate cell proliferation, rel ease of inflammatory mediators that promote proteinuria, and 
fibrotic remodeling, ultimately lead ing to loss of renal function.14,18 This pathogenesis suggests 
that local immunosuppression of mucosal B-cell ac tivation and proliferati on in Peyer’s patches, 
which reside in high density in the distal part of the small in testine, could attenuate Gd-IgA1 
production and leakage to the systemic circulation, thereby reducing subsequent 
pathophysiological chan ges in the kidneys. 
1.1 Rationale 
There is currently no optimal management stra tegy for IgAN. Treatment recommendations have 
been provided in the 2012 Kidney Disease: Im proving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.21 
Rigorous blood pressure control wi th angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or 
angiotensin II type I receptor bl ockers (ARBs) to achieve  blood pressure targ ets of <130/80 mmHg 
is the cornerstone of therapy. Fo r patients with proteinuria desp ite rigorous blood pressure control 
by renin-angiotensin system (RAS ) inhibition, immunosuppressive agen ts such as corticosteroids 
or cyclophosphamide may be added. Corticostero ids may lower the risk of kidney disease 
progression and the need for di alysis and transplantation, bu t the use is limited by well-known 
adverse effects.4 
Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid (GCS ) with weak mineralocorticoid activities. 
Immunosuppressive and anti-inf lammatory properties have led to the approval of budesonide 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 17 formulations for use in respir atory indications since 1981 and fo r inflammatory bowel diseases 
including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.22,23 Budesonide has a high first-pass metabolism 
with formation of metabolites with very low GCS activity, reducing the degree of systemic effects. 
Nefecon is an oral, modified-rel ease capsule formulation of budes onide that combines a delayed 
capsule disintegration with a sustained/prolonged rel ease of the active ingredie nt in the distal part 
of the small intestine. By directing release of bude sonide to the distal part of the small intestine 
where the target immune tissues, Peyer’s patches,  reside in high density, a local pharmacological 
effect is achieved. Budesonide may suppress lo cal B-cell activation and proliferation in these 
patches and inhibit subsequent pr oduction and leakage of Gd-IgA1 into the systemic circulation. 
Glomerular mesangial deposition of Gd-IgA1 resu lting in nephritis and loss of renal function can 
thereby be prevented. 
Nefecon is under investigation fo r the treatment of patients w ith primary IgAN at risk of 
developing ESRD. From the results in Phase 1 and 2 studies in healthy volunteers and in patients 
with primary IgAN, Nefecon is suggested to be a safe and well-tolerated steroid formulation for 
adjunctive therapy to ACEI and/ or ARB treatment in IgAN patients at risk of progressing to ESRD. 
Further details regarding the noncli nical studies of Nefecon and th e clinical development program 
can be found in the I nvestigator’s Brochure.24 
The current study is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open- label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Nefecon tr eatment in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 
Study Nef-301 and continue to be treated with a stable  dose of RAS inhib itor therapy (ACEIs 
and/or ARBs). 
1.2 Benefit/Risk 
The active ingredient in Nefecon is budesonide , a potent steroid with a high first pass liver 
metabolism, which makes it well suited for local treatment, where feasible. The advantage of local application of budesonide has been  demonstrated in several mark eted products, such as for the 
treatment of asthma, where the inhaled budesonide  products can provide a high concentration of 
steroid to the airway tissue with only limited syst emic exposure due to the low bioavailability. In 
this way, high exposure of the steroid can be ach ieved to the target ti ssue with only limited 
systemic exposure and risk for st eroid-related adverse effects.  
Budesonide is a well-characteri zed glucocorticosteroid that, apar t from treatment of asthma, also 
has been developed for local treatment of infl ammatory conditions such  as Crohn’s disease and 
ulcerative colitis. These products ha ve been on the market for up to  25 years. Budesonide has been 
studied extensively in nonclini cal and clinical deve lopment programs that  have supported the 
approval of several medicinal products (e.g., Pulmicort
 Respules®, Pulmicort Flexhaler®, 
Entocort®, Uceris®).22,23,25,26 A vast amount of safety informa tion from previous human experience 
with budesonide, both from i nhaled and oral ad ministered products, is available. 
Nefecon can, by directing the releas e of budesonide to the distal part  of the small intestine, achieve 
a local pharmacological effect. When  the budesonide is absorbed it will undergo a high first pass 
metabolism in the liver, resulting in only limited systemic exposur e. The Nefecon formulation of 
budesonide has been tested in patients with Ig AN at a daily dose of 8 mg or 16 mg for up to 
9 months. Nefecon was found to be safe and well  tolerated, and the treatment-provided evidence 
that local exposure of budesonide  to a restricted area of the gut, where the Peyer’s patches are

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 18 located, results in significant reduction in proteinuria and improveme nt in renal function 
parameters. 
There are currently no treatments approved for patie nts with IgAN at risk of progressing to ESRD. 
However, the current standard of care includes rigorous blood pressure c ontrol using ACEIs and/or 
ARBs to target <130/80 mmHg to re duce hemodynamic stre ss and proteinuria.12,13,27 For those 
patients with proteinuria despit e rigorous blood pressure cont rol by RAS inhibition, a 6-month 
treatment course of high-dose systemic corticos teroids can be considered ; however, there is not 
consensus for this treatment regimen, mainly due to the increased level of severe side effects.21,28 
Based on experience from the treatment of patie nts suffering from IgAN with Nefecon and the 
already documented safety profile of budesonide, it is judged that  the benefit/ri sk of Nefecon 
treatment for patients with IgAN at risk of progressing to ESRD, who have persistent proteinuria 
despite rigorous blood pressure control w ith ACEIs and/or ARBs, will be favorable.

3.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, OLE study to evalua te the efficacy and safety of Nefecon treatment 
in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 Study Nef- 301 and continue to be treated 
with a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (A CEIs and/or ARBs). Patients who previously 
received Nefecon in Study Nef-301 will receive retreatment, whereas patients who previously 
received placebo in Study Nef-301 will be trea tment naïve to Nefecon. During Study Nef-301 
OLE, the patients and Investigators will remain  blinded to treatment given in Study Nef-301. 
Assuming that 75% of the patients who have  completed Study Nef-301 will enter Study Nef-301 
OLE, the total number of patients to  be included is estimated to be approximately 250 patients, but 
up to 360 patients may be enrolled. 
Preferably, Visit 17a in Study Nef-301 should be combined with  Visit 1 in Study Nef-301 OLE, 
and Visit 17b in Study Nef-301 should be combin ed with Visit 2 in Study Nef-301 OLE. If the 
visits are not combined, Visit 3 in Study Nef-301 O LE must occur within 3 months after Visit 17b 
in Study Nef-301. 
Patients who do not meet all of the eligibility requirements may be rescreened in Study Nef-301 
OLE within 3 months after Vi sit 17b in Study Nef-301. Patients who do not meet all of the 
eligibility requirements within this 3-month period will be screen failures  and will not be followed 
any further. 
In addition to meeting all other eligibility cr iteria, patients must have proteinuria based on 
2 consecutive measurements separated by at least 2 weeks and calculated by the central laboratory 
showing either 1 g/day (1000 mg/day) or UPCR 0.8 g/gram ( 90 mg/mmol) in 2 consecutive 
measurements. Patients must also have eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the CKD-EPI 
formula. 
During Study Nef-301 OLE, patients will receive Nefecon 16 mg/day for a 9-month period. The 
16 mg/day dose may be reduced to 8 mg/day if c linically relevant advers e events (AEs) develop 
during the 9-month Treatment  Period that the Investigator c onsiders related to the study drug and 
that mandate dose reduction. 
From the first day of dosing, a telephone visit will  occur at 1 month, and onsite visits will occur at 
3, 6, and 9 months. After completing 9 months of  study drug treatment, patients will enter the 
2-week Tapering Period with Ne fecon 8 mg/day. To perform re plicate laboratory sampling, an 
onsite visit will occur 14 to 35 days after the 9- month visit. An onsite follow-up visit will also 
occur at 12 months. 
Patients will remain on a stab le dose of RAS inhibitor therap y (ACEIs and/or ARBs) throughout 
the study. If a patient receives re scue treatment (systemic steroi ds and/or immunosuppressive 
treatment), the patient will be withdrawn from Nefecon treatment and continue w ith study visits 
for a total of 12 months fo llow-up after first dose.  
Patients who prematurely discon tinue Nefecon at 16 mg/day s hould have the dose reduced to 
8 mg/day for 2 weeks, if feasible, to prevent adrenal insufficiency.

26. Staff involved in the conduct of the study. 
4.3 Withdrawal Criteria 
A distinction must be made between patients w ho prematurely discontinue  study drug treatment 
and those who withdraw consent to any follow-up in the study.  
In all cases of impending study drug discontinuati on or patient requests for withdrawal from study 
visits, Investigators should discuss with the pati ent his/her options for continuing in the study. At 
a minimum, Investigators should encourage patients to continue follow-up with Investigators (or 
his/her designee) in order to collect the patient’s  eGFR, proteinuria, and creatinine at 9 months. 
The Investigator should ensure he /she understands the reasons for a patient’s desire to prematurely 
discontinue study drug or withdraw  from the study prior to comp letion and documen t these reasons 
in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Unless a patient withdraws his/her consent to part icipate in the study, all patients should complete 
the remaining study visits (especially at 9 and 12 months), re gardless of whether they are still 
receiving study drug. 
4.3.1 Withdrawal From the Study 
Participation of a patient may be permanentl y discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
 The patient requests discontinuati on and withdraws consent from the study for any follow-up; 
or 
 The study is terminated by the Spons or or the regulatory authority. 
For patients who are withdrawn from the stud y, the End of Study Visit procedures will be 
completed, if possible, at the time the decision is  made to withdraw the patient. The End of Study 
Visit will consist of all of the Study Visit 10 procedures (see Secti on 6.4.1 and Appendix A). 
Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 25 4.3.2 Premature Disconti nuation of Study Drug 
Patients who prematurely discon tinue study drug treatment shoul d complete the remaining study 
visits (especially at 9 and 12 months ) despite discontinuation of study drug. 
Patients who prematurely discon tinue Nefecon at 16 mg/day s hould have the dose reduced to 
8 mg/day for 2 weeks, if feas ible, to prevent adrenal insu fficiency (see Section 5.5.3). 
The following do not fulfil the criteria fo r withdrawal from th e study, but do require 
discontinuation of study drug:  
 Use of rescue treatment (systemic steroi ds and/or immunosuppr essive treatment); 
 Occurrence of any medical condition or circumst ance that exposes the patient to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the patient to a dhere to the requirements of the protocol; 
 Any serious adverse event (SAE), clinically  significant AE, severe  laboratory abnormality, 
intercurrent illness, or othe r medical condition which indicates  to the Investigator that 
continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient; 
 Pregnancy; 
 Requirement of prohibited c oncomitant medication; or 
 Patient failure to comply w ith protocol requirements or study-related procedures. 
If one of the above cr iteria are met, every effort  should be made to keep the pati ent in the study 
and continue follow-up afte r study drug discontinuation. 
4.3.3 Lost to Follow-Up 
The Investigator will make reasonable effort to contact patients who fail to return for scheduled 
study visits. These actions might include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Contact all telephone numbers for th e patient and his/her listed cont acts (to be collected in the 
source documents at the patient’s  entry into the study), as a pplicable. This includes making 
telephone calls after norma l business hours or on holidays or weekends; 
 Contact the patient’s primary care physician, referring specialist, pharmacist, or other 
healthcare professional, as applicable; 
 Send e-mails, text messages, and postal mail w ith certified letters to all of the patient’s 
addresses and contacts, as applicable , and document all attempted contacts; 
 Review available medical records/notes for details  of hospitalizations, c linic visits, or other 
procedures that may indicate the stat us of the patient, as applicable; 
 Utilize the internet to search for additiona l contact information, as applicable; and 
 Check local, regional, and national public records to locate the patient or search for mortality 
status as allowed by law, as applicable. 
Once all of these actions have been exhausted and documented, then Calliditas Therapeutics AB

5.1 Treatment Groups 
Patients will receive Nefecon 16 mg/day for a 9-month period. The 16 mg/day dose may be 
reduced to 8 mg/day if clinically  relevant AEs develop during the 9-month Tr eatment Period that 
the Investigator considers related to the study drug and that mandate dose reduction. 
After completing 9 months of study drug treatment , patients will enter the 2-week Tapering Period 
with Nefecon 8 mg/day to prevent adrenal insuff iciency. See Section 5.5.3. Patients will then enter 
the 3-month Follow-up Period. 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
Budesonide, which is the active drug substance in Nefecon, is a well-do cumented compound with 
extensive experience from clinical use in the treatment of asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. 
Nefecon is a modified-release oral  formulation, designed specifically to rel ease budesonide in the 
distal part of the small intestine where Peyer’ s patches reside at high density, thus providing a 
potent immunosuppressive effect to reduce local  B-cell activation and proliferation and the 
subsequent production of Gd-IgA1. Based on safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2b study, 
where doses of placebo and Nefecon 8 mg and 16 mg  were given daily for 9 months, the Nefecon 
16 mg/day dose was selected for Phase 3. Nefecon treatment at doses of up to 16 mg/day for 
9 months in IgAN patients at ri sk of developing ESRD despite  optimized RAS blockade, has 
demonstrated promising efficacy results on protei nuria reduction and eGFR stabilization, with no 
safety concerns.24  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding 
This is an open-label study. All patients wi ll receive Nefecon treatment for 9 months. 
During Study Nef-301 OLE, the patients and Inves tigators will remain blinded to treatment given 
in Study Nef-301. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
Procedures for breaking the b lind are not applicable for th e current study (Nef-301 OLE). 
5.5 Drug Supplies 
5.5.1 Formulation and Packaging 
Nefecon is a modified-release capsule containing  4 mg of the active substance budesonide. The 
capsule is white to off-white, of size 1, with bl ack printing “CAL10 4MG,” and is coated with an 
enteric coating layer that delivers the capsule int act until it reaches the distal part of the small 
intestine. The capsule contains triple coated be ads with a sugar sphere as the core. The inner 
coating layer contains the active substance, and the outer coating layer is a prolonged-release 
polymer coating that cont rols the rate of release of the ac tive substance once the capsule has 
dissolved.  
Nefecon capsules will be packaged  in high-density polyethylene bottles and should be stored 
between 15°C to 25°C in their original container with the cap tightly sealed. Nefecon will be 
packaged and labeled according to the requirements of local law a nd legislation, as well as current

Patients must take the first dose of study drug in the presence of site staff during Study Visit 4.  
Following initial shipment, there will be an au tomatic resupply of stu dy drug to the site for 
dispensing to the patient at Study Visits 6 and 7. 
The Investigator (or his/her desi gnee) must record the patient number, the identification number 
of the study drug dispensed, the date dispensed, a nd the amount dispensed in the source documents. 
The disposition of study drug delivered to an Investig ator will be recorded on a per-patient basis. 
Dispensation logs will be completed for all patients at each site documenting dispensed and returned study drug throughout the c ourse of the study. Patients will  be reminded at each scheduled 
study visit to return all empty bottles and unused study drug. The dispensation logs will be 
monitored by Medpace on an ongoing basis. 
5.5.3 Study Drug Administration 
Nefecon 16 mg (four 4 mg budesonide modified-rel ease capsules QD) will be administered orally 
for 9 months during th e Treatment Period.  
Patients must take the first dose of study drug in th e presence of site sta ff during Study Visit 4. As 
a result, the firs t dose of study drug may be ad ministered at any time of day and without regard to 
the timing of meals. Patients may self-dose for all other doses of study drug and should take study 
drug in the morning at least 1 hou r before breakfast. The capsules  must be swallowed whole and 
may not be chewed or crushed. 
The 16 mg/day dose may be reduced to 8 mg/day if clinically relevant AEs develop during the 
9-month Treatment Period that the Investigator considers re lated to the study  drug and that 
mandate dose reduction. The Medi cal Monitor should preferably be  consulted prior to reducing 
the dose. If a dose reduction is ma de, then the dose should not be in creased back to 4 capsules QD 
(Nefecon 16 mg). 
After completing 9 months of st udy drug treatment, the daily dose of study drug will be reduced 
from 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks to prevent adrenal insufficiency (Tapering Period). Patients who have their daily dose of study drug reduced 
to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) due to safety a nd/or tolerability reas ons during the 9-month 
Treatment Period will remain on this dose duri ng the 2-week Tapering Period. Patients who 
prematurely discontinue study dr ug while taking 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) sh ould have the 
daily dose of study drug reduced  to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks, if feasible, to 
prevent adrenal insufficiency. 
5.5.4 Treatment Compliance 
Patients will be instructed to re turn all empty bottles a nd unused study drug to th e site at the next 
study visit. Accountability of the used and unused study drug will be recorded. Compliance with 
the study drug regimen will be evaluated by co unting unused capsules. During the Treatment 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 29 Period, if compliance is not between 80% and 120%, inclusive, the patient will be counseled about 
the importance of compliance w ith the study dr ug regimen. 
5.5.5 Storage and Accountability 
Study drug must be stored in a pharmacy or a lock ed and secure storage facility, accessible only 
to those individuals authorized by the Investigator to  dispense the drug, be tween 15°C to 25°C in 
the original container with the cap tightly sealed. The Investigator or his/her designee will maintain 
accurate records of all study drug received, disp ensed, or returned/disposed, as well as a 
temperature log to document temper ature conditions during storage. 
Temperature excursions up to 30°C will be allowed. Details regarding allowed excursions will be 
available in the pharmacy manual. 
Return and destruction of study drug will be de scribed in the pharmacy manual. The Investigator 
agrees to only distribute study drug to patients participating in the study. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Patients must not receive other investigational drugs during the study. Systemic immunosuppressive drugs  (including GCSs) are prohibite d during the study. Herbs for 
medicinal use, including Eastern herbs and Eastern traditional medi cines, with a known effect on 
the immune system (e.g., Tripterygium wilfordii or ginseng) or with a kn own effect on proteinuria 
or creatinine, are not allowed during the study. Patie nts should be encouraged to not use herbs for 
medicinal use, including Eastern herbs and Ea stern traditional medici nes, during the study; 
however, if used, they should be recorded as concomitant medications. See Appendix E for 
additional information on  immunosuppressive drugs. 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole ) are prohibited during treatment with study drug. 
See the US Food and Drug Administrati on website for additional examples.
29 During this time, 
patients should also be instructed to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. 
If a patient receives rescue  treatment (systemic steroids and/or  immunosuppressive treatment), the 
patient will be withdrawn from Ne fecon treatment and continue with  study visits for a total of 
12 months follow-up after first dose. 
5.6.2 Restricted Medications  and/or Procedures 
Patients should avoid starting ne w medications and making cha nges to existing medications. 
However, if needed, the introduction of new medi cations or changes to existing medications are 
permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. 
5.6.3 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Medication Use 
Medications taken within 3 m onths prior to Study Visit 1 and concomitant medications and 
therapies will be recorded in the eCRFs. All c oncomitant medications and changes in concomitant 
medications will be recorded throughout th e course of the study in the eCRFs.

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 37 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Adverse Events 
Ongoing AEs from the patient’s involvement in St udy Nef-301 will continue to be followed in 
Study Nef-301 OLE and captured as ongoing AEs. Ne w AEs will be collected from Study Visit 1 
through 12 months after the first dose of study drug in Study Nef-301 OLE. New 
treatment-emergent AEs will be those starting with Study Nef-301 OLE dosing (Study Visit 4). 
An AE is defined as any untow ard medical occurrence in a cl inical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unf avorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or diseas e temporally associated  with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the in vestigational medicinal product. 
The Investigator will collect AE s with a non-leading question such as “have you experienced any 
new health problems or worseni ng of existing conditions” as well as collecting ev ents directly 
observed or spontaneously volunteer ed by patients or caregivers. Al l AEs, including observed or 
volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, including AESIs and SAEs, w ill be monitored and documented by  the Investigator (or his/her 
designee) from Study Visit 1 until 12 months after the first dose of study drug, inclusive, regardless 
of whether the patient discontinues the study prem aturely. Patients should be instructed to report 
any AE that they experience to the Investigator (or hi s/her designee).  
Wherever possible, a specific dise ase or syndrome rather than in dividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  the Investigator and recorded  on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not cons idered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be reco rded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e .g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at Study Visit 1 should not be reported as an AE unless the 
medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline worsens in severity or seriousness at 
any time during the study. In this cas e, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant ab normal laboratory or ot her examination (e.g., physical examination) 
findings that are detected during the study or are presen t at Study Visit 1 a nd significantly worsen 
during the study should be reported as AEs. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and 
scientific judgment in decidi ng whether an abnormal laborato ry finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically significant. Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory values occurring 
during the clinical study will be followed until repeat  tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no 
longer clinically significan t. Any abnormal test that is determin ed to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE. 
Any medical condition or abnormal finding that worsen s in severity or seriousness and that fulfils 
the criteria for an SAE will be reported as such, from signature of informed consent. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended respon ses to a medicinal product re lated to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal product m eans that a causal 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 38 relationship between a medicinal pr oduct and an AE is at least a r easonable possibility, i.e., the 
relationship cannot  be ruled out. 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable Refe rence Safety Information (RSI). For Nefecon the 
RSI is included in the Investigat or’s Brochure curre ntly in force.24 The RSI will be reviewed yearly 
and the periodicity of the review  will be harmonized with the re porting period of the Development 
Safety Update Report. 
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Even ts by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intens ity) of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to  its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity: 
 Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily 
activities. 
 Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities. 
 Severe – An event that is incapacitating with  inability to work or perform normal daily 
activities. 
Causality Assessment: 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of  the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: 
No (not related, unlikely to be related) – The time  course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rule s out a causal relation ship and another cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, co mplications, etc.) is suspected. 
Yes (related) – The time course between the ad ministration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the AE is consistent with a causa l relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, 
therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonabl e possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (eviden ce) or arguments to sugge st a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
o Each report should be evaluated in the contex t of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any othe r disease the patient may have. 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 39  Concomitant drug- 
o The other drugs the patient is taking or th e treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whethe r any of them might be reco gnized to cause the event in 
question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
o Clinical and/or preclinical data  may indicate whether a particular  response is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/ or mental stresses- 
o The exposure to stress might i nduce adverse changes in the re cipient and provide a logical 
and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and pharmacoki netics of the study drug- 
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorptio n, distribution, metabolis m, and excretion) 
of the study drug should be considered. 
8.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The following, which are establis hed potentially clinica lly significant conse quences of steroid 
treatment, will be considered AESIs:  
 Severe infection requiring hospitalization; 
 New onset of diabetes mellitus; 
 Confirmed fracture; 
 New osteonecrosis; 
 Gastrointestinal bleeding th at requires hos pitalization; 
 Reported occurrence of cataract formation; and 
 Reported onset of glaucoma. 
If not already determined from th e general questions used to cap ture AE, the patient must be 
explicitly asked if the fo llowing have occurred sin ce the last study visit:  
 Have you been hospitalized due to any infe ction and/or gastrointestinal bleeding? 
 Have you had any X-ray confirmed fractures? 
 Have you been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus? 
 Have you visited an ophthalmologist and been diagnosed with glaucoma or cataract(s)? 
AESIs may or may not constitute an SAE. Howe ver, all types of AESI s must be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety and processed as SAEs , regardless of their fo rmal classification of 
seriousness, in accordance with th e instructions in Section 8.4. Th e AESIs that do not fall into the 
category of SAEs will be recorded from Study Visit 1 until 12 months after the first dose of study 
drug, inclusive, regardless of whether the patient discontinues th e study prematurely.

Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 40 8.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is cons idered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Calliditas, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
o NOTE: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Calliditas, its occurrence place s the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an event that, had it occurre d in a more severe fo rm, might have caused 
death. 
 Requires hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalizations; 
o NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room  visit without hospita l admission for more 
than 24 hours will not be recorded as a SAE under this criteri on, nor will elective 
hospitalization/surgery or hospita lization for treatment of pre-ex isting (prior to signing of 
the ICF) conditions that did not worsen from baseline. Howe ver, unexpected complications 
and/or prolongation of hospitaliz ation that occur duri ng elective surgery should be recorded 
as AEs and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational 
reasons (i.e., no place to stay, live too far aw ay to come for hospita l visits) will not be 
considered inpatient  hospitalizations.  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be  life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not re sult in inpatient hosp italizations, or the 
development of drug dependency. 
8.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial Reports 
All SAEs, irrespective of relatedness, occurring fr om Study Visit 1 until 12 months after the first 
dose of study drug must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this re fers to any AE that meets any of th e aforementioned serious criteria). 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form elect ronically in the electr onic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is comple ted, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified 
electronically and will retrieve th e form. If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to 
access the EDC system, send an e-mail to Medpace Safety at Medpace-safetynotification@medpace.com or ca ll the Medpace SAE reporting line (telephone

Follow-Up Reports 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persis tent impairment), or the patient 
dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt  of follow-up information, the Inve stigator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any s upporting documentation 
(e.g., patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical Safe ty via fax or e-mail. 
If it is not possible to access the EDC system, re fer to the procedures outlined above for initial 
reporting of SAEs.  
8.5 Pregnancy Reporting 
If the patient participatin g in the study becomes pregnant duri ng the study or within 30 days of the 
last dose of study drug, the Investigator should re port the pregnancy to Medpace Clinical Safety 
via telephone or e-mail within 24 hours of bein g notified. Medpace Clinical Safety will then 
forward the Exposure In Utero form to  the Investigator for completion.  
A patient becoming pregnant while on study dr ug will immediately discontinue study drug 
treatment but will not be withdrawn from the study. 
The patient should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason befo re the anticipated date, the I nvestigator should notify Medpace 
Clinical Safety. At the completion of the pregna ncy, the Investigator will document the outcome 
of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification 
as an SAE (i.e., postpartum co mplication, spontaneous  abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly), the Investigator should fo llow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.6 Expedited Reporting 
Calliditas (or their designee) will report all re levant information about suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs)  that are fatal or life-threaten ing as soon as possible to all 
regulatory authorities in the concerned countri es and Central Ethics Committees (CECs) as 
applicable in each participating country, and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 42 Calliditas (or their designee) of such a case. Rele vant follow-up information will subsequently be 
communicated within an additional 8 days.  
All other SUSARs will be  reported to all regulatory authoritie s in the concerned countries and to 
the CECs as soon as possible but within a maximum of 15 days of first knowledge by Calliditas.  
Calliditas (or their designee) will also in form all Investigators as required.  
8.7 Safety Assessments 
The safety variables will include the following: 
 Treatment-emergent AEs, defined as AEs that  occur for the first time after dosing in 
Study Nef-301 OLE, or exist before  dosing in Study Nef-301 OLE but  worsen in severity after 
dosing in Study Nef-301 OLE; 
 AEs leading to study drug discontinuation; 
 AESIs (severe infections requiring hospitalizatio n, new onset of diabetes , confirmed fracture, 
new osteonecrosis, gastrointestinal bleeding th at requires hospitalizati on, reported occurrence 
of cataract formation, and repor ted onset of glaucoma); and 
 Vital signs, body weight, clinical laboratory variables, and p hysical examination findings. 
8.8 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical safety laboratory assessments will incl ude hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis 
parameters from collection of blood and urine samples as indicated in Appendix A. See 
Appendix B for a complete list  of laboratory analytes. 
All laboratory analyses will be performed or mana ged by a central laboratory. The TB test must 
be the specific QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test and can be done locally if needed. However, the 
report must be available to confirm a negative TB result. Details regarding the collection, 
processing, storage, and shipping of sample s can be found in the laboratory manual. 
8.9 Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements will in clude systolic and diastolic bl ood pressure and heart rate as 
indicated in Appendix A. Blood pressu re and heart rate will be measur ed after resting in the supine 
position for at least 5 minutes. At Study Visits 1 and 3, blood pressure and heart rate will be 
measured up to 3 times with each measurement sepa rated by 1 minute (the lowest value will be 
recorded on the eCRF). 
8.10 Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination will be perform ed as indicated in Appendix A and will consist 
of examination of the head, eyes , ears, nose, throat, lymph nodes, chest, abdomen, and extremities, 
as well as the respiratory, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, dermatolog ic, and nervous systems 
(including sensory, motor, a nd deep tendon reflexes).  
8.11 Body Weight and Height 
Measurement of body weight should be performed w ith the patient dressed in indoor clothing, with 
shoes removed, and bladder em pty. Height will onl y be collected at Study Visit 1.

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 43 9 STATISTICS 
9.1 Analysis Populations 
The Completers Analysis Set will include all patients who receive Nefecon for 9 months. The Full Analysis Set will include all patients who r eceive at least 1 dose of Nefecon, with at least 
1 efficacy measurement (UPCR or  eGFR) collected after dosing. 
The Safety Analysis Set will include all patients  who have received at least 1 dose of study drug 
at the time of the analysis. 
9.2 Statistical Methods 
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy 
No formal statistical analyses will be perf ormed. eGFR, UPCR, and UACR are expected to be 
log-normally distributed; therefore, the ratio of  9 months to baseline for eGFR, UPCR, and UACR 
will be summarized using geometric mean and its associated 95% confidence interval. If outlying 
data are present for an endpoint, a supplementary description of the data will be performed using 
a robust regression approach. Separate summaries  will be provided according to whether the 
patient received Nefecon or placebo in Study Nef-301. 
Each efficacy variable will be summarized in 2 different analysis sets, the Completers Analysis 
Set and the Full Analysis Set. Any data recorded after rescue treatment wi ll not be included in the 
analysis for either  analysis population. 
Baseline eGFR, UPCR, and UACR will be defined as  the geometric mean of the 2 consecutive 
measurements prior to dosing. The 9-month eGFR , UPCR, and UACR values will be defined as 
the geometric mean of the values recorded at Study Visits 8 and 9. 
For UPCR, the primary analysis wi ll calculate the mean of the change from baseline in log(UPCR), 
with results back-transformed to provide a geomet ric mean ratio and 95% c onfidence interval. For 
eGFR, due to the possible presence of outlying data, the primary analysis will use the same 
approach but deriving th e mean change and its co nfidence interval using a robust regression model. 
If a reasonable proportion of patients do not provide 9-month data, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed by fitting a mixed model that incorpor ates any data recorded at 3, 6, and 12 months 
with different assumptions made about efficacy after discontinuation of treatment. 
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will 
include all safety data from patien ts who have received at least 1 dose of study drug at the time of 
the analysis. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class. 
In addition, the time to first occurrence of the most common event will be summarized using 
cumulative incidence plots. Safety data will be summarized or listed separately for the period 
between screening and the first dose of study drug. In addition, the safety data will be summarized 
for the entire period following the first dose of study drug and separately for periods during and 
after dosing. 
Summary statistics will be presen ted for changes in vital signs and laboratory tests throughout the 
study. Physical examinat ions will be listed.

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 44 9.2.3 Sample Size Determination 
All patients who have complete d Study Nef-301 and meet all eligib ility criteria w ill be able to 
participate in Study Nef-301 OLE. Assuming that 75% of the patients who have completed Study Nef-301 will enter Study Nef-301 OLE, the tota l number of patients to be included is 
estimated to be approximately 250 patients,  but up to 360 patients may be enrolled. 
In Study Nef-202, a completed, randomized, double- blind study of Nefecon in comparison to 
placebo, the standard deviation fo r the change from baseline in  log(UPCR) and log(eGFR) was 
0.59 and 0.18, respectively. If 125 patients are recr uited within each efficac y group (prior Nefecon 
or prior placebo) and a 25% reduc tion (ratio of 0.75) in UPCR is observed in this study, the upper 
95% confidence limit for the baseline ratio will extend to 0.83. Likewise, if there is no change in eGFR observed in this study (ratio  of 1), the lower 95% confidence limit for the baseline ratio will 
extend to 0.97. Therefore, this study will provide a su fficiently precise estima te of the efficacy of 
Nefecon according to whether the patient pr eviously received Nefecon or placebo.

Note: Prior to conducting any study-related ac tivities, the current, approved Informed C onsent Form must be signed and dated by  the patient. 
1. Patients will be required to fast for at  least 10 hours prior to Study Visit 3. 
2. Study Visit 4 must occur within 4 weeks after Study Visit 3. 
3. See Section 4.3 for additional details related to withdrawal cr iteria. For patients who are withdrawn from the study, the End o f Study Visit procedures will be completed, if 
possible, at the time the decision is made to  withdraw the patient. The End of Study Vi sit will consist of all of the Study Vis it 10 procedures. 
4. Preferably, Visit 17a in Study Nef-301 should be combined with Vi sit 1 in Study Nef-301 OLE. If the visits are combined, proced ures do not need to be duplicated. If the 
visits are not combined, Visit 3 in Study Nef-301 OLE must occu r within 3 months after Visit 17b in Study Nef-301. Preferably, Visit 17b in Study Nef-301 should be 
combined with Visit 2 in Study Nef-301 OLE. If the visits are not combined, Study Visit 2 must occur within 2 weeks after Study  Visit 1. Study Visit 3 must occur 2 to 
4 weeks, inclusive, after Study Visit 2 in order to collec t the second proteinuria measurement to determine eligibility. 
5. After confirming all eligibility criteria (laboratory values from Study Visits 1, 2, 3, etc.) (eGFR values  from Study Visits 1 or 3 must be 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for the 
patient to be eligible), IRT will trigger the first shipment of  study drug to the site for the patient. Following initial shipm ent, there will be an automatic resupply of study drug 
to the site for dispensing to the patient at Study Visits 6 and 7. 
6. Medications taken within 3 months prior to Study Visit 1 and co ncomitant medications and therapies will be recorded in the eCRF s. 
7. Vital sign measurements w ill include systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure and heart rate will b e measured after resting in the supine position for 
at least 5 minutes. At Study Visits 1 and 3,  blood pressure and heart rate will be measured up to 3 times with each measurement  separated by 1 minute (the lowest value will 
be recorded on the eCRF). 
8. Height will only be collected at Study Visit 1. 
9. See Appendix B for the complete list of analytes. 
10. The central laboratory will calculate the eGFR using the CKD-EPI formula. 
11. If the patient is rescreened, HBV, HCV, HIV, and TB screenings s hould not be repeated if  done as part of the study within the l ast 12 months. 
12. A fresh urine sample will be collected for the urinalysis, and in addition urine will be assesse d by dipstick. See Appendix B f or the complete list of analytes. 
13. For women of childbearing potential only. A serum pregnancy test will only be performed at Study Visit 1. A pregnancy test via a local urine assessment will be performed at 
all other applicable study visits. 
14. Postmenopausal women will have a confirmato ry FSH test performed  at Study Visit 1. 
15. Patients must take the first dose of study drug in the presence of site staff during Study Visit 4. As a result, the first dose  of study drug may be administered at any time of day 
and without regard to the timing of meals.  Patients may self-dose for all other dos es of study drug and should take study drug in the morning at least 1 hour before breakfast.

Version 1.0, 06 August 2020 58 APPENDIX C:  RENIN-ANGIO TENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITOR AND 
OTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS 
ACCORDING TO THE 2012 KIDNEY DISEASE: IMPROVING GLOBAL 
OUTCOMES GUIDELINES 
Patients must continue on a stable dose of reni n-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor therapy 
(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and/or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers 
[ARBs]) at the maximum allowed dose or maxi mum tolerated dose according to the 2012 Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Ou tcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.1 A stable dose is defined as a dose 
within 25% of the dose at Vis it 17a or 17b in Study Nef-301.  
The following are recommendations for optimizati on and maintenance of RAS/antihypertensive 
therapy that are in line with the 2012 KDIGO guidelines1 and should be followed throughout the 
study: 
 Antihypertensive therapy is recommended to ach ieve a target systolic blood pressure 
<125 mmHg and target diastolic blood pressu re <75 mmHg. Antiproteinuric therapy should 
be used to try to achieve a ta rget proteinuria level <1 g/day. Antihypertensive therapy in these 
patients will follow current  clinical guidelines; 
 ACEIs are recommended as a first-line therapy and increased to the maximum tolerated daily 
dose (not to exceed the maximum recommended daily dose) depending on the degree of arterial 
hypertension and proteinuria. Pa tients can be converted to an ARB when ACEIs are not 
tolerated. Combination ACEI and ARB thera py is discouraged, but may be used at the 
discretion of the Investigator. If  combination therapy is used, th e stable dose should be based 
on the maximum tolerated dose rather  than the maximum allowed dose; 
 In patients who do not tolerate ACEIs or ARBs , other antihypertensive treatments may be used 
according to local treatment guidelines to achie ve the target blood pres sure. Study centers are 
not limited to the use of specific compounds; 
 Antihypertensive therapy with other agents incl uding diuretics, aldoste rone agonists, calcium 
channel blockers, and β-blockers may be maintained or  added according to the 2012 KDIGO 
guidelines and the clinical guideli ne of the individual study center in order to achieve the target 
blood pressure;1  
 In the case of hypotension, withdrawal of other antihypertensive (non-ACEI/non-ARB) 
medications should be considered as the first alternative; and  
 In the case of hypertension, addition or dose increase of other antihypertensive 
(non-ACEI/non-ARB) medicatio ns, as recommended by the 2012 KDIGO guidelines, should 
be considered.1

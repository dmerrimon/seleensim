CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Exploratory:  The exploratory endpoint s in each independent study group are:  
• DKK1  concentration in serum  and plasma relative to safety 
and efficacy outcomes.  
• Tumor genetics, gene expression levels (e.g., RNA-Seq), 
DKK1 expression (e.g. , RNAscope in situ hybridization), 
immunohistology, infiltrating immune cells and additional 
IHC staining (e.g., DKK1 and associated downstream elements, [e.g., β -catenin]) on tumor tissue  relative to safety 
and efficacy outcomes  
Study Design:  Study DEK-DKK1 -P204 is a Phase 2 basket study designed to 
evaluate DKN-01 activity either in combination with paclitaxel or as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent EEC or 
recurrent 
platinum -resistant/refractory  EOC , or recurrent carcinosarcoma  
(MMMT) who have received at least one prior systemic t herapy for 
advanced disease. Note that this basket study is enriching for 
activating β -catenin mutation s and/or Wnt signaling alterations (see 
Screening ). A maximum of 124  evaluable patients aged 18 years or 
older with histologically -confirmed recurrent EE C or recurrent 
platinum -resistant/refractory  EOC , or recurrent carcinosarcoma 
(MMMT ) requiring therapy will be enrolled in the study.  
Patients who are not eligible to receive paclitaxel, as determined by the Investigator, will be enrolled in the monotherapy group by primary tumor. Four distinct patient groups are being enrolled with up to 21 evaluable patients in Groups 1, 3,  and 4 , up to 31 evaluable patients 
in Group 2, up to 10 evaluable patients in Group 5, and up to 
20 evaluable patients in Group 6.  
Group 1: DKN -01 monotherapy in recurrent  EEC  
Group 2: DKN -01+paclitaxel in recurrent  EEC  
Group 3: DKN -01 monotherapy in recurrent  EOC  
Group 4: DKN -01+paclitaxel in recurrent  EOC  
Group 5: DKN -01 monotherapy in recurrent carcinosarcoma  
(MMMT ) 
Group 6: DKN -01+paclitaxel in recurrent carcinosarcoma 
 (MMMT ) 
Groups 1-4  employ a 2-stage design  conducted separately for each 
group. For each monotherapy group (Groups 1 and 3), after 12 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an additional 9 evaluable 
patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 1 or more patients 
respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are no responses in Stage 
Clinical Study Protocol_DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page ix 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  1, then preliminary anti -tumor activity in the group will be rejected 
and no further patients will be enrolled in that group. For the EEC 
combination therapy group (Group 2), after 20 evaluable patients are 
enrolled (Stage 1), if 3 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR), an additional 11  evaluable patients will be enrolled  in that 
group (Stage 2). If there are fewer than 3  responses in Stage 1, then 
preliminary anti-tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be enrolled in that group. For the EOC combination therapy group (Group 4), after 16 e valuable patients are 
enrolled (Stage 1), if 2 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR), an additional 5  evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group 
(Stage 2). If there are fewer than 2  responses in Stage 1, then 
preliminary anti-tumor ac tivity in the group will be rejected and no 
further patients will be enrolled in that group.  
Groups 5 and 6 are exploratory in nature.  Group 5 will enroll 
approximately 10 evaluable patients and Group 6 will enroll approximately 20 evaluable patients.  
For Groups 5 and 6, 3  patients in each group will initially be enrolled  
in a safety run -in phase. If the first 2 of 3 patients in a group  have a 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) will 
have been exceeded and a cohort will be enrolle d to evaluate DKN -01 
at a dose of 300 mg (±paclitaxel, depending on group assignment)  (see 
Synopsis Dose -Limiting Toxicity Determination and Maximum 
Tolerated Dose Definition ). If none of the 3 treated patients in a  
group develop a DLT after a minimum of o ne cycle of treatment, 
enrollment into the group will proceed according to the planned 
schedule. If a DLT is observed in 1 of the 3 patients in a group, up to 
an additional 3 patients will be enrolled and treated. If no further 
DLTs are observed within the expanded group of 6, enrollment into 
the group will proceed. If ≥2 of 6 patients within a  group experience a 
DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded and a cohort will be enrolled to evaluate DKN-01 at a dose of 300 mg (±paclitaxel , depending on 
group assignm ent). 
For the Rollover  Treatment Phase, p atients remain on the s ame dose 
and schedule as they received in the previous study part.  
 The study has 6  distinct periods, as follows:  
Screening  
Potentially eligible patients will sign informed consent prior to undergoing any study-related procedures. Patients will undergo Screening assessments for protocol eligibility within 28 days of study 
entry, as outlined in Table 6.  
Clinical Study Protocol_DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page x 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Fresh tumor tissue samples are required to be collected from all 
patients during Screening for genomic cancer profiling (i.e., CTNNB1 mutation and Wnt -signaling mutation), g ene expression  levels (e.g., 
RNA-Seq),  DKK1 expression (e.g. , RNAscope in situ hybridization),  
immunohistology, infiltrating immune cells and additional IHC staining ( DKK1  and associated downstream elements, [e.g., 
β-catenin]) . Although fresh biopsy is preferred, an archived specimen 
collected within 3  months of C1D1 may be acceptable, with the prior 
approval of the Medical Monitor.  
This basket study is enriching for activating β -catenin mutation s 
and/or Wnt signaling alterations, whereby approximately 50% of all 
evaluable patients enrolled in each group , in Stage 1 and in Stage 1 
and 2 combined (Groups 1- 4) and in Groups  5 and 6, are required to 
have an activating β -catenin  mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other 
Wnt signaling alteration  (e.g., LRP5/ 6, APC, A XIN1 /2, GSK3B, 
RNF43, ZNRF3, RSPO2 /3, FBXW7 , ARID1A, or CBP/CREBBP ; see 
full list in Appendix 12.6) , based on testing of the Screening tumor 
tissue sample or previously documented alteration by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) -accredited laboratory.   
To allow -for real -time  testing of Screening tumor tissue samples, the 
Screening period may be extended to 42  days, with results obtained 
and confirmed to be positive before the performance of additional Screening procedures. Note that all other Screening assessments must be per formed within 28 days before C1D1.  
Patients with prior documentation of a known activating β -catenin 
mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other Wnt signaling alteration by a CLIA -accredited laboratory will be permitted to enroll based on this 
documentation. In s uch patients, a Screening tumor sample will be 
collected and analyzed centrally; however, confirmatory results are not required for study enrollment.  
Groups 1-4 employ a 2-stage design conducted separately for each group. For each monotherapy group (Groups  1 and 3) , once 
6 evaluable patients are enrolled who do not have activating β -catenin 
mutation and/or Wnt signaling alterations, Stage 1 enrollment for that group will continue only with patients with activating β -catenin 
mutation and/or Wnt signaling alt erations. For combination therapy 
Group 2, once 10 evaluable patients are enrolled who do not have activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling alterations, Stage 1 
enrollment for that group will continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling alterations. For 
combination therapy Group 4, once 8 evaluable patients are enrolled 
who do not have activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling 
Clinical Study Protocol_DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page xi 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  alterations, Stage 1 enrollment for that group will continue only with 
patients with activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling 
alterations. At any time for Groups 1, 3, or 4, once 10 evaluable 
patients who do not have a documented activating β -catenin mutation 
and/or other Wnt signaling alteration have been enrolled in a group, enrollment in that group will continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other identified 
Wnt signaling alteration.  
At any time for Group 2, once 15 evaluable patients who do not have a 
documented activati ng β-catenin mutation and/or other Wnt signaling 
alteration have been enrolled, enrollment in that group will continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 
mutation) or other identified Wnt signaling alteration.  
 Study Treatment Period 
The Study Treatment Phase includes either DKN-01 monotherapy or 
DKN-01 in combination with paclitaxel; patients will be assigned to receive monotherapy or combination therapy at the Investigator’s discretion. Patients who initially start combination  therapy but 
subsequently discontinue paclitaxel may continue to receive DKN- 01 
as monotherapy during the Treatment Period.  
Patients are to begin study treatment as soon as possible (and 
preferably within 24 hours)  after completion of all screening 
procedures and confirmation of study eligibility . Study visits will be 
performed as outlined in Table 6.  
During the Treatment Period, tumor measurements are to be performed using the same radiographic methods used during Screening. Tumor response, including PD, is to be assessed by the 
Investigator within ±7 days of the first study drug dose in every other 
cycle, starting in C3, and at the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit using 
RECIST 1.1.  
The severity of TEAEs will be graded according to the United States National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ), version 5.0 . 
Rollover Treatment Phase 
The Rollover Treatment Phase will permit patients who are still 
experiencing clinical benefit continued access to study drug(s) until they meet discontinuation criteria as per Sectio n 6.4.1 . Study visits 
will be performed as outlined in Table 7 . 
Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Clinical Study Protocol_DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page xii 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  All patients will continue study treatment in the Treatment Phase until 
development of radiographically-documented PD or unacceptable toxicity or another discontinuation criterion is met, as determined by the Investigator. All patients will return for an EO T Visit 
approximately 30 days (+7 days) after the last treatment administration 
in the Treatment Period. The reason for discontinuation from study treatment will be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Progressive Disease Follow-up Phase  
To ensure accuracy and completeness for the disease response-related endpoints, patients who permanently discontinued study treatment prior to PD will continue to be followed up in the PD follow -up phase 
until radiographically documented PD.  
During this P D follow -up period, efficacy assessments for disease 
response and PD per RECIST 1.1 will be performed every 8 weeks 
[see Table 6 and ( Table 7  for the Rollover Treatment P hase only) ]. 
Patients are expected not to start any other anti -cancer therapy during 
the PD follow -up phase prior to radiographically documented PD; 
however, if alternate therapy is started, patients wi ll continue to be 
followed for radiologic progression even after starting subsequent 
therapy. After radiographically -documented PD, all patients will be 
followed for survi val in the Survival Follow -up Phase.  
Survival Follow -up Phase  
After discontinuation of treatment and radiographic documentation of 
PD, all patients will be followed in the survival follow -up phase for 
survival until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to f ollow -up, 
implementation of the rollover treatment phase, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. Survival follow -up will occur 4 times per year (every 
12 weeks [±14 days]) after the EOT visit or end of PD Follow -up 
Phase, as applicable, and may be conduct ed via telephone or office 
visit. During survival follow -up, the following information will be 
collected: survival and subsequent anti -cancer therapies.

Test Products, Doses, and Mode 
of Administration:  The study treatment regimens for Groups 1-4 are:  
• DKN-01 monotherapy:  DKN -01 300 mg on D1 and 15 every 
28 days.  
• DKN-01+paclitaxel:  DKN -01 300 mg on D1 and 15 + 
paclitaxel 80  mg/m2 on D1, 8, and 15 every 28 days.  
The study treatment regimens for Groups 5-6 are:  
• DKN-01 monotherapy:  DKN -01 600 mg on D1 and 15 every 
28 days.  
• DKN 01+paclitaxel:  DKN -01 600 mg on D1 and 15 + 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, 8, and 15 every 28 days.  
DKN-01 wil l be administered intravenously (IV) over a minimum of 
30 minutes and up to a maximum of 2 hours given on D1 and 15 of 
each cycle without interruption.  
For patients receiving DKN-01 in combination, paclitaxel will be administered IV over 1 hour on days 1,  8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle 
according to standard clinical practice. The dose for paclitaxel is 80 mg/m
2. For patients receiving the combination, DKN -01 will be 
administered first followed by paclitaxel as separate infusions on D1 and 15 of each cycle.   
Additionally, for Groups 5 and  6, 3 patients in each group will initially 
be enrolled in a safety run -in phase. If the first 2 of 3 patients in a 
group have a DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded and a cohort 
will be enrolled to evaluate DKN-01 at a dose  of 300 mg (±paclitaxel , 
depending on group assignment)  (see Synopsis Dose-Limiting 
Toxicity Determination and Maximum Tolerated Dose Definition). If none of the 3 treated patients in a  group develop a DLT after a 
minimum of one cycle of treatment, enrollm ent into the group will 
proceed according to the planned schedule. If a DLT is observed in 
Clinical Study Protocol_DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page xix 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  1 of the 3 patients  in a group, up to an additional 3  patients will be 
enrolled and treated. If no further DLTs are observed within the 
expanded group of 6, enrollment into the group will proceed. If ≥2 of 
6 patients within a  group experience a DLT, the MTD will have been 
exceeded and a cohort will be enrolled to evaluate DKN-01 at a dose of 300 mg (± paclitaxel , depending on group assignment) . 
Premedication for paclitaxel will be given according to local standard of care prior to each infusion. Suggested premedications include dexamethasone 20  mg orally [PO] 1 2 to 6 hours prior; 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior; and cimetidine or ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior) or equivalents.  
For the Rollover Treatment Phase, patients re main on the s ame dose 
and schedule as they received in the previ ous study part.   
Duration of Treatment:  No maximum duration of treatment has been set; patients may 
continue treatment until the development of PD or unacceptable 
toxicity or another discontinuation criterion has been met.  
Duration of Study:  It is estimated that the total study duration will be  approximately 
36 months, assuming a 24- month accrual period and 12 months 
of follow -up for the last patient enrolled.  Patients who are still 
experiencing clinical benefit will continue to have access to 
study drug(s) in the Rollover Treatment Phase, until they meet 
discontinuation criteria as per Section  6.4.1 . 
Sample Size Calculation:  This is a proof -of-concept basket study designed primarily to seek 
information on the safety and efficacy of DKN-01 in combination with 
paclitaxel and as DKN-01 monotherapy in patients with recurrent EEC or EOC with and without activating β -catenin mutatio n and/or Wnt 
signaling alterations, or carcinosarcoma (MMMT). A maximum of 124 evaluable patients (monotherapy groups and combination groups) 
will be enrolled in the study. This is an exploratory open-label study with 6 groups. Groups 1-4 employ a 2-stage study design conducted 
separately for each group. Up to 21  evaluable patients are enrolled in 
each of Groups 1, 3, and 4, and up to 31 evaluable patients in Group 2. Groups 5 and 6 are exploratory in nature and will have up to 10 and 20 evaluable patients  enrolled and dosed at the RP2D , respectively.  
The sample sizes of 10 and 20 patients for Groups 5 and 6, respectively, are based on practical considerations and clinical judgement to obtain sufficient information on the safety, initial clinical 
effectiveness, and PK data in the carcinosarcoma groups at the 600 -mg 
dose.  
The sample size of Groups 1 through 4 employ a 2-stage study design 
and were calculated as follows: For each monotherapy group (Groups 
Clinical Study Protocol_DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page xx 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  1 and 3), after 12 evaluable patients are enr olled (Stage 1), an 
additional 9 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) 
if 1 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are no responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -tumor activity in the 
group will be rejected  and no further patients will be enrolled in that 
group. If the group continues to Stage 2, a total of 21 evaluable 
patients will be studied for that group. The group will be considered successful if ≥3 treated patients respond.  
This design is applied to each monotherapy group separately and is based on a 2 -stage Simon Minimax design ( Simon 1989) for a total of 
21 evaluable patients (null hypothesis that ORR ≤5% versus the 
alternative hypothesis that ORR ≥20% with alpha=0.080 and power=0.803).  
For combination therapy Group 2, after 20 evaluable patients are 
enrolled (Stage 1), an additional 11 evaluable patients will be enrolled 
in that group (Stage 2) if 3 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are fewer than  3 responses in Stage 1, then 
preliminary anti-tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be enrolled in that group. If the group continues to Stage 2, a total of 31 evaluable patients will be studied for that group. The group will be considered successful if ≥6 treated patients respond. 
This design is applied to combination therapy Group 2 separately and is based on a 2 -stage Simon Minimax design for a total of 
31 evaluable patients (null hypothesis that ORR ≤12% versus the 
alternative hypothesis that ORR ≥25% with alpha=0.150 and 
power=0.802).  
For combination therapy Group 4, after 16 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an additional 5 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 2 or more patients re spond (i.e., experience 
CR or PR). If there are fewer than 2 responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti-tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be enrolled in that group. If the group continues to Stage 2, a total of 21 e valuable patients will be studied for that group. 
The group will be considered successful if ≥4 treated patients respond. This design is applied to combination therapy Group 4 separately and is based on a 2 -stage Simon Minimax design for a total of 
21 evaluable patients (null hypothesis that ORR ≤10% versus the 
alternative hypothesis that ORR ≥25% with alpha=0.149 and power=0.803).  
There are no formal comparisons planned between groups. Any statistical results will be interpreted in the perspective of the exploratory nature of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Analysis Populations:  Study Population Definitions  
Several study populations will be used for analysis, as follows:  
• Evaluable Analysis Set (EAS): All patients who received any 
amount of DKN -01 and have at least one eval uable post -
baseline RECIST tumor response assessment or were discontinued due to toxicity.  
The EAS will be the primary population for analyses of ORR, ODCR, PFS, DoR, DoCR, DoCB, and TTP. 
• Full analysis set (FAS): All enrolled patients who receive any amount of DKN -01. The FAS will be used for analyses of OS, 
TTTF, sensitivity analysis of select tumor -related endpoints, 
and exploratory endpoints.  
• Safety population, defined as all enrolled patients who receive any amount of study treatment (either DKN-01 or paclitaxel). 
All safety analyses will be based on this population. The safety population and FAS are identical, unless a patient received paclitaxel but did not receive DKN-01.  
• A Per -Protocol (PP) subset may also be used to analyze select 
efficacy endp oints and will be based on study drug exposure 
(compliance and/or time on study drug) and major protocol deviations. The criteria for inclusion in the PP subset will be finalized and documented. The PP set will be defined and finalized separately for each group.  
• PK Analysis Set: All enrolled patients who receive at least a single dose of DKN-01 and have sufficient data to determine PK parameters.  
Clinical Study Protocol_DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page xxii 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Statistical Methodology:  General Considerations  
Summaries will be tabulated for each group and within each group, 
where applicable, by presence of Wnt signaling alterations and/or CTNNB1 activating mutations. Select parameters may also be summarized by dose and will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviat ion, median, minimum, 
and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables. Frequency 
distributions (counts and associated percentages) will be presented for categorical variables. Median, 25
th and 75th percentiles and standard 
error will be presented f or time -to-event data.  
This study is descriptive in nature; no formal comparisons between groups will be performed. All confidence intervals (CIs) will be 95%, unless stated otherwise.  
Individual patient data listings will be provided to support summary tables.  
The effects of noncompliance, treatment discontinuations, premature study withdrawals, subsequent therapies, and covariates will be assessed to determine the impact on the general applicability of results from this study.  
 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy data will be summarized for each group. Selected summaries 
may also be done  within each group, as applicable, by presence of 
Wnt signaling alterations and/or CTNNB1 activating mutations, and by subgroups as described in the SAP. The EAS will be the primary population for analysis of ORR, ODCR, PFS, DoR, DoCR, DoCB, and TTP. Secondary and exploratory analyses of efficacy endpoints (including OS and TTTF) will be performed using the FAS.  
The proportion of patients with ORR and ODCR, along with a 95% CI based on the Clopper -Pearson interval, will be reported. The 
Kaplan -Meier method will be used to summarize OS, PFS, TTP, 
TTTF, DoR, DoCR, and DoCB. The Investigator disease response assessments according to RECIST 1.1 will be used as the primary measures for analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.   Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population and 
presented by group.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded according to the current version 
of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The severity of AEs will be graded according to the United States NCI CTCAE, version 5.0.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any AE 
with onset or (worsening of a pre -existing condition) after the first 
dose of study drug thr ough 30 days following the last dose of study 
drug. Events including TEAEs, AEs leading to dose 
reduction/interruption, AEs related to study drug, SAEs, AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation, and AEs with an outcome of death will 
be summarized by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group. A summary of AEs of NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 
higher, as well as the most frequent AEs (preferred terms), and AEs by relationship to study treatment, will be provided.  
For Groups 5 and  6, incidence of DLTs will be summarized.  
Number and percent of patients with infusion-related reactions will be summarized by group, overall and by visit.  
Values and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory results will be 
summarized by visit. Clinical laboratory val ues will be graded 
according to the NCI CTCAE, for applicable tests. Shifts in toxicity 
grades from baseline grade will be summarized. Shifts from baseline 
in ECOG performance status also will be summarized.  
Vital sign, ECG, and concomitant medication data will be 
summarized.  
PK Analyses  
Peak drug concentration (C
max), time to peak concentration (T max), and 
areas under the concentration -time curve (AUCs) will be reported, as 
feasible. Data may be pooled with data from other studies to conduct population PK  modeling.  
Immunogenicity Analyses  
Details regarding immunogenicity analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
Exploratory Analyses

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background  
1.1.1. DKN -01 
DKN- 01 (formerly known as LY2812176) is a potent humanized monoclonal antibody (Mab) 
(immunoglobulin G4 [IgG 4]) with neutralizing activity against dickkopf- 1 (DKK1), a modulator 
of Wnt signaling pathways that influences a number of important processes such as cell growth 
and differ entiation, bone development, and adult bone homeostasis ( Sato et al. 2010 ; 
Gavriatopoulou et al. 2009; Vallet et al. 2010; Pinzone et al. 2009) . DKN -01 is in development 
as an anti -cancer agent and is being investigated in a variety of solid tumors.  
To date, DKN- 01 has been evaluated in a 30- subject healthy volunteer study and in 
approximately 167 patient s with cancer in 5 clinical studies. Results from completed Phase 1 
Study DEK -DKK1- P100, in which DKN -01 was administered as monotherapy to patients with 
cancer at doses up to 600 mg every other week, demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. 
Based on these results, clinical evaluation of DKN -01 in combination was initiated , with DKN-
01 also shown to be well tolerated when administered in combination  with commercially 
available anti -neoplastic agents. Across all studies, there have been no safety concerns 
identified that re late to significant injection site reactions or systemic infusion reactions. 
Furthermore, t here have been no known undesirable effects identified with administration of 
DKN- 01. DKN- 01 has been observed to be well -tolerated over multiple treatment cycles.  
Evidence of an anti -tumor effect of DKN -01 as a monotherapy has been seen in patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . Additionally, evidence of an anti -tumor effect has been 
seen with DKN -01 in combination in patients with esophageal cancer, parti cularly those with 
adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastro -esophageal junction who had received fewer lines 
of therapy, and in patients with biliary tract cancer. 
Full information on DKN -01 is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.1.2. Dickkopf -1 (DKK1 ) 
Wnt signaling is a multifaceted pathway that regulates stem cell maintenance, cell fate 
decisions, cell proliferation, survival, migration, and polarity determination during development 
and adult tissue homeostasis ( Logan and Nusse 2004;  MacDonald et al. 2009 ; Clevers and 
Nusse 2012;  Clevers et al. 2014;  Sedgwick and D'Souza -Schorey 2016) . DKK1 is a secreted 
modulator of Wnt signaling and is best characterized as an antagonist of the canonical 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, however it has also been implicated in the activation of 
noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways and PI3K/AKT signaling ( Niehrs et al. 2 006; Wang and 
Zang 2011; Kimura  et al.  2016) .  
DKK1 protein, is over -expressed in a variety of tumor types and this is associated with a poor 
prognosis such as decreased ov erall survival (OS) of cancer patients, including NSCLC, 
esophageal cancer, breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, liver cancer , and ovarian cancer 
(Shizhuo et al. 2009; Tung et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2012; Shi et al. 2013;  Hiss 2012). DKK1 has 
direct tumor effects by increasing tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis and through 
favoring a stem cell -like phenotype ( Smadja et al. 2010; Krause et al. 2014 ; Malladi et al. 2016; 
Thudi et al. 2011) . Furthermore, DKK1 has been implicated in promoting an 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 2 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  immunosuppressive tumor micro environm ent by activating myeloid derived suppressor cells 
and through the downregulation of NK activating ligands on cancer cells ( D’Amico  et al. 2016;  
Malladi et al. 2016).  Based on these data, neutralizing DKK1 has been hypothesized to not only 
directly impede tumor growth but also promote an anti -tumor immune response .  
1.1.3. Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway and Gynecological Cancers  
Elevated levels of DKK1 have been observed in p atients  with gynecological cancer (Jiang et 
al. 2009; Chamorro et al. 2005; Shizhuo et al. 2009; Wang and Zang 2011). Assessment of 
DKK1  levels in the sera of 104 patients with gynecological cancer, including ovarian (N=36), 
cervical (N=40), and endometrial (N=28) cancers, revealed significantly higher DKK1  levels in 
patients with either cervical cancer (314.13 pg/mL, p <  0.001) or with endometrial cancer 
(46.95 pg/mL, p < 0.001) relative to healthy individuals (29.45 [11.86] pg/mL). Furthermore, 
the serum levels of DKK1  were associated with clinical stage in all patients in this study (Jiang 
et al. 2009 ). 
Mutations of CTNNB1 , the gene that encodes β -catenin , have been identified in a high 
percentage of patients with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma  and low -grade endometrioid 
ovarian carcinoma ( Liu et al. 2014 ; McConechy et al. 2014 ). CTN NB1 mutations that are 
associated with active canonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling have been identified in an aggressive 
subset of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma  occurring in younger women ( Lui et al. 2014). 
Activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling that can occur through CTNNB1 mutations 
leads to increased expression of DKK1 and this may further promote tumor growth ( Chamorro 
et al. 2005 ; Niida et al. 2004; C hen et al.  2016 ; Bu et al. 2008) . Furthermore, patients with 
tumors that co -stain for β-catenin, a marker of active canonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling, and 
DKK1 frequently have a worse prognosis ( Yu et al. 2009; Xu  et al.  2012 ; Chen et al. 2014) . 
Taken together these results suggest that patients with activated Wnt/ β-catenin signaling may 
benefit from a DKK1 neutralizing therapy.  
1.2. Rationale and Justification for the Study  
Molecular subtyping of cancers may inform diagnosis, prognosis, and selection of appropriate targeted therapies. The development of molecular -targeted therapies has been a growing area of 
interest for the treatment of both endometrioid ovarian carcinoma  (Matsuzaki et al. 2015; 
Banerjee and Kay 2013; Bast 2011; Hiss 2012; Twu and Han 2012; Sudo 2012; Weberpals et al. 
2011) and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma  (Uppendahl et al. 2017 ; Bookman et al. 2014; 
Bansal et al. 2009 ), with  a number of potential targets identified . Molecularly -targeted agents 
hold the promise of greater selectivity with lower toxicity than conventional chemotherapy (Banerjee 2013 ).  
As stated previously, CTNNB1 mutations have been seen both in patients with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma ( Liu et al. 2014; McConechy et al. 
2014; Markowska et al. 2014) . Furthermore, high expression levels of DKK1  have been 
observed in patients with gynecological cancers, including ovarian and endometrial ( Jiang et al. 
2009) . Activation of canonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling that can occur through CT NNB1 
mutations is associated with increased expression of DKK1 ( Chamorro et al. 2005; Niida et al. 
2004; Chen  et al. 2016
; Bu et al. 2008) . Furthermore, patients with tumors that co -stain for β -
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  catenin, a marker of active canonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling, and DKK1 frequently have a 
worse prognosis ( Yu et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2012 ; Chen et al. 2014).  
This study will enroll patients with either epithelial endometrial cancer (EEC) or epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC)  (Groups 1- 4), or carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumor 
[MMMT]) (Groups 5 -6) and for all groups  will enric h for activating β -catenin mutations 
(CTNNB1 mutation) or other Wnt signaling alterations (e.g., LRP 5/6, APC, A XIN1/2 , GSK3B, 
RNF43, ZNRF3, RSPO2/3 , FBXW7 , ARID1A, or  CBP/CREBBP ; see full list in Appendix 
12.6), whereby approximately 50% of all patients enrolled are required to have such mutations 
or alterations.   
DKN -01 will be administered as monotherapy or, at the Investigator’s discretion, in 
combination with paclitaxel in the current study . Paclitaxel is indicated as first- line and 
subsequent treatment in advanced ovarian cancer and has been studied extensively in patients 
with endometrial cancer  and is recommended as a chemotherapeutic option in this disease 
setting ( NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2017; Bestvina and Flemming 2016 ).  
1.3. Rationale for the Dose Selected  
DKN- 01 will be administered at a dose of 300 mg (Groups 1- 4) or 600 mg (Groups 5 and 6) 
intravenously ( IV) on Days (D) 1 and 15 every 28 days  either as monotherapy or , at the 
Investigator’s discretion,  in combination with paclitaxel .  
DKN- 01 is selective for the DKK1 member of the dickkopf family. It binds human DKK 1 with 
high affinity and, as a consequence, potently neutralizes DKK1. The levels of the protein DKK1 are elevated in a variety of tumor types and have been implicated in tumor growth and disease 
progression. A preclinical NSCLC A549 xenograft model study demonstrated that suppression of free (unbound) DKK1 concentrations correlated with an inhibition of tumor growth. 
A target -mediated disposition model was utilized to fit the clinical DKN -01/DKK1 
concentration data. The model incorporated two  DKN- 01 clearance pathways, one non- specific 
(linear) clearance pathway, and one target -mediated (nonlinear) clearance that included 
saturable binding to DKK1. The resulting one -target model assumed quasi -equilibrium (QE) 
and was utilized to simultaneously fit both tota l DKN -01 and total DKK1 serum concentrations. 
This approach was used to assess the degree of target engagement (formation of the DKN01/  
DKK1 complex) by DKN -01 and the resulting suppression of free DKK1 concentrations in 
serum.  
Based on modeling in combination with xenograft results, DKK1 neutralization (lower free 
DKK1) was associated with maximal tumor growth inhibition in an A549 xenograft study (see 
Investigators Brochure, Section 5.1.6). In order to relate these preclinical results to clinical data, 
model simulations were generated to predict human clinical DKN -01 and the resulting free 
DKK1 serum concentrations after IV drug administration once every 2 weeks ( Q2W ). These 
simulations focused on the maximal concentration for free DKK1 (DKK1 peak drug concentration  [C
max]) over the Q2W dosing interval. The initial baseline value of free DKK1 
was approximately 5.4 ng/mL (data not shown). The graphs below demonstrate that DKK1 C max 
is substantially reduced (relative to baseline) by the administration DKN -01.  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  These plots illustrate that in the majority of patients (> 95%), DKK1 C max concentrations could 
be suppressed to 1.5 ng/mL or less after one dose of 300 mg DKN -01 (Figure 1). In addition, 
after repeat 300  mg Q2W dosing, the highest free DKK1 C max levels declined to approximately 
0.76 ng/mL or less for 95% of patients ( Figure 1). Simulations showed that when the DKN -01 
dose was in creased to 600  mg, the highest free DKK1 C max was decreased to approximately 
0.8 ng/mL after the first dose, and then to 0.4 ng/mL after repeat Q2W dosing to steady- state 
(Figure 2 ).

Several ongoing clinical studies have been conducted to determine the effect of DKN -01 on a 
variety of cancers. In Study DEK -DKK1 -P102 (P102; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), DKN -01 was dosed in 
combination with paclitaxel as  well as in a separate monotherapy substudy. In this study, 
patients were administered DKN -01 at doses of 150 or 300 mg Q2W over a 28- day cycle. 
Patients in Study DEK -DKK1 -P103 (P103; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) were administered DKN -01 at 
doses of 150 or 300 mg in combi nation with gemcitabine and cisplatin on Days 1 and 8 of each 
21-day cycle. The dosing cycles for P102 and P103 are not comparable and the simulations 
above only apply to a Q2W dosing schedule, such as that used in P102. 
In both of these clinical studies, pharmacokinetic ( PK)/pharmacodynamic  (PcD)  modeling 
showed a dose -dependent decrease in free DKK1 C max concentrations. For example, in 
Study P102, the median free DKK1 C max after a  150 mg DKN- 01 dose was 0.95 ng/mL (after 
the last dose for each patient), w hereas the median value was 0.55 ng/mL in the 300 mg dose 
group. Although this last value is higher than the steady- state values in the 300 mg Q2W 
simulation above, it should be noted that many patients were not dosed to steady- state in the 
P102 clinical s tudy.   
In P102 and P103, preliminary modeling showed that for patients with a partial response  (PR) , 
the median free DKK1 C max was 0.39 ng/mL and 0.50 ng/mL (respectively), and the highest 
individual free DKK1 C max was 0.86 and 0.77 ng/mL, respectively. I n non -responders, the 
median C max was 0.65 and 0.61 ng/mL (respectively) and the highest individual free C max 
observed was 5.7 and 10.8 ng/mL, respectively. Thus, for patients showing a PR , maximal free 
DKK1 C max levels did not exceed 0.86 ng/mL and the median free C max values were lower than 
those for the non- responders. Currently, it is not understood if the 0.86 ng/mL threshold is a 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  meaningful target for efficacy, or if median free DKK1 C max values ( ≤ 0.39- 0.50 ng/mL) are 
important. However, it can be stated that there is an overall trend for lower free DKK1 levels in 
partial responders versus non- responders. By extension, higher doses of DKN -01 (i.e., 600 mg) 
should lower free DKK1 levels sufficiently to see ad ditional efficacy in patients.  
Safety data for DKN -01 are available from 30 healthy subjects treated with a single dose of 
DKN- 01 monotherapy and 229 patients with cancer treated with DKN -01, of whom 65 received 
DKN- 01 monotherapy; 7 received DKN -01 in com bination with lenalidomide /dexamethasone ; 
69 received DKN -01 in combination with paclitaxel; 51 patients received DKN -01 in 
combination with gem citabine /cisplatin ; and 37 received DKN -01 in combination with 
pembrolizumab.  
Study DEK -DKK1 -P100 was a 2 -part ( Parts A and B), Phase 1, multicenter, nonrandomized, 
open- label, multiple -dose, dose -escalation study of DKN -01 administered IV to patients 
30 years of age or older. Study Part A (dose escalation) consisted of a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation designed to d etermine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and dose -limiting 
toxicities (DLTs ) of DKN- 01 in patients with multiple myeloma (MM ) or advanced solid 
tumors. Study Part B (dose confirmation) was designed to administer DKN -01 at the MTD (or 
highest dose tested i f the MTD is not reached) to further characterize safety and tolerability and 
to evaluate progression -free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory NSCLC.  
A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study and received study treatment. Thirteen patien ts 
were enrolled and treated in Part A and 19 patients in Part B. In Part A, DKN -01 doses of 75, 
150, and 300 mg were administered IV (once weekly) QW and 600 mg was administered IV Q2W to different cohorts of patients. There were no DLTs observed in Part A; therefore, study Part B proceeded with enrolling a total of 19 patients who received 300 mg DKN -01 Q2W . 
DKN- 01 given IV at escalating doses from 75 mg QW to 600 mg Q2W in Part A and as a single 
IV agent at a dose of 300 mg Q2W in Part B was safe and wel l tolerated.  All treatment- related 
adverse events ( TEAEs ) were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were no related serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ) and no discontinuations due to a TEAE.  
Study DEK -DKK1 -P102 is an ongoing Phase 1 non- randomized, dose -escalating, open -label, 
multicenter study conducted in multiple parts (Parts A through F). In addition, a separate monotherapy substudy is being conducted concurrently with Parts B through F. A maximum of approximately 224 patients aged 18 years or older with histologi cally confirmed recurrent or 
refractory esophageal, gastro -esophageal junction or gastric cancer with progressive disease 
requiring therapy will be enrolled in the study.  
As of 20 August 2018, 124 patients have been enrolled, including 9 patients in Part A ; 20 in 
Part B; 25 in Part C, 3 in Part D; 2 in Part E; 37 in Part F; and 28 in the monotherapy substudy. 
Overall, 3 patients have received DKN -01 150 mg+paclitaxel; 56 have received DKN -01 
300 mg+paclitaxel; 2 have received DKN -01 150 mg+pembrolizumab; 35 have received 
DKN- 01 300 mg+pembrolizumab; and 28 patients have received DKN -01 300 mg as 
monotherapy in this study. 
Among patients treated with DKN -01 as monotherapy (N=28) in the monotherapy substudy, the 
most common type of TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (18 patients; 64%) and the most 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 7 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  common individual TEAEs were fatigue (13 patients; 46%), vomiting (8 patients; 29%), 
dehydration (7 patients; 25%), and nausea, constipation, and anemia (each 6 patients; 21%).  
At least 1 TEAE was considered by the Investigator to be DKN -01-related for 16 (57%) 
patients, with the most common such events being fatigue (7 patients; 25%), anemia and vomiting (each 4 patients; 14%), and nausea and decreased appetite (each 3 patients; 11%). All other DKN- 01-related TEAEs were reported for ≤2 patients.  
One (4%) patient treated with DKN -01 monotherapy experienced DKN -01-related Grade 3 
TEAEs, hyponatremia and lymphopenia. All other DKN -01-related TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 
in intensity.  
Among patients treated with DKN -01 300 mg+paclitaxel (N=56), the most common type of 
TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (41 patients; 73%) and the most common individual TEAEs were fatigue (29 patients; 52%), anemia (27 patients; 48%), alo pecia and peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (each 19 patients; 34%), neutropenia (17 patients; 30%), cough (16 patients; 29%), and dyspnea (14 patients; 25%). 
Among the 3 patients treated with the lower DKN -01 dose of 150 mg+paclitaxel, the TEAE 
profile was si milar to that seen with the 300 mg dose, with the most common TEAEs being 
diarrhea and fatigue (each 3 patients; 100%) and arthralgia, headache, and toothache (each 
2 patients; 67%). All other TEAEs were reported for 1 patient only at this dose level.  
Thirty-two (57%) of 56 patients treated with DKN -01 300 mg +paclitaxel experienced a 
DKN- 01-related TEAE, most commonly fatigue (13 patients; 23%), diarrhea (7 patients; 13%), 
nausea (6 patients; 11%), anemia and decreased appetite (each 5 patients; 9%), and constipation 
and neutropenia (each 4 patients; 7%).  
Six (11%) patients experienced a DKN -01-related Grade 3 TEAE, including hypophosphatemia 
(2 patients; 4%), anemia, monocytosis, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy (1 patient; 2%).  
DKN- 01-related TEAEs  reported with DKN -01 150 mg + paclitaxel included single incidences 
of dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and stomatitis, with fatigue and peripheral sensory neuropathy being Grade 3 in intensity.  
Among the 56 patients who received DKN- 01 300 mg + paclitaxel, 22 (39%) experienced at 
least 1 SAE, with infections and infestations being the most common type (9 patients; 16%). Individual SAEs reported for >1 patient included pneumonia (4 patients; 7%), and aspiration, lung infection, and pulmonary embolism (each 2 patients; 4%). All SAEs were considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to DKN -01. 
Three patients experienced a Grade 5 TEAE, including aspiration (2 patients) and pulmonary embolism and respiratory failure in 1 patient e ach. For all 3 patients, the TEAE resulting in 
death was considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to DKN -01. 
For summar ies of the clinical safety of DKN -01 300 mg administered in conjunction with 
pembrolizumab (Study DEK -DKK1 -P102) or in conjunction with gemcitabine and cisplatin 
(Study DEK -DKK1 -P103), please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
In the current study, a s of 20 August 2018, the most common TEAEs amo ng patients receiving 
DKN- 01 as monotherapy (N=5) and in combination with paclitaxel (N=10) in Study 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 8 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  DEK- DKK1 -P204 are summarized. Overall, 11 (73%) of 15 patients experienced at least 
1 TEAE. TEAEs reported for >1 patient included arthralgia, constipation, hypokalemia, and 
lymphopenia. 
Eight (53%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE that was considered by the Investigator to be 
DKN- 01-related. Such events reported for >1 patient included hypokalemia and lymphopenia 
(each 2 patients), with 1 case of lymphopenia assessed as Grade 3 in intensity. All other DKN- 01-related TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity.  
The dose of paclitaxel selected for use in the current study, 80 mg/m
2, is the same as that 
employed in combination with DKN -01 in Study P102. For detail ed information related to 
clinical safety, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4. Justification of the Study Design  
This study employs a “basket” design , a relatively new form of oncologic clinical study design 
predicated on the hypothesis that the presence of a molecular marker predicts response to a 
targeted therapy independent of tumor histology ( Redig and Jänne 2015; Mandrekar et al. 2015 ; 
Menis et al. 2014) . Several recent studies have employed this type of design, including the large 
(estimated 1000  patients) “NCI- MATCH” study (i.e ., National Cancer Institute Molecular 
Analysis for Therapy Choice) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and “CUSTOM” study (i .e., Molecular Profiling and Targeted Therapies in Advanced Thoracic Malignancies) 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Per the  basket design, patients will be assigned to 1 of 4 s pecific treatment groups  in a 
non-randomized fashion, with each group essentially representing an independent P hase 2 stud y 
conducted in parallel , with each group employing a 2- stage design . According to this design, a 
particular group may be stopped if a preliminary lack of antitumor activity is seen in that group 
in Stage 1 without impacting the other study groups . Conversely, patients will be enrolled in 
Stage 2 for a particular group if Stage 1 did not reveal  a preliminary lack of antitumor activity .  
The Sponsor , Monitor, and Investigators will perform th is study in compliance with the 
protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements .

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Design and Plan of the Study  
Study D EK-DKK1 -P204  is a Phase 2 basket study designed to evaluate DKN -01 activity either 
as monotherapy or, at the Investigator’s discretion, in combination with paclitaxel in patient s 
with recurrent EEC , recurrent platinum -resistant/refractory  EOC (Groups 1- 4), or recurrent 
carcinosarcoma (MMMT)  (Groups 5- 6) who have received at least one prior systemic therapy 
for advanced disease. For Groups 1- 4, this basket study will enrich for activating β -catenin 
mutation and/or Wnt signaling alterations (see Screening , Section 3.2.1 ). A maximum of 124 
evaluable patients aged 18  years or older with histologically confirmed recurren t EEC , 
recurrent platinum -resistant/refractory  EOC, or recurrent carcinosarcoma ( MMMT ) with PD 
requiring therapy will be enrolled in the study. Patient s who are not eligible to receive paclitaxel 
will be enrolled in the monotherapy group by primary tumor. Six  (6) distinct patient groups are 
being enrolled with up to 21 evaluable patient s in Groups 1, 3 and 4, up to 31 evaluable patients 
in Group 2, up to 10 evaluable patients in Group 5, and up to 20 evaluable patients in Group 6, 
as follows :  
• Group 1: DKN -01 monotherapy in recurrent  EEC  
• Group 2: DKN -01+paclitaxel in recurrent EEC  
• Group 3: DKN -01 monotherapy in recurrent  EOC 
• Group 4: DKN -01+paclitaxel in recurrent EOC 
• Group 5: DKN -01 monotherapy in recurrent carcinosarcoma  (MMMT ) 
• Group 6: DKN -01+paclitaxel in recurrent carcinosarcoma ( MMMT ) 
Groups 1- 4 employ a 2 -stage design  conducted separately for each group. For each 
monotherapy group (Groups 1 and 3), after 12 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an additional 9 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 1 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are no responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -
tumor  activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be enrolled in that group. 
For the EEC combination therapy group (Group 2), after 20 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), if 3 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR), an additional 11 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2). If there are fewer than 3 responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be 
enrolled in that group. For the  EOC combination therapy group (Group 4), after 16 evaluable 
patients are enrolled (Stage 1), if 2 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR), an additional 5 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2). If there are fewer than 
2 responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no 
further patients will be enrolled in that group.  
Groups 5 and 6 are exploratory in nature. Group 5 will enroll approximately 10 evaluable patients and Group 6 w ill enroll approximately 20 evaluable patients.  
For Groups  5 and 6, 3 patients in each group will initially be enrolled  in a safety run -in phase . If 
the first 2 of 3 patients in a group have a DLT  (see Section  5.6.2.1) , the MTD will have been 
exceeded (see Section 5.6.2.1) and a cohort will be enrolled to evaluate DKN -01 at a dose of 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 14 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  300 mg ( ±paclitaxel , depending on group assignment) . If none of the 3 treated patients in a  
group develop a DLT after a minimum of one cycle of treatment, enrollment into the group will 
proceed according to the planned schedule. If a DLT is observed in 1 of the 3 patients  in a 
group, up to an additional 3 patients will be enrolled and treated. If no further DLTs are observed within the expanded group of 6, enrollment into the group will proceed . If ≥2 of 
6 patients w ithin a  group experience a DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded and a cohort 
will be enrolled to evaluate DKN -01 at a dose of 300 mg ( ±paclitaxel , depending on group 
assignment) . 
For the Rollover Treatment Phase, patients remain on the s ame dose and schedu le as they 
received in the previous study part.  
3.2. Study Periods
 
The study has 6 distinct periods, as follows:  
3.2.1. Screening  
Potentially eligible patients will sign informed consent prior to undergoing any study- related 
procedures. Patient s will undergo Screening assessments for protocol eligibility within 28 days 
of study entry, as outlined in Table 6.   
Fresh tumor tissue samples are required to be collected from all patients during Screening for genomic cancer profiling (i.e., CTNNB1 mutat ion and Wnt -signaling mutation), gene 
expression levels (e.g., RNA -Seq), DKK1 expression (e.g., RNAscope in situ hybridization), 
immunohistology, infiltrating immune cells and additional IHC staining ( DKK1  and associated 
downstream elements, [e.g., β -caten in]). Although fresh biopsy is preferred, an archived 
specimen collected within 3  months of C1D1 may be acceptable, with the prior approval of the 
Medical Monitor.  
This basket study is enriching for activating β -catenin mutation s and/or Wnt signaling 
alterations, whereby approximately 50% of all evaluable patients enrolled in each group, in Stage 1 and in Stage 1 and 2 combined (Groups 1- 4) and in Groups 5 and 6, are required to have 
an activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other Wnt signaling alteration (e.g., 
LRP5/6, APC, AXIN1 /2, GSK3B, RNF43, ZNRF3, RSPO2/3 , FBXW7, ARID1A, or 
CBP/CREBBP ; see full list in Appendix 12.6), based on testing of the Screening tumor tissue 
sample or previously documented alteration by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments ( CLIA) -accredited laboratory.  
To allow -for real -time testing of Screening tumo r tissue samples, the Screening period may be 
extended to 42 days, with results obtained and confirmed to be positive before the performance of additional Screening procedures. Note that all other Screening assessments must be performed within 28 days before C1D1.  
Patients with prior documentation of a known activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 
mutation) or other Wnt signaling alteration by a CLIA -accredited laboratory will be permitted 
to enroll based on this documentation. In such patients, a Screening tumor sample will be 
collected and analyzed centrally; however, confirmatory results are not required for study enrollment.  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 15 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Groups 1- 4 employ a 2 -stage design conducted separately for each group. For each 
monotherapy group (Groups 1 and 3) , once 6 evaluable patients are enrolled who do not have 
activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling alterations, Stage 1 enrollment for that 
group will continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling 
alterations.  For Group 2, once 10 evaluable patients are enrolled who do not have activating 
β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling alterations, Stage 1 enrollment for that group will 
continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signalin g alterations. 
For combination therapy Group 4, once 8 evaluable patients are enrolled who do not have 
activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling alterations, Stage 1 enrollment for that 
group will continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt signaling 
alterations. At any time for Groups 1, 3, or 4, once 10 evaluable patients who do not have a documented activating β -catenin mutation and/or other Wnt signaling alteration have been 
enrolled in a group, enrollment in that group will continue only with patients with activating β -
catenin mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other identified Wnt signaling alteration. At any time for Group 2, once 15 evaluable patients who do not have a documented activating β -catenin 
mutation and/or other Wnt signaling alteration have been enrolled, enrollment in that group will continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other 
identified Wnt signaling alteration.  
3.2.2. Study Treatment Period  
The Study Treatment Phas e includes either DKN -01 monotherapy or DKN -01 in combination 
with paclitaxel; patients will be assigned to receive monotherapy or combination therapy at the Investigator’s discretion . Patient s who initially start combination therapy but subsequently 
disco ntinue paclitaxel may continue to receive DKN -01 as monotherapy during the Treatment 
Period.  
Patient s are to begin study treatment as soon as possible (and preferably within 24 hours) after 
completion of all screening procedures and confirmation of study e ligibility . Study visits will be 
performed as outlined in  Table 6.  
During the Treatment Period, tumor measurements are to be performed using the same  
radiographic methods used during Screening. Tumor response, including PD, is to be assessed by the Investigator within ± 7 days of the first study drug dose in every other cycle, starting in 
C3, and at the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit, using RECIST 1.1.  
The severity of adverse events ( AEs) will be graded according to the United  States  National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE ), version 5.0.  
3.2.3. Rollover Treatment Phase  
The Rollover Treatment Phase will permit patients  who are still experiencing clinical benefit 
continued access to study drug(s) until they meet discontinuation criteria as per Section 6.4.1. 
Study visits will be pe rformed as outline d in Table 7. 
 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 16 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  3.2.4. Study Treatment Discontinuation  
All patient s will continue study treatment in the Treatment Phase until development of 
radiographically -documented PD or unacceptable toxicity or another discontinuation criterion is 
met, as determined by the Investigator . All patient s will return for an EOT Visit ap proximately 
30 days ( +7 days) after the last treatment administration in the Treatment Period. The reason for 
discontinuation from study treatment will be documented in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF).  
3.2.5. Progressive Disease Follow -up Phase  
To ensure a ccuracy and completeness for the disease response -related endpoints, patient s who 
permanently discontinued study treatment prior to PD will continue to be followed up in the PD follow -up phase until radiographically documented PD. During this PD follow -up period, 
efficacy assessments for disease response and PD per RECIST 1.1 will be performed every 8 weeks [ see Table 6 ( Table 7 for Rollover Treatment Phase only) ]. Patient s are expected not to 
start any other anti -cancer therapy during the PD follow -up phase prior to radiographically 
documented PD; however, if alternate therapy is started, patient s will continue to be followed 
for radiologic progression even after starting subsequent therapy. After radiographically -
documented PD, all patients will be followed for survival in the Survival Follow -up Phase.  
3.2.6. Survival Follow -up Phase  
After discontinuation of treatment and documentation of PD, all patients will be followed in the Survival F ollow -up Phase for survival until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, 
implementation of the rollover treatment phase, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. Survival 
follow -up will occur 4 times per year (every 12 weeks  [±14 days]) after the EOT visit or end of 
PD follow -up phase, as applicable, and may be conducted via telephone or office visit. During 
survival follow -up, the following information will be collected: survival and subsequent anti -
cancer therapies.  
3.3. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opinion of the Investigator or Leap Therapeutics, Inc. (Leap) , there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification documenting 
the reason for study termination will be provided to the Investigator or Leap  by the terminating 
party .  
Circumstances  that may warrant termination of the study or discontinuation of a study site 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Determination  of unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the 
study.  
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate . 
• Failure to comply with pertinent regulations of appropriate regulatory authorities . 
• Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the Sponsor .

with the study drug(s) so that the situatio n can be assessed.  
5.6.1. DKN- 01 Administration  
DKN- 01 is a large molecular weight protein that will be administered at a dose of 300 mg 
(Groups 1- 4) and 600 mg (Groups 5 and 6)  as an IV infusion over a minimum of 30 minutes 
and up to a maximum of 2 hours on D1 a nd 15 of each 2 8-day cycle without interruption.  
5.6.2. Paclitaxel Administration  
For patient s receiving combination therapy, paclitaxel will be administered at a dose of 
80 mg/m2 via IV infusion over 1 hour on D1, 8, and 15 of each 28- day cycle according to 
standard clinical practice and as per the prescribing information ( Bristol- Myers Squibb 
Company, 2011).  
Standard of care premedication for paclitaxel will be given prior to each paclitaxel infusion 
(e.g., dexamethasone 20 mg PO 12 to 6 hours prior; diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 30 to 
60 minutes prior; and cimetidine or ranitidine 50 mg IV 30  to 60 minutes prior) ( Bristol -Myers 
Squibb Com pany, 2011).  
On D1 and 15 of each cycle, DKN -01 will be administered first followed by paclitaxel as 
separate infusions.  
For Groups 5 and 6, 3 patient s in each group will initially be enrolled  in a safety run -in phase . If 
the first 2 of 3 patients in a g roup have a DLT  (see Section  5.6.2.1) , the MTD will have been 
exceeded  (see Section 5.6.2.1)  and a cohort will be enrolled to evaluate DKN -01 at a dose of 
300 mg ( ±paclitaxel , depending on group assignment) . If none of the 3 treated patients in a  
group develop a DLT after a minimum of one cycle of treatment, enrollment into the group will proceed according to the planned schedul e. If a DLT is observed in 1 of the 3 patients  in a 
group, up to an additional 3 patients will be enrolled and treated. If no further DLTs are observed within the expanded group of 6, enrollment into the group will proceed . If ≥2 of 6 
patients within a  group experience a DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded and a cohort will 
be enrolled to evaluate DKN -01 at a dose of 300 mg ( ±paclitaxel , depending on group 
assignment) . 
5.6.2.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity Determination and Maximum Tolerated Dose / 
Recommended Phase 2 Dose Definition  
A DLT is defined as an AE during C1 that is possibly related to the study drug(s) and fulfills 
any one of the following criterion using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0.  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 5 days or Grade 3 or 4 neut ropenia with fever and/or 
infection

• Grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction to DKN -01 with or without premedication 
• Any Grade 5 AE  
• Any treatment -related AE that causes the patient to discontinue treatment during C1.  
A drug- related fever ≤ Grade 3 will not be considered a DLT. 
Patients in Group 6 must have completed 100% of the DKN -01 doses and 75% of the paclitaxel 
doses in C1 to be evaluable for DLT.  
Furthermore, in any study part, if a patient experiences a TEAE meeti ng the definition of DLT 
in the first cycle of treatment, he/she will be discontinued from study treatment.  
The MTD is defined as the highest tested dose level below the dose level at which a DLT is 
seen in 2 or more patients. 
The RP2D is defined as the MT D or up to the highest planned dose level evaluated in 
Groups  5-6 without identification of the MTD.

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  6. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
6.1. Criteria for Initiation of a New  Treatment Cycle 
A new cycle may be initiated for patients meeting the following criteria:  
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) resolved to baseline grade or ≤Grade 1 (≥1500/mm3). 
• Platelet count ≥ 75×109/L. 
• Liver associated enzymes/function (e.g., AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ], 
bilirubin ) ≤Grade 1 or resolved to baseline grade . 
• Any other drug- related  AEs that may have occurred resolved to ≤ Grade 1 severity  or 
baseline grade . 
If these conditions are not met on D1 of a new cycle, the patient  will be evaluated weekly and a 
new cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the toxicity has resolved as described above . 
The maximum treatment delay is 2 8 days prior to necessitating withdrawal from study.  
If, in the opinion of the I nvestigator, a patient is receiving clinical benefit from continued 
treatment with DKN- 01 alone or in combination with  paclitaxel , patients may continue therapy 
until developing documented PD or otherwise meeting criteria for treatment discontinuation  
(Section 6.4.1) .  
Patients for whom the I nvestigator decides it is in their best interest to stop DKN- 01 trea tment 
are discontinued and complete the EOT procedures . 
6.1.1. Criteria for Treatment on Days 8 and 15 of a Treatment Cycle  
Treatment may be administered on D8 and 15 for patients meeting the following criteria:  
• ANC ≥ 1000  cells/mm3. 
• Platelet count ≥ 75×109/L. 
• Liver associated biochemical abnormalities must resolve to ≤Grade 1 or baseline grade . 
Refer to Section 6.2.2 for instructions for paclitaxel dose modifications for the management of 
peripheral neuropathy as well as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia within a cycle.

6.2.1. DKN- 01 Dos ing and Dose Adjustments  
DKN- 01 will be administered via IV infusion on D1 and 15 in each  28-day treatment cycle .  
After the first occurrence of a toxicity necessitating withholding of study treatment, the 
Investigator may elect to restart DKN- 01 treatment for the patient at the previously received 
dose once th e toxicity resolves to ≤Grade  1 or baseline  grade . For subsequent recurrence of the 
toxicity, DKN- 01 treatment, per Investigator discretion,  may be resumed at the next lower dose 
after the toxicity resolves to ≤Grade  1 or baseline  grade  (see Table 1) .

*If the toxicity is judged to be significant in the opinion of the Investigator or the Investigator does not wish to dose at the same 
dosing level, he/she may contact the Medical Monitor to consider a one dose reduction level with the first occurrence of 
toxicity.  
Once a patient’s DKN- 01 dose has been reduced, no re -escalation to a previously received dose 
is allowed at any time during the study. Intra -patient dose escalation is not permitted at any time 
during the study.  
For patients who experience an infusion reaction to DKN- 01, all att empts should be made to 
obtain blood samples for determination of anti -DKN- 01 antibody (immunogenicity sample) and 
serum DKN- 01 levels as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the resolution of the 
event, and 30 days following the event or just prior to the start of new therapy, whichever 
comes first. In addition, these samples may be used for determination of PcD markers.  
DKN- 01-related adverse reactions and infusion reactions are to be managed as described in 
Appendix 12.5 and Appendix 12.4, respectively.  
6.2.2. Paclitaxel Dos ing and Dose Adjustments  
For patient s receiving combination therapy, paclitaxel is  administered via IV infusion on D1, 8, 
and 15 of each treatment cycle. The paclitaxel dose is to be modified for peripheral neuropathy and for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as de scribed in Table 3  and Table 4 , respectively .

(Days  1, 8, and 15 per cycle)  
Fourth  Discontinue  
*If the toxicity is judged to be significant in the opinion of the Investigator and the Investigator does not wish to dose at  the 
same dosing level, he/she may contact the Medical Monitor to consider a 1 dose reduction level with the first occurrence of 
toxicity.  
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, a patient is receiving clinical benefit from treatment with 
the combination of DKN -01 plus paclitaxel but has a compelling clinical reason after C2 to 
discontinue treatment with paclitaxel, the patient will b e permitted to continue in the study with 
DKN- 01 monotherapy at the discretion of the treating clinician. Patients can continue therapy 
until they meet criteria for discontinuation (Section  6.4.1).  
6.2.3. Dose Delays  
The start of a new cycle may be delayed up to 28  days ( for toxicities only) to allow sufficient 
time for recovery  from the previous cycle . Patients who do not  recover from toxici ty within 
28 days will be discontinued from the study and undergo EOT  procedures .  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 29 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Missed doses will not be made up.  
Supportive care use of transfusion for symptomatic anemia or hemoglobin <8 g/dL and of 
colony- stimulating factors for neutropenia is encou raged per established guidelines.  
A treatment delay at the start of a cycle (Day 1) of no more than 7  days, because of holidays, 
weekends, inclement weather, or other justifiable events, will be permitted and not considered  
as a protocol violation. If a delay of therapy is ≥28 days is necessary, the patient must be 
removed from the study.  
6.3. Duration of Study Participation and Treatment  
A patient’s duration of study participation will include a Screening Period, a Treatment Period of repeating 28- day cycles, and a Post -Treatment  Follow -up Period. The total duration of 
participation for a patient is dependent upon the patient’s response to treatment as well as toxicity to study drugs . If, in the opinion of the Investigator, a patient is receiving c linical 
benefit from treatment with the combination of DKN -01 plus paclitaxel but has a compelling 
clinical reason after C2 to discontinue treatment with paclitaxel, the patient will be permitted to continue in the study with DKN -01 monotherapy at the disc retion of the treating clinician. 
Patients can continue therapy until they meet criteria for discontinuation (Section  6.4.1).  
Patients enrolled in the rollover treatment phase will continue to receive the same dose and 
schedule of study drug(s) as per the previous study part.  
Upon discontinuing DKN- 01, patients undergo EOT assessments and are followed up for AEs 
for 30 days after the last DKN- 01 dose .  
After completion of the EOT visit, patient s without radiographically -documented PD will 
continue to be followed up in the PD follow -up phase until radiographically documented PD. 
During this PD follow -up period, efficacy assessments for disease response and  PD per RECIST 
1.1 will be performed every 8 weeks [see Table 6  or Table 7  (Rollover Treatment Phase only) ]. 
Patient s are expected not to start any other anti -cancer therapy during the PD follow -up phase 
prior to radiographically documented PD; however, if alternate therapy is started, patient s will 
continue to be followed for radiologic progression even after starting subsequent therapy.  
After discontinuation of treatment and documentation of PD, all patients will be followed in the 
Survival Follow -up Phase for survival until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, or 
closure of the study by the Sponsor. Survival follow -up will occur 4 times per year (every 12 
weeks [±14 days]) after the 30 days post treatment discontinuation visit or end of PD follow -up 
phase, as applicable, and may be conducted via telephone or office visit. During survival 
follow -up, the following information will be collected: survival and subsequent anti -cancer 
therapies.  
6.4. Withdrawal and Replacement of Patients  
6.4.1. Withdrawal from Treatment o r the Study 
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to their medical care . The Sponsor and Investigators also have the 
right to withdraw patients from the study .  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 30 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  All patien ts who withdraw from the study prematurely will undergo all EOT assessments. 
Regardless of the reason for withdrawal, efforts should be made to follow  safety events from the 
time of withdrawal through resolution or until the event stabilizes .  
Study drug should be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
• AEs/unacceptable toxicity justify ing treatment or study withdrawal. 
• Non-adherence to the study drug regimen or protocol requirements . 
• Non-compliance with instructions or failure to return for follow -up. 
• Investigator decides that study termination is in the patient’s best medical interest.  
• Lost to follow -up. 
• Enrollment in any other clinical study involving use of an investigational drug or device 
or enrollment in any other type of medical re search judged not to be scientifically or 
medically compatible with this study.  
• Availability of an open label extension study of DKN -01 trials , under which patients, 
who are participating in a study with DKN -01 and who in the opinion of the investigator 
are receiving clinical benefit could continue to receive access to DKN -01 as a 
monotherapy or in combination  
• Dosing delay of  ≥28 days . 
• Development of radiographically- documented PD , as determined by the Investigator 
using RECIST 1.1 ( Appendix 12.2) . 
• With the consent of the patient or the legally authorized representative the Investigator may determine that limited data collection may be continued (e.g., through medical record review) for the duration of the study after a patient has withdrawn. 
6.4.2. Replacement of Study Patients  
Patient s who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.  
6.5. Concomitant Medications, Therapies and Supportive Care  
No other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, or any other type of therapy (including herbal or natural supplements) for treatment of cancer or experimental drugs will be permitted while the patients are on this study. In addition, any disease progression requiring 
other forms of specific antitumor therapy will also necessitate discontinuation from the study. Appropriate documentation for all forms of premedications, supportive care, and concomitant medications must be captured on the case report form .  
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be gi ven throughout the study, 
including IV antibiotics to treat infections, growth factor support and blood components, etc . 
Additional care, including palliative radiotherapy (excluding target lesions and lesions representing progressive disease), may be admi nistered as indicated by the treating physician, 
patient’s medical need, and after discussion with the Medical Monitor .

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The Schedule of Assessments for the study is provided in Table 6  in Appendix 12.1. For the 
Rollover Treatment Phase of the study assessments are ou tlined in Table 7 in Appendix 12.1. 
Detailed descriptions of the study assessments to be conducted during this study are described  
in the following sub-sections.   
7.1. Clinical Procedures and Safety  Assessments  
7.1.1. Informed Consent  
A complete description of the study is to be presented to each potential study patient . Signed 
and dated informed consent is to be obtained before any study -specific procedures are 
performed.  
7.1.2. Inclusion /  Exclusion Criteria Review  
The inclusion and exclusion c riteria will be reviewed during the Screening Period as 
assessments are performed to confirm patient eligibility for the study . The criteria will be 
reviewed prior to administration of the first dose of study drug on C1D1 to confirm continue d 
study eligibility.  
7.1.3. Demographics , Medical and Disease History  
Demographic data and medical and disease histor ies will be obtained for all patients during the 
Screening Period. Demographic d ata to be recorded in the source document/ eCRF include s 
gender, race, and date of birth . Information on significant medical and surgical history  including 
dates, outcome, and whether or not ongoing or currently treated will be recorded . The date of 
original cancer diagnosis will be recorded along with a ny known cancer genomic s profile  
results and previous treatments , including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and use of 
blood products , including red cell and platelet transfusions and growth facto rs, within the 
previous 3 months . In addition, all other medications taken within 28 days of the initial 
Screening  visit will be recorded.  
The medical history will be reviewed prior to dosing on C1D1  to assess continued study 
eligibility  and adherence to final inclusion/exclusion criteria . This recent medical history 
includes a review for changes from Screening  as well as a review of the patient’s recent 
medication use to assess whether or not any changes have occurred since the previous study 
visit.  
7.1.4. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination  (general appearan ce, head/ears/eyes/nose/throat [HEENT] , 
lungs/chest, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, extremities, and neurological exam ination ) will be conducted at the time points designated in Table 6, (see Table 7 for 
Rollover Treatment Phase) . During Screening , the physical examination is to include 
measurement of heigh t. 
Abbreviated (i.e., symptom -directed) physical examinations will b e conducted at the time points 
designated in Table 6 (see Table 7 for Rollover Treatment Phas e) to address any complaints or 
concerns verbalized by the pati ent at all other study visits . 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 33 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  7.1.5. Vital Signs  and W eight  
Vital signs are to be measured at the time points designated in Table 6, (see Table 7 for 
Rollover Treatment Phase) . Vital signs to be measured include systolic and diastolic b lood 
pressure (mmHg; measured in the same arm), oral temperature (°C ), pulse (bpm), and 
respiration rate (breaths/minute).  
Weight  will be measured  on Day 1 of each treatment cycle and  at the EOT  visit. Body surface 
area (BSA) is to be calculated on Day 1 of each treatment cycle using the weight from that cycle 
and the Screening height measurement.  
7.1.6. Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at the time points designated in Table 6, (see Table 7 for 
Rollover Treatment Phase) . Additional ECGs may be obtained as clinically warranted and 
judged by the Investigator .  
Patients  must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG col lection and remain 
supine but awake during ECG collection.  
ECGs will be interpreted by a qualified physician ( the Investigator or qualified designee) at the 
site as soon after the time of ECG collection as possible, and ideally while the patient is still 
present,  to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria at the relevant visit(s) and for 
immediate patient management, should any clinically relevant findings be identified.  
If a clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified after enrollment, the Investigator  will assess the patient for symptoms (for example, palpitations, near 
syncope, syncope) to determine whether the patient  can continue in the study. The Investigator 
or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in patient  management is 
needed and must document  his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluation.  
The machine- read ECG intervals and heart rate may be used for data analysis and report writing 
purposes.  
7.1.7. Eastern C ooperative O ncology G roup Performance Status (ECOG PS)  
The ECOG PS (Oken et al. 1982) will be determined  at the time points designated in Table 6, 
(see Table 7  for Rollover Treatment Phase). Patients must have a n ECOG PS of 0 -1 to be 
enrolled into the study. Patients with an ECOG PS of 2 may be entered upon review and approval for study participation by the Medical Monitor.  
7.1.8. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Routine clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed locally by a certified laboratory selected for the study . Prior to starting the study, the Investigator will provide  copies of all 
laboratory certifications and normal ranges for all laboratory parameters to be assessed  by the  
local  laboratory. 
Refer to Section 6.1 and Section 6.1.1 for laboratory criteria required to initiate a new treatment 
cycle and for subsequent study drug doses within a cycles.  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 34 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical laboratory evaluations are to be performed  at the time points designated in Table 6 (see 
Table 7 for Rollover Treatment Phase). Final clinical laboratories are to be performed at the 
EOT visit.  
All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing will be followed up by repeat 
testing and further investigated ac cording to the judgment of the Investigator . 
The Investigator  must review all the patient’s laboratory reports in a timely manner. 
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report and must assess whether or not any abnormal test results are clinically significant. The Investigator must complete an appropriate AE form for any abnormal test results that are identified as clinically significant.  
Specific tests to be performed are described below:  
Hematology  
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte count (RBC), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MVHC), platelets, leukocytes ( WBC ) and differential [absolute 
counts of] neutrophils (segmented and banded), lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and 
basophils . Neutrophil -to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) also is to be determined.  It is acceptable to  
use the automated differential for complete blood count (CBC).  
Chemistry  
Sodium, potassium, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ALP , ALT, 
AST, blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) , creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), uric acid, calcium, glu cose 
(random), albumin, cholesterol, serum chloride, phosphorus , carbon dioxide, and total protein.  
Urinalysis  
Specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, and urine leukocyte esterase.  
Coagulation Studies  
PT, PTT, and INR.  
Pregnancy Testing  
Serum or urine pregnancy testing is to be performed for women of childbearing potential. If a urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. On C1D1, the pregnancy test may be performed within 72 hours before the study drug dose; the results must be available and confirmed to be negative before administration of the first study drug dose. Pregnancy testing is to be repeated during the study any time pregnancy is suspected.  
Pregnant and breastfeedi ng women must not take DKN -01; hence the study investigator may 
need to test to confirm that a patient is postmenopausal. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal ( defined as amen orrhea >12 consecutive months; or women with documented 
plasma follicle- stimulating hormone level >35µ lU/mL ). Women who are using oral, implanted 
or injectable contraceptive hormones, an intrauterine device, barrier methods (diaphragm, 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 35 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  condoms, spermicidal ) to prevent pregnancy, practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile 
(e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be of childbearing potential.  
CA 125 
Blood sample s for measurement of CA125 are to be collected at the time points designated in 
Table 6.  
Other Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Blood samples for measurement of vitamin D and thyroid -stimulating hormone are to be 
collected at the time points desi gnated in Table 6 . 
7.1.9. Concomitant Medication s / Procedures Review  
A review of concomitant medications and procedures will be conducted at each study visit . Any 
medications taken by study patients or concomitant procedures (e.g., transfusions, radiation, 
surgery, or other palliative care) are to be recorded in the e CRF and reviewed for compliance 
with protocol requirements .  
7.1.10. Adverse Event Monitoring 
Each patient must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs , including infusion-
related AEs (see Section 7.1.11) , throughout the study from signing of the informed consent  
through 30 days after the last dose of DKN- 01, when EOT procedures are performed . This 
information should be obtained in the form of non -leading questions (e.g., “How are you 
feeling?”), and from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, from lab oratory 
evaluation, observations of study personnel, patient diary , and spontaneous reports from 
patients.  
During post -treatment f ollow -up, any SAEs that the Investigator  consider s related to study 
treatment are to be reported.  
All AEs will be graded using  the NCI CTCAE , version 5.0, grading system  (available at:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_8.5x11.pdf ). The Investigator will assess and grade all  AEs . Details of AE 
monitoring and reporting are provided in Section  8 of this protocol . 
7.1.11. Medical Events of Interest  
The follow ing sections describe the assessment and management of DK N-01 infusion- related 
AEs. Details for the management an d assessment of these events are found in Appendi x 12.3 
and Appendix 12.4.  
7.1.11.1. Infusion -related Reactions 
The NCI  CTCAE, version  5.0, definition of infusion -related reactions will be used in this study 
(see Appendix 12.3), and any reactions will be  graded using the se same criteria.  The Sponsor or 
designee should be contacted immediately if questions arise concerning the grade of the reaction.  
Infusion -related  reactions are temporally associated with the infusion of DKN- 01 (≤24 hours 
post-infusion).  Symptoms occurring during or following infusion of study drug may also be 
defined according to AE categories such as allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, or cytokine release 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 36 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  syndrome. In the setting of symptoms occurring during or following infusion of investigational  
therapy, investigators are encouraged to use the AE term “In fusion- related reaction ” and any 
additional terms (including those not listed in the NC I CTCAE ) that best describe the event.  
For patients who experience an infusion reaction to DKN -01, all attempts should be made to 
obtai n blood samples for determination of anti -DKN- 01 antibody (immunogenicity sample) and 
serum DKN- 01 levels as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the resolution of the 
event, and 30 days following the event or just prior to the start of new ther apy, whichever 
comes first. In addition, these samples may be used for determination of PcD markers.  
Guidelines for the management of DKN- 01 infusion- related reactions are summarized in  
Appendix 12.4. 
7.2. Blood Sample Collection for Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and 
Exploratory Assessments 
Blood samples are to be collected for PK, PcD , and exploratory assessments as indicated in the 
following subsections at the time points designated in Table 6 . After processing of the samples 
for the protocol- specified assays, any remaining biologi cal material  (whole blood, serum, 
plasma) is to be stored for future exploratory analyses, as deemed appropriate. In the  rollover 
treatment phase  blood sample for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory 
assessments will not be collected . 
7.2.1. Blood Samp le Collection for DKK1  
Blood samples will be collected for determination of total DKK1 (includes DKK1/DKN -01 
complex) in serum at the time points designated in Table 6 . Free serum DKK1 levels may be 
estimated.  
Serum  levels of DKK1  will be measured using a validated Enzyme -linked Immunosorbent 
Assay (ELISA), designed to perform in the presence of DKN -01.  
7.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Blood samples  will be collected for the assessment of serum DKN -01 concentrations at the time 
points designated in Table 6. Instructions for the collection and handling of blood samples will be provided by the Sponsor. The actual date and time (24- hour clock time) of each sampling 
will be recorded.  
Serum concent rations of DKN -01 will be assayed using a validated method at a laboratory 
designated by the Sponsor.  
Prior to analysis, t he samples will be stored at a facility designated by the Sponsor.  
Bioanalytical samples collected to measure investigational product concentrations will be 
retained for a maximum of 1 year following last patient visit for the study.  
Any remaining serum from the samples collected for PK may be pooled and used for 
exploratory metabolism work , as deemed appropriate.  
7.2.3. Samples for Immunogen icity Research  
Blood samples will be collected for assessment of antibodies to DKN -01 (i.e., ADA) at the time 
points designated in Table 6. The blood sample collected for immunogenicity will be separated 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 37 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  into serum and divided into 2 tubes, one (A) for screening assay and the other (B) for storage 
for potential evaluation in a functional/cell -based assay.  
ADA will be assessed u sing a validated assay (Qualitative Affinity Capture Elution [ACE] 
ELISA) , which is tolerant to high concentrations of free drug (DKN -01).  
If any patient is found to be ADA -positive at the EOT visit, the patient will be monitored 
monthly (if feasible) until serum samples are determined to be ADA -negative.  
Samples may be stored for a maximum of 2 years following last patient visit for the study at a facility selected by the Sponsor to enable further analysis of immune responses to DKN -01. The 
duration allows the Sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to DKN -01.   
7.2.4. Samples for Exploratory Biomarkers  
Blood samples for exploratory biomarkers relevant to DKN -01 and/or the study indication will 
be collected at the time points specified in Table 6. 
Samples may be stored for a maximum of 2 years following last patient visit for the study at a 
facility selected by the Sponsor.   
7.3. Tumor Tissue Samples  
Fresh tumor tissue samples are required to be collected from all patients during Screening  for 
genomic cancer profiling (i.e., CTNNB1 mutation and Wnt -signaling mutation ). Although fresh 
biopsy is preferred, an archived specimen collected within 3 months of  study entry may be 
acceptable, with the prior approval of the Medical Monitor.  
Approximately 50% of all evaluable patients enrolled in each group , in Stage 1 and in Stage 1 
and 2 combined (Groups 1- 4) and in Groups  5 and 6, are required to have an activating 
β-catenin mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other Wnt signaling alteration  (e.g., LRP5/6, APC, 
AXIN1 /2, GSK3B, RNF43, ZNRF3, RSPO2/3 , FBXW7, ARID1A, or CBP/CREBBP ; see full 
list in Appendix 12.6) , based on testing of the Screening tumor tissue sample by a CLIA -
accredited laboratory.  Once 50% of evaluable patients without a documented β -catenin mutation 
or other Wnt signaling alteration have been enrolled within a group in Stage 1 (or in Stage 1 and 
2 combined, or in Groups 5 and 6) , then only patients with activating β -catenin mutation 
(CTNNB1 mutation) or other identified Wnt signaling alteration, based on testing of the Screening tumor tissue sample by a CLIA -accredited laboratory, will be eligible for enrollment 
in that group  (see Section 3.1 for details) . (To allow  for real- time testing of Screening tumor 
tissue samples, the Screening period may be extended to 42 days in such cases, with results obtained and confirmed to be positive before the performance of additional Screening procedures. Note that all other Screening assessments must be performed within 28 days before 
C1D1. )  
Patients with prior documentation of a known activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 
mutation) or other Wnt signaling alteration by a CLIA -accredited laboratory will be permitted 
to enroll based on this documentation. In such patients, a Screening tumor sample will be collected and analyzed centrally; however, confirmatory results are not required for study enrollment.  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 38 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Fresh tumor tissue samples also will be obtained from all patients at C 2D1 ±7 days . The same 
lesion biopsied during Screening is to be biopsied at C2D1  ±7. The t arget lesion (s) should not 
be biopsied. If a repeat biopsy is required during study participation, a sample of the biopsy will 
be submitted for evaluation.  
For patients who discontinue from the study prior to C2D1 , a tumor tissue sample is to be 
obtained at the EOT  visit.  
Exploratory analyses will include gene expression levels (i.e., RNA -Seq),  DKK1 expression 
(e.g., RNAscope in situ hybridization), immunohistology, infiltrating immune cells and 
additional IHC staining (e.g., DKK1 and associated downstream elements, [e.g., β -catenin]) on 
tumor tissue  relative to safety and efficacy outcomes.  
Tumor blocks or partial bl ocks will be sectioned and may be returned to the I nvestigator at last 
patient s visit or before if requested .  
The samples will be coded with the patient number and stored for up to a maximum 15 years after the last patient visit for the study at a facilit y selected by the S ponsor . The samples and any 
data generated from them can only be linked back to the patient by Investigator  site personnel . 
The duration allows the Sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to the study drug. 
Samples will be destroyed according to a process consistent with local regulation.  
7.4. Efficacy and Response Assessments 
Response and evaluation of PD will be determined according to RECIST  v 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 
2009) (Appendix 12.2) . Refer to the Schedule of Assessments [Table 6, (see Table 7 for Rollover 
Treatment Phase) ] for details regarding the timing of specific efficacy measu res.  
For baseline tumor measurements, all sites of disease should be imaged by computed tomography (CT)/positron emission tomography (PET). With the approval of the Medical Monitor, if the anatomic region cannot be adequately imaged by CT/PET, CT or MRI m ay be 
used instead. Baseline imaging studies may be performed within 28 days before C1D1.  
Tumor measurements are to be repeated within ± 7 days of the first study drug dose in every 
other cycle, starting in C3, and at the EOT visit ( ±7 days) until radiographically documented 
PD. Repeat assessments should use the same radiographic methods as used at baseline  
(Appendix 12.2) .  
To confirm objective responses, all lesions should be radiologically assessed, and the same 
radiologic method used for the initial response determination should be repeated at a minimum 
of 4 weeks following the initial observation of an objective response, usi ng the sample method 
that was used at baseline . If a patient is discontinued from the study, repeat radiology 
assessments may be omitted if clear clinical signs of progressive disease are present.  
7.5. Post-Treatment Follow -up and Mortality Assessments  
After co mpletion of the EOT visit, patient s without radiographically -documented PD will 
continue to be followed up in the PD follow -up phase until radiographically documented PD. 
During this PD follow -up period, efficacy assessments for disease response and PD per  RECIST 
1.1 will be performed every 8 weeks [see Table 6  (see Table 7 for Rollover Treatment Phase) ]. 
Patient s are expected not to start any other anti -cancer t herapy during the PD follow -up phase 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 39 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  prior to radiographically documented PD; however, if alternate therapy is started, patient s will 
continue to be followed for radiologic progression even after starting subsequent therapy.  
After discontinuation of treatment and documentation of PD, all patients will be followed in the 
Survival Follow -up Phase for survival until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, 
implementation of the rollover treatment phase, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. Survival  
follow -up will occur 4 times per year (every 12 weeks [±14 days]) after the 30  days post 
treatment discontinuation visit or end of PD follow -up phase, as applicable, and may be 
conducted via telephone or office visit. During survival follow -up, the following information 
will be collected: survival and subsequent anti -cancer therapies.  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 40 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1. Definitions, Documentation, and Reporting  
8.1.1. Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laborat ory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality . An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and from any route of admi nistration, formulation, or dose, 
including an overdose.  
The Investigator is required to provide appropriate information concerning any findings that suggest significant hazards, contraindications, side effects,  or precautions pertinent to the safety 
of the drug under investigation.  
In addition to collecting the AE verbatim and the NCI CTCAE severity grade, AE verbatim text will also be mapped by the Sponsor or designee to corresponding terminology within the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Me dDRA).  
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug should be reported. Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and 
drug safety evaluation.  
8.1.2. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is considered to be serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death.  
• Life-threatening . Life -threatening means that the patient  was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occu rred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . Hospitalization 
admissions and/or surgical operations sch eduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient  was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study ( e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical event . An important medical event is an even t that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered an SAE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or patient  
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes listed in 
the definitions for SAEs . Examples of such medical events include allergic 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 41 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study. 
Planned hospitalizations or elective procedures for underlyin g preexisting conditions that are 
already recorded in the patient’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be 
considered SAEs . Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization without a precipitating 
clinical AE (for example, for the administration of study therapy or other protocol -required 
procedure) should not be considered SAEs.  
8.2. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs  and SAE s 
Each patient  must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs . This information 
should be obt ained in the form of non -leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and 
from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, patient diaries, and spontaneous reports from patients.  
All AE s (serious and non -seriou s) spontaneously reported by the patient  and/or in response to 
an open question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the e CRF . Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the e CRF . When possible, 
signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one 
comprehensive event.  
Study site personnel must alert Leap  or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of Investigator 
awareness of the event via a Leap -approved method. Alerts issued via telephone are to be 
immediately followed with official notification on study- specific SAE forms . The AEs which 
are serious and unexpected, and assessed as at least possibly related to study drug ( possibl y or 
related) will be reported to the regulatory authority by Leap , or it’s designee in accordance with 
21 CFR § 312.32. Patients will be monitored for AEs from signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF ) to 30 days after the last dose of DKN- 01.  
All SAEs that occur during the course of the  study must be reported by the Investigator  within 
24 hours from the point i n time when the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE (Contact 
information will be provided by Leap  or its designee).  
All SAEs must be reported whether or not considered causally related to the study drug. SAE forms will be completed  and the information collected will include patient number, a narrative 
description of the event and an assessment by the Investigator as to the intensity of the event and relatedness to study drug. Follow -up information on the SAE may be requested by the 
Sponsor or designee.  
Certain SAEs require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC). If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug experiences associated with the use of the study drug, Leap  or designee will notify the 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 42 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating Investigator s on an expedited basis . It is 
the responsibility of the Investigator to promptly notify the IRB/IEC of all unexpected serious 
adverse drug experiences associated with the use of the study drug. 
For both serious and non- serious  AEs , the Investigator must determine both the intensity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
Intensity of all AEs , including cli nically significant treatment- emergent laboratory 
abnormalities and potential systemic reactions, will be graded according to the NCI  CTCAE , 
version 5.0 (available at:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_
Reference_8.5x11.pdf ). For AEs without matchi ng terminology within the NCI  CTCAE , 
version 5.0, criteria, the Investigator will be responsible for selecting the appropriate system 
organ class and assessing severity grade based on the intensity of the event . Note that both 
CTCAE term (actual or coded) and severity grade must be selected by study site personnel and collected in the eCRF . This collection is in addition to verbatim text used to describe the AE.  
The CTCAE grade refers to the severity of the AE and ranges from Grade 1 (mild AE), Grade 2 (moderate AE), Grade 3 (severe AE) and Grade 4 (life- threatening or disabling AE) to Gra de 5 
(death related to AE).  
AEs not listed by the CTCAE will be graded as follows:  
• Mild : discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity.  
• Moderate : discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity.  
• Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
• Life threatening :  represents an immediate threat to life.  
• Death  
Relationship  to study drug administration will be determined by the Investigator according to the 
following criteria.  
• Not Related : No relationship can be established between the event and the 
administration of study drug. The event is related to other etiologies, such  as 
concomitant medications or patient’s clinical state.  
• Possible :  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug and follows a pattern to the suspected study drug. The event recurs on re -
challenge . The event i s not commonly associated with drug exposure but is also 
uncommon in the patient population. The reaction might have been produced by the 
patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• Related :  A reaction that is known to be strongly associated with drug exposure . A 
temporal relationship can be established between the administration of study drug and the event . The reaction cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of 
the patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs that are classified as having a possible or related relationship to study drug will be considered treatment- related events.  
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 43 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  SAEs occurring after a patient has received the study drug will be collected for 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug, regardless of the Investigator’s opinion of causation. Thereafter, SAEs are not required to be reported unless the Investigator feels the events we re related to either the 
study drug or a protocol procedure.  
Progressive disease ( PD) will be documented in the eCRF intended to capture tumor response 
and PD , and will be analyzed accordingly. Signs and symptoms related to PD should be 
reported in the appropriate eCRF as either an AE or SAE. Verbatim terms such as “disease progression” or “progressive disease” etc. should not be reported as AEs or SAEs unless the Investigator  considers the progression to be atypical, accelerated or caused by the study drug. 
Similarly, for deaths occ urring as a result of PD during the study or until 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug is administered, the sign or symptom with an outcome of death should be reported on the AE and SAE pages: the verbatim term of “death” should not be used on the AE  
or SAE forms as the event . Additional information pertaining to the death should be reported on 
the eCRF intended to capture death information.  
8.3. Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded starting at time of patient consent  up to and including 30 days 
after administration of the last dose of DKN- 01. All AEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
Any SAE that occurs at any time after the EOT  procedures are performed, which the 
Investigator considers to be related to study drug, must be reported to Leap  or designee. 
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly report to Leap  or its designee via e CRF the circumstances and data 
leading to any such dosage reduction or discontinuation of treatment.  
All AEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
Patient s will be evaluated for AEs at each visit . Each patient will be instructed to call his or her 
physician to report any AEs between visits . Study site personnel will record th e occurrence and 
nature of each patient’s preexisting conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study.  
After the ICF is signed, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs . All AEs related to protocol procedures will be reported to 
Leap  or designee . Any clinically significant findings from ECGs, laboratory, or vital sign 
measurements that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Leap  or its  designee. Investigators 
will be instructed to report to Leap  or its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness 
of each AE to protocol procedure, study drug, and/or drug delivery system via designated data transmission methods.

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  9. STATISTICAL CON SIDERATIONS  
9.1. Sample Size Determination  
This is a proof -of-concept basket study designed primarily to seek information on the safety, 
PK, and efficacy of DKN -01 in combination with paclitaxel and as DKN -01 monotherapy in 
patients with recurrent  EOC or EEC with and without activating β -catenin mutation and/or Wnt 
signaling alterations , or carcinosarcoma (MMMT) . A maximum of 124 evaluable pat ients 
(combination regimen plus monotherapy regimen) will be enrolled in the study. This is an 
exploratory open- label study with 6 groups. Groups 1- 4 employ a 2- stage study design 
conducted separately for each group. Up to 21 evaluable patients are enrolled in each of 
Groups  1, 3, and 4 and up to 31 evaluable patients in Group 2. Groups 5 and 6 are exploratory 
in nature and will have up to 10 and 20 evaluable patient s enrolled  and dosed at the RP2D , 
respectively.  
The sample sizes for Groups 5 and 6  are based on practical considerations and clinical 
judgement to obtain sufficient information on the safety, initial clinical effectiveness, and PK data in the carcinosarcoma groups at a DKN- 01 dose exceeding 300 mg.  
The sample size of Groups 1 through 4 employ a 2-stage study design and were calculated as 
follows : For each monotherapy group (Groups 1 and 3) after 12 evaluable patients are enrolled 
(Stage 1), an additional 9  evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 1 or more 
patients respond ( i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are no responses in Stage 1, then 
preliminary anti -tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be 
enrolled in that group. If the group continues to Stage 2, a total of 21 evaluable patients  will be 
studied for that group. The group will be considered successful if ≥3 treated patients respond. 
This design is applied to each monotherapy group separately and is based on a 2- stage Simon 
Minimax design for a total of 21 evaluable patients (null h ypothesis that ORR ≤5% versus the 
alternative hypothesis that ORR ≥20% with alpha=0.080 and power=0.803).  
For combination therapy Group 2, after 20 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an 
additional 11 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 3 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are fewer than 3 responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be 
enrolled in that group. If the group continues to Stage 2, a total of 31 evaluable patients will be studied for that group. The group will be considered successful if ≥6 treated patients respond. This design is applied to combination therapy Group 2 separately and is based on a 2- stage 
Simon Minimax design for a total of 31 evaluable patients (null hypothesis that ORR ≤12% versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR ≥25% with alpha=0.150 and power=0.802). 
For combination therapy Group 4, after 16 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an 
additional 5 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 2 or more patients 
respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are fewer than 2 responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be 
enrolled in that group. If the group continues to Stage 2, a total of 21 evaluable patients will be studied for that group. The group will be considered successful if ≥4 treated patients respond. This design is applied to combination t herapy Group 4 separately and is based on a 2- stage 
Simon Minimax ( Simon 1989) design for a total of 21 evaluable patients (null hypothesis that 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 45 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  ORR ≤10% versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR  ≥25% with alpha=0.149 and 
power=0.803).  
There are no formal comparisons planned between groups. Any statistical results will be 
interpreted in the perspective of the exploratory nature of the study.  
9.2. Randomization  
There is no randomization in this open -label Phase 2 study.  
9.3. Populations  for Analy sis 
Several  study populations will be used for analysis , as follows : 
• Evaluable Analysis Set (EAS): All patient s who received any amount of DKN -01 and 
have at least one evaluable post -baseline RECIST tumor response assessment or were 
discontinued due to toxicity. The EAS will be the primary population for analyses of ORR, ODCR, PFS,  DoR, DoCR,  DoCB, and TTP.  
• Full analysis set (FAS): All enrolled patients who receive any amount of DKN -01. The 
FAS will be used for analys es of OS, TTTF, sensitivity analysis of select tumor -related 
endpoints, and exploratory endpoints. 
• Safety population, defined as all enrolled patients who receive any amount of study treatment (either DKN -01 or paclitaxel) . All safety analyses will be based on this 
population. The safety population and FAS are identical, unless a patient received paclitaxel but did not receive DKN -01. 
• A Per -Protocol (PP) subset may also be used to analyze select efficacy endpoints and 
will be based on study drug exposure (c ompliance and/or time on study drug) and major 
protocol deviations. The criteria for inclusion in the PP subset will be finalized and documented. The PP set will be defined and finalized separately for each group. 
• PK Analysis Set: All enrolled patients who  receive at least a single dose of DKN- 01 and 
have sufficient data to determine PK parameters.  
9.4. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused and Spurious Data  
The procedures for handling missing, unused, or spurious data, along with the detailed method for analysis of each variable, transformations, and exploratory analyses will be presented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.5. Interim Analyses  
Interim analyses will be conducted after Stage 1 for Groups 1- 4. No interim analyses are planned 
for Groups 5 and 6. For each monotherapy group (Groups 1 and 3), after 12 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an additional 9  evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) 
if 1 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are no res ponses, then 
preliminary anti -tumor activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be 
enrolled in that group.  
For combination therapy Group 2, after 20 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an additional 11 evaluable patients will  be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 3 or more patients respond (i.e., 
Clinica l Study Protocol DEK -DKK1 -P204 _ 01 July 2020 page 46 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  experience CR or PR). If there are fewer than 3 responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -tumor 
activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be enrolled in that group. 
For combination therapy Group 4, after 16 evaluable patients are enrolled (Stage 1), an additional 
5 evaluable patients will be enrolled in that group (Stage 2) if 2 or more patients respond (i.e., experience CR or PR). If there are fewer than 2  responses in Stage 1, then preliminary anti -tumor 
activity in the group will be rejected and no further patients will be enrolled in that group.  
9.6. Statistical Methods  
9.6.1. General Methods  
Summaries will be tabulated for each group and within each group, where ap plicable, by 
presence of Wnt signaling alterations and/or CTNNB1 activating mutations. Select ed 
parameters may also be summarized by dose and will be detailed in the SAP.

9.6.4. Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data will be summarized for each group . Select ed summaries may also be done w ithin 
each group, as applicable,  by presence of Wnt signaling alterations and/or CTNNB1 activating 
mutations , and by subgroups as described in the SAP.  
All efficacy endpoints are secondary for Group 5 and Group 6. 
9.6.4.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis  (Groups 1- 4) 
For the purpose of the 2 -stage design in Groups 1 -4, the ORR is considered the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with BOR of PR or CR according to 
RECIST  1.1. The proportion of patients with ORR in the EA S, along with a 95% CI, based on 
the Clopper -Pearson interval, will be reported. Secondary analyses of ORR described above 
may be repeated in FAS, treating missing BOR as a non- responder. ORR at each visit and best 
overall response will also be summarized using the EAS. Secondary analyses of ORR may be repeated in the PP set.  
9.6.4.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Analysis  (Groups 1- 4) 
Secondary efficacy variables in the study include:  
• Objective disease control rate (ODCR)  is defined as the percentage of patient s with 
BOR of CR, PR, or SD. The analysis of ODCR will be performed using the EAS and conducted in the same manner as ORR. Similar to ORR, analysis of ODCR may be repeated in the FAS and PP set.  
• Overall survival (OS)  is defined as the time from first dose of study drug until date of 
death due to any cause. Patients without documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored as of the date the patient was last known to be alive, or the data cut -off 
date, whichever is earlier. Overall survival (OS ) will be performed in the FAS using 
Kaplan -Meier methods.  
• Progression -free survival (PFS)  is defined as time from first dose of study drug to first 
documentation of PD (per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. Analysis of PFS will be performed in the EA S and may be repeated in the FAS and PP set.  
Patients who do not experience PD and are alive will be censored at the time of last evaluable tumor assessment. Patients who do not experience PD and start new anti -
cancer therapy will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment on or prior to the time the new anti- cancer therapy. For analyses conducted in the FAS, patients with no 
evaluable post -baseline tumor assessments will be censored at the time of receipt of first 
study drug. Patients who are lost to follow -up for assessment of PD will be censored at 
their last evaluable tumor assessment. Additional details for censoring will be specified in the SAP and will be based on the Food and Drug Administration, Guidance for Industry: Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics, dated May 2007. The analysis of PFS will be based on Kaplan- Meier methods.

assessment. Patients who do not experience disease progression and start new anti -
cancer therapy will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment on or prior to the 
time the new anti- cancer therapy was begun. For analyses conducted in the FAS, 
patients with no evaluable post -baseline tumor assessments will be censored at the time 
of rec eipt of first study drug. Patients who are lost to follow -up for assessment of PD 
will be censored at their last evaluable tumor assessment. Additional details for censoring will be specified in the SAP. The analysis of TTP will be based on Kaplan -Meier me thods.  
• Duration of response (DoR)  includes patients with an objective disease response (PR or 
CR) and is defined as the time from the first tumor assessment that supports the patient’s objective disease response to the time of PD or death due to any cause. Patients who do not experience PD or death at the time of analysis will be censored using the same rules as described for PFS. The analysis of DOR will be performed in the E AS using Kaplan-
Meier methods.  
• Duration of CR (DoCR)  includes patients with a CR a nd is otherwise defined and 
analyzed similarly to DoR. 
• Duration of clinical benefit  (DoCB) includes patients with a BOR of CR, PR, or SD 
and is defined as the time from the first tumor assessment of CR, PR or SD to the time 
of PD or death due to any cause. Patients who do not experience PD or death at the time of analysis will be censored using the same rules as described for PFS. The analysis of 
DoCB will be performed in the EAS using Kaplan -Meier methods.  
• Time to treatment failure (TTTF) is defined as time from first dose of study drug to discontinuation of DKN -01 for any reason including PD, t oxicity, and death. Patients 
without documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored as of the date the patient was last known to be alive, or the data cut -off date, whichever is earlier. Time to 
treatment failure (TTTF) will be performed in the FAS using Kaplan- Meier methods.  
9.6.4.3. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Analysis (Groups 5- 6) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints in each independent study group (Groups 5- 6) are:

1 To allow -for real -time testing of Screening tumor tissue samples, the Screening period may be extended to 42 days in such cases, with results obtained and confirmed to be 
positive before the performance of additional Screening procedures. A ll other Screeni ng assessments must be performed within 28 days before C1D1.  
2 After completion of Cycle 2 , subsequent D8 visits can be conducted over the phone with patients in the m onotherapy groups.  
3 Imaging studies, tumor assessments, and disease response assessment should be performed as scheduled every 8 weeks (± 7 days) following first dose of study therapy until 
radiographically -documented progression of disease, even if therapy is delayed. PD Follow -up phase only applies to patients who discontinue study treatment without 
documented PD.  
4 All patients will be followed in the Survival Follow -up phase for survival until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, implementation of the rollover treatment 
phase, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. Long -term follow -up will occur 4 times per year (every 12 weeks  ±14 days ) after the 30 days post treatment discontinuation 
visit or PD follow -up phase discontinuation visit, as applicable.  
5 Cancer treatment history is to include documentation of prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and use of blood products, including red cell and platelet 
transfusions and growth factors within the previous 3 months.  
6 Note that fresh tumor tissue samples are required to be collected from all patients during Screening for genomic cancer profiling. Although fresh biopsy is preferred, an archived specimen collected within 3 months of study entry may be acceptable, with the prior approval of the Medical Monitor.   
7 This basket study will enrich for Wnt sign aling alterations whereby approximately 50% of all patients enrolled require an activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) 
or other Wnt signaling alteration (e.g., LRP 5/6, APC, A XIN1/2 , GSK3B, RNF43, ZNRF3, RSPO2 /3, FBXW7 , ARID1A, or CBP/CREBBP ; see f ull list in Appendix 12.6).  
Once 50% of patients (i.e., 10  patients) without a documented β -catenin or other Wnt signaling alteration have been enrolle d within a group , enrollment in that group will 
continue only with patients with activating β -catenin mutation (CTNNB1 mutation) or other identified Wnt signaling alteration.  
8 Fresh tumor tissue samples will be obtained from all patients at C2D1 ±7 days . The same lesion biopsied during Screening is to be biopsied a t C2D1 ±7 days. The target 
lesion (s) should not be biopsied. If a repeat biopsy is required during study participati on, a sample of the biopsy will be submitted for evaluation. Patients who discontinue 
prior to the C2D1  visit are to have a biopsy performed at the EOT visit. Exploratory analyses will include tumor genetics, gene expression levels (e.g., RNA -Seq), DKK1 
expression (e.g. , RNAscope in situ hybridization), immunohistology, infiltrating immune cells and additional IHC staining to evaluate DKK1 and DKK1 associated 
downstream elements (e.g., β-catenin) on tumor tissue  relative to safety and efficacy outcomes . If a repeat biopsy is required during study participation, a sample of the 
biopsy will be submitted for evaluation.   
9 Hematology includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte count (RBC), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin concentrati on (MCHC ), leukocytes (WBC), 
neutrophils, segmented and banded, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets. It is accept able to use the automated differential  for complete blood count 
(CBC). Coagulation studies include prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR ).  
10 If Screening safety laboratory tests are obtained ≤72 hours of C1D1 to confirm eligibility, safety labs should be repeated on C1D 1 but do not need to be resulted prior to 
dosing. If S creening laboratory tests are obtained ≥72 hours prior to C1D1, then all safety laboratory tests need to be repeated on C1D1 t o confirm eligibility.  All pre -
treatment laboratory tests are to be obtained with 24- 48 hours of D1 dosing.  
11 Clinical chemistry includes sodium, potassium, total and direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ALP, ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, creatine 
kinase, uric acid, calcium, glucose (random), albumin, cholesterol, serum chloride, phosphorus, carbon dioxi de, and total protein.  
12 Urinalysis includes specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, and leukocyte esterase.  
13 Serum or urine pregnancy testing is to be performed for women of childbearing potential. If a urine test is positive or canno t be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy 
test will be required. On C1D1, the pregnancy test may be performed within 72 hours before the study drug dose; the results m ust be available and confirmed to be negative 
before administration of the first study drug dose. Pregnancy testing is to be repeated during the study any time pregnancy is suspected.  
14 Blood samples for serum PK are to be collected  on C1D1 pre -infusion,  post-infusion,  and then 24 hours (1 day), and 168 hours (7 days) post -infusion. Thereafter, such 
samples are to be collected pre - and post -infusion on D1 of each cycle and a final sample is to be collected at the EOT visit . Please use the following windows  when 
scheduli ng blood sample s for PK: C1D1 pre -infusion: - 60-minute window; C1D1 post infusion: ± 5-minute window; 24 hours (1 day): random draw during Day 2; 
168 hours (7 days): ±  1 day ; C1D15 pre -infusion: -60 minute window  
Clinical Study Proto col DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page 63 
CONFIDENTIAL    Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  15 Blood samples for serum ADA/immunogenic ity are to be collected pre -infusion on C1D 1, and then pre -infusion  on D1 of every other cycle beginning with C3 (C5, C7, C9, 
etc) and at the EOT visit . If any patient is found to be ADA -positive at the EOT visit, the patient will be monitored monthly (if feasible) until serum samples are determined 
to be ADA-negative. If a patient has an infusion reaction, all attempts should be made to obtain an immunoge nicity and PK sample as close to the onset of the event as 
possible, at the resolution of the event and 30 days following the event.    
16 For patients receiving combination therapy, s tudy drug is to be administered in the following order:  premedications  DKN-01  paclitaxel.  
17 Premedication for paclitaxel (will be given prior to each paclitaxel infusion as per local standard of care. Suggested premed ications include dexamethasone 20 mg orally 
[PO] 12 to 6 hours prior; diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 min utes prior; and cimetidi ne or ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior) or equivalents.  
18 DKN-01 will be administered IV over a minimum of 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 2 hours given on days 1 and 15 of each cycle w ithout interruption plus paclitax el 
administered IV over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle according to standard clinical practice . Standard of care premedication for paclitaxel will be given 
prior to DKN -01. For patients receiving combination therapy, DKN-01 will be administered first followed by paclitaxel.  
19 Baseline imaging studies may be performed within 28 days before C1D1. For baseline tumor measurements, all sites of disease s hould be imaged by CT/PET. With the 
approval of the Medical Monitor, if the anatomic region cannot be adequately imaged by CT/PET, CT or MRI may be used instead. Tumor measurements are to be repeated 
within ±7 days of the first study drug dose in every other cycle, starting in C3, and at the EOT Visit until radiographically documented progression of disease. Repeat 
assessments should use the same radiographic methods as used at Baseline.  
20 Disease response is to be assessed by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al., 2009) within ±7 days of the first study drug dose in every other cycle, starting in 
Cycle 3 and at the EOT  Visit following first dose of study therapy until radiographically documented PD .

kinase, uric acid, calcium, glucose (random), albumin, cholesterol, serum chloride, phosphorus, carbon dioxide, and total protein.  All pre -treatment laboratory tests are to be 
obtained with 24 - 48 hours of D1 dosing.  
7 Urinalysis includes specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, and leukoc yte esterase.  All pre -treatment laboratory tests are to be obtained with 24-  48 hours of 
D1 dosing.  
8 Serum or urine pregnancy testing is to be performed for women of childbearing potential. If a urine test is positive or canno t be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy 
test will be required. Pregnancy testing is to be repeated during the study any time pregnancy is suspected.  
9 For patients receiving combination therapy, study drug is to be administered in the following order:  premedications  DKN-01  paclitaxel.  
10 Premedication for paclitaxel (will be given prior to each paclitaxel infusion as per local standard of care. Suggested premed ications include dexamethasone 20 mg orally 
[PO] 12 to 6 hours prior; diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior ; and cimetidine or ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior) or equivalents.  
11 DKN-01 will be administered IV over a minimum of 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 2 hours given on days 1 and 15 of each cycle w ithout interruption plus paclitaxel 
adminis tered IV over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle according to standard clinical practice. Standard of care premedication for paclitaxel will be given 
prior to DKN -01. For patients receiving combination therapy, DKN -01 will be administered fir st followed by paclitaxel.  
12 Tumor measurements are to be repeated within ±7 days  every 12 weeks , and at the EOT Visit until radiographically documented progression of disease. Repeat assessments 
should use the same radiographic methods as used at Baselin e.  
13 Disease response is to be assessed by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al., 2009) within ±7 days every 12 weeks a nd at the EOT Visit following first dose of 
study therapy until radiographically documented PD.

 Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  12.2. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Reference Guide  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria 
proposed in:  Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. 2009. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Eur J Can cer 45:228 -247. 
Eligibility  
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where ORR is the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is defined as the presence of at least one measurable lesion.  
Methods of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
• CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment . MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans 
but not for lung). 
• Lesions on a chest X -ray may be considered measurable lesions if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  
• Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
• Ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  
• Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.  
• Cytology and histology can be used in rare cases (e.g., for evaluation of residual masses to differentiate between Partial Response [PR] and Complete Response [CR] or evaluation of new or enlarging effusions to differentiate between Progressive Disease [PD] and Response/Stable Disease [SD]).  
Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy is not advised. However, they can be used to confirm complete pathological response.  
Baseline Disease Assessment  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
Measurable Lesions - Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
Clinical Study Proto col DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page 67 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  • 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm; when CT scans have 
slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum size should be twice the slice thickness).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non - measurable).  
• 20 mm by chest X -ray 
• Malignant lymph nodes  
- To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 
mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness is 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the 
short axis will be measured and followed.  
- Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic  lesions with identifiable soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
or MRI can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability described above. 
- ‘Cystic lesions ’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
Non-Mea surable Lesions -  Non -measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
as well as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable inc lude: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam ination  that is not measurable by reproducible  imaging techniques.  
Blastic bone lesions  are non- measurable.  
Lesions with prior local treatment , such as those situated in a previously irradiated area or in 
an area subjected to other loco -regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless 
there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions 
- All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  
- Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, as well as their suitability for reproducible repeated measurements.  
- All measurements should be recorded in metric notation using calipers if clinically assessed.  
Clinical Study Proto col DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page 68 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions)  for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters, which will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. If lymph nodes are to be included in t he sum, only the short axis will contribute.  
Non-Target Lesions 
All lesions (or sites of disease) not identified as target lesions, including pathological lymph nodes and all non- measurable lesions, should be identified as non- target lesions and be recorded 
at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required and they should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases, ‘unequivocal progression’. 
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum of diameters . 
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm . 
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD. 
Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions 
• Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. When lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <10 mm.  
• Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very small. However, sometimes lesions or lym ph 
nodes become so faint on a CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’, in which case a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  
• Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. When non- nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between  them may be 
maintained that would aid in obtaining m aximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.

CONFIDENTIAL   
 Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response 
(CR)  • Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
levels. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short 
axis)  
Non-CR/Non -PD • Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease 
(PD) • Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
• When patient has measurable disease. To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ 
on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in presence of 
SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy . A modest ‘ increase’ in the 
size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status  
• When patient has only non -measurable disease. There is no measurable 
disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non -
measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non -target disease cannot 
be easily quantified, a useful test that can be applied is to consider if the 
increase in overall disease burden based on change in non -measurable 
disease is comparab le in magnitude to the increase that would be required 
to declare PD for measurable disease. Examples include an increase in a 
pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’ or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread progression status.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression:  
• The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e., not attributable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor, especially when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial 
or complete response).  
• If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly  new disease. If  repeat scans 
confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
• A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned 
at baseline is considered a new lesion and disease progression.  
It is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of fludeoxyglucose -positron emission 
tomography ( FDG- PET)  scanning to complement CT in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified 
according to the following algorithm:  
Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG- PET at follow -up is PD based on a new 
lesion.  
Clinical Study Proto col DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page 70 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: 
• If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
CT, this is PD.  
• If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a  new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET scan).  
• If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corre sponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
Time Point Response 
A summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline is presented in Table 1 below.

PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR = complete response; PR – partial response; SD – stable disease; PD = progressive disease; NE – unevaluable  
When patients have non- measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table 2 is to be used.

Unequivocal PD  Yes or No  PD 
Any Yes PD 
CR = complete response; PR – partial response; SD – stable disease; PD = progressive disease; NE – unevaluable .  
1 Non-CR / non-PD is preferred over ‘Stable Disease’ for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials. To assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.  
Clinical Study Proto col DEK -DKK1 -P204_01 July 2020 page 71 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  Confirmation  
In non- randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR is 
required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. This will also 
permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has traditionally required confirmation in such trials.  
However, in all other circumstances, (i.e., in randomized Phase 2 or 3 trials or studies where 
stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints), confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination of the requirement for response confirmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular in studies, which are not blinded.  
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6 –8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.  
Missing Assessments and Unevaluable  Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.  
If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also 
considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned ti me point 
response. This would most likely happen in the case of PD. 
Criteria for Continuing Treatment after Evidence of Progressive Disease by RECIST 1.1  
Radiologic tumor flare, which is not defined in RECIST 1.1, has been observed in patients 
undergoing t reatment ( Hales et al., 2010). Thus, patients who have evidence of clinical benefit 
but with PD as defined by RECIST 1.1 may be considered for continued study treatment at the Investigator ’s discretion (after discussion with the Medical Monitor ) if they meet the following 
criteria:  
• Tumor shrinkage (at least 30% decrease in diameter from baseline) of one or more evaluable lesions  
Improvement in one or more symptoms or signs attributable to the underlying cancer as assessed by the Investigator.

A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to  be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, i ncluding 
those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, "A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care."  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well -being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). E ven the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.

and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly vulnerable 
and need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence.  
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable internatio nal norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory 
requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the d uty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, 
dignity, integrity, right to self- determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may harm the environment.  
14. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly described in a research protocol . The protocol should contain a statement of the 
ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, Sponsor s, institutional affiliations , other potential conflicts of interest, incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -study access by study subjects to interventions identified as 
beneficial in the study or access to other appropriate care or benefits.  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be 
independent of the researcher, the S ponsor and any other undue influence. It must take 
into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide  monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any serious adverse events. No change to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee.  
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate scientific training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy 
Clinical Study Protocol DEK- DKK1 -P204_ 01 July 2020 page 80 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician 
or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professional and never the research subjects, even though they have given consent.  
17. Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or community  is 
only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs and priorities of this population or community and if there is a reasonable likelihood that this population or community stands to benefit from the results of the research.  
18. Every medical  research study involving human subjects must be preceded by careful 
assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and communities involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or communi ties affected by the condition under investigation.  
19. Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.  
20. Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects unless they  
are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians must immediately stop a study when the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.  
21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
22. Participation by competent individuals as subjects in medical researc h must be voluntary. 
Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no competent individual may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of resear ch subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of the study on their physical, mental and social integrity.  
24. In medical research involving competent human subjects, each potential subject must be adequately inf ormed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of 
interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject's freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. 
If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed.  
Clinical Study Protocol DEK- DKK1 -P204_ 01 July 2020 page 81 
CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally 
seek con sent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations 
where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be don e 
only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the phys ician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be 
sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.  
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician mus t seek informed 
consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the population represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent should be respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
that prevents giving informed consent is a neces sary characteristic of the research 
population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the 
specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee.  Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as  well as positive results should be published or otherwise made 
publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of  this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.

CONFIDENTIAL  Leap Therapeutics, Inc.  C ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that the research is justified by its potent ial preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the 
physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for exam ple, 
access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a st udy or the patient's decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient- physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating 
suffering. Where possible, this interv ention should be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

Investigational 
Product : ARQ-151 cream 0.3% 
IND:  135681  
Clinical Indication : Plaque Psoriasis  
Study Objectives : • To evaluate the systemic exposure and characterize the plasma 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ARQ -151 cream 0.3% and its 
major N -oxide metabolite, in pediatric subjects with plaque 
psoriasis involving body surface areas (BSA) of  at least  3%, 
under maximal usage conditions. 
• To evaluate the safety of ARQ -151 cream 0.3% applied QD to  
pediatric subjects with  plaque psoriasis involving BSA of  at least 
2%.   
• To explore the efficacy of ARQ-151 cream 0.3% applied QD for 
4 weeks to pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis involving BSA 
of at least 2%.    
Summary of Study 
Design : This is a phase 2, open label, maximal usage PK and safety study of 
ARQ-151 cream 0.3% in pediatric subjects (ages 6 to 11  years  old) 
with plaque psoriasis : 
• At entry, subjects will have at least 2% BSA involvement 
(excluding the scalp, palms, soles), except for a subset of 
evaluable subjects who consent to a PK sampl e for maximal usage 
evaluation that will have at least 3% BSA involvement (excluding 
the scalp,  palms, soles), and both groups of subjects will have a 
minimum IGA of Mild (‘2’).  
• Subjects who discontinue the study may be replaced.   
• Subjects /caregivers will apply ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD for 
28 days to all affected areas of plaque psoriasis and any newly 
appearing plaque psoriasis lesions that arise during the study, 
except on the scalp.  
• Subjects /caregivers should maintain treatment of these areas with 
study drug for the duration of the study regardless of whether 
treatable areas of psoriasis clear prior to Week 4.

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 12 of 74  Key Assessments:  Safety will be monitored through l ocal cutaneous tolerability 
assessments, vital signs, physical examination, safety labs 
(blood chemistries/hematology/urinalysis) , ECGs , Children's 
Depression Inventory 2 ( CDI-2, parent report ), Children's 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), and reported Adverse 
Events ( AEs). 
All AEs will be collected starting at Screening  after the parent/legal 
guardian and, as appropriate, the subject has provided assent/informed 
consent. TEAEs  should be recorded starting from the beginning of the 
treatment period.  
Efficacy assessments will include IGA, Intertriginous Area -IGA 
(I‑IGA), PASI, WI- NRS, BSA, and CDLQI.  
PK sample collection:  
• All enrolled  subjects will have a  trough PK sample at the Week 4 
visit.   
• A subset  of 6 evaluable subjects who consent will have an 
additional PK sample collected  pre-dose at the Week 2 visit .  
o PK evaluable subjects ( in the maximal usage subset)  are 
defined as those that  have PK results for Week 2 . Unevaluable 
subjects may be replaced.  
Study Endpoints : 
 • The primary endpoints will be PK, safety and tolerability .   
• Efficacy will be assessed  as exploratory endpoints. 
Statistical 
Consider ations : 
 Safety  
The following analyses will be performed; however, no formal 
inferential statistics will be done on safety assessments.  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data and 
frequency counts will be compiled for classification of qualitative 
safety data.  All subjects who receive at least one confirmed dose of 
study drug will be included in the safety population.  
Adverse Events:  
A subject -by-subject treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) data 
listing, including verbatim term, preferred term, treatment, severity, 
and relationship to study drug, will be provided. 
The number of subjects experiencing adverse events ( AEs) and 
number of AEs will be summarized by cohort using frequency counts.

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 13 of 74  Clinically significant physical examination parameters will be 
captured as adverse events.  
Vital signs and s afety laboratory parameters will be summarized at 
each visit using descriptive statistics or frequencies and percentages, 
as appropriate. Changes from baseline in laboratory values and vital 
signs will also be summarized by visit. In addition, changes from 
baseline in weight and laboratory values will be summarized using 
shift tables . 
ECG data will be summarized with descriptive statistic s. 
Efficacy  
All efficacy analyses will be exploratory . 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for absolute and percentage 
change from baseline in IGA, I- IGA, PASI, WI -NRS, and BSA.  
The proportion of subjects with 50% and 75% improvement in PASI 
at post- baseline visits will also be described descriptively.  
Study Nuances : 
 Non-medicated emollients, moisturizers and sunscreens will be 
allowed as normally used by the subjects, but may only be applied to 
non-treatment sites.  
PK Analysis: Pharmacokinetics Assessment  
Plasma levels of circulating roflumilast and its major N -oxide 
metabolite will be measured at the following time points:  
• All enrolled  subjects will have  a trough PK sample collected at 
the Week 4 visit.   
• A subset  of 6 evaluable subjects who consent to a PK sampl e 
under maximal usage conditions will have an additional PK 
sample collected  pre-dose at the Week 2 visit .  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
All subjec ts who are enrolled and receive at least one application of 
study drug will be included in the pharmacokinetic population. When 
possible, the exposure or roflumilast and its major N -oxide metabolite 
will be calculated based on plasma concentrations versus time profile 
data.

or 25.1 kilograms) . Measure the weight in triplicate and report  the average weight in EDC.  
d BSA, IGA affected by plaque psoriasis  will be determined to qualify for study entry (Screening and Baseline) 
and will be measured at the Week 2 and Week 4 visits.  Scalp, palms and soles should be excluded from 
consideration in these assessments.  Additionally, Intertriginous Area -IGA (I -IGA) , PASI, and WI -NRS will be 
evaluated.   WI-NRS p ruritus  assessment will  be completed by subjects ≥ 8 years old, or by parent/caregiver  for 
subjects < 8 years old. All other assessments will be performed by the Investigator or study staff, as appropriate.   
e Local tolerability assessments should be recorded prior to study drug application for the Investigator assessment 
of skin irritation (Berger and Bowman skin irritation score) and 10 -15 minutes post -drug application for the 
subject’s ‘0 -3’ burning/stingin g assessment (subject -rating completed by the subject or parent/caregiver). At the 
Week 4 visit, only the Investigator assessment of skin irritation will be performed.  Note for investigator 
tolerability assessments: reactions at the site of product IP application, which may occur post -Baseline, should be 
differentiated from the preexisting inflammation associated with the subject’s psoriasis . 
f For females that have started menstruation, a serum pregnancy test will be performed during Screening. A urine 
pregnancy test will be administered to all females of child -bearing potential. A negative result is required for 
continued participation in the study, and results must be available prior to dispensing of study drug  
g All enrolled subjects will have a trough PK sample collected at the Week 4 visit. A subset of 6 subjects who 
consent will provide  an additional PK sample pre -dose (within 1 hour) at the Week 2 visit.  
h Subjects/caregiver  to apply assigned IP in clinic at Baseline and Week 2. All Investigator assessments should be 
completed prior to IP application.  
I The number of kits to be dispensed is based on %BSA affected. See IP Handling Manual for details. Site should review IP kit to ensure sufficient IP is available until the next visit and only dispense additional IP if needed.
 
j Every tube should be weighed and recorded when dispensed and returned.  
k Any emergent AEs will be followed in the clinic for up to 1 month at the Invest igator’s discretion until resolved 
or otherwise judged as clinically stable.  
l Photography is planned to be performed at selected investigational sites.  Photography will be optional.  All efforts will be made to de -identify the subjects.  
m Subjects who en roll into the open label extension study (ARQ -151-306) will complete the study at Week 4; 
subjects that do not enroll into ARQ -151-306 will complete the study  with a Week 5 Telephone Follow -up. 
The Week 5 Telephone Follow -up is a call to the subjects to  follow -up on any continuing adverse events related 
to the study drug. Telephone call also assess es any emergent adverse event post -Visit 4. Any emergent AEs will 
be followed in the clinic for up to 1 month at the Investigator’s discretion until resolved or otherwise judged as clinically stable.

4.1 Introduction 
Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitor approved globally to reduce the risk of 
exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) associated 
with chronic bronchitis.  Roflumilast and its active metabolite, roflumilast N -oxide, are high 
affinity selective inhibitors of PDE -4 (a major cyclic -3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate 
(cyclic AMP) -metabolizing enzyme), whose activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic 
AMP.  There are four different subtypes  of PDE -4: PDE -4a, PDE-4b, PDE-4c, and PDE-4d, 
each with several isoforms (splicing variants).  IC 50 values of both roflumilast and roflumilast 
N-oxide for the different PDE-4 isoforms and subtypes are mostly sub-nanomolar and single 
digit nanomolar ( Hatzelmann 2010).   The PDE- 4 family of enzymes are the most prevalent 
phosphodiesterases in immune cells and inhibition of PDE-4 subtypes has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects in many biological systems.  
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by raised, well -demarcated, 
erythematous oval plaques with  adherent silvery scales.  The pathogenesis of pediatric and adult 
psoriasis is believed to be similar.  Numerous past reports have suggested a deficiency of  cyclic 
AMP -dependent protein kinases in human psoriatic skin ( Brion  1986).  More recently, various 
cytokines produced by Th1 and Th17 cells have been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  It has been postulated that the anti -inflammatory effects of PDE -4 
inhibitors may provide a beneficial therapeutic intervention in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis , and Otezla
® (apremilast) a PDE -4 inhibitor has been approved for the oral treatment of 
chronic plaque psoriasis.  
The past 15 years have witnessed a transformation in the systemic treatment of moderate to 
severe psoriasis with the advent of biological therapies.  However, for patients with milder forms of disease, best treated with topical options, the therapeutic landscape has not significantly changed in several decades.  Topical steroids come in all shapes and forms, but the lower potency steroids are not effective and the higher potency steroids are beset with issues of local skin atrophy and the potential for hypothalamic -pituitary axis suppression when applied over 
larger body surface areas and for prolonged periods of time.  Vitamin D has been the other staple 
of topical psoriasis treatment , but it is irritating, not suitable for use on the fac e or intertriginous 
areas, and its efficacy is rather modest.  Hence, there is substantial medical need for additional 
topical approaches in the treatment of psoriasis.   The study Sponsor is developing a topical 
cream formulation of roflumilast for the tre atment of chronic plaque psoriasis.  Phase 2 results 
suggest that ARQ -151 may be a highly efficacious and well- tolerated topical treatment for 
psoriasis.  Accordingly, a phase 3 program is ongoing evaluating ARQ-151 cream 0.3% for the treatment of plaque p soriasis in subjects 2 years of age and older .  The present study is a 
maximal use pharmacokinetic trial with the to -be-marketed formulation.  The study is designed 
to ensure that the expected target patient population for ARQ-151 is properly represented, as well as to ensure that a suitable number of subjects with plaque psoriasis are evaluated and that PK is adequately characterized.

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 29 of 74  6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a phase  2, open label, maximal usage PK and safety study of ARQ-151 cream 0.3% in 
pediatric subjects (ages 6 to 11  years  old, inclusive) with plaque psoriasis.   
At entry, subjects will have at least 2% BSA involvement (excluding the scalp, palms, soles), 
except for a subset  of evaluable subjects who consent to a PK sampl e for maximal usage 
evaluation that will have at least 3% BSA involvement (excluding the scalp, palms, soles), and 
both groups of subjects will have a minimum IGA of Mild (‘2’).  
Subjects who discontinue the study may be r eplaced.   
Subjects /caregivers will apply ARQ-151 cream 0. 3% QD for 28 days to all plaque psoriasis 
affected areas and any newly appearing plaque psoriasis lesions that arise during the study, 
except on the scalp.  
Subjects /caregivers should maintain treatment of areas with study drug for the duration of the 
study regardless of whether treatable areas clear prior to Week 4.  The palms and soles will be 
treated but will not be counted towards any measurements of efficacy (PA SI, IGA, I- IGA, BSA).  
Approximately 20 male and female subjects ages 6 to 11 years old with plaque psoriasis: 
• All subjects must have at least 2% BSA psoriasis involvement at Baseline  
• However, a subset  of 6 evaluable subjects who consent to a PK sampl e for maximal 
usage evaluation will have at least 3% BSA involvement at Baseline (excluding  the scalp,  
palms, soles ).  
o PK evaluable subjects (in the maximal usage subset) are defined as those that have PK results at Week 2. Unevaluable subjects may be replaced.  
• All subjects must have at least Mild (‘2’) psoriasis severity based on IGA at Baseline  
6.2 Subject Participation  
All subjects will participate in s creening (up to 3 weeks) and a  Treatment phase (4 weeks).  
Upon completion of this study, participants may have the opportunity, subject to research site 
participation , to enroll in an open-label extension study of up to 24 weeks, receiving ARQ -151 
cream 0.3% concentration ( study ARQ-151-306). 
• For subjects who enr oll in ARQ-151-306, the Week 4 visit will complete this study 
(ARQ-151-215).  
• Subjects who do not enroll in ARQ-151- 306 will complete this study (ARQ-151-215) 
with the Week 5 Telephone Visit.

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 30 of 74  6.3 Numbering of Subjects  
All screened  subjects will be identified b y a unique six -digit subject ID number.  The first digit 
will be “5” while the next two  digits correspond to the site number (assigned by the Sponsor, 
e.g., 01 to 05 ), the last three digits correspond to the sequential order in which the subject is 
screened  for the study (e.g., Subject ID 505-001: first digit fixed at 5, Site 5 (next two digits), 
subject number 001 screened by that site  [last three digits] ).  
The clinical site is responsible for maintaining a current log of subject ID number assigned to 
that subject.  The subject ID number is required to be entered on all clinical study documentation 
(e.g., case report for ms, labeling of clinical materials and sample containers, investigational 
product accounta bility logs, etc.).  
6.4 Blinding

Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 34 of 74  Generally, the addition of new medications, including nonprescription medications, during the 
course of the study is discouraged.  However, the short- term use of a medication may be 
authorized by the Investigator.  The Investigator must make the decision to authorize the use of any such a medication only after consideration of the clinical situation, the potential for masking symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether the use of the medic ation will 
compromise the outcome or validity of the clinical investigation.  If medication is required, the name, strength, frequency, duration of use, and reason for use will be recorded in source documents and entered  into the Case Report Forms.  Medica tions which have been used 
chronically by subjects, in particular statins and anti-hypertensives, are allowed for use during the study, except as prohibited in ‘Exclusions’ ( Table  1).  
6.9 Treatment  
6.9.1 Drug Supplies, Packaging and Labeling  
ARQ-151 cream 0.3% will be in 45 gram ( weight of cream) squeeze tubes. The tubes will be 
packaged  in kits, containing multiple tubes of investigational product.  The number of kits 
dispensed to a subject will be based on the BSA involvement of plaque psoriasis. The kits will be labeled in an open-label manner. The kit(s) dispensed to a subject will be labeled with a unique number. 
The Sponsor will supply sufficient quantities of the investigational product to each site to allow 
for completion of this study. 
Records will be made of the receipt and dispensing of the investigational products supplied.  
At the conclusion of the study, any unused investigational products will be returned to the 
Sponsor or designee, or destroyed, as per Sponsor instructions. 
Refer  to the current version of the IP Handling Manual for details on the accountability, storage, 
and management of the IP. 
6.9.2 Treatment Administration  
ARQ-151 cream 0.3% is administered once daily as a topical product to cover the skin surface at 
an application rate of approximately 2 mg/cm
2. Each site and each subject will be provided a 
digital scale to accurately measure the proper amount of cream to be applied to the psoriatic lesions. Each site will be provided a calculation program that uses the subject’s height, weight, and %BSA of plaque psoriasis involvement to calculate the correct amount of ARQ -151 to be 
applied once a day to the psoriatic lesions. 
At the Baseline visit, the Investigator will calculate daily IP to be applied in grams using the 
calculation tool.  
• IP tubes will be weighed prior to and immediately after IP application (Cap On)  
• IP will be weighed into a plastic dish using the digital scale  
Protocol ARQ-151-215 Arcutis  Biotherapeutics, Inc . 
Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 35 of 74  Investigator will confirm calculate d IP adequately covers the entire involved area of plaque 
psoriasis . The Investigator can adjust IP usage up or down based on their clinical judgement or 
may consider the calculated expected IP weight as acceptable. The plastic dish should be 
reweighed after IP application to determine the actual amount of IP used.  
At the Baseline visit, the study staff will demonstrate to the subject and/ or parent/caregiver how 
to use the digital scale to measure the proper amount of ARQ -151 cream to apply. ARQ-151 
cream  is applied to psoriasis lesions as a thin film and rubbed in using the index and middle 
finger, thoroughly but gently, until the ‘white’ has disappeared. The subject or parent/ caregiver 
will then apply the weighed amount of ARQ-151 to the psoriasis lesions once a day .  
If a parent/guardian /caregiver helps apply the study medication, they should wash their hands 
with soap and water when finished.   For days that are a clinic visit, the IP will be applied in the clinic and the subject does not apply 
any furt her IP that day. All psoria sis lesions should be treated using the IP amount as noted in the 
Subject Body Diagram (see Appendix 1) , except for the scalp.  
Re-training will be conducted at subsequent visits as needed (i.e., if the returned tube(s) weighs 
substantially different than the expected weight).  
Note : 
• All subjects should apply medication each evening (except on clinic visit d ays) at least 
15 minutes after showering or bathing (if they take an evening shower/bath) and then not wash areas where ARQ -151 cream has been applied until at least 4 hours after study drug 
application and preferably not until the following morning. Inves tigational product 
should be applied at least 20 minutes before going to bed. 
• Subjects should maintain treatment of areas with study drug for the duration of the study regardless of whether treatable areas of psoriasis clear prior to Week 4 visit . 
New lesi ons that develop during the study should be treated (except scalp) . An unscheduled visit 
is not required for starting treatment of new lesions.  
Each investigational product tube will be weighed prior to dispensing at the B aseline visit and at 
subsequent visits. Investigational product tubes must be returned by subjects at each study visit, 
both empty and full, and will be weighed. If the subject’s actual use is substantially different than the expected use for the subject’s BSA, the subject /parent/ caregiver  will be retrained on the 
study drug application technique.  
At the final clinic visit, the subject should return all IP (used or unused), the digital scale, 
and any remaining plastic dishes.  
Refer to the Investigational Product (IP) Handling Plan for detailed instructions.

Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 36 of 74  6.9.3 Treatment Compliance  
Investigational product tubes will be weighed at each clinic visit.  
Subjects /caregivers will complete a daily diary recording the date and time of each dose applied, 
any missed doses, and a comment section should the subjects have a comment, e.g., record 
potential AEs.  Site personnel will review the diaries and use the information to question the subject regarding compliance and AEs and then record appropriate information in source documents and complete Case Report Forms (CRFs). If a subject misses a dose, they should be instructed to return to the protocol investigational product administr ation schedule (i.e. if subject 
forgets a dose they should wait until that evening and apply as usual). 
A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 
80% of the expected applications during the study drug application period and does not miss more than 3 consecutive doses.  
Compliance will be assessed by review of the dosing diary. Weight of investigational product applied (via dispensed and returned tube weights) will be measured for reporting purposes.  
If the diary shows less than 80% of expected use, the subject is using too little study drug and retraining must be conducted and documented. 
Compliance will be documented in source and in eCRF.  
7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The Schedule of Visits and Assessments ( Section  2) summarizes the clinical procedures to be 
performed at each visit. Individual clinical procedures are described in detail below. Additional 
evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the PI and/or the Sponsor for reasons related to subject safety.  
7.1 Safety Assessments  
This study assesses the safety , efficacy,  and pharmacokinetics of ARQ-151 cream . Safety will be 
determined by evaluating physical examinations, 12- lead ECGs, local tolerability  assessments, 
vital signs /weight , clinical laboratory parameters , Children's Depression Inventory 2 
(CDI -2, parent report),  and AEs as outlined in the Schedule of Visits and Assessments  
(Section  2). If deemed necessary, additional safety assessments will be performed at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
7.1.1 Screening  
Within 3 weeks prior to the first dosing, subjects/legal guardians will be provided details of study 
requirements and sign an informed consent form and, when applicable, assent form.  M edical 
history and demographic data includi ng sex, age, race, ethnicity, body weight (kg), and 
height (cm) will be recorded. Each subject will undergo plaque psoriasis assessments,  a physical 
examination, ECG,  vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart  rate, and temperature) and 
laboratory tests : hematology, chemistry, urinalysis and a pregnancy test for female subjects of

discretion of the Investigator.  
All screened subjects will receive a screening number and be ent ered into the study tracking 
document. 
7.1.2 Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will be performed  as follows: 
• Screening, Baseline, and Week 4.   
The physical exam will be limited to skin, lungs and heart only. 7.1.3 Vital Signs , Height and Weight 
Vital signs will be collected  (in seated position after 5 mins) at timepoints  noted below: 
• Weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be measured  at 
Screening, Baseline, Week  2, and Week 4. 
o For both weight and height measurements, the investigator or examiner should be 
trained in measuring height and weight as well as in calibration procedures  
o Ideally, the same person should measure the subject at every visit 
o Attempts should be made to schedule visits, so that measurements can be taken at approximately the same time throughout the study  
o The parent / caregiver may  help with the measurements and to soothe and comfort 
the child, as needed   
o Explain to the parent/ caregiver the steps in the procedures and that it is important to keep the child still and calm to obtain good measurements , as needed   
o For measuring weight, use a calibrated scale with appropriate range and resolution , 
and the same scale should be used for a subject throughout the duration of the study 
 Subjects must remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains  
 Subjects must also remove the contents of their pockets and remain still 
during measurement of weight 
 Have  the child or teen stand with both feet in the center of the scale with their 
arms at their side and hold still  
 Record  the weight to the nearest decimal fraction (for example, 55.5 pounds 
or 25.1 kilograms)  
Protocol ARQ-151-215 Arcutis  Biotherapeutics, Inc . 
Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 38 of 74  o For measuring length, a device such as a stadio meter should be used and placed on 
a flat, stable surface  
 Remove the child or teen’s shoes, bulky clothing, and hair ornaments, and 
unbraid hair that interferes with the measurement 
 Lower the headpiece until it firmly touches the crown of the head.  
 Accurately record  the height to the nearest 1/8th inch or 0.1 centimeter  
o For both weight and height, three reproducible measurements of both the child’s weight and height should be recorded and the average of the 3 recordings will be entered onto the eCRF 
7.1.4 12-lead ECGs  
12-lead ECGs will be performed as follows:  
• Screening and Week 4. 
ECGs will be performed on subjects after 5 minutes in the supine position . All ECG tracings and 
readouts will be reviewed by the central reader at the ECG laboratory . 
7.1.5 Laboratory Tests 
All tests listed below will be performed as follows:

7.1.6 Children’s Depression  Inventory 2 
The CDI -2 Assessment will be performed as follows:  
• Screening , Baseline, Week 2, and Week 4  
The CDI -2 quantifies depressive symptomatology and is recommended for use in initial 
evaluation and is appropriate when there is a need for an assessment and robust descriptio n of a 
child’s depressive symptoms.  
This study will use the CDI Parent Report Form.  An example of the Parent report form is 
presented in Appendix 2. 
7.1.7 Local Tolerability Assessment  
Investigator Local Tolerability Assessment will be performed as follows : 
• Baseline, Week 2, and Week 4 
Application site reactions will be graded at the timepoints outlined in the Schedule of Visits and  
Assessments ( Section  2). Irritation reactions are graded using the scale detailed in the following  
section ( Berger  1982). Reactions at the site of product application, which may occur 
post-Baseline, should be differ entiated  from the preexisting inflammation associated with the 
subject’s plaque psoriasis. 
The investigator assessments will be conducted by the investigator prior to study drug 
application in the clinic.

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 42 of 74  I-IGA  
For subjects with intertriginous area involvement of at least ‘mild’ severity by IGA (I- IGA≥2) at 
Baseline (using the IGA scale shown above but evaluating intertriginous ar eas ONLY and NOT 
whole body involvement), an IGA for the intertriginous region alone (I- IGA) will be recorded at 
Screening, Baselin e, Week 2, and Week 4. 
This ‘intertriginous area IGA’ (I -IGA) should be done AFTER the ‘standard whole body 
IGA’ in subjects who qualify. 
7.2.2 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  
Assessments will be performed as single assessments from which PASIs will be calculated.  
PASI assessment will be performed at Screening,  Baseline/D ay 1, Week 2, and Week 4  visit s.  
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is used for the measurement of severity of psoriasis.  
PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score 
in the range 0 (no dise ase) to 72 (maximal disease).  
The body is divided into four (head (h) (10% of a person's skin); arms (a) (20%); trunk  (t) (30%); 
legs (l) (40%)). Each of these areas is scored by itself, and then the four scores are combined into the final PASI/mPASI. For each section, the percent of area (A) of skin involved is estimated and then transformed into a grade from 0 to 6 (A):  
0. 0% of involved area 
1. < 10% of involved area 
2. 10–29% of involved area 
3. 30–49% of involved area 
4. 50–69% of involved area 
5. 70–89% of involved area 
6. 90–100% of involved area 
Within each area, the severity is estimated by three clinical signs: erythema (‘E’; redness), 
induration (‘T’; thickness) and desquamation (‘S’; scaling). Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, from none to maximum severity possible. 
To calculate the PASI, the sum of the severity rating for the three main signs are multiplied with 
the numerical value of the area affected and with the various percentages of the four body areas. These values are then added to complete the formula as follows:  
PASI = 0.1 (Eh + Th + Sh) Ah + 0.2 (Ea + Ta + Sa) Aa + 0.3 (Et + Tt + St)  
At + 0.4 (El  + Tl + Sl) Al

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 43 of 74  7.2.3 Worst Itch -Numerical Rating Scale (WI -NRS)  
WI-NRS Assessments will be performed as follows:  
• Screening, Baseline, Week 2, a nd Week 4  
The WI -NRS has been developed as a simple, single item to assess the patient -reported severity 
of this symptom at its highest intensity during the previous 24-hour period ( Naegeli  2015). 
The WI-NRS will be determined by asking the subject’s assessment of worst itch over the past 
24 hours. The scale i s from ‘0 to 10’ (“no itch” to “worst imaginable itch”). WI -NRS pruritus 
assessment will be completed by subjects ≥ 8 years old, or by parent/caregiver for subjects 
< 8 years old.    
 
7.2.4 Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index  (CDLQI)  
CDLQI ( age 2 -16 years) will be completed as follows:  
• Screening, Baseline, Week 2, and Week 4  
The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) allows a simple, compact and uniform assessment of patients with skin diseases in general, in which higher scores indicate poorer disease -related quality of life.  Subjects/caregivers will complete the CDLQI. See  Appendix 4 for 
the CDLQI.  
7.2.5 Dermal Imaging 
Medical photography will be performed at participating sites on consenting/assenting subjects as 
follows:  
• Baseline, Week 2, and Week 4 
Photography should be focused on single lesions or specific body sections (e.g. arm). Subjects with intertriginous involvement also will have photographs taken of the intertriginous area.  
Body or half-body photographs should only be taken if necessary. All efforts will be made to 
de-identify the subjects. Subjects who are unwilling to participate in the medical photography will be allowed to opt out of this procedure and document on the informed consent form .  
Refer to the current Photography Manual for instructions regarding photography.

7.3.1 Body Surface A rea (BSA)  
BSA Assessments will be performed as follows:  
• Screening, Baseline, Week 2, and Week 4 
The BSA affected by plaque psoriasis will be determined by the subject’s hand method, where 
the subject’s hand (including fin gers) surface area is assumed to equal 1% of body surface area 
(BSA).    
Note : All plaque psoriasis lesions on a subject will be treated including the face, trunk, 
genitals/skin folds, or limbs (excluding the scalp). The palms and soles will be treated but will not be counted towards any measurements of efficacy ( PASI , IGA, BSA).  
Body Diagram 
The body diagram (see Appendix 1) will be completed as follows:  
• Baseline  
A copy of  the body diagram will be provided to the subject for study drug application at home.  
7.3.2 Pharmacokinetic s Sample Collection  
Plasma levels of circulating roflumilast and its major N -oxide metabolite will be measured at the 
following time points:  
• All enrolled  subjects will have a trough PK sample at the Week 4 visit.   
• A subset  of 6 subjects who consent will have an additional PK sample collected  pre-dose at 
the Week 2 visit.   
Ensure investigational product is not applied in the area where PK will be drawn. 
A manual for blood sampling, collection, processing , and sample shipment will be provided in a 
separate document. 7.4 Final Study Visit  
The approximate final study visit will occur at Week 4 for those subject s that enroll into the 
Open Label Extension study (ARQ-151-306), or Week 5 (Day 35 – Telephone Follow-up) for 
those subjects that do not enroll in  ARQ -151-306. See Schedule of Visits and Assessments

visit (Day 28). 
7.6 Unscheduled Visit  
Unscheduled visits may be necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for 
follow -up of AEs, or for any other reason, as warranted in the judgement of the Investigator. 
The fol lowing information will be collected for all subjects:  
• Concomitant medications/procedures  
• AEs 
The following information also will be collected: 
• IGA/I -IGA and PASI  
• BSA affected with plaque psoriasis  
• Local tolerability assessment  (by Investigator)

7.7 Adverse Event s 
7.7.1 Adverse Event  Definition  
An AE  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.   
AEs will be collected following informed consent of the subject until one month after treatment.   
A treatment emergent a dverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that started post application of 
investigational product at the Baseline visit  or was present at treatment initiation but worsened 
during treatment, through study completion.  
Application site reactions will be considered adverse events if they require intervention, 
suspension or discontinuation of study drug.

Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 46 of 74  7.7.2 Serious Adverse Event  
The definitions and reporting requirements of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/ 
ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management,  Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Topic E2A will be adhered to.  If any AEs are serious, as defined by ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety, required  procedures will be followed.  All SAEs  will be reported to the 
Sponsor via fax or e- mail w ithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, whether or not the 
serious events are deemed drug -related.  All serious event reporting will adhere to ICH E6: 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and ICH E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Stan dards for Expedited Reporting.  The IRB will be notified of the Alert 
Reports as per FDA,  ICH and the IRB ’s policies and procedures. 
An SAE is any AE that in the view of either the PI or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  I mportant medical events 
that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropria te medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening is defined as an AE that in the view of the PI or Sponsor, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death. 
Hospitalization does not include the following: 
• Rehabilitation facilities, hospice facilities or respite care (e.g. caregiver relief)  
• Nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities  
• Emergency room visits  
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures)  
• <24 hour admissions for observation or evaluation 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is 
not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen  
• Hospitalizations for cosmetic elective surgery, social, and/or convenience adm issions 
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the individual subject. 
Protocol ARQ-151-215 Arcutis  Biotherapeutics, Inc . 
Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 47 of 74  • Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs; 
however, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it occurs during the reporting period and meet s the definition of an AE.  
For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be 
reported as an AE, and the resulting appende ctomy should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE. 
Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the  IND . 
If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact the Sponsor personnel listed in Key Contacts 
List (provided separately)  within one business day of knowledge of event.  
7.7.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
This is defined as a serious adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the known study treatment information. A serious event or reaction is not defined as a SUSAR when: ‘it is serious but expected’ or it does n ot fit the definition of an SAE, whether 
expected or not.  
7.7.4 Safety Review with Subject  
At each follow -up visit, subjects and/or caregivers will be queried with an open- ended question 
such as: ‘How have you been feeling since your last visit?’  Additionally, the study staff will 
review subject diaries and, if it appears that a potential AE was recorded, study staff will query 
the subject and determine if an AE occurred.   
AEs (whether serious or non- serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value(s) 
will be evaluated by the PI and treated and/or followed up for up to one month after end of treatment until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acc eptable levels, as judged by the 
PI. 
Where appropriate, medical  test(s) and/or examination(s) will be performed to document 
resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, im proved, unchanged, worse, 
fatal or unknown (lost to follow- up). 
7.7.5 Adverse Event Reporting  
The PI will review each event and assess its relationship to drug treatment (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, likely). Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on the NIH NCI CTCAE toxicity grading scale 5 -point severity sc ale (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). The date and time 
of onset, time relationship to drug dosing, duration, and outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown/lost to follow-up) of each event will be noted. 
• The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following definitions:  
Protocol ARQ-151-215 Arcutis  Biotherapeutics, Inc . 
Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 48 of 74  Unrelated  • The AE must clearly be caused by the subject ’s clinical state, or the study 
procedure/conditions. 
• Definitely not related to drug.  
• Temporal sequence of an AE onset relative to administration of drug not 
reasonable.  
• Another obvious cause of an AE. 
Unlikely  • Time sequence is unreasonable.  
• There is another more likely cause for an AE.  
Possibly • Corresponds to what is known about the drug. 
• Time sequence is reasonable.  
• Could have been due to another equally, likely cause.  
Probably • Is a known effect of the drug. 
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Ceases on stopping the drug. 
• Cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Likely  • Is a known effect of the drug (e.g., listed in Physicians' Desk Reference, Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties, IB).  
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Event stops upon stopping drug, event returns upon restarting drug. 
• The following CTCAE toxicity grading scale 5- point severity scale definitions for rating  
maximum severity will be used: 
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  Moderate; minima l, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.*  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.**  
Note : An experience may be severe but may not be serious, e.g., severe 
headache).  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Note:  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
* Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
** Self-care acti vities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden.

7.8 Reporting Pregnancy  
Durin g the study, all subjects should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they 
suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  If pregnancy is 
confirmed, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and followed until the pregnancy comes to term.  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all available pregnancy information on the pregnancy report within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, although pregnancy itself is not considered an AE.  Study treatment must be discontinued immediately in the event of a pregnancy.  The subject should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Monitoring of the subject should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy.  Follow-up information detailing the outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the newborn should be reported as it b ecomes available.  
Should the pregnancy result in a congenital abnormality or birth defect, a SAE report must be submitted.  Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of the birth should be reported as SAEs, without regard to causality.  In addition, any infant death that occurs after the 30-day reporting period that the investigator suspects are  related to the in -utero exposure to the 
study treatment should also be reported. 
7.9 Treatment Stopping Rules  
If a subject has non -cutaneous adverse events of concern, clinically significant laboratory values 
or any condition that the investigator determines could possibly be related to the study drug, 
the Investigator should immediately contact the Medical Monitor to discuss if the subject should 
be discontinued from the study. 
Treatment for any individual subject will be discontinued if the subject:  
• Experiences a serious adverse event (SAE) or a clinically significant non -serious AE 
which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or Medical Monitor warrants 
discontinuation f rom the study for that subject’s well-being. 
• A severe (Grade 3) laboratory abnormality (confirmed by repeat sample and considered related to study drug; see Appendix 5).  
Dosing of study drug for an individual subject may be suspended for safety concerns other than those described above, at the discretion of the investigator if he/she feels the subject’s safety may be threatened. 
CDI-2 raw total score of 34 should be referred promptly to a mental health care professional and 
consideration be given to discontinuation from study drug.   A subject that is experiencing suicidal ideation and behavior should be referred immediately to a 
qualified mental health c are provider and consideration given to discontinuation from study drug.

Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 50 of 74  As noted above, study treatment must be discontinued immediately in the event of a female 
subject’s pregnancy.   
Treatment should be interrupted: 
• If a subject develops an application site reaction with the clinical appearance of an  
‘irritation reaction’, and with a severity of a Dermal Response Score of 5 (erythema, 
edema and papules) or greater on the scale of Berger and Bowman, treatment should be interrupted for up to one week and may then be resumed if the reaction has, in the opinion of the Investigator, adequately resolved.   
Treatment should be discontinued: 
• If the reaction reoccurs, treatment should be discontinued permanently, and the subject followed until the reaction resolve s.   
For cases of suspected allergic contact dermatitis, the medical monitor and sponsor should be notified and there should be discussion about performing patch tes ting to further evaluate. 
Patch  testing is encouraged in such cases.

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 51 of 74  8.1.2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
When possible, the exposure of roflumilast and its major N -oxide metabolite will be calculated 
based on plasma concentrations versus time profile data .  
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for roflumilast and its N -oxide metabolite will be 
calculated by a standard noncompartmental method of analysis; these may include AUC last, Cmax, 
Tmax, and others, as data permit. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using 
appropriate descriptive statistics.  
A detailed description of the PK analysis will be presented in the pharmacokinetics report.  
8.1.3 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size will be  approximately 20 subjects.  
This sample size is considered adequate for safety and PK evaluation.  The sample size was not 
powered based on data for the efficacy  endpoints to provide statistical significance . 
8.1.4 Subjects to Analyze  
Safety population will include all subjects who are enrolled and received at least one confirmed dose of investigational product . This population will be defined separately for each cohort. 
All subjects who are enrolled and receive at least one application of study drug and have evaluable PK data will be included in the pharmacokinetic population. 
The MUSE PK subset population will include a ll evaluable (see Section 8.1.1 above) subjects 
receiving the active drug with sufficient plasma concentrations of roflumilast to define a profile, 
as determined by the pharmacokineticist. 
8.1.5 Interim Analysis  
No interim efficac y analyses are planned.   PK and safety data may be reviewed on an ongoing 
basis.  
8.1.6 Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, 
and race) and background characte ristics for the  enrol led subjects.   
8.1.7 Investigational Product Application  Compliance  
The number of investigational product applications by each subject based on diary data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The amount of investigational product used by each subject based on tube weight will be 
summarized by treatment using descriptive  statistics, and  categorically.

Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative efficacy  data and frequency counts will 
be compiled for classification of cat egorical  efficacy  data.    
8.3 Safety Evaluation 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data and frequency counts will be compiled for classification of qualitative safety data.  
8.3.1 Adverse Events  
All treatment-emergent AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of MedDRA terminology for the safety population. Treatment- emergent AEs are those AEs 
with an onset on or after application of investigational product at the  Baseline visit or were  
present at treatment initiation but worsened during treatment,  through study completion. 
All treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by cohort, the number of subjects reporting 
treatment- emergent AEs, system organ class, preferred  term, severity, relationship, 
and seriousness.

9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
9.1 Ethics  
9.1.1 Ethics  Review Board  
Before enrollment of subjects into the study, the current protocol and ICF will be reviewed and 
approved by an appropriate IRB or EC , as required by FDA (21  CFR § 56), Health Canada, 
and ICH GCP  regulation s.  A letter documenting the IRB or EC approval must be received by 
the Sponsor (or delegate) before the initiation of the study at a clinical site. Amendments to the 
protocol will be subject to the same requirements as the original protocol.  The Investigator, Sponsor, or designee will submit a progress report at least once yearly to the 
IRB or EC. However, the frequency of these reports will depend on IRB or EC requirements. As soon as possible after completion or termination of the study, the Investigator will submit a

Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 54 of 74  final report to the IRB or EC per the IRB or EC requirements, and in compliance with FDA and 
Health Canada regulations and ICH GCP guidelines. 
The Investigator, t he Sponsor, or designee shall promptly notify the IRB or EC of any SAEs, 
SUSARs, or any other information that may affect the safe use of investigational product  during 
the study, per the IRB or EC local requirements, and in compliance with FDA  and Health  
Canada regulations and ICH GCP guidelines. 
9.1.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This research will be carried out in accordance with the protocol,  the principles of the 
Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS), the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and the ICH harmonized tripartite guideline regarding GCP (E6  Consolidated 
Guidance, April 1996). 9.1.3 Subject Information and Consent /Assent  
The purpose of the study, the procedures to be carried out and the potential hazards will be 
described to the subjects in non- technical terms. Subjects will be required to read, sign and date 
an ICF summarizing the discussion prior to screening and will be assured that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardizing their medical care.  Adoles cents will 
provide written assent and parent (s) or legal guardian (s) will provide written consent for all 
subjects, as required by local law. 
Subjects will be given a signed copy of their ICF. 9.2 Study Monitoring  
Prior to the initiation of the clinical investigation, Sponsor representatives or designees may visit 
the clinical site where the investigation is to be conducted.  Sponsor representatives shall ensure 
that the Investigator understands the investigational status of the investigational product, 
all requirements of the investigation to be undertaken, and all of his/her responsibilities as an 
Investigator.  Sponsor representatives will also visit the clinical site at appropriate intervals as required to ensure compliance with the protocol and to verify the accuracy and completeness of data reported on the CRFs.  The Study Director or designees shall be available for consultation with the Investigator and serve as liaisons between the clinical site and the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor or authorized designees may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the Investigator, including but not limited to medi cal records (office, clinic, 
or hospital) and investigational product dispensation logs for the subjects in this clinical investigation.  The Investigator must permit access to such records.  The Investigator must obtain, as part of informed consent, permission for an authorized representative of the Sponsor, or regulatory authorities, to review, in confidence, any records identifying subjects.

22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 55 of 74  9.3 Study Completion/Termination  
9.3.1 Study  Completion  
The study is considered completed with the last visit of the last subject participating in the study. 
The final data from the investigational site will be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final subject visit at that site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
9.3.2 Study  Termination  
The Sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Investigational sites will be closed upon study completion. An investigational site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a site closure visit has been performed. The invest igator 
may initiate site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of an investigational site by the Sponsor or investigator may 
include but are not limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
• Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator.  
• Discontinuation of further drug development. 
9.4 Data Quality Assurance 
In order t o ensure the collection of accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable data during this 
clinical investigation, Sponsor representatives or designees may conduct audits of participating sites at appropriate intervals throughout the study.  The results of these periodic site audits may be subject to review by independent auditors at completion of the clinical investigation.  
All clinical data will undergo a 100% quality control check prior to clinical database lock. Edit checks are then performed for appropriate databases as a validation routine using SAS
® to 
check for missing data, data inconsistencies, data ranges etc. Corrections are made prior to database lock. 
9.5 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
During the clinical study, the Investigator will maintain adequate records, including medical 
records, records detailing the progress of the study for each subject, laboratory reports, signed informed consent forms, investigational product disposition records, correspondence with the IRB and Study Monitor/Sponsor, AE reports, and information regarding subject discontinuation and completion of the clinical investigation.

Amendment 1

BACKGROUND  
As the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to develop, Paidion Research Inc. and Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc. have collated the following guidelines for study sites participating in the ARQ-151-215 study. While it is  ideal for subjects to perform all 
protocol- specific assessments at the study site, both Paidion and Arcutis are focused on 
prioritizing subject safety and data integrity. Therefore, the following guidelines will identify challenges and mitigation strategi es while operating clinical trials remotely . 
 REMOTE DATA COLLECTION 
In the event subjects are unable to complete protocol -specific assessments onsite, study sites may 
collect data from subjects remotely via telephone and/or by traditional mail or email. T he method 
used for data collection must be clearly documented in the source. Whenever possible, sites 
should adhere to the protocol visit window
 for remote data collection. Screening and Baseline 
(Day 1) visits/assessments must be performed in the clinic and must NOT  be completed 
remotely. If necessary, these visits can be delayed ensuring they are conducted in the clinic and 
not remotely . 
 Data collection by phone may be performed. Subjects are contacted via telephone and site staff will collect data verbally for all critical data points applicable. Subject responses should be 
recorded in the site source documents. Data collected remotely should be entered into the EDC system.  
 Data collection by mail or email may also be performed for applicable assessments. Site staff 
will contact subjects via traditional mail or email to collect data using paper versions of study 
questionnaires.   Investigator assessments and subject questionnaires normally completed during on- site visits 
should be completed on the appropriate paper source documents and entered in the EDC. The following subject assessments/questionnaires are approved to be collected via telemedicine/remotely : 
• WI-NRS  
• CDLQI  
• CDI-2 
• Subject Local Tolerability  
• Adverse Events 
• Concomitant medication  
• Review of  Subject Diary  
Protocol ARQ-151-215 Arcutis  Biotherapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 1 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential  Page 73 of 74 The following Investigator assessments cannot be completed  via telemedicine/remotely: 
• IGA, I- IGA 
• PASI  
• BSA  
• Investigator Local Tolerability  
• Subject Weight 
 
GUIDELINES FOR REMOTE DATA COLLECTION 
1. Highest priorities: the subject safety  and preserving integrity of data are critical  
2. Study visits  and procedures must be followed per protocol whenever possible. Any 
specific changes in study conduct that deviate from the protocol should be communicated to the IRB and Sponsor (via reporting to your site assigned CRA). All protocol deviations 
which occurred as a result of COVID -19 disruptions (e.g., visits out of window, missed 
assessments, etc.) should be differentiated from other PDs. It is prudent to rece ive IRB 
guidance or approval if a deviation is known to occur in advance (i.e., extending IP application or changing assessment windows, etc.).  
3. If, despite all efforts, a planned clinic visit is absolutely not possible due to a COVID -19 
related issue (e.g. , site has closed, subject prohibited from coming to clinic, etc.), 
sponsor’s strong preference is a delayed clinic visit. If the subject can come to clinic within a reasonable amount of time considering the protocol allowed visit window. If a delayed clin ic visit cannot be completed within 14 days of the protocol specified visit 
window, please contact the Medical Monitor for additional guidance.  
4. It is critical to ensure subjects have enough IP in the event timely clinic visit(s) is/are not possible. It is also critical to ensure subjects are instructed to continue to apply IP per 
protocol for the duration of their participation in the study. Subjects should also be reminded to complete their daily diaries and IP compliance should be assessed via phone if clinic visits are not possible or are delayed.  
5. 
It is critical for preserving data integrity to make every effort possible to have a subject 
return to clinic for the Week 4  visit.  For visits conducted in the clinic, it is critical to 
ensure Rater consistency for all efficacy assessments (e.g., IGA, etc.). If absolutely necessary, it is preferred to have several missed visits and a delayed Week 4 visit versus 
having an Early Termination and no Week 4 visit. If it is not possible for a subject to return on-site within window for the Week 4 visit, sites should:
 
a. Ensure the subject has signed the most current IRB approved ICF with the ICF Addendum. 
b. Contact subjects to discuss continued administration of IP and continue to complete their dosing diaries per regular IP administration instructions.  
c. Subjects are approved to continue applying IP post Week 4 as long as the following 
have been discussed with the subject:  
Protocol ARQ-151-215 Arcutis  Biotherapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 1 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential  Page 74 of 74 - Site should confirm the s ubject has adequate IP to continue dosing and if not ask 
the subject to return to the site to pick up additional IP or refer to the current IP 
Handling Plan for instructions on shipment of IP from site to subject.  
- Confirm the subject has no AEs that would warrant discontinuation of the IP.  
- Site should discuss any new or ongoing conmed(s) and determine if the use of any 
warrant having the subject stop IP application  or not. 
- For any female subject of childbearing potential that site should discuss and confirm the subject has continued her methods of ensuring pregnancy does not occur. Any deviation from these methods should be discussed further and the site should determine if IP should be halted or contact the medical monitor or Arcutis if they have any questions.  A pregnancy test can be performed at the next onsite visit (this is applicable to prior visits being missed due to COVID -19 as well).  
- Subjects are approved to continue dosing for up to 14 days past W eek 4 until they 
return the clinic for the Week 4 visit. After this , sites should reach out to the 
Medical Monitor and/or Arcutis directly for approval to have subjects continue dosing. 
- All the above discussions must be documented in the source. 
d. If available, home health nurse visits could be considered for collection of Vital Signs and Clinical Labs. 
e. In the event a subject is quarantined, has symptoms, or is confirmed positive for COVID-19, it is the Sponsor’s opinion that IP can continue, assuming no other contraindications.

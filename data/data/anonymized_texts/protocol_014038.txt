Study Title A multicenter, double blind, randomized, single dose, active-
controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of synthetic 
surfactant (CHF 5633) in comparison to porcine surfactant (Poractant 
alfa, Curosurf ®) in the treatment of preterm neonates with 
respiratory distress syndrome.
Sponsor Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Via Palermo 26/A, 43122 Parma (Italy)
Name of the Product CHF 5633 Synthetic surfactant
Centers Approximately 20 investigational sites will be involved. 
Indication Treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS).
Study design Double blind, randomized, single dose, active-controlled study. 
Study phase Proof of Concept (POC)/Phase II
Objectives Main objectives of this study are: 
to investigate the short term efficacy profile of CHF 5633 vs. 
porcine surfactant (Poractant Alfa, Curosurf®) in terms of 
reduced oxygen requirement and ventilatory support 
to evaluate the mid-term efficacy profile in terms of reduced 
incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and 
mortality/BPD rate at 36 weeks post menstrual age (PMA), 
mortality rate at 28 days post-natal age (PNA) and 36 weeks 
PMA, RDS-associated mortality through 14 days of age and 
other major co-morbidities of prematurity.
Moreover, other objectives of the present study are: 
to evaluate the need for  re-dosing in the 2 treatment groups 
according the pre-defined criteria;
to evaluate the inflammatory status through the 
measurements of specific biomarkers of inflammation  in 
tracheal aspirates (in a subgroup of babies who require 
endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation when 
feasible);
to assess immunogenicity through the measurement of 
antibodies to SP-B analogue (CHF 5736.03) and SP-C 
analogue (CHF 4902.03) contained in CHF 5633.
to perform the evaluation of oxygenation status through 
invasive measurements [in a subgroup of babies who have

to evaluate the safety profile in the two treatment groups  in 
terms of adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs), vital signs, hematology and biochemistry values.
Treatment duration One intratracheal administration of CHF5633 200mg/kg or Poractant 
alfa (Curosurf®) 200 mg/kg within 24 hours from birth. If needed, up 
to two repeat doses of 100 mg/kg each may be administered at 
approximately 12-hour intervals with the same surfactant as the first 
dose, according to the double blind design and the below pre-defined 
criteria: 
lack of reduction in FiO 2 >0.10  to keep arterial oxygen 
saturation (SpO 2) between 88–95% or other clinical evidence 
of lack of efficacy within 12 hours after first/previous 
dosing;
babies mechanically ventilated with FiO 2 ≥0.30 for babies 24 
to 26+6 weeks and FiO 2 ≥0.35 for babies 27 to 29+6 weeks 
within 12 hours after first/previous dosing;
babies not mechanically ventilated with FiO 2 ≥0.35 for 
babies 24 to 26+6 weeks and FiO 2 ≥0.40 for babies 27 to 29+6 
weeks within 12 hours after first/previous dosing.
However, if a neonate still fails to show a clinical improvement after 
further re-dosing with the same surfactant as the first dose (e.g. 
FiO 2>0.40 to maintain SatO 2 88-95%, respiratory acidosis defined as 
pCO 2 >65 mmHg/8.5 kPa and pH<7.20 on an arterial or capillary 
blood gas), he/she could receive an alternative surfactant treatment 
according to Investigator’s discretion.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 18/621. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common respiratory disease of premature 
neonates and its incidence is directly proportional to the degree of prematurity. It occurs especially 
in extremely preterm infants, as illustrated in a study of the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development Neonatal Research Network, that showed an incidence of RDS of 93% in a 
cohort of 9575 extreme premature infants with gestational age (GA) of 28 weeks or below, born 
between 2003 and 2007 (1). Despite a constant improvement of neonatal care, RDS still represents 
one of the major causes of mortality in preterm infants, as confirmed by a very recent American 
review (64 deaths per 1000 live births) (2).
The 
clinical features of RDS start appearing soon after birth. RDS is characterized by tachypnea 
(rapid breathing), expiratory grunting, subcostal and intercostal retractions, cyanosis, nasal flaring, 
apnea and/or hypothermia in extremely immature neonates. In the pre-surfactant era, the disease led 
rapidly to progressive respiratory failure in the first 2-3 days of life (Error! Reference source not found.) and, 
in the most severe cases, to the death of premature babies. Moreover, RDS can be followed by 
respiratory complications, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), most commonly in those 
infants who required ventilatory support and/or oxygen therapy for RDS treatment (8). 
The 
pathophysiology of RDS has been correlated to lung immaturity and surfactant deficiency. 
Surfactant, a macro-aggregate composed by highly organized lipids and specific proteins, is 
produced by type 2 cells in the alveoli and covers the air liquid interface. It mainly reduces surface 
tension and prevents alveolar collapse, particularly at end-expiration, so that adequate gas exchange 
is maintained throughout the ventilatory cycle (5,8). In preterm babies, RDS develops mostly for the 
deficiency of surfactant production, but different kinds of insults may deteriorate surfactant function 
(inhibition, inactivation, dysfunction, degradation).
Surfactant therapy has become the standard of care in management of preterm neonates with RDS 
and is commonly accepted as being crucial in management of RDS (8). Surfactant treatment of 
babies with or at risk of RDS reduces mortality and the incidence of pulmonary air leaks such as 
pneumothorax by about 50% (7). 
Natural
 surfactants (containing SP-B and SP-C) derived from animal sources (porcine or bovine) 
and synthetic surfactants have been evaluated extensively in preterm neonates. The natural 
surfactants commonly available worldwide include Survanta® (beractant), InfasurfTM (calfactant; 
licensed in the US and Israel but not in the EU), Curosurf® (poractant alfa), Alveofact® (bovactant; 
national European authorization). They produce better results than synthetic, protein-free 
preparations (8) and overall poractant alfa (Curosurf®) has been regarded as the gold standard for the 
treatment of RDS (6). There have been several attempts over the years to replace animal-derived 
surfactants with more effective synthetic surfactants (9-10). The first-generation synthetic surfactants, 
no longer commercially available, contained only phospholipids and no surfactant proteins. The 
superiority of animal surfactants over these first protein-free synthetic preparations was due to the 
presence of the hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C (11). The functional importance of the 
surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C in the phospholipid monolayer encouraged attempts to improve 
the function of synthetic surfactants by the addition of human analogues of both surfactant proteins 
SP-B and SP-C. An effective synthetic surfactant should comprise both these peptides. Synthetic 
new-generation surfactants consisting of peptide and lipids may have several advantages over the 
Clinical Study Protocol No.: CCD-5633AA1-02                                          Version No.: 4.0

CONFIDENTIAL Page 19/62current natural surfactants: less infectious risk, less batch-to batch variability and no ethnographic 
issues.
Among the new-generation synthetic surfactants (containing SP-B and/or SP-C analogues) only 
lucinactant (proposed name Surfaxin®) reached the stage of being used in comparative clinical 
trials in preterm neonates (12-13). Surfaxin was approved by FDA in March 2012 for the prevention 
of RDS in high risk, premature infants and it was launched in the US in November 2013.  Unlike all 
available animal-derived surfactants, Surfaxin contains only one surfactant synthetic peptide 
(sinapultide/KL4).  Since CHF 5633 contains two synthetic peptides and has a proposed indication 
for treatment of RDS, surfaxin would not represent a good comparator for CHF 5633 both in terms 
of chemical characteristics and therapeutic indication. Surfaxin also requires high volume of 
administration (5.8 mL per kg) and a cumbersome preparation procedure in the neonatal intensive-
care unit (NICU) setting, which makes it a less-than-ideal candidate for comparison in a CHF 5633 
trial.
The new synthetic surfactant CHF 5633 is the first fully synthetic surfactant in which the lipid 
phase is enriched by both peptide analogues to human SP-B and SP-C, proteins that are of crucial 
importance for lung surface activity. Moreover, CHF 5633 contains a suitable phospholipid 
composition of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine, optimized to maintain integrity over 
a large range of surface tension, with enhanced adsorption and spreading characteristics. It is 
presented as a sterile suspension for intratracheal administration as a single dose and the intended 
indication is treatment of RDS in premature neonates. 
The in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies showed that CHF 5633 displays at least similar 
surfactant activity to animal derived surfactant.
The in vitro experiments showed that CHF 5633 reduces surface tension at the air/liquid interface as 
efficiently as animal derived surfactant. The dynamic surface response/spreading data illustrated 
that CHF 5633 results in reduction of surface tension very close to that achieved by Curosurf®. 
Moreover it was as fast as Curosurf® in promoting spreading at the interface (14).
The 
in vivo efficacy of CHF 5633 as surfactant replacement was evaluated in preterm newborn 
rabbits. This model is regarded as an appropriate and sensitive experimental benchmark for neonatal 
respiratory distress syndrome (15). It closely resembles the conditions of premature babies affected 
by RDS in the sense that the lungs of these animals are not yet able to produce their own surfactant 
but can undertake gas exchange and they can expand in response to exogenous surfactant 
administration. Curosurf® was used as reference standard. Intratracheal administration of CHF 5633 
resulted in a marked improvement of lung expansion and the response was not statistically different 
from that of the animal-derived surfactant Curosurf® (16). As CHF 5633 contains the essential 
surface active components of natural human pulmonary surfactant required for treatment of RDS, it 
is anticipated that this new surfactant has the potential to offer an increased benefit to risk balance 
over the existing therapies for the life threatening and potentially debilitating consequences of RDS 
in preterm neonates. This concept is supported by the current experience with natural and artificial 
surfactants, and by the activity of the product itself, that has been demonstrated, as described above, 
both in in vitro models and in a relevant in vivo disease model. 
Based on these results it is anticipated that CHF 5633 will restore the functional surfactant film in 
the lungs of newborns with RDS. The anticipated improved therapeutic potential of this product is 
related to an improved safety profile. Most importantly the modified amino acid sequence of the

enhanced efficacy with potentially fewer patients requiring repeated administrations.
In a first-in-human Phase I study (17) conducted in European Countries (Germany, UK and Czech 
Republic) mainly aimed at investigating the safety and tolerability of intratracheal administration of 
two different escalating single doses of CHF 5633 (100 and 200 mg/kg) in preterm neonates with 
RDS from 27+0 to 33+6 weeks  gestational age. 
The primary aim of this study was the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of intratracheal 
administration of two doses of CHF5633, 100 and 200 mg/kg, in preterm neonates with RDS, in 
terms of adverse events (AE) and adverse drug reactions (ADR), haematology and biochemistry 
values, incidence of major neonatal morbidities and mortality. The secondary objectives of this 
study were to explore the effect of the drug on oxygenation and ventilatory requirements and need 
for rescue surfactant treatment. Moreover, the immunogenicity through the measurement of 
antibodies to SP-B analogue (CHF 5736.03) and SP-C analogue (CHF 4902.03) contained in CHF 
5633 as well as the extent of systemic exposure were evaluated. 
CHF 5633 demonstrated a good safety profile and also an encouraging preliminary efficacy profile 
at both 100mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Only one adverse drug reaction was  reported  following drug 
administration at 200 mg/kg:  obstruction of the endotracheal tube ) with no persistent effects on  
oxygen requirement or ventilatory support. The  main objective of the present Phase 2 proof-of-
concept (POC) study is to provide a proof-of-efficacy profile of CHF 5633 in comparison with 
Poractant Alfa (Curosurf®) in the same clinical procedural setting to sustain (or not) further clinical 
development.
Inflammation seen during RDS may be associated with the course of RDS and the promotion of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (18). A synthetic surfactant may provide a less potent 
immunological stimulus than an animal product.  An exploratory examination of whether the nature 
and extent of the inflammatory response during RDS is related to the administered surfactant will 
be performed in a subgroup of centers and babies in this study. The good safety profile of CHF 
5633 obtained in the European FIH study will be further evaluated in the present study in 
comparison to Curosurf® administered to extremely preterm and very preterm neonates, the 
potential target population of a surfactant replacement therapy nowadays. This trial will be 
conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964 and amendments), the current 
Good Clinical Practices and all other applicable laws and regulations.

2.1 Primary Objectives
Main objectives of this study are:
to investigate the short term profile of CHF 5633 vs. porcine surfactant (Poractant Alfa, 
Curosurf®) in terms of reduced oxygen requirement and ventilatory support
to evaluate the mid-term profile in terms of incidence of BPD and mortality/BPD rate at 36-
week post menstrual age (PMA), mortality rate at 28 days PNA and at 36 weeks PMA, 
RDS-associated mortality through 14 days of age and other major co-morbidities of 
prematurity. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives
• To evaluate the need for re-dosing in the two treatment groups;
• to evaluate the inflammatory status through the measurements of specific biomarkers of 
inflammation  in tracheal aspirates (in a subgroup of babies who require endotracheal 
intubation for mechanical ventilation, when feasible);
• to assess immunogenicity through the measurement of antibodies to SP-B analogue (CHF 
5736.03) and SP-C analogue (CHF 4902.03) contained in CHF 5633
• to perform the evaluation of invasive measurements of ventilator support (in a subgroup of 
babies when feasible); 
•to evaluate the safety profile in the two treatment groups  in terms of adverse events (AEs) 
and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), vital signs, hematology and biochemistry values.
3. STUDY DESIGN
This is a multicenter, double blind, randomized, single dose, active-controlled study. Efficacy and 
safety assessments will be performed in the 24 hours following study treatment administration (at 
minutes 30, at hours 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24), in the next 6 days (at days 2, 3, 5 and 7) and in the 
follow-up periods [(at days 28±2 postnatal age (PNA), discharge home and at 36 weeks 
postmenstrual age (PMA)]. Moreover, a further clinical assessment will be performed at 24 months 
(±3 months) corrected age to check the neurological and general health status related to the 
condition of prematurity (Table 1).

End of the trial
The end of the trial will correspond to the date of discharge home of the last baby from the 
approved investigational sites (recruiting sites) or from another hospital where the treated baby 
could have been transferred from the original recruiting site for continuation of clinical care. 
In case the last baby is discharged home prior to 36-week PMA, the end of the trial will correspond 
to a clinical assessment at 36-week PMA (on-site visit or phone call).
The approved investigational site is responsible for the proper follow-up, data collection and 
documentation of the primary and secondary outcomes until the baby is discharged home. The 
investigator of the recruiting site will have to keep contacts and provide the continuing care site 
with written instruction about management of the above as well as for the reporting of serious AE, 
if any.On admission

Poractant Alfa (Curosurf®) is a standard natural surfactant treatment prepared from porcine lungs 
for intratracheal administration and containing almost exclusively polar lipids, in particular 
phosphatidylcholine (about 70% of the total phospholipid content), and about 1% of specific low 
molecular weight hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C, with a total concentration of 80 mg/ml. The 
drug product is filled in sealed 3.0 ml glass vials.
Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. will supply the study medication and also provide the 
Pharmacist/Investigator with appropriate certificates of analytical conformity.
6.2 Dosage and Administration 
6.2.1 Selection of doses in the study
Surfactant doses used in the study follow the recommendations approved in the USA SmPC for the 
administration of Poractant Alfa (Curosurf®), determined as 200 mg/kg for the first dose and 100 
mg/kg for additional doses. For this reason, CHF 5633 will be initially administered at the dosage of 
200 mg/kg (total drug substance components).
Pharmacodynamic studies, both in vitro and in vivo in premature newborn rabbits (16), showed that 
200 mg/kg of CHF 5633 has a profile comparable to that of approved naturally derived surfactants 
(Survanta® and Poractant Alfa, Curosurf®).
In the FIH trial (17) a lower dose of 100 mg/kg was included for safety reasons and showed to be safe 
and effective. The same positive profile was demonstrated for the upper dose of 200 mg/kg. 
Extreme preterm neonates’ lungs present very immature features, such as simplified saccular 
airways, no true alveoli and wide interstitial spaces, making them very susceptible to lung injury 
(18). Given the vulnerability of this population, the higher dose of 200 mg/kg has been chosen to 
achieve a clear efficacy signal and the possible greatest beneficial effect.

6.2.3 Administration
Before the administration of CHF 5633 or Poractant Alfa, the condition of the neonate should be 
stabilized, correcting any acidosis, hypotension, anaemia or hypothermia. The following modes and 
techniques for surfactant administration are the ones to be used in the present study:
a. Disconnecting endotracheally intubated neonates from the ventilator, leaving the endotracheal 
tube
Disconnect the infant momentarily from the ventilator and administer the suspension, as a single 
bolus, directly into the lower trachea via the endotracheal tube. Perform approximately one 
minute of hand-bagging and then reconnect the infant to the ventilator at the same settings as 
before administration. 
b. Without disconnecting endotracheally intubated neonates from the ventilator 
Administer the suspension, as a single bolus, directly into the lower trachea by passing a catheter 
through the suction port into the endotracheal tube or using an endotracheal tube with a side port. 
c. Infants stabilized on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) may also receive 
surfactant via an endotracheal tube solely introduced for the purpose of surfactant administration 
or with brief ventilation and rapid extubation. The tube is withdrawn after surfactant 
administration, and the infant is put on CPAP.  If the condition of the baby worsens, standard of 
care measures could be applied at the discretion of the investigator
The CHF 5633 suspension will be withdrawn from the vial using a sterile syringe through a large-
gauge needle (e.g., at least 20 gauge) and the effective dose calculated on the basis of the weight of 
the neonate could be administered as a single bolus dose or as two half bolus doses into the lower 
part of the trachea, positioning the neonate on each side as each bolus is being administered.
Since both test treatments will be refrigerated, each vial must be warmed up slowly to room 
temperature e.g. by placing it in an incubator for about 1 hour or keeping it in hands for 5-10 
minutes and gently turned upside down, without shaking, avoiding the formation of foam. Artificial 
warming methods should not be used.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 27/62Re-treatment will be undertaken according to the criteria reported in Section 7.1 The exact time of 
the rescue treatment will be noted in the appropriate section of the eCRF. 
No suctioning of the airways should be performed for two hours after each surfactant instillation 
unless the treating physician deems this appropriate, in which case this will be noted in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF.  
All used vials will be retained at the site until the conclusion of the trial. Each vial is for single use 
only. Any leftover medication is to be retained for drug accountability. And any need for re-dosing 
will require a new vial to be issued via IRT (see Section 6.6).
After surfactant administration, the specific method of respiratory support (mechanical ventilation 
or non-invasive support) will be provided at the discretion of the investigator
6.2.4 Subject Training
Not Applicable.
6.3 Packaging
Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. will supply both test treatments. A central depot will be in charge of 
clinical trial supplies’ distribution to the Investigational sites.
Glass vials containing the study treatment will be packed in double blind condition. An initial 
supply containing single vials of 3 ml each of CHF5633/Poractant Alfa for both initial dosing and 
possible re-dosing will be provided to the investigational sites and will be packed in an outer box. 
Each vial is for single use only. Any need for re-dosing will require a new vial to be issued via IRT 
(see Section 6.6).
6.3.1 Primary packaging
Glass vial of 3 ml volume at a concentration of 80 mg/ml for both initial dosing and possible re-
dosing. The actual volume of instilled test treatment will be reported in the relevant section of the 
eCRF. 
6.3.2 Secondary packaging
A holder containing one glass vial  of 3 ml volume.
6.4 Labeling 
All labeling will be in English and according to US law and FDA regulatory requirements in 
compliance with Annex 13 and GMPs.
6.5 Treatment allocation
A dynamic randomization method will be used to balance the treatment groups by investigational 
site and gestational age group (i.e. from 24+0 to 26+6 weeks and from 27+0 to 29+6 weeks). Patients 
will be centrally assigned to one of the two treatment arms on admission through an IRT system 
(Interactive Response Technology, combination of voice and web response system and also referred 
as IVRS/IWRS).
Clinical Study Protocol No.: CCD-5633AA1-02                                          Version No.: 4.0

CONFIDENTIAL Page 28/62The IRT will allocate the patient to a certain treatment group using the Pocock and Simon 
minimization algorithm (19) and assign the study medication kit number corresponding to the 
patients’ treatment group. IRT specifications will be fully described in a specific document. The 
IRT will also generate a confirmation after every IRT transaction is performed.
The Investigator will call the IRT on admission to receive the patient number, and before treatment 
administration to randomize the patient and to obtain the medication kit number. Detailed 
instructions for use of IRT will be provided to the site.
The patient will be identified by a unique number of six digits: the country will be the first digit, the 
investigational site number will be the second two digits and the following three digits will be the 
progressive numbering of the patient within each site (e.g. 101001, 101002 etc.). 
6.6 Treatment Code
The medication list will be provided to the labeling facility but will not be available to patients, 
Investigators, monitors or employees of the center involved in the management of the trial before 
unblinding of the data, unless in case of emergency.
The Sponsor’s clinical team will also be blinded during the study as they will not have direct access 
to the randomization list nor to the medication list.
In case of emergency, unblinding of the treatment code will be done through IRT. The treatment 
group will be disclosed and confirmation will follow (by fax and/or notification email). The IRT 
will be designed to send a confirmation (by fax and/or notification email) to the site for every 
transaction performed by the Investigators. The Investigator will be provided with usernames and 
passwords for randomization purposes and to unblind the study treatment in case of emergency 
situation, where he/she considers essential to know what treatment the patient was taking. The IRT 
will promptly notify the Sponsor and the Clinical Monitor whenever a treatment code is unblinded. 
Users from Chiesi Global Pharmacovigilance will have their own passwords to unblind patients in 
case of SUSARs to be reported to the competent Regulatory Authorities and Ethic Committees/IRB. 
6.7 Treatment compliance
Each CHF 5633 or Poractant Alfa vial will be designated by code number and medication number 
according to the medication list and the actual volume of instilled test treatment will be noted in the 
hospital chart and on the eCRF of the study. The residual volume in each vial will have to be 
checked by the study monitor with the support of the Investigator or the hospital pharmacist during 
the monitoring visits, and all the residual vials will be maintained until the end of the study.
Moreover, also the code and medication number of the surfactant (CHF 5633 or Poractant Alfa) 
vials used as rescue treatment as well as the actual volume instilled will be recorded in the hospital 
chart, in the eCRF of the study and in the relevant surfactant accountability form and will be 
checked by the clinical monitor at the study visits. The completely or partially used vials will be 
kept in a sealed labelled plastic box/envelop with patient’s screening number/initials until the end of 
the study for final accountability.

6.8 Drug Storage 
The Pharmacist/Investigator will be responsible for the safe storage of all medications assigned to 
this study, in a secure place with restricted access, and maintained within the appropriate ranges of 
temperature.
CHF 5633 and Poractant Alfa will have to be stored between 2˚ and 8˚C, protected from light (see 
CTS instruction leaflet) 
6.9 Drug Accountability
The Investigator or pharmacist is responsible for the management of all the test treatments to be 
used for the study. Test treatments should be stored in a locked, secure storage facility with access 
limited to those individuals authorized to dispense the study drugs.
An inventory will be maintained by the Investigator or pharmacist (or other nominated individual), 
to include a signed account of all the test treatment(s) received, dispensed and returned by each 
subject at the planned visits. 
At the conclusion or termination of the study, the Investigator or the pharmacist shall conduct and 
document a final drug supply (used and unused) inventory. An explanation will be given for any 
discrepancies.
No surfactant material supplied for this trial is to be used for any other purpose. 
In addition a signed account shall be kept of all test treatments administered to each patient. 
All the test treatments supplied, used or unused, will be returned to the Sponsor or to the designated 
CRO under Sponsor’s responsibility or destroyed directly by the Pharmacy of the involved 
investigational site upon provision of destruction certificate and documentation assuring the 
occurred destruction according to standard procedures and filed both at investigator’s site file and at 
Sponsor/CRO trial master file.   
6.10 Provision of additional care
At study completion, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to prescribe appropriate treatment for the 
patient. 
7. STUDY PLAN
7.1 Study Schedule
As described in Section 3. Study Design, this study will be conducted in phases and follow-up 
periods: on admission to the study (within the first 24 hours of life), study treatment administration 
and up to 24 hours after receiving it (at 30 min., 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours), 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after 
initial treatment, and follow-up periods (28±2 days PNA, discharge home and 36 weeks PMA). 
Moreover, a further clinical assessment will be performed at 24 months (±3 months) corrected age 
to check the neurological and general health status related to the condition of prematurity.
Clinical Study Protocol No.: CCD-5633AA1-02                                          Version No.: 4.0

CONFIDENTIAL Page 30/62If needed, up to two repeat doses of 100 mg/kg each may be administered at approximately 12-hour 
intervals with the same surfactant as the first dose, according to the double blind design and the below 
pre-defined criteria: 
• lack of reduction in FiO 2 ≥0.10 to keep arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2) between 
88–95% or other clinical evidence of lack of efficacy within 12 hours after 
first/previous dosing;
• babies mechanically ventilated with FiO 2 ≥0.30 for babies 24+0 to 26+6 weeks and 
FiO 2 ≥0.35 for babies 27+0 to 29+6 weeks within 12 hours after first/previous dosing;
• babies not mechanically ventilated with FiO 2 ≥0.35 for babies 24+0 to 26+6 weeks and 
FiO 2 ≥0.40 for babies 27+0 to 29+6 weeks within 12 hours after first/previous dosing.
However, if a neonate still fails to show a clinical improvement after further re-dosing with the 
same surfactant as the first dose (e.g. FiO 2>0.40 to maintain SatO 2 88-95%, respiratory acidosis 
defined as pCO 2 >65 mmHg/8.5 kPa and pH<7.20 on an arterial or capillary blood gas), he/she 
could receive an alternative surfactant treatment according to Investigator’s discretion. Such 
treatment would need to be appropriately documented as a concomitant medication in the CRF.

of life) 
The study will be explained to the parents of a potentially eligible baby prior to birth, if 
possible, giving the parents the maximum time to make an informed choice. Once their written 
informed consent has been obtained either prior to or after birth, the neonate’s eligibility to take 
part in the study will be assessed according to the post-birth inclusion and exclusion criteria. If 
the baby becomes eligible, then the medical history of the mother, the complications during 
pregnancy and the prenatal use of corticosteroids will be collected.  
If the baby becomes eligible, then the following information will be collected:
birth weight; 
Apgar score;

In case the baby was discharged home prior to 28 days of life, the baby should be recalled for an 
on-site clinic visit at the recruiting site. If not feasible, any effort should be made to collect 
information about the occurrence of any adverse events as well as about any change in concomitant 
medications. The Investigator should contact the family pediatrician to collect the relevant 
information.
In case the treated baby was transferred to and discharged home by a continuing care site prior to 28 
days of life or still hospitalized there, the baby should be recalled at the recruiting site for the visit. 
If this is not feasible, the visit can be replaced by a contact/phone call by the Investigator to the 
physician of the continuing care site or to the family pediatrician to check the occurrence of any 
other adverse event as well as of any change in concomitant medications.

The discharge home can occur whenever deemed appropriate by the investigator according to the 
clinical condition of the baby. In case the baby is transferred to a continuing care site, the recruiting 
site is responsible for the proper continuation of data collection and documentation of the primary 
and secondary outcomes. The investigator of the recruiting site should keep contacts and provide 
the continuing care site with written instruction about management of the above as well as for the 
reporting of serious AE, if any. The recruiting site should receive a discharge letter clarifying as 
much detailed information as possible the progress in patient’s conditions. 
Routine clinical safety data included in the discharge home summary letter should be sought to 
complete data collection and register the end of the trial, if applicable. 
If the discharge home coincides with the 36 wks PMA follow-up, only the assessments foreseen at 
36 wks PMA will be performed and reported in the eCRF.
In the event that multiple measurements are available, the measurements closest to the required time 
point are to be collected.

7.1.10 Phase 10 – Clinical assessment at 24 months (±3 months) corrected age 
A further clinical assessment will be performed at 24 months (±3 months) corrected age by 
physicians of participating study centers. This clinical assessment will be based on:
Demographic data
Vital signs
Bayley Scales of Infant Development (see Section 7.2.5)
Health status questionnaire (health problems, illnesses, injuries, well-being, diet, respiratory 
assessment).
7.2 Investigations
7.2.1 Immunogenicity assessment
An immunogenicity assessment in serum will be carried out in about 400 µL blood sample 
additionally collected prior to test treatment administration and approximately at 5 weeks after 
administration (with a window from 3 to 6 weeks).In case there is no possibility to obtain the blood 
sample pre-dose without delaying the baby clinical care, a window of maximum 2 hours is allowed 
after surfactant administration.
 
To obtain serum, after collection the blood is allowed to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room 
temperature. This usually takes 15-30 minutes. The clot is than removed by centrifugation at 1,000-
2,000 x g for 10 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge and serum is the resulting supernatant.
It is important to immediately transfer the liquid component (serum) into a clean polypropylene 
tube using a Pasteur pipette. The samples should be maintained at 2-8°C while handling and then 
stored below –65°C until shipped to the central laboratory ( ) for the immunogenicity assay. A 
laboratory manual will be provided to the clinical sites by .
In case the treated baby is transferred to another hospital site, the blood sample will be taken by a 
trained study team member of the original site in which the baby received the study treatment and

hours, to be processed according to the above procedures.
The measure of anti-SP-B and anti-SP-C antibodies will be evaluated by a titration versus a positive 
control serum (GP) diluted in buffer solution. The titer is expressed as the dilution at which the 
sample exhibited a 0.050 absorbance (background). The entire range of dilutions will be plotted 
versus optical density. If a sigmoidal profile of the curve will be observed, it will show that the 
serum contains a significant level of antibodies.

this assessment and the samples will be shipped to the following address:
     
7.2.2 Biomarkers of Inflammation
CXCL8, Interleukin 1β (IL1β), Interleukin 6 (IL6), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) will be collected prior to study drug administration, at 24±1 hours and on 
day 2 (48±1 hours) (in a subgroup of babies who require endotracheal intubation for mechanical 
ventilation, when feasible). In case the baby is extubated earlier than 24 or 48 hours and when 
feasible, the tracheal aspirate can be collected at any time closest to the above time points. 
The suggested procedure to collect the tracheal aspirates is the following:
 After instillation of 0.5 ml of 0.9% saline through the endotracheal tube, a 5 F catheter is 
inserted slightly beyond the distal tip of the endotracheal tube and all the secretions are 
aspirated. The tracheal secretions are collected through a Luken’s trap. Three to five 
manual or ventilator breaths are given between instillation of saline and suctioning. 
 The whole procedure is then repeated.
 The suction catheter is then flushed with 0.5mL of normal saline to collect the residual 
sample in the catheter. The final volume should be 1 ml.
The infant’s heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation will be monitored and allowed to 
stabilize during the suctioning procedure. 
The collected tracheal aspirate need to be immediately chilled in ice bath and centrifuged at 2000 x 
g for 15 min within 1 h. The supernatant will be recovered, divided into aliquots and kept below -65 
°C until shipment to the central laboratory for analysis. Further details will be described in the 
laboratory manual that will be provided to each clinical site.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 39/627.2.3 A-a oxygen gradient and Oxygenation Index
Alveolar-arterial (A–a) oxygen gradient is a measure of the difference between the alveolar 
concentration of oxygen and the arterial concentration of oxygen obtained from the following 
equation: 
Oxygenation Index (OI) is defined as the ratio of RSS and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial 
blood (PaO 2). 
Both OI and A-a gradient require an arterial blood gas analysis to calculate PaO 2. Given the 
challenges to placing arterial catheters in pre-term neonates, these parameters will be measured at 3, 
6, 12, 18, 24 and 2 days post treatment (only in a subgroup of babies when feasible). 
7.2.4 Vital signs and Blood tests
Heart rate and SatO 2 are measured by pulse oximetry 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are measured in a non-invasive way 
Blood tests can be performed with an arterial, capillary or venous sample. 
The following blood tests are to be performed: FBC, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, glucose, ALT, 
AST, CRP:  1-3 ml (depending on centers’ assays). 
7.2.5 Bayley scale
Bayley Scales of Infant Development is a standard series of measurements used primarily to 
assess the motor (fine and gross), language (receptive and expressive), and cognitive development 
of infants and toddlers, aged 0-3. This measure consists of a series of developmental play tasks 
and takes between 45 - 60 minutes to administer. Raw scores of successfully completed items are 
converted to scale scores and to composite scores. These scores are used to determine the child's 
neurodevelopmental performance compared with norms taken from typically developing children 
of their age (in months). Completed by the parent or caregiver, this questionnaire establishes the 
range of adaptive behaviors that the child can currently achieve and enables comparison with age 
norms.

10. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING
10.1 Definitions
An Adverse Event is, “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.” An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
Clini
cal Study Protocol No.: CCD-5633AA1-02 Version No.: 4.0
IND No.: 122619  Date: 31st January 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 42/62temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.
An Adverse Drug Reaction is an, “untoward and unintended response to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any dose administered.”
All adverse events judged by either the reporting Investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable 
causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression, “reasonable 
causal relationship,” means to convey in general that there are facts (evidence) or arguments meant 
to suggest a causal relationship.
The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, 
including misuse and abuse of the product.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is any untoward medical 
occurrence or effect that at any dose falls in one or more of the following categories:
- Results in death
Death is not an adverse event but an outcome. It is the cause of death that should be regarded as
the adverse event. The only exception to this rule is, “sudden death,” where no cause has been
established; in this latter instance, “sudden death,” should be regarded as the adverse event and,
“fatal,” as its reason for being serious.
- Is life-threatening
Life-threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the
event (e.g., aplastic anaemia, acute renal failure, and anaphylaxis). The term does not refer to
an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
- Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Hospitalization refers to a situation whereby an AE is associated with unplanned overnight
admission into hospital, usually for purpose of investigating and/or treating the AE.
Hospitalization for the treatment of a medical condition that occurs on an, “elective,” or,
“scheduled,” basis or for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study should
not necessarily be regarded as an AE. Complications that occur during the hospitalization are
AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization, the event is an SAE.
Emergency room visits that do not result in a formal admission into hospital should be
evaluated for one of the other seriousness criteria (e.g., life-threatening; persistent or significant
disability or incapacity; medically significant).
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
The term significant disability should be viewed as any situation whereby an AE has a
clinically important effect on the subject’s physical or psychological well-being to the extent
that the subject is unable to function normally.
- Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (not applicable for this study)
-Is a medically significant adverse event

cal Study Protocol No.: CCD-5633AA1-02                                          Version No.: 4.0
IND No.: 122619                                                                    Date: 31st January 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 43/62This criterion allows for any situations in which important adverse events/reactions that are not 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospitalization may jeopardize the 
subject’s health or may require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.
Examples of such events are: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an event is serious 
because medically significant.
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.
A Non-Serious Adverse Event/Non-Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is an adverse event or 
adverse drug reaction that does not meet the criteria listed above for a serious adverse event/serious 
adverse drug reaction. 
10.2 Expectedness
An expected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent 
with the applicable Reference Safety Information (Investigator’s Brochure for CHF 5633 and 
Summary of Product Characteristics for Curosurf®), otherwise it is considered unexpected. 
Reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented serious adverse drug reaction constitute unexpected events. For example, an event 
more specific or more severe than described in the Investigator’s Brochure would be considered as 
“unexpected”. General examples of such events are: (a) acute renal failure as a labelled ADR with a 
subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant 
hepatitis.
10.3 Intensity of Adverse Event
The investigator is asked to assess the intensity of all the adverse events and to report them in the 
eCRF.
The intensity (severity) of a specific event is defined as mild, moderate, or severe; the event itself, 
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the 
same as "serious," which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to a participant's functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
Each Adverse Event must be rated on a 3-point scale of increasing intensity:
Mild: The event causes a minor discomfort, or does not lead to establishment of a correcting 
treatment.
Moderate: The event perturbs the usual functioning of the subject. The event leads to the 
establishment of a correcting treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 44/62Severe:  The event prevents any usual functioning of the subject.
10.4 Causality Assessment 
The following “binary” decision choice will be used by the Investigator to describe the causality 
assessment with the study medication:
- Reasonable possibility of a relatedness 
- No reasonable possibility of relatedness 
The expression “reasonable possibility of relatedness” is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments meant to suggest a causal relationship. 
The Investigator will be asked to consider the following before reaching a decision on causality 
assessment:
- Time relationship between study drug intake and event’s onset;
- Medical history;
- Lack of efficacy/worsening of existing condition;
- Study treatment(s);
- Mechanism of action of the study drug;
- Class effects;
- Other treatments-concomitant or previous;
- Erroneous treatment with study medication (or concomitant);
-Protocol related process.
10.5 Action taken with study drug due to the AE
Since patients will receive a single dose of study drug, “action taken with study drug” will be not 
applicable.
10.6 Other actions taken
- Specific therapy/medication
- (Prolonged) Hospitalization
- Surgical/medical procedure
10.7 Outcome
Each Adverse Event outcome must be described by choosing among:
- Recovered/resolved
- Recovering/resolving
- Not recovered/not resolved
- Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae
- Fatal
- Unknown
10.8 Recording Adverse Events
All AEs occurring during the course of the study must be documented in the Adverse Event page of 
the eCRF. Moreover, if the Adverse Event is serious, the Serious Adverse Event Form must also be 
completed.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 45/62It is responsibility of the Investigator to collect all adverse events (both serious and non-serious).
As a general rule, the recording period for Adverse Events is the period starting from the Informed 
Consent signature until the subject’s study participation ends.
However, the complications of prematurity, listed below, are clinically expected outcomes in 
preterm neonates aged between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks. Therefore, if started before drug 
administration, they haven’t to be reported as AEs but in the relevant section of the eCRF. 
While the occurrence or worsening of these complications of prematurity after test

• Air leaks (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum);
• anemia of prematurity;
• apnea of prematurity;
• necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC); 
• patent ductus arteriosus (PDA);
• pneumonia;

o hyperglycaemia
o hypocalcaemia
o hypercalcaemia
o hyponatraemia
o hypernatraemia
ohypokalaemia
ohyperkalaemia. 
For study definitions see appendix II and its references.
The investigator should carefully check inclusion and exclusion criteria because some of these 
morbidities may not allow the neonate to be randomized.
If a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment detected during 
the study period meets the definition of an AE, then the AE eCRF page must be completed, as 
appropriate. A diagnosis, if known, or clinical signs and symptoms if diagnosis is unknown, rather 
than the clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, should be reported on the AE eCRF

finding should be recorded.
For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed-up in order to elucidate as 
completely and practically as possible their nature and/or causality until resolution of all queries, 
clinical recovery is complete, laboratory results have returned to normal, stable condition is reached 
or until the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up may therefore continue after the subject has left 
the study. In this case, the follow-up will continue with no timelines for related SAEs, while for 
unrelated SAEs the type and extent of follow-up undertaken will be determined for each individual 
case and will depend upon the nature (e.g. events with poor prognosis or which do not resolve), 
severity and medical significance of the event.
Follow-up may therefore continue after the patient has been discharged from the NICU.
10.9 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor
The Investigator must report all Serious Adverse Events to the  Safety Contact within 24 
hours of awareness. The information must be sent by providing the completed Serious Adverse 
Event form. At a later date, the Safety Contact will report all information to Chiesi Global 
Pharmacovigilance, the Clinical Project Manager and the Clinical Research Physician.

Reporting of SAEs from the investigator site is from the time of subject’s signature of 
informed consent and until the subject’s study participation ends. Moreover, even after the 
end of the study, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE and deems it as related to study 
drug, he/she should report this SAE. 
Up to the closure of the recruiting site, these SAE reports should be reported to the CRO 
Safety Contact. All related SAEs occurring after the recruiting site is closed should be directly 
reported to the Sponsor Safety Contact.
10.10 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities/Ethics Committees/IRB
The Sponsor or designated CRO will report adverse events to the regulatory authorities in 
compliance with the timelines and standards of reporting according to local regulations (Guidance 
for industry and Investigators-Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE studies,

CONFIDENTIAL Page 47/62December 2012). All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), which occur with 
the investigational medicinal product or marketed active comparator, within or outside the 
concerned clinical trial, will be reported by the Sponsor or designated CRO to regulatory 
authorities, as required, as well as to the Investigators and Central IRB, if applicable, by 
MedWatch/CIOMS form. The Investigator (or Sponsor/CRO where required) must inform the IRB 
per Sponsor instruction upon receipt of the SUSAR notification. An IND and/or NDA Safety 
Report will be submitted to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating Investigators and IRB 
will receive a blinded IND Safety Report, unless otherwise specified. 
10.11 General Notes
- In case of death, a comprehensive narrative report of the case should be prepared by the 
Investigator and provided to the  Safety Contact together with the Serious Adverse 
Event form, retaining a copy on site;
- If an autopsy is performed, copy of autopsy report should be actively sought by the 
Investigator and provided to the  Safety Contact as soon as available, retaining a 
copy on site;
- If a baby is transferred to a continuing care site prior to discharge home, the investigator 
should ensure that the receiving hospital site is aware that the baby is participating to the 
present study and communication should be maintained in order to record any adverse 
event. Moreover, the investigator of the recruiting site will have to provide the continuing 
care site with written instruction about management and reporting of SERIOUS AE. After 
discharge home from the continuing care site a copy of the discharge summary letter 
should be requested in order to cross reference any adverse events and to determine if the 
baby is suffering from BPD. 
10.12 Independent Safety Monitoring Board  
An Independent Safety Monitoring Board (ISMB) will be established to ensure the safety of study 
subjects on an on-going basis. The involvement of independent expert advisors will provide an 
unbiased evaluation of the overall safety in the study, with particular regard to the incidence of 
major adverse outcomes (i.e. Serious Adverse Events) following study treatment administration.
The ISMB will be composed by independent Clinicians and one independent Biostatistician.
The ISMB will have periodical face-to face or telephone meetings, as appropriate, and a Safety 
Assessment Report will be issued after each meeting.
The Sponsor (and other study personnel) may be involved in some parts of the ISMB meetings, 
however, they will never have access to unblinded data and/or unblinded/coded comparisons.
All ISMB members will keep as confidential all information and data deriving from the ISMB 
activity, without disclosing them to others.
The complete ISMB guidelines including details regarding the members, duties and responsibilities, 
work and communication processes, frequency of meetings will be established by the ISMB 
members during the first meeting and reported in a separate charter.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 48/6211. DATA MANAGEMENT
An electronic case report form (eCRF) to be filled in by the investigator and/or his/her designee will 
be used. 
Front-end edit checks will run at the time of data collection and back-end edit checks will be run by 
the Data Manager to check for discrepancies and to ensure consistency and completeness of the 
data. 
Complications of prematurity, procedures and adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA 
dictionary; medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary and Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical classification (ATC). The same dictionaries will be used to code mother’s medical 
history, complications during pregnancy and mother’s prenatal medications.
External data (Immunogenicity and Biomarkers of Inflammation) will be processed centrally and 
reconciled against data recorded in the eCRF as part of cleaning activities.
Laboratory normal ranges will be collected prior to FPFV at each site and provided to CRO data 
management that will enter them in the eCRF. Laboratory results will be entered in the eCRF by the 
investigator.
After cleaning of data, a review meeting will be held to determine the occurrence of any protocol 
violation and to define the patient populations for the analysis. 
Once the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, the 
randomization codes will be opened and the planned statistical analysis will be performed. Only 
authorised and well-documented updates to the study data are possible after database lock. 
A CD-ROM of the patient data will be sent after database lock at the investigational site for 
archiving.
The 24-month clinical assessment data will be collected by a paper CRF and recorded in a separate 
database.
12. STATISTICAL METHODS
12.1 Sample Size
According to the exploratory nature of this this study, no formal power calculation was performed.
A maximum number of sixty-three (63) randomized neonates per treatment group (126 in total) is 
deemed sufficient to describe the efficacy and safety profile of CHF5633 compared to Poractant 
Alfa.
12.2 Populations for analysis
The following populations will be considered for the analysis:
Intention-to-Treat population (ITT): all randomized patients who received at least 
one dose of study medication and with at least one available evaluation of efficacy 
after the baseline.
Safety population: all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study 
medication.

      LIST OF STUDY DEFINITIONS
Air leaks will be documented by evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, 
pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum on radiograph (20). 
Anemia of prematurity is defined by a haemoglobin or haematocrit value that is more than 
two standard deviation below the mean for age (21)
Apn
oea of prematurity is defined as pause in breathing > 20 sec, or <20 sec if accompanied 
by bradycardia and/or cyanosis (22)
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is defined according to the diagnostic criteria recently 
proposed by the NICHD / NHLBI / ORD Workshop (23): 
Time point of assessment and general criterion - 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) or 
discharge home, whichever comes first; treatment with oxygen > 21% for at least 28 
days plus the below reported additional criteria: 
Additional criteria: 
Mild BPD = breathing room air at 36 weeks PMA or at discharge; 
Moderate BPD = need for < 30% oxygen at 36 weeks PMA or at discharge;
Severe BPD = need for >30% oxygen and/or positive pressure at 36 weeks PMA or at 
discharge.
Hypercalcaemia: Ca tot > 11 mg/dl
Hyperglycaemia: > 175 mg/dl (in 2 separate occasions at least 6 hours apart)
Hyperkalaemia: K+>6,0 mmol/l 
Hypernatraemia: > 150 mEq/l (operational value > 155 or an increasing trend)
Hypocalcaemia: Ca tot < 7,0 mg/dl
Hypoglycaemia: < 40 mg/dl (operational values < 45 in day 1st and 50 further days)
Hypokalaemia: K+<3 mmol/l 
Hyponatraemia: < 135 mEq/l (operational value < 130 or a decreasing trend)
Germinal matrix haemorrhage and Intraventricular haemorrhage will be determined 
according to Papile’s classification of cranial ultrasound findings of echodensity in the

Cerebral 
parenchymal haemorrhage will be determined according to the cranial ultrasound 
finding of an echogenic lesion that fans out from the ventricular wall into the brain substance, 
associated to a GMH/IVH 
Necrotizing enterocolitis is defined as stage 2 or higher as per modified Bell’s criteria (25).
Neonatal 
jaundice is defined as elevated total serum/plasma bilirubin (TB) levels, which 
results in yellowish discoloration of the skin, and/or conjunctiva caused by bilirubin deposition
Patent ductus arteriosus will be documented by echocardiography or if medically treated / 
surgically ligated / haemodinamically significant. 
Periventricular leukomalacia will be defined by development of periventricular cysts 
identified by cranial ultrasound. 
Pneumonia will be clinically diagnosed as the presence of infected tracheal aspirate in a 
neonate with deteriorating oxygenation or chest x-ray appearances of consolidation.
Pulmonary haemorrhage will be diagnosed when significant amounts of blood from the 
endtroacheal tube, mouth and nose together with deterioration in oxygenation.
Pulmonary interstitial emphysema will be diagnosed on chest X-ray appearance.
Retinopathy of prematurity will be defined as per the International Classification (26).
Sepsis will be diagnosed by a positive blood culture or suggestive clinical and laboratory 
presentation resulting in a clinical decision to treat with antibiotics despite the absence of a 
positive blood culture. 
24+0 TO ≤ 29+6 WEEKS GA: 24 weeks and 0 days to 29 weeks and 6 days. Gestational age 
is determined based on certain dates of last menstrual period or early ultrasound scan (i.e. 
performed at < 20 weeks). If a discrepancy of more than 2 weeks exists choose the early 
ultrasound scan.

Study Protocol  10 
The purpose of this study is to test a new approach for the early detection of DPN.  11 
Diabetes patients meeting the criteria were recruited from the Diabetes Clinics and non -diabetic 12 
subjects from the general veteran population.  A written and informed consent was obtained 13 
from all partic ipants. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the 14 
Institutional Review Board (#201610799).  Participants were divided into two groups: diabetic 15 
with peripheral neuropathy and non -diabetic with no history of peripheral neuropathy.  16 
Inclusion Criteria:  1) Type 2 diabetes diagnosed based on the opinion of an Endocrinologist, 17 
the absence of a history of ketoacidosis, and a C- peptide > 0.8 ng/ml. 2) At least 10 year known 18 
duration of diabetes. 3) Age ≥ 50 yr. 4) HbA1c < 9.0%. 5) Mild to moderate PN based on 19 
response to Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument  (MNSI) ,18 nerve conduction and 20 
amplitude determined using DPNCheck, medical record, presence or absence of  ankle reflex, 21 
vibration threshold and 10g monofilament  sensation. Exclusion Criteria : 1) Histor y of neurologic, 22 
muscular, genetic, or other condition known to affect muscle function or exercise tolerance. 2) 23 
Electrolyte abnormalities, untreated hypothyroidism, abnormalities in calcium, phosphate, or 24 
magnesium concentrations, or any other metabolic disturbance affecting neural function. 3) 25 
Cigarette smoking in the past year. 4) Peripheral vascular, cardiac, pulmonary, or any other 26 
disorder affecting blood or tissue oxygenation. 5 ) Use of any medication known to alter 27 
peripheral nerve function. 6) History of diabetic foot ulcer. 7) History of corneal disease including 28 
dry eye. 8) History of wearing contacts. 9) Any other medical or psychological condition judged 29 
to limit compliance  with the protocol or interpretation of results.  30 
The study included 28 patients with type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy (24 male 31 
and 4 female).  The average age of the diabetes patients was 66.8 ± 1.9, with duration of 32 
diabetes 20.0 ± 2.6 and hemoglobin A 1C 8.2 ± 0.3.  The non -diabetic subjects (11 male and 5 33 
female) were younger 49.8 ± 5.0.  34

 Clinical neuropathy assessment :  The MNSI questionnaire was self -administered.  35 
Each applicant was encouraged to answer yes or no to each of the 15 questions.  A score of ≥ 4 36 
was considered abnormal.  During the MNSI examination a health professional examined the 37 
feet, for deformities, dry skin, calluses, infections, and ulcers.  Quantitative sensory testing 38 
included the presence or absence of ankle reflexes  and vibration and monofilament sensation at 39 
the dorsum of the great toe.19  Nerve conduction values were determined using a point of care 40 
device DPNCheck ( DPN Check, NeuroMetrix, Inc., Waltham, MA).  Manufacture instructions 41 
were followed, briefly after skin preparation, the probes were coated with the conductive gel and 42 
applied directly to the skin, posterior to the lateral malleolus.20  Up to four recordings were made 43 
as individual tolerance allowed.  The recordings were averaged.  44 
Ophthalmic assessment:   All patients underwent a visual acuity assessment.  Provided 45 
answers to two questionnaires the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Dry Eye 46 
Questionnaire (DEQ -5).  To evaluate cornea sensitivity each patient underwent a Cochet - 47 
Bonnet aesthesiometer examination and blinking response determination following application 48 
of a drop of isotonic saline (308 mosmol/liter ) or Muro -128 solution 5%  sodium chloride (1710  49 
mosm ol/liter)  (Rugby Laboratories, Livonia, MI) .  This study was  perform ed by having the 50 
subject rest their chin comfortably on a support.   Three CMOS cameras (Imaging Development 51 
Systems GmbH, Obersulm, Germany), one positioned in front of the subject  and two positioned 52 
laterally, were  used to observe both eyes simultaneously .  Custom softwa re was  used to 53 
synchronize video streams and obtain images (MATLAB R2012a, The MathWorks I nc., Natick, 54 
MA).  Video was  taken continuously at 30fps of each subject  as an isotonic solution was 55 
delivered to the left eye.  The response was video recorded for 60 sec after a 10 sec delay .  56 
After a 15 min wash and rest period the procedure was repeated using a drop of Muro -128 57 
solution 5% sodium chloride.  An image collector was  used offline to retrieve video frames  every 58 
10 sec onds from each eye drop concentration epoch; therefore 15 images w ere analyzed 59 
subject  per solution .  Fiji image analysis software was used by a masked technician to measure 60 
4 
 the visible surface area of both eyes  between the upper and lower eyelids.  In each recording 61 
epoch, the ratio of time the eyelids were closed are presented as a percentage of the subjects ’ 62 
maximum visible eye surface area between the eyelids during that epoch.  63 
Data Analysis  64 
Results are presented as mean ± S.E.M.  Compar isons between the control  and diabetic 65 
subjects  were conducted using Student t -test (Prism software; GraphPad, San Diego, CA).   A p 66 
value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.  67

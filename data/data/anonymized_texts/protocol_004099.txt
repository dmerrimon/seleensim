Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The order of the sequential non-inferiority assessment hypothesis
testing has been modified in this amendment. The main study recruited participants not previously infected
by SARS-CoV-2 and not previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine to evaluate the non-inferiority
of different dose levels on immune responses following 1 or 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S. For the non-
inferiority analysis set, participants were to remain N serology negative at the respective timepoint of the
non-inferiority assessment. During the course of the study, an unexpectedly high number of participants
had symptomatic or asymptomatic infections and would therefore be eliminated from the analysis affecting
the power of the study to conclude non-inferiority. Participants that have been recruited in the sub study
and were not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine will be part
of the non-inferiority analysis of the main study However, not all dose levels in the main study (6 dose
levels)  are represented in the sub study (4 dose levels) . Consequently, dose level groups that are in common
will have a larger sample size than those present only in the main study and will have a higher power to
conclude non-inferiority. As the non-inferiority assessment follows a sequential hypothesis testing, the
order of the sequential hypothesis testing has been modified in this amendment.
For all participants, given that approved COVID-19 vaccines exist for the adult population in all countries
in which VAC31518COV3003 is being conducted, if participants need to receive boosters, they may be
vaccinated outside of the study as a part of their national vaccination campaign after the participants have
completed their last study visit. Once the primary analysis results are available (post vaccination 2) ,
investigators will be notified to contact participants in groups who received a dose level of Ad26.COV2.S
that did not meet non-inferiority post vaccination 2 to advise them that they should receive a booster of a
COVID-19 vaccine that is licensed/authorized through their national COVID-19 vaccination health care
program if not done already.
In addition, due to extensive follow up data available after vaccination across the Ad26.COV2.S program,
including up to 12 months, the follow up in this protocol has been reduced from 12 months to 6 months
after last vaccination.

1.4.12-dose Vaccination Schedule 
for Participants in the Main Study 
1.4.22-dose Vaccination Schedule 
for the Sub Study ParticipantsGiven the follow up period has 
been reduced to 6 months, there are 
some participants in the study who 
would have already had their 6-

a final phone call for safety follow
up has been added.To capture any additional safety

9.1Statistical Hypotheses Text has been added explaining the 
change in the sequential order of 
non-inferiority testing. The 2.5x1010 vp dose will be tested
before the 7x1010 vp in the
sequential testing due to an
increased risk to fail non-inferiority
as a consequence of a smaller
sample size in the 7x1010 vp group.

9.2Sample Size Determination Added the expected power based on 
% of dropout due to various reasons 
(eg, lost to follow-up, participants 
with major protocol deviations with 
impact on immunogenicity,
participants who become N-
seropositive during the study or
with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection, and participants who
received their vaccination outside
the allowed window) . Also, an
explanation for the possible
addition of the sub study
participants in the primary analysis
has been added.The power calculations show why
the sub study participants need to
be added to the main study primary

1.1. Synopsis
A Randomized, Double-blind, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate 6 Dose Levels of Ad26.COV2.S Administered
As a Two-Dose Schedule in Healthy Adults
Ad26.COV2.S (also known as Ad26COVS1)  is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant,
replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26)  vector, constructed to encode the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)  spike (S)  protein, stabilized in its prefusion
conformation, which will be assessed in this study.
Information about the disease, correlates of immunity, and safety issues concerning this new pandemic-
causing virus are rapidly evolving. Therefore, it is critical to recognize that the approach outlined in this
document might or will change as insights and discussions evolve.

If a correlate or threshold for protection against COVID-19 is established in terms of humoral immunity,
then a statistical comparison to that correlate or threshold will substitute non-inferiority testing to immune
responses to vaccine at release, as outlined in a revised analytical plan.
Hypotheses
Formal non-inferiority (NI)  testing will be applied to demonstrate NI of 1-dose and 2-doses of 9×1010 vp,
2.5x1010 vp, 7×1010 vp, 3.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S versus 1-dose and 2-doses of
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (release titer) , using a NI margin of 2/3 for the GMC ratios.
OVERALL DESIGN
Main Study
This is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study to evaluate 6 dose levels of Ad26.COV2.S administered
as a 2-dose schedule in healthy adults. In this main study, the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of
1 dose (dose 1 of the 2-dose regimen)  and 2-doses of Ad26.COV2.S will be evaluated. The lower dose
(3.5x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp)  levels mimic vaccine degradation to enable determination of
product expiry. In order to increase the end of shelf-life specifications a potential target release titer of
7x1010 vp will be evaluated. A higher titer of 9x1010 vp will also be evaluated as is the upper limit of the
release range (potential maximum vp at release) . The study population will consist of healthy men and
women aged between 18 and 55 years (inclusive) , who have not previously received a vaccine against
COVID-19 and have not had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 as assessed by local serology testing.
Participants will receive Ad26.COV2.S administered IM.
A target ofapproximately, 1,350 participants (225 participants per active vaccine group)  in the main study
will be randomized in parallel in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 6 vaccination groups in this study. Participants

a Vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S may interfere with some serologic assays utilized at local community health
clinics/commercial laboratories, by seeking and identifying the spike protein in the vaccine and rendering a
false positive result. For this reason, participants will be encouraged to not seek serological testing outside the
study.

After each vaccination, participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least 15 minutes
for the presence of any acute reactions and solicited events. Participants will be asked to note in the diary
occurrences of injection site pain/tenderness, erythema and swelling at the study vaccine injection site daily
for 7 days post vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) . Participants will also be
instructed on how to note signs and symptoms in the diary on a daily basis for 7 days post vaccination (day
of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) , for the following events: fatigue, headache, nausea, and myalgia.
Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer provided for home
use. Participants should record the temperature in the diary in the evening of the day of vaccination, and
then daily for the next 7 days approximately at the same time each day.
AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, that are related to study procedures or
that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be reported from the time a signed and dated
ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early withdrawal. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
is considered to be an AESI. Suspected AESIs (thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia [defined as platelet
count below 150,000/µLa])  will be reported from the moment of vaccination until the end of the study/early
withdrawal. An AESI Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be established to evaluate
each suspected AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS. All other unsolicited AEs will be reported
for each vaccination from the time of vaccination until 28 days post vaccination. All SAEs and AEs leading
to discontinuation from the study/vaccination (regardless of the causal relationship)  will be reported from
the moment of first vaccination until completion of the participant’s last study-related procedure.
MAAEs are defined as AEs with medically-attended visits including hospital, emergency room, urgent care
clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel for any reason. Routine study visits will not be considered
medically-attended visits. New onset of chronic diseases will be collected as part of the MAAEs. MAAEs
are to be reported from the moment of vaccination until 6 months after the vaccination.
STATISTICAL METHODS
The number of participants chosen is to provide sufficient power for the non-inferiority comparisons.
The following assumptions were made in the sample size determinations:
 Log transformed (log10 scale)  immune response data are normally distributed
 A common standard deviation (SD) : SD=0.5 (log10 scale)  of the immune response log transformed
data
 Non-inferiority margin = log10(2/3)  = -0.176
 Alpha = 0.0125 (1-sided)  for 1- and 2-dose NI comparisons
 Power = 90%
Based on the above assumptions, a sample size of 225 per group is needed (assuming a 10.2% dropout rate)
to detect non-inferiority with 90% power. An additional 40 seronegative and 20 seropositive participants
per Groups 1, 3, 5, and 6 (a target of approximately240 participants)  will be enrolled to further characterize
the innate, pro-inflammatory and other relevant (eg, pro-thrombotic) responses to Ad26.COV2.S to better
understand a possible risk to TTS events.

The sponsor may be unblinded for this study, but the blind will be maintained at the participant and study
site level up to study end.
The primary analysis, which will be performed on unblinded data, will include safety up to Day 85 and
immunogenicity up to Day 71 in the main study and sub study for all groups and will be performed when
all participants have completed the visit that takes place 85 days after the first study vaccination or
discontinued earlier.
The final analysis for the main study will be performed when all included participants from the main study
have completed their last visit (at least 6 months post last vaccination)  ordiscontinued earlier. Results from
participants in the sub study may be available with the main study. Results from the main study and sub
study may be combined in one report.
Depending on availability of results, primary and final analysis might be combined.
Further interim analyses may be performed for safety and/or immunogenicity to facilitate decision making
with regards to planning of future studies or for regulatory submission purposes.
For all participants, given that approved COVID-19 vaccines exist for the adult population in all countries
in which VAC31518COV3003 is being conducted, if participants need to receive boosters, they may be
vaccinated outside of the study as a part of their national vaccination campaign after the participants have
completed their last study visit. Once primary analysis results are available (post vaccination 2) ,
investigators will be notified to contact participants in groups who received a dose level of Ad26.COV2.S
that did not meet non-inferiority post vaccination 2 to advise them that they should receive a booster of a
COVID-19 vaccine that is licensed/authorized through their national COVID-19 vaccination health care
program if not already received.
Unblinding due to availability of an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine
Investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an
authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine at the efficacious dose if/when these become available, including
the sponsors. In these cases, the investigator will discuss with the participant available options and
ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an authorized/licensed vaccine according to local
immunization guidelines or recommendation and if the participant wishes to proceed with the unblinding,
the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures. The reason for the unblinding request should be
documented. The name and date(s)  of administration of the other COVID-19 vaccine should be recorded
(see body of the protocol for more details) .
If the participant prefers another company’s vaccine, they will be informed that there are no data on the
safety of receiving two different COVID-19 vaccines. In the event of the participant unblinding in order to
receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine, no further study vaccination will be permitted.
Unblinded participants will be asked to continue to be followed in this study in line with the schedule of
activities to the extent that they permit. Safety and immunogenicity evaluations will be identical for all
participants, including participants that are unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine
and who remain in the study, if applicable and feasible. All data will be analyzed separately from the point
of unblinding, for safety and immunogenicity analysis, as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .

j. Investigator must check for acute illness or body temperature ≥38.0°C/100.4°F at the time of vaccination. If any of these events occur within 24 hours prior to
planned vaccination, the vaccination can be rescheduled as long as this is in agreement with the allowed windows. If the vaccination visit cannot be rescheduled
within the allowed window or the contraindications to vaccination persist, the sponsor should be contacted for further guidance. The investigator should also check
if any other reasons, as listed in Section 7.1, Discontinuation of Study Vaccination, have been met and would prevent further study vaccination.
k. For women of childbearing potential only.
l. Serum collected can also be used for N-serology testing.
m. Whole blood samples will be used for a platelet count (as part of a complete blood count if applicable)  in a local laboratory or substitute for local laboratory,
depending on local feasibility towards turnaround time of sample processing. Serum and plasma samples will be stored for coagulation-related testing in a central
laboratory, some of which will be conducted retrospectively (See Section 10.2, Appendix 2) .
n. This blood draw occurs in the ongoing study for monitoring breakthrough infections and will be performed by a central laboratory.
o. Participants will be closely observed for a minimum of 15 minutes post vaccination. Any solicited local (at injection site)  and systemic AEs, unsolicited AEs,
SAEs, concomitant medications, and vital signs will be documented by study site personnel following this observation period and participants will be allowed to
leave the study site after it is documented that the 15 minutes post vaccination observation period is complete.
p. AEs and special reporting situations that are related to study procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be reported from the time a
signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early withdrawal. All other unsolicited AEs and special reporting situations will be reported for each
vaccination from the time of vaccination until 28 days post vaccination.
q. All SAEs related to study procedures or non-investigational sponsor products will be reported for all participants from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained
until the end of the study/early withdrawal. All other SAEs are to be reported for all participants from the moment of first vaccination until completion of the
participant’s last study-related procedure. Suspected AESIs are to be reported from the moment of vaccination until completion of the participant’s last study-
related procedure (see Section 8.3.1) .
r. At each visit the participant will be asked if they have had a private/off-study COVID-19 test. If a participant receives a positive SARS-CoV-2 result from a
private/off-study test (whether through PCR or serological testing)  during the study, and the positive result occurs within 28 days after vaccination, the event will
be reported as an AE. If it occurs after 28 days, the event will be recorded as an SAE only if the event qualifies as serious. If the event occurs after 28 days, and it
is not serious, it will be reported in the eCRF. The participant can continue in the study for safety follow-up if they choose to; however, this must be in accordance

The medical management of thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia is different from the
management of isolated thromboembolic diseases. Study site personnel and/or treating physicians
should follow available guidelines for treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenia (eg. from the
American Society of Hematology [ American Society of Hematology 2021 ], British Society of
Haematology - Expert Haematology Panel [ British Society for Haematology. Guidance 2021 ], and
the CDC [ CDC 2021 ]) . The use of heparin may be harmful and alternative treatments may be
needed. Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Management of the
participant should not be delayed by decision-making of the Janssen Adjudication Committee.
In the event of a suspected thrombotic event or TTS, laboratory assessments (to be performed
locally)  might be needed to facilitate diagnosis and determine treatment options, including but not
limited to platelet count and anti-PF4 tests.
Additional blood samples should be collected for central laboratory testing as detailed below.
However, results of central laboratory testing may not be available to guide immediate treatment
decisions.

Stud
y VAC31518COV3003 is being conducted under the sponsorship of Janssen (Janssen
Vac
cines & Prevention B.V) .
COVID-19 Vaccine and Considerations
Currently, there is only limited availability oflicensed/authorized vaccines for the prevention
of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) . The continued development of safe and effective
vaccines is considered critical to contain the current outbreak and help prevent future outbreaks.
Although the quantitative correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been
identified, neutralizing antibody responses against the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
S protein have been associated with protection against experimental SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
infection in nonclinical models ( Chen 2005, Zhao 2017 ) . Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-
2 has several similarities to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis
and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage ( Letko 2020,
Lu 2020, Zhou 2020 ).Therefore, a neutralizing antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein may also have a protective effect.
Adenoviral-vectored Vaccines
Recombinant, replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors are attractive candidates for expression
of foreign genes for a number of reasons. The adenoviral genome is well characterized and
comparatively easy to manipulate. Adenoviruses exhibit broad tropism, infecting a variety of
dividing and non-dividing cells. The adenoviral vaccine (AdVac®) vector platform, developed by
Crucell HollandB.V. (nowJanssen Vaccines & PreventionB.V.)allows forhigh-yieldproduction
of replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors, eg, Ad26, with desired inserts. The adenovirus E1
regionis deletedto renderthe vectorreplication-incompetent andcreate space fortransgenes, with
viral replication taking place in cells that complement for the E1 deletion in the virus genome.

Stat
us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022Ad26 has been selected as a potential vaccine vector because there is substantial nonclinical and
clinical experience with Ad26-based vaccines that demonstrate their capacity to elicit strong
humoral and cellular immune responses and their acceptable safety profile, irrespective of the
antigen transgene (see also Section 2.3.1) .
The immunogenicity profile of adenoviral vectors is illustrated by data obtained following the
immunization of adults with Ad26-vectored human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines
(Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV and Ad26.Mos4.HIV) , an Ad26-vectored Ebola virus vaccine
(Ad26.ZEBOV) , Ad26-vectored respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)  vaccines (Ad26.RSV.FA2 and
Ad26.RSV.preF) , an Ad26-vectored Zika virus vaccine (Ad26.ZIKV.001) , and an Ad26-vectored
malaria vaccine (Ad26.CS.01) . Antigen-specific antibody responses are observed in almost all
participants after 1 dose, in both naïve and pre-immune individuals (RSV) . These antibodies may
persist for a year or more (RSV)  after a single vaccination in pre-immune participants. They have
functional properties of neutralization (RSV, Zika) , crystallizable fragment (Fc) -mediated
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis
(HIV, malaria) . Furthermore, these data support an immunogenicity profile with emphasis on
T-helper cell type 1 (Th) 1 responses and demonstrate predominantly interferon gamma (IFN-γ)
and tumornecrosis factoralpha (TNF-α)production in clusterofdifferentiation (CD)4+andCD8+
T cells ( Barouch 2013, Milligan 2016, Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. Data on file ) .
Ad26.COV2.S Candidate Vaccine
The aimofthe COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program is to develop asafe andeffective
vaccine for the prevention ofCOVID-19. The candidate vaccine to be assessed in this study is
Ad26.COV2.S, which is a recombinant, replication-incompetent Ad26 encoding a prefusion
stabilizedvariantoftheSARS-CoV-2 S protein. TheparentalS proteinsequencewas derivedfrom
a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (Wuhan, 2019, whole genome sequence NC_045512) . The
selection ofantigen was based on previous work on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV candidate
vaccines ( Chen 2005, Faber 2005, Modjarrad 2019 ) . The S protein is the majorsurface protein on
coronaviruses and is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and mediating the fusion of
host and viral membranes, thereby facilitating virus entry into the cell ( Zhou 2004 ) .
SARS-CoV-2 Virology and COVID-19 Disease Burden
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA  Betacoronavirus
(Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2020,
Wu 2020 ). It was first identified following reports ofa cluster ofacute respiratoryillness cases in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, ChinainDecember2019 ( Li 2020 ) . Earlyepidemiological investigations
suggested that the majority ofearly cases were linked to a seafood market, with patients infected
through zoonotic or environmental exposure, followed by the subsequent spread ofinfection by
human-to-human transmission among close contacts ( Li 2020 ) . However, there is some
controversy about the initial origin of the virus ( Cyranoski 2020 ) . Genomic sequencing was
performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with viral pneumonia
admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, which identified a novel RNA  virus from  the family
Coronaviridae ( Lu 2020, WHO 2005a ) . Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome
revealed that the virus, SARS-CoV-2, is part of the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus

CoV-like coronaviruses previously sampled from bats in China ( Lu 2020 ) .
SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly and globally since its emergence. The WHO declared that the
outbreak constituted a public health emergencyof international concern on January 30, 2020 and
declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020 ( WHO 2005a, WHO 2020c) . As of
December 11th, 2020, approximately69,688,577 casesofCOVID-19 andapproximately1,584,063
COVID-19-related deaths have been reported ( Johns Hopkins CSSE 2020 ) .
Symptoms of infection may appear from 2 to 14 days following exposure, with the clinical
manifestations ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness or death ( CDC 2020b ) . Severe
clinical presentations have been reported in as manyas 20% to 25% oflaboratory-confirmedcases
(ECDC 2020b ) . In a study of 99 patients in a single center in Wuhan with SARS-CoV-2
infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) , the
most commonlyreported clinical manifestations were fever (83%) , cough (82%) , shortness of
breath (31%) , and muscle aches (11%)( Chen 2020 ) . In chest X-rays and computed tomographic
(CT) scans, 75% of patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 14% of patients showed diffuse
mottling and ground-glass opacities. In a further study of 138 patients with novel coronavirus-
induced pneumonia in a single center in Wuhan, common symptoms included fever (98.6%) ,
fatigue (69.6%) , and dry cough (59.4%)( US Dept Health 1998 ) . Lymphopeniaoccurredin70.3%
ofpatients, and chest CT scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the
lungs of all patients. Thirty-six patients (26%)  were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU)
because ofcomplications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, andshock.
Subsequent US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) descriptions of COVID-19
clinical case definitions and Janssen-sponsored interviews with COVID-19-experienced
clinicians have included signs and symptoms of respiratory distress such as blue lips, extreme
shortness of breath and dyspnea, persistent cough, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) , Kawasaki-like
disease, discoloration offeet and toes, chills, shaking chills, loss of sense of taste and smell,
signs of stroke, disorientation, inability to respond or understand verbal communication, among
others.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 follows the emergence of 2 other novel betacoronaviruses
capable of causing severe human disease over the past 18years: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
which have nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 of approximately 79%  and 50%,
respectively ( Lu 2020 ) . The first known cases of SARS occurred in Southern China in
November 2002 ( WHO 2004 ) . The etiological agent, SARS-CoV, is believed to be an animal
virusthatcrossedthespeciesbarrierto humansfollowedbyhuman-to-humantransmission, leading
to SARS cases in >25 countries. The MERS-CoV was isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia
who died of severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure in June 2012 ( Zumla 2016 ) . MERS-
CoV is considered to be a zoonotic virus capable ofnonsustained human-to-human transmission.
Since 2012, sporadic cases and community and health-care-associated clusters of infected
individuals have been reported in the Middle East.

us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022Patients with SARS or MERS present with various clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic
or mild respiratory illness to fulminant severe acute respiratory disease with extrapulmonary
manifestations ( Chan 2015, Zumla 2016 ) . Both diseases have predominantly respiratory
manifestations, but extrapulmonary features may occur in severe cases. By July 2003, the
international spread of SARS-CoV resulted in 8,098SARS cases and 774 deaths (case-fatality
rate: 10%) with substantial social, economic and health service disruption in some affected
countries ( Chan 2015, WHO 2004 ) . The case-fatality rate of MERS-CoV infections is estimated
to be 35% ( Chan 2015 ) .
It is not known if SARS-CoV-2 will remain as a worldwide pandemic. It is also not known if
immunityis acquired after symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and how long it
might last. Currently, the only preventive measures that have been employed with some success
have been social distancing and quarantine after contact tracing and testing. Test and treat
approaches await an effective proven safe therapy that can be implemented on a mass scale. It is
generally believed that an effective vaccine will be 1 ofthe most important tools to help control
this highlycontagious respiratoryvirus.
The sponsor is developing a COVID-19 vaccine based on a human replication-incompetent Ad26
vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The S protein is the major surface protein of
coronaviruses. Different animal models have been used for the evaluation of candidate coronavirus
vaccines against SARS-CoV (2002-2003 outbreak) , and the common conclusion that has emerged
from the evaluation of several different vaccines is that the viral S protein is the only significant
target for neutralizing antibodies ( Buchholz 2004, Sui 2005, Zhang 2004, Zhou 2004 )and the only
viral protein that can elicit protective immunity in animal models ( Berry, 2004, Bisht 2004,
Bukreyev 2004, Subbarao 2004, Yang 2004 ) . Based on these findings, the S protein was selected
as the sponsor’s candidate vaccine antigen.

be found in Section 4.3.
The purpose of this study is to aid in the establishment of end-expiry specifications for the 1-dose
and 2-dose vaccine regimens being assessed in the Phase 3 efficacy studies VAC31518COV3001
and VAC31518COV3009, respectively. The lower dose (3.5 x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp)
levels mimic vaccine degradation to enable determination of product expiry. In order to increase the end of
shelf life specifications a potential target release titer of 7x1010 vpwill be evaluated. A higher titer of 9x1010
vp will also be evaluated as is the upper limit of the release range (potential maximum vp at release) . For
this study’s purpose 6 dose levels of Ad26.COV2.S will be assessed: 9x1010 vp,7x1010 vp, 5x1010
vp (release titer) , 3.5x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp. The following NI comparisons by
sequential approach will be performed:

Biodistribution
To assess distribution, persistence, and clearance of the Ad26 viral vector platform, intramuscular
(IM) biodistribution studies have been conducted in rabbits using an Ad26-based HIV vaccine,
Ad26.ENVA.01, and an Ad26-based RSV  vaccine, Ad26.RSV.preF. In the available
biodistribution studies, the Ad26 vector did not widely distribute following IM administration in
rabbits. Ad26 vector deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was primarilydetected at the site of injection,
draining lymph nodes and (to a lesser extent) the spleen. Clearance ofthe Ad26 vector from the
tissues was observed. Both Ad26 vectors showed a comparable biodistribution despite carrying
different antigen transgenes. These data further indicate that the Ad26 vector does not replicate
and/or persist in the tissues following IM injection. These platform data are considered sufficient
to inform  on the biodistribution profile of Ad26.COV2.S for which the same Ad26 vector
backbone is used.
Toxicology
The sponsor has significant nonclinical experience with Ad26-vectored vaccines using various
transgenes encoding HIV, RSV, Ebola virus, filovirus, human papilloma virus, Zika, influenza
(universal flu [Uniflu]) , and malaria antigens. To date, more than 10 Good Laboratory Practice
(GLP) combined repeated dose toxicology and local tolerance studies have been performed in
rabbits (and1 studyin rats) , testing the nonclinical safetyofvarious homologous andheterologous
regimens with Ad26-based vaccines at full human dose levels up to 1.2×1011 vp. No adverse
effects have been observed in these studies. The vaccine-related effects observed were similar
across studies, consideredto be reflective ofaphysiological response to the vaccines administered,
andseemto be independentofthe antigentransgene. Overall, there were no safetysignals detected
in any ofthe available GLP toxicology studies with Ad26-based vaccines up to the highest dose
level tested (1.2×1011 vp) . In a combined embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development GLP
studyin female rabbits with anotherAd26-based vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV, encoding an Ebola virus
antigen) , there was no maternal or developmental toxicity observed following maternal exposure
during the premating and gestation period. A repeated dose and local tolerance GLP study, and a
combined embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development GLP study with Ad26.COV2.S are
planned to run in parallel with studyVAC31518COV1001.
Clinical Studies
At the start of this study, the safety and immunogenicity (post-Dose 1) of Ad26.COV2.S,
administered at several dose levels, has been demonstrated in healthy adults in the first-in-human
study VAC31518COV1001 ( IB Ad26.COV2.S 2022, Sadoff2020 ) and is currently further
evaluated in Phase 2 study VAC31518COV2001. Based on the interim data of study
VAC31518COV1001, 2 clinical studies have been initiated to assess the protective efficacy of
Ad26.COV2.S at the 5x1010vp dose level, administered either as a 1-dose (study
VAC31518COV3001)  or as a 2-dose schedule (study VAC31518COV3009) .

Clinical Safety Experience With Ad26-based Vaccines
As described above, replication-incompetent Ad26 is being used as a vectorin the development of
vaccine candidates against diseases such as malaria, RSV, HIV, Ebola virus, Zika virus and
filovirus, and has been used in the now licensed Ebola virus vaccine (Zabdeno/Ad26.ZEBOV) .
As of 04 September 2020, Ad26-based vaccines, developed by the sponsor, have been
administered to approximately 114,000 participants in ongoing and completed studies, including
more than 99,000 participants in an ongoing Ebola vaccine study in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (VAC52150EBL3008/DRC-EB-001) , and an ongoing immunization campaign in
Rwanda (UMURINZI Ebola Vaccine Program campaign) .
The sponsor’s clinical AdVac®safety database report (V5.0, dated 10 April 2020, cut-off date
20 December 2019) describes integrated safety data from 26 completed clinical studies using
Ad26-based vaccines for which the database was locked for final analysis. In these 26 studies,
4,224 adult participants were vaccinated with an Ad26-based vaccine and 938 adult participants
received a placebo. A total of 6,004 Ad26-based vaccine doses were administered to adults. Most
adult participants (3,557 out of 4,224; 84.2%) received Ad26-based vaccine at a dose level of
5×1010 vp, while 284 adult participants (6.7%)received Ad26-based vaccine at the 1×1011 vp dose
level (the highest dose level tested) .
As of04 September 2020, more than 109,000 participants were enrolled in ongoing studies and
in the ongoing immunization campaign in Rwanda (UMURINZI Ebola Vaccine Program
campaign) . However, their safety data were not included in the AdVac® safety database report
V5.0 because the studies were still blinded, the studies were unblinded but their analysis took
place after the AdVac® safety database report cut-offdate, or the study data were not integrated
in the Ad26- based vaccine database used for the report.
Overall, the Ad26-based vaccines were well tolerated, irrespective of the antigen transgene,
without significant safety issues identified to date. See Section 2.3.1, Risks Related to Study
Participation for a summaryof data from the AdVac®safetydatabase report.
Th1/Th2 Prof ile of  Ad26-basedV accines in Clinical Studies
In the 1960s, a formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine was associated with enhanced respiratory
disease (ERD)  in young children, characterized by an increased rate of RSV-mediated, severe
lower respiratory tract infection in the vaccinated individuals compared with the control group
(Chin 1969, Fulginiti 1969, Kapikian 1969, Kim 1969 ) . Although the mechanisms for ERD are
not fullyunderstood, it is thought that the FI-RSV vaccine mayhave: 1)failed to induce adequate
neutralizing antibody titers; 2) led to an overproductionofbinding antibodies promotingimmune
complex deposition and hypersensitivity reactions; 3) failed to induce adequate numbers of
memory CD8+ T cells important for viral clearance; and 4) induced a T-helper cell (Th) type
2-skewed type T-cell response ( Moghaddam 2006 ) .

Stat
us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022Vaccine-induced ERD has also been described for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in some animal
models in which candidate vaccines induced a Th2 biased immune response ( Agrawal 2016,
Bolles 2011, Deming 2006, Honda-okubo 2015, Houser 2017, Smatti 2018 ) but proofofhuman
SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV vaccine-associated enhanced disease does not exist as these candidate
vaccines were never tested for efficacy nor used in outbreak situations. For SARS and MERS, the
mechanism  of enhanced disease observed in mice has been associated with a Th2-mediated
eosinophilic infiltration in the lung, which is reminiscent of ERD  effects observed after RSV
infection ofmice immunized with FI-RSV. Similar to RSV vaccines, enhanced disease has been
shown for whole-inactivated SARS-CoV  vaccines, as well as subunit vaccines inducing a
Th2-type immune response, which can be rescued by formulating vaccines in Th1-skewing
adjuvants. In addition to a Th1-biased immune response, also induction ofa high proportion of
neutralizing antibodies compared with virus binding antibodies is desirable to prevent
predisposition to enhanced disease as observed for RSV vaccines. While vaccine-associated
enhanced disease was observed in nonclinical studies with experimental SARS and MERS
vaccines, it is not a given that the same risk applies to COVID-19 vaccines To the sponsor’s
knowledge, antibody-related COVID-19 disease enhancement has not been observed in
nonclinical models yet. Antibodies against the receptor binding domain ofSARS-CoV-2 were
shown not to enhance in vitro infectivity. Repeated SARS-CoV-2 challenge of NHP or NHP
studies with Th2 biasing COVID-19 vaccines that would be expected to predispose to enhanced
disease did not show any signs of enhanced disease. In addition, disease enhancement was not
observed in NHP immunized with ChAdOx1 encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein prior to challenge
with SARS-CoV-2 ( IB Ad26.COV2.S. 2022 ) . The Ad26 vector was chosen due to its ability to
induce humoral and strong cellular responses with a Th1 immune phenotype ( Anywaine 2019,
Barouch 2018, Colby 202, Milligan 2016, Mutua 2019, Salisch 2019, Stephenson 2020,
van der Fits 2020, Widjojoatmodjo 2015, Zhan 2012 ) . This type 1 polarityofthe immune response
minimizes the risk ofenhanced disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The immunogenicity profile ofadenoviral vectors, with particular emphasis on Th1 responses, is
illustrated by data obtained from  immunization of adults with Ad26-vectored HIV  vaccines
(Ad26.ENVA.01 and Ad26.Mos4.HIV)and Ad26-vectored Ebolavaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV) . These
data show predominantly IFNγ and TNFα production in CD4+and CD8+T cells ( Anywaine 2019,
Barouch 2013, Barouch 2018 ) . In the RSV  vaccine clinical development program,
Ad26.RSV.preF w a s  evaluated in healthy RSV- seropositive toddlers aged 12 to 24 months

vp or a placebo. The immunogenicity of a single immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF in
RSV-seropositive toddlers aged 12 to 24 months, including a favorable Th1 bias, was confirmed.
In August 2020, the study had been completed and showed that Ad26.RSV.preF had an acceptable
safety and reactogenicity profile. In a further study of Ad26.RSV.preF in RSV-seronegative
toddlers aged 12 to 24 months (Phase 1/2a study VAC18194RSV2002) , initial safety data have
not revealed concerns after Ad26.RSV.preF vaccination.
In Study COV1001, Ad26.COV2.S induced cellular immune responses were assessed by ICS and
ELISpot. Robust CD4+ T and CD8+ T-cell responses were seen following a single vaccination

be found in the IB ( IB Ad26.COV2.S. 2022 ) .
2.3.1. Risks Rela ted to Study Pa rticipa tion
The following potential risks for Ad26.COV2.S will be monitored during the study and are
specified in the protocol:
Risks Related to Ad26.COV2.S
At the start of this study, the post-dose 1 safety and reactogenicity profiles of Ad26.COV2.S
(5x1010 and 1x1011 vp) were considered acceptable, as demonstrated in the interim analyses of
blinded safety data from approximately 800 participants (18 to 55 years of age [Cohort 1] and
≥65 years of age [Cohort 3])  in the first-in-human study VAC31518COV1001 ( Sadoff 2020 ) .
Local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants in Cohorts 1a and 3,
respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants in
Cohorts 1 and 3, respectively. Fevers occurred in 19% (5% Grade 3)  and 4% (0% Grade 3) of
participants of Cohorts 1 and 3, respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within
1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event was injection site pain and the
most frequent solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache and myalgia. The safety and
reactogenicity profiles of 2 dose levels, 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp were considered acceptable.
For the most comprehensive nonclinical information regarding Ad26.COV2.S, refer to the latest
version of the IB ( IB Ad26.COV2.S. 2022 ) .
Sites should advise participants that side effects include fever as well as injection site pain,
headache, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea per the current ICF.
Anaphylaxis is considered an important identified risk for Ad26.COV2.S. Individuals should be
observed by a healthcare provider after vaccination per protocol requirements. Refer to the latest
version of the IB and its addenda (if applicable)  for further details.
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (thrombosis withthrombocytopenia syndrome
[TTS]) , in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Reports include severe cases of venous thrombosis at unusual
sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) , splanchnic vein thrombosis and arterial
thrombosis, in combination with thrombocytopenia. These cases occurred approximately
1-2 weeks following vaccination, mostly in women under 60 years of age. Thrombosis in
combination with thrombocytopenia can be fatal. The exact physiology of TTS is unclear. TTS is
considered an important identified risk for Ad26.COV2.S. Participants should be instructed to seek

swelling, persistent abdominal pain, severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, skin bruising
and/or petechiae beyond the site of vaccination. The medical management of thrombosis with
thrombocytopenia is different from the management of isolated thromboembolic diseases. Study
site personnel and/or treating physicians should follow available guidelines for treatment of
thrombotic thrombocytopenia (eg, from the American Society of Hematology [ American Society
of Hematology. COVID-19 resources 2021 ], British Society of Haematology - Expert
Haematology Panel [ British Society for Haematology. Guidance produced from the Expert
Haematology Panel 2021 ] and the CDC [ CDC 2021 ]) . The use of heparin may be harmful and
alternative treatments may be needed. Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended.
Management of the participant should not be delayed by decision-making of the Janssen
Adjudication Committee. Refer to the latest version of the IB and its addenda (if applicable)  for
further details. Due to the possibility of the occurrence of TTS after vaccination with
Ad26.COV2.S, additional reporting and data collection procedures have been included in the study
for thrombotic events, thrombocytopenia, and TTS (see Section 8.3.6) , which may facilitate
diagnosis and clinical management of the event. Reports of adverse events following use of the
Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine under emergency use authorization (EUA)  suggest an increased risk of
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)  during the 42 days following vaccination. Investigators should be
alert to GBS signs and symptoms to facilitate diagnosis, to initiate adequate supportive care and
treatment, and to rule out other causes. Refer to the latest version of the IB and its addenda (if
applicable)  for further details.
Heparin-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia
TTS has been found to resemble heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) ,
which is mediated by antibodies against complexes of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4)  that
induce Fc receptor-mediated activation of platelets and hypercoagulation ( Arepally 2021 ) . Current
evidence suggests that these 2 conditions may be linked ( Streiff 2021 ) . The exact mechanisms
remain to be investigated, but anti-PF4 antibodies are suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis
of TTS associated with vaccination.
Risks Related to Adenoviral-vectored Vaccines
The clinical AdVac® safety database (report version 5.0, dated 10 April 2020, cut-off date
20 December 2019) contains pooled safety data from 26 Janssen-sponsored clinical studies with
Ad26 vaccine candidates: Ad26.ZEBOV (Ebola; 10 studies) , Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV
and Ad26.Mos4.HIV (HIV; 8 studies) , Ad26.CS.01 (malaria; 1 study) , Ad26.RSV.FA2 and
Ad26.RSV.preF (RSV; 6 studies) , and Ad26.Filo (filovirus; 1 study) . In these studies, 4,224 adult
participants and 650 children received at least 1 vaccination with an Ad26-based vaccine. The
AdVac® safety database report includes data only from studies for which the database has been
locked for the final analysis; therefore, of the studies including an Ad26.RSV.preF-based regimen
mentioned in Section 2.2, only data for approximately 230 participants aged ≥60 years from
studies VAC18193RSV1003, VAC18193RSV1005, and VAC18193RSV2003 were included.
Overall, the Ad26-based vaccines were well tolerated, without significant safety issues identified.

started within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. Most of the events resolved within 1 to 3 days.
In adults, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was injection site pain (56.9% of Ad26
participants, compared with 22.5% of placebo participants) . All other solicited local AEs were
experienced by less than 25% of adult participants. The most frequently experienced solicited local
AE in children was injection site pain, reported in 13.9% of children aged 1-3 years, 29.8% of
children aged 4-11 years, and 24.8% of children aged 12-17 years after vaccination with an Ad26-

in children aged 12-17 years. No children aged 1-3 years have received placebo.
Severe injection site pain was experienced by 1.0% of adult Ad26 participants and 0.8% of children
aged 4-11 years. No children in the other 2 age groups and no placebo participants experienced
severe injection site pain.
There was a trend toward an increase in the frequency of some local AEs with an increase in Ad26

participants at the 2×1010 vp dose level, 52.0% of participants at the 5×1010 vp dose level, and
77.1% of participants at the 1×1011 vp dose level) , and to a lesser extent injection site swelling
(6.7%, 2.7%, 9.3%, and 17.6%, respectively) . Injection site warmth was not collected at the
0.8×1010 vp and the 2×1010 vp dose level. The frequency of injection site warmth at the 5×1010 vp
and the 1×1011 vp dose level was 19.5%, and 26.7%, respectively. This trend needs to be
interpreted with caution since the participants in the lower dose groups (0.8×1010 vp and 2×1010 vp
dose level)  were all from a single study (VAC52150EBL3002) , and the majority of the participants
in the highest dose group (1×1011 vp dose level)  were also from a single study
(VAC18193RSV2003) .
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs (ie, reported in more than 30% of
participants)  for adult Ad26 participants were malaise (53.8%) , fatigue (48.3%) , headache
(45.7%) , and myalgia (38.3%) , all of which were more frequent for Ad26 participants compared
with placebo (36.4%, 30.7%, 30.0%, and 17.7% of placebo participants, respectively) . Most of
these events were considered related to the study vaccine. Pyrexia (9.9%)  and vaccine-related
pyrexia (9.0%)  were also reported more frequently after administration of an Ad26-based vaccine
compared with placebo (3.5% and 2.9%, respectively) .
Solicited systemic AEs reported in ≥10% of children aged 1-3 years were decreased appetite
(13.9%) , decreased activity (13.2%) , pyrexia (11.1%) , and irritability (10.4%) . The most
frequently reported solicited systemic AEs in children aged 4-11 years (reported in ≥15% of Ad26
participants)  were headache (23.6%; no data are available for the placebo arm in this age group) ,
and decreased activity (18.5%)  and irritability (17.6%) , which were both reported in 4.2% (N 1)
of placebo participants. The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs in children aged
12-17 years (reported in ≥15% of Ad26 participants)  were headache (34.6%)  and fatigue (24.0%) ,
compared to 33.3% and 19.0% of placebo participants, respectively. Most of the frequently
experienced solicited systemic AEs in children were considered related to the study vaccine.

of adult placebo participants)  and dizziness (0.7% vs. 0.2%, respectively) .
ForAd26, the most frequently reported unsolicited AE in children was malaria,areported in 36.8%
of children aged 1-3 years, in 19.0% of children aged 4-11 years, and in 10.6% of children aged
12-17 years. One child in the 12-17 years group (4.8%)  experienced malaria after placebo
vaccination. There were no other children in the placebo groups who experienced malaria. The
most frequently reported related unsolicited AE was hypernatremia (1.6% of children aged
4-11 years [vs. 4.2% with placebo] and 2.4% of children aged 12-17 years [vs. 4.8% with
placebo]) . No AEs in children aged 1-3 years were considered related to the vaccine.
General Risks Related to Vaccination
In general, IM injection may cause local itching, warmth, pain, tenderness, erythema/redness,
induration, swelling, arm discomfort, or bruising of the skin. Participants may exhibit general signs
and symptoms associated with intramuscular injection of a vaccine and/or placebo, including
fever, chills, rash, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, headache, dizziness, arthralgia, general itching, and
fatigue. These side effects will be monitored, but are generally short-term. Instructions regarding
use of antipyretic medication can be found in Section 6.8.
Syncope can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. Syncope can be
accompanied by falls. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury. If syncope develops,
aThi
s was expected as the pediatric studies were conducted in malaria-endemic regions. The imbalance in the
frequency of malaria between Ad26 participants and placebo participants can largely be explained by the fact that the
active control group of study VAC52150EBL3001 was not included in the pooling.

Stat
us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022participants should be observed until the symptoms resolve. Fear of injection might lead to fainting
and fast breathing.
Participants may have an allergic reaction to the vaccination. An allergic reaction may cause a
rash, urticaria or even anaphylaxis (see above risks related to Ad26.COV2.S) . Severe reactions are
rare. Participants with a known allergy, or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions
to vaccines or their excipients (including specifically the excipients of the study vaccine)  will be
excluded from the study.
After each vaccination, participants will remain at the study site for at least 15 minutes and will be
closely observed by study staff. Necessary emergency equipment and medications must be
available in the clinic to treat severe allergic reactions.
Pregnancy and Birth Control
The effect of the study vaccine on a fetus or on a nursing baby is unknown.
Given the limited number of incident pregnancies in the clinical studies with Ad26-based vaccines
in the AdVac® safety database report (HIV vaccine: 20 pregnancies in participants and 10 in
partners of participants; Ebola vaccine: 32 pregnancies in participants and 13 in partners of
participants) , it is not possible at present to draw firm conclusions on the safety of the vaccines
when administered around the time of conception or prior to the initiation of the pregnancies. There
is currently no concerning pattern of AEs in the pregnancies initiated around the time of
vaccination or after exposure to the Ad26-based vaccines in the Janssen vaccines clinical
development programs.
Participants of childbearing potential will be required to agree to practicing an acceptable effective
method of contraception and agree to remain on such a method of contraception from providing
consent until 3 months after receiving study vaccine (see Section 5.1) . Participants who are
pregnant at screening will be excluded from the study. Participants who become pregnant during
the study will remain in the study and will continue to undergo all procedures and all safety follow-
up as outlined in the protocol for all participants but will not receive further vaccination.
Participants who are breastfeeding are allowed to participate in the study.
Risks from Blood Draws
Blood draws may cause pain, tenderness, bruising, bleeding, dizziness, vasovagal response,
syncope, and rarely, infection at the site where the blood is taken.
Risks from Collection of Nasal Swabs
Collection of a nasal swab may cause a nosebleed. Assistance with the collection of nasal swab
samples bears the risk of potentially infecting the assistant.
Theoretical Risk of Enhanced Disease
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease has been described for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in some
animal models ( Agrawal 2016, Bolles 2011, Deming 2006, Honda-okubo 2015, Houser 2017 )and

s: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022is associated with non-neutralizing antibodies and a Th2-skewed immune response, but proof of
human SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV VAERD does not exist as these candidate vaccines were never
tested for efficacy nor used in outbreak situations. In contrast, the Ad26-based vaccines have been
shown to induce a clear Th1-skewed immune response and generate potent neutralizing antibody
responses in both humans and animal models (see Section 2.2) . Participants in the present study
will be informed of the theoretical risk of disease enhancement in the ICF.
Unknown Risks
There may be other risks that are not known. If any significant new risks are identified, the
investigators and participants will be informed.
2.3.2. Benefits for Study Pa rticipa tion
Participants may benefit from clinical testing and physical examination.
The efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data to date support a favorable benefit-risk profile for
Ad26.COV2.S in the proposed indication, ie, active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused
by SARS-CoV-2 in adults ≥18 years of age. The overall benefit and risk balance for individual
participants is ongoing.
2.3.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment for Study Pa rticipa tion
Based on the available data and proposed safety measures, the overall benefit-risk assessment for
this clinical study is considered acceptable for the following reasons:
 Only participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (specified
in Section 5)  will be allowed to participate in this study. The selection criteria include adequate
provisions to minimize the risk and protect the well-being of participants in the study.
 Safety will be closely monitored throughout the study:
 In general, safety evaluations will be performed at scheduled visits during the study, as
indicated in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) .
 After each vaccination, participants will remain at the study site for at least 15 minutes
and will be closely observed by study staff. Necessary emergency equipment and
medications must be available in the clinic to treat severe allergic reactions. Participants
will use a diary to document solicited signs and symptoms. Details are provided in
Section 8.3.
 The investigator or the designee will document unsolicited adverse events, SAEs and
MAAEs as indicated in Sections 8.3and 10.4.
 TTS is considered to be an AESI (Section 8.3.6) . Suspected AESIs (thrombotic events
and thrombocytopenia [defined as platelet count below 150,000/µL
(Brighton Collaboration. Interim Case Definition of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia
Syndrome 2021 )must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. Suspected
AESIs will be followed up as described in the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.4.3.

If a correlate or threshold for protection against COVID-19 is established in terms of humoral
immunity, then a statistical comparison to that correlate or threshold will substitute non-inferiority
testing to immune responses to vaccine at release, as outlined in a revised analytical plan.
Refer to Section 8, Study Assessments and Procedures for evaluations related to endpoints.
HY POTHESES
Formal non-inferiority (NI)  testing will be applied to demonstrate NI of 1-dose and 2-doses of
9×1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp , 7×1010 vp, 3.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S versus 1-dose
and 2-doses of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (release titer) , using a NI margin of 2/3 for the GMC
ratios (see Section 9.1) .
The 2.5x1010 vp dose will be tested before the 7x1010 vp in the sequential testing due to an
increased risk to fail non-inferiority as a consequence of a smaller sample size in the 7x1010 vp
group.

infor
mation will be shared with the IDMC. Refer to Committees Structure in Section 10.3, for
details.
A diagram of the study design is provided in Section 1.2, Schema.
Study Duration
The study duration from screening until the last follow-up visit will be at least 8 months per
participant. The study will consist of a 28-day screening phase with vaccinations on Day 1 and
Day 57, and a follow-up of at least 6 months after the last vaccination.
The vaccination phase consists of the administration of 1-dose of Ad26.COV2.S on Day 1 and
1-dose of Ad26.COV2.S on Day 57. A follow-up of at least 6 months after vaccination 2, is
foreseen.
If a participant is unable to complete the study(post vaccination 1) , but has not withdrawn consent,
an early exit visit will be conducted, or the participant can continue with other study procedures.
The end of study is considered as the last visit for the last participant in the study.
Study Procedures
For each group, safety will be assessed by collection of solicited local (at injection site)  and
systemic AEs, unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, AESIs, and SAEs. Other safety assessments include vital

body temperature)  and physical examinations at the time points indicated in Section 1.4.
After each vaccination, participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least
15 minutes for presence of any acute reactions and solicited events. Any solicited local or systemic
AEs, unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, AESIs, SAEs, concomitant medications, and vital signs will be
documented by study-site personnel following this observation period. In addition, participants
will record solicited signs and symptoms in a diary for 7 days post vaccination.
The reporting periods of AEs, MAAEs, AESIs, and SAEs, and special reporting situations are
detailed in Section 8.3. Reporting periods for concomitant therapy are outlined in Section 6.8. At
each visit the participant will be asked if they have had a private/off-study COVID-19 test. If a
participant receives a positive SARS-CoV-2 result from a private/off-study test (whether through
PCR or serological testing)
 the participant can continue in the study for safety follow-up if they choose to:
o This should be in accordance with local country and site level recommendations,
including requirements for quarantine
o They will not be permitted to receive further study vaccination administrations
o The study staff will recommend the participant informs their medical care
provider.
o If there are no local country recommendations for COVID-19, the sponsor
recommends the participant self-quarantines and does not come for a clinic visit
until 2 consecutive negative PCR tests could be obtained.
In case the participant experiences signs or symptoms of COVID-19 after obtaining a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test result, they should contact the study site at the time of symptom onset for
recommendations on actions to follow for further care per local guidance.
See Section 8.3.1on the reporting periods of this event.
A final safety follow-up visit is foreseen at least 6 months after the last vaccination for all
participants.
From all participants, blood samples will be collected at selected timepoints indicated in
Section 1.4, Schedule of Activities for humoral immunogenicity assessments, with an emphasis
on neutralizing and binding antibody responses. Further details about the immunogenicity
assessments are provided in Section 8.1.
An independent IDMC has been installed for the different studies throughout the COVID-19
vaccine program. Refer to Section 10.3.6 for details.
The planned primary and final analyses are detailed in Section 9.5.

4.2. Scientific Ra tiona le for Study Design
Dose Level Selection
The rationale behind the selection of the dose level of the release titer (5x1010vp)  is described in
Section 4.3.
Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Vaccine Groups
Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of participants to vaccine groups,
to increase the likelihood that known and unknown participant attributes (eg, demographic and
baseline characteristics)  are evenly balanced across vaccine groups, and to enhance the validity of
statistical comparisons across vaccine groups. Blinded study vaccine will be used to reduce
potential bias during data collection and evaluation of study endpoints.
Blinding will be guaranteed by the preparation of the study vaccine by an unblinded pharmacist or
by other qualified study site personnel with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation
and dispensing, and by the administration of vaccine in a masked syringe by a blinded study
vaccine administrator. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the groups based on a
computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision
of the sponsor. The sponsor may be unblinded for this study.
Rationale for the Sub Study
The mechanism for the rare thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)  events that have
been reported after vaccination with Johnson & Johnson’s Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is not known.
Examining gene expression in blood cells may inform on the inflammation signals and pro-
thrombotic signaling pathways triggered by Ad26.COV2.S that can predispose for TTS. Gene
expression profiles will be generated from blood obtained from clinical trials to provide insights
into putative signaling pathways that may predispose for TTS and that are triggered by
Ad26.COV2.S. Whole blood RNA will be sampled on early timepoints after vaccination with
Ad26.COV2.S at different dose levels, examining if the innate gene expression patterns are dose
dependent. In addition, serum samples collected at early timepoints can inform on systemic
cytokines and chemokines and lipid mediators of innate activation to complement the
transcriptome analysis. To further characterize the innate, pro-inflammatory and other relevant
(eg, pro-thrombotic)  responses to Ad26.COV2.S to better understand a possible risk to TTS events,
an additional sub study consisting of a target of approximately 40 seronegative and 20 seropositive
participants to Groups 1, 3, 5 and 6 has been added to the study. This sub study will obtain blood
samples at additional timepoints for additional analyses of transcriptome and serum innate
responses as outlined above to further explore the mechanism of these TTS events.

Potential participants will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study, and during
the study, participants will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue
participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be

us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which they
would otherwise be entitled. Potential participants who are fully able to understand the risks,
benefits, and potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntarily will be enrolled.
The primary ethical concern is that this study will be performed in adult participants who will
receive no benefit from participation in the study, except for compensation for the time and
inconveniences that may arise from participation in the study. See Section 2.3, Benefit-Risk
Assessmentfor details on potential and known benefits and risks, and for the safety measures taken
to minimize risk to participants.
The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be an acceptable amount of blood to be
collected over this time period from the population in this study based up the US Department of
Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections, and US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)  guidelines of 550 mL in any 8-week period ( US FDA 1998,
US DHHS 1998 ) , and as wellas the European Commission guidelines of 500 mL per donation and
3 L per consecutive 12 month period ( EC 1998 ) .
4.3. Justifica tion for Dose
The release titer ofAd26.COV2.S in the present study (5×1010 vp)  is based on experience with
other Ad26-vectored vaccines administered to adults in clinical studies including Ad26.ZEBOV
(Ebola virus program) ; Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV, and Ad26.Mos4.HIV (HIV program) ;
Ad26.CS.01 (malaria program) ; Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad26.RSV.preF (RSV program) ; and
Ad26.ZIKV.001 (Zika virus program) . The dose level of 5×1010 vp is the most extensively tested
dose to date and has shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in these vaccine programs.
Safety data from studies with other Ad26-based vaccines are summarized in Section 2.2.
The same dose level is also being assessed in study VAC31518COV1001 where initial
immunogenicity and safety data (28 days post-dose 1 data from Cohort 1a and available data from
Cohort 3)  have demonstrated that a single-dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp
induces an immune response that meets prespecified minimum criteria and is safe. The sponsor
has therefore decided to proceed with a 5×1010 vp as the release titer dose in this Phase 3 study.
The additional dose levels of 9×1010 vp, 7×1010 vp, 3.5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp and 1.25×1010 vp
were chosen to be evaluated based on data from the COV2001 study. The lower dose (3.5 x1010
vp, 2.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp)  levels mimic vaccine degradation to enable determination of
product expiry. In order to increase the end of shelf-life specifications a potential target release
titer of 7x1010 vpwill be evaluated. A higher titer of 9x1010vp will also be evaluated as is the upper
limit of the release range (potential maximum vp at release) . The present study incorporates a
2-dose regimen, as this dosing schedule is also being evaluated by the sponsor across clinical trials.
While a 1-dose regimen demonstrated efficacy and safety for emergency use in a pandemic setting,
the long-time efficacy and safety are still being evaluated. The duration of immunity of 2-doses
may be preferable post-acute pandemic setting.
Non-human primates immunized with a single-dose of Ad26.COV2.S (Study 20-14, dose level
titration study)  showed robust protection after intranasal and intratracheal challenge with

substantial viral load in both the lower and upper respiratory tract.
4.4. End of Study Definition
End of Study Definition
The end of study is considered as the last visit for the last participant in the study. The final data
from each participating study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee)  after completion of the
final participant visit at that study site, in the time frame specified in the clinical trial agreement.
Study Completion Definition
A participant will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed
assessments at the 6-month follow-up visit post-dose 2 vaccination for their respective study
group.
Participants who prematurely discontinue study vaccination for any reason before the second
vaccination will not be considered to have completed the study.
5. STUDY POPULATION
Screening for eligible participants will be performed within 28days before administration of the
study vaccine. Refer to Section 5.4, Screen Failures for conditions under which the repeat of any
screening procedures are allowed.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling participants in this study are described below. If
there is a question about these criteria, the investigator must consult with the appropriate sponsor
representative and resolve any issues before enrolling a participant in the study. Waivers are not
allowed.
For a discussion of the statistical considerations of participant selection, refer to Section 9.2.
NOTE: Investigators should ensure that all study enrollment criteria have been met at screening.
If a participant’s clinical status changes (including any available laboratory results or receipt of
additional medical records)  after screening but before the first dose of study vaccination is given
such that he or she no longer meets all eligibility criteria, then the participant should be excluded
from participation in the study (See Section 5.4, Screen Failures, describes options for retesting) .

Study vaccine will be administered by IM injection into the deltoid muscle, preferably of the non-
dominant arm. Subsequent vaccinations are preferably administered in the opposite arm. If an
injection cannot be given in the deltoid muscle due to a medical or other contraindication (for
example, tattooed upper arms rendering it difficult to assess site reactogenicity) , use alternative
locations such as the hip, thigh or buttocks. If alternative locations are used for vaccine
administration, these locations should consistently be used for later vaccinations. In all
circumstances, IM injections in other locations than the upper arm are not considered protocol
deviations.
For information on vaccination windows, see Section 1.4.1 (for the sub study) , Schedule of
Activities. If a participant cannot be vaccinated within the allowed window (eg, if the window is
missed due to a study pause [see Section 6.9 Study Pausing Rules]) , the decision regarding
vaccination will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, upon discussion between sponsor and
investigator.

to participants participating in the study. Returned study vaccinemust not be dispensed again, even
to the same participant. Study vaccine may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other
participants. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study vaccine from, nor store it at, any
site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor. Further guidance and information for
the final disposition of unused study vaccine are provided in the SIPPM.
6.3. Mea sures to Minimize Bia s: Ra ndomiza tion a nd Blinding
Vaccine Allocation
Procedures f or Randomization
Central randomization will be implemented in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned
to 1 of 6 groups based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study
by or under the supervision of the sponsor. The randomization will be balanced by using randomly
permuted blocks. The interactive web response system (IWRS)  will assign a unique intervention
code, which will dictate the intervention assignment and matching study intervention kit for the
participant. The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification
number when contacting the IWRS, and will then give the relevant participant details to uniquely
identify the participant.
If, due to the urgency of study initiation during the ongoing pandemic, the IWRS is not yet
available at the planned time of randomization of the first participant, randomization may be
started based on a paper randomization list until the IWRS is live. In the event that randomization
is started based on a paper randomization list, sealed randomization codes will be provided for
each participant containing coded details of study vaccine allocation. All randomization codes,
whether opened or sealed, will be collected after the end of the participant’s participation in the
study.
Blinding
Blinding will be guaranteed by the preparation of the study vaccine by an unblinded pharmacist or
other qualified study-site personnel with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and
dispensing, and by the administration of vaccine in a masked syringe by a blinded study vaccine
administrator. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the groups based on a
computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision
of the sponsor and using the IWRS. The sponsor may be unblinded for this study.
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained
within the IWRS which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an
individual participant.
Data that may potentially unblind the study vaccine assignment (ie, immunogenicity data, study
vaccine accountability data, study vaccine allocation, biomarker, or other specific laboratory data)
will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the

us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating
the data in question from view by the investigators, or others as appropriate until the time of
database lock and unblinding.
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until the database is finalized for the
primary analysis. The investigator may in an emergency determine the identity of the intervention
by contacting the IWRS or by opening the sealed code (if IWRS is not available yet) . While the
responsibility to break the intervention code in emergency situations resides solely with the
investigator, it is recommended that the investigator contact the sponsor or its designee, if possible,
to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone contact with the sponsor
or its designee will be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. In the event the blind is broken,
the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, and reason for the unblinding
must be documented in the IWRS and in the source document.
Participants who have had their intervention assignment unblinded should continue to return for
scheduled evaluations. Participants should not be allowedto receive further study vaccinations and
are only to be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluation visits.
In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully only if the study is completed, and the
clinical database is closed.
If randomized participants are withdrawn from vaccination before the first dose of study vaccine
is administered, additional participants may be recruited to replace these participants at the
discretion of the sponsor. Any replacement participant will be assigned to the same group as the
original (discontinued)  participant. If randomized participants are withdrawn after the first dose of
study vaccine is administered, they will not be replaced.
Investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an
authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine at the efficacious dose if/when these become available,
including the sponsors. In these cases, the investigator will discuss with the participant available
options and ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an authorized/licensed vaccine according
to local immunization guidelines or recommendation and if the participant wishes to proceed with
the unblinding, the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures. The reason for the
unblinding request should be documented. The name and date(s)  of administration of the other
COVID-19 vaccine should be recorded (see Section 6.8) .
If the participant prefers another company’s vaccine, they will be informed that there are no data
on the safety of receiving two different COVID-19 vaccines. In the event of the participant
unblinding in order to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine, no further study
vaccination will be permitted. Unblinded participants will be asked to continue to be followed in
this study in line with the Schedule of Activities (SoA) to the extent that they permit. Safety and
immunogenicity evaluations will be identical for all participants, including participants that are
unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine and who remain in the study, if
applicable and feasible. All data will be analyzed separately from the point of unblinding, for safety
and immunogenicity analysis, as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .

Study vaccines will be administered intramuscularly by blinded qualified study-site personnel at
the study site. Details of each administration will be recorded in the eCRF (including date and time
of injection [deltoid or alternative location]) . For blinding procedures, see Section 6.3, Measures
to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding.
6.5. Dose Modifica tion
Dose modification is not applicable in this study.
6.6. Continued Access to Study Va ccine After the End of the Study
For all participants, given that approved COVID-19 vaccines exist for the adult population in all
countries in which VAC31518COV3003 is being conducted, if participants need to receive
boosters, they may be vaccinated outside of the study as a part of their national vaccination
campaign after the participants have completed their last study visit. Once primary analysis results
are available (post vaccination 2) , investigators will be notified to contact participants in groups
who received a dose level of Ad26.COV2.S that did not meet non-inferiority post vaccination 2 to
advise them that they should receive a booster of a COVID-19 vaccine that is licensed/authorized
through their national COVID-19 vaccination health care program if not already received.
At the time when a COVID-19 vaccine is determined to be efficacious and authorized/licensed for
use, some participants may become eligible to receive such vaccine at the efficacious dose,
depending on country-specific conditions (eg registration status, local
recommendations/regulations, vaccine availability or the specific target group for vaccination) .
The investigator will discuss with the participants the available information and options to allow
the participant to make an informed choice as to whether they qualify to receive the
authorized/licensed vaccine and whether they should request individual unblinding to take up the
offer of an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine. In the event of the participant unblinding in
order to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine, no further study vaccination will be
permitted. Safety evaluations will be identical for all participants, including participants that are
unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine and who remain in the study, if
applicable and feasible. All data will be analyzed separately from the point of unblinding for safety,
efficacy and immunogenicity (under the conditions outlined in Section 6.3) , as described in the
SAP.
6.7. Trea tment of Overdose
For this study, any dose ofAd26.COV2.S greater than the highest dose tested in the study will be
considered an overdose. The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should:
 Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.
 Closely monitor the participant for AEs/MAAEs/AESIs/SAEs (ie, the participant will remain
at the study site for at least 15 minutes and will be closely monitored for allergic or other

Prestudy specific therapies such as analgesic/antipyretic medications and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and vaccinations administered up to
30 days before first dose of study vaccine must be recorded at screening.
Concomitant therapies such as analgesic/antipyretic medications and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs corticosteroids, antihistamines, and vaccinations must be recorded from
the first dose of study vaccine until 28 days after administration of study vaccine and thereafter,
pre-dose on the day of vaccination and for 28 days after each subsequent dose of study vaccine.
All other concomitant therapies should also be recorded if administered in conjunction with new
or worsening adverse events reported per protocol requirements outlined in Section 8.3.1, Time
Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Information.
For all participants, concomitant therapies associated with an SAE, or suspected AESI meeting the
criteria outlined in Section 10.4.1 and Section 8.3.6, respectively, will be collected and recorded
in the eCRF from the moment of vaccination through the end of the study. Concomitant therapies
associated with MAAEs will be collected and recorded in the eCRF from the moment of
vaccination until 6 months after vaccination. Concomitant therapies associated with MAAEs
leading to study discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF during the entire study.
For all participants, concomitant therapies associated with unsolicited AEs will be collected and
recorded in the eCRF from the time of vaccination through 28 days after vaccination. Concomitant
therapies associated with solicited AEs will be collected by the participants and recorded in the
eCRF from the time of vaccination through 7 days after vaccination.
Use of any experimental medication (including experimental vaccines other than the study
vaccine)  during the study is not allowed. Any participant who has been given an anti-COVID-19
vaccine (other than study vaccine)  or treatment will not receive further study vaccination.
Participants may not receive an investigational drug (including investigational drugs for
prophylaxis of COVID-19)  or use an invasive investigational medical device within 30 days or
receive an investigational Ig or monoclonal antibodies within 3 months, or receive convalescent
serum for COVID-19 treatment within 4 months or receive an investigational vaccine (including
investigational Adenoviral-vectored vaccines)  within 6 months before the planned administration
of the first dose of study vaccine.
Licensed live attenuated vaccines should be given at least 28 days before or at least 28 days after
a study vaccination. Other licensed (not live)  vaccines (eg, tetanus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies)
should be given at least 14 days before or at least 14 days after administration of study vaccine in
order to avoid potential confusion of adverse reactions and potential immune interference. The use

any time prior to vaccination and during the study. If a vaccine is indicated in a post-exposure
setting (eg, rabies or tetanus) , it must take priority over the study vaccine.
Antipyretics are recommended post vaccination for symptom relief as needed. Prophylactic
antipyretic use is not encouraged; however, in some instances, it could be considered for
participants with special circumstances and/or comorbidities.
Chronic or recurrent use of systemic corticosteroidsa at immunosuppressive dose and
administration of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy is prohibited
during the study and within 6 months before the planned administration of the first dose of study
vaccine. If any of these agents are indicated in a disease setting, these must take priority over the
study vaccine.
Refer to Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria for further details of prohibited therapy.
The sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter)  of any instances in
which prohibited therapies are administered.
6.9. Study Va ccina tion Pa using Rules
The occurrence of a study pause in any other ongoing study with Ad26.COV2.S may trigger a
study pause in further vaccination in the current study, if considered to be medically relevant. Any
subsequent study visits out of window during a study pause are not considered to be protocol
violations, however, the data at these timepoints may be eliminated from some statistical analyses.

To reduce the chances of a participant being deemed lost to follow-up, prior to randomization
attempts should be made to obtain contact information from each participant, eg, home, work, and
mobile telephone numbers and email addresses for both the participant as well as appropriate
family members.
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. A participant cannot be deemed
lost to follow-up until all reasonable efforts made by the study-site personnel to contact the
participant are deemed futile. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to
the study site for a required study visit:
 The study-site personnel must attempt to contact the participant to reschedule the missed visit
as soon as possible, to counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned
visit schedule, to ascertain whether the participant wishes to or should continue in the study.
 Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every
reasonable effort to regain contact with the participant where possible, 3 telephone calls, e-
mails, fax, and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address,
or local equivalent methods. Locator agencies may also be used as local regulations permit.
These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records.
 Should the participant continue to be unreachable, they will be considered to have withdrawn
from the study.
Should a study site close, eg, for operational, financial, or other reasons, and the investigator cannot
reach the participant to inform them, their contact information will be transferred to another study
site.
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
The Schedule of Activities (Section 1.4) summarizes the frequency and timing of safety,
reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and other measurements applicable to this study. All participants
in the study will be counselled on COVID-19 prevention each time that they have a contact with
study site staff in line with local guidelines.
If multiple assessments are scheduled for the same timepoint, it is recommended that procedures
be performed in the following sequence: vital signs before blood draws. If needed, assessments
may be performed at another day within the applicable visit window. Actual dates and times of
assessments will be recorded in the source document and in the eCRF.
Participants will be provided a thermometer (to measure body temperature) , ruler (to measure local
injection site reactions) , and participant diary to record body temperature and solicited local (at
injection site)  and systemic signs and symptoms. The diary includes instructions on how to capture
the data and grading scales to assess severity of the signs and symptoms post vaccination
(reactogenicity) . The study staff is responsible for providing appropriate training to the participant

Stat
us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022to avoid missing or incorrect data. The diary will be reviewed by the study personnel at visits
indicated in Section 1.4, Schedule of Activities. If the diary review is missed, the diary will be
reviewed during the following visit. If a participant misses a vaccination, the diary covering the
period after the missed vaccination does not have to be completed.
The total blood volume to be collected from each participant over the course of the main study will
be approximately 119 mL. The total blood volume to be collected from each participant over the
course of the sub study will be approximately 163 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be
taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. For participants who experience
a suspected AESI, an additional 30 mL of blood will be collected.
At each visit the participant will be asked if they have had a private/off-study COVID-19 test. If a
participant receives a positive SARS-CoV-2 result from a private/off-study test (whether through
PCR or serological testing) , the participant should contact the study site at the time the positive
SARS-CoV-2 test result is obtained. The participant can continue in the study for safety follow-
up if they choose to; however, this must be in accordance with local country and site level
recommendations for COVID-19, including requirements for quarantine. These participants will
not be permitted to receive further study vaccination administrations. The study staff will
recommend the participant informs their medical care provider. If there are no local country
recommendations for COVID-19, the sponsor recommends the participant self-quarantines and
does not come for a clinic visit until 2 consecutive negative PCR tests could be obtained. If the
participant experiences signs or symptoms of COVID-19 after obtaining a positive SARS-CoV-2
test result, they should contact the study site at the time of symptom onset for recommendations
on actions to follow for further care. See section 8.3.1on the reporting periods of this event.
Visit Windows
Visit windows are provided in Section 1.4, Schedules of Activities. The participant should be
encouraged to come on the exact day planned and use the visit window only if absolutely
necessary.
The timings of the post vaccination visits will be determined relative to the actual day of the
corresponding vaccination.
If a vaccination window is missed due to a study pause (see Section 6.9) , efforts will be made to
still vaccinate the participant as soon as possible, even if out of window. The timings of the post
vaccination visits will be determined relative to the actual day of the vaccination, unless they
overlap with other scheduled visits, in which case the sponsor should be contacted to discuss
optimal scheduling for these visits. If the participant does not want to receive the second
vaccination, they can still continue with other study procedures.
Screening
Screening will be performed within 28 days prior to the first study vaccination or on the day of
vaccination. If screening is performed on the day of vaccination, Visit 1 and Visit 2 will coincide

Screening may be conducted in part via a sponsor- and IRB/IEC-pre-approved non-study-specific
screening consent process, but only if the relevant pre-screening tests are identical to the per
protocol screening tests and are within 4 weeks prior to first vaccination. However, no study-
specific procedures, other than these pre-approved pre-screening assessments, will be performed
until the participant has signed the study-specific ICF. Participants who test positive will be
informed of the result by the study staff. The study-specific ICF date will be entered into the eCRF.
The non-study-specific ICF will be considered source data.
Sample Collection and Handling
The actual dates and times of sample collection must be recorded in the eCRF or laboratory
requisition form. Refer to Section 1.4, Schedule of Activities for the timing and frequency of all
sample collections.
Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples are found in the
laboratory manual that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples
must be under the specified, and where applicable, controlled temperature conditions as indicated
in the laboratory manual.
Study-Specific Materials
The investigator will be provided with the following supplies:
 IB for Ad26.COV2.S

Blood samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as described in the Schedules
of Activities in Section 1.4and Section 10.2, Appendix 2. In case of a thrombotic event or TTS,
every effort should be made to collect local hospital/laboratory test results obtained by the treating
physician to allow rapid diagnosis and treatment. This information should be reported through the
TTS AESI form (see Section 10.8, Appendix 8)  electronically per instructions in the eCRF
completion guidelines. In addition, every effort should be made to collect blood samples from the
participant for a platelet count (local laboratory or substitute for local laboratory)  and other
applicable testing (central laboratory (see the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.4 and
Section 10.2, Appendix 2) . The Investigator will review the laboratory test results to assist the
investigation of the AESI.
See Section 8.3.6.1 for details on laboratory test details to be reported for an AE of
thrombocytopenia.
8.3. Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Medica lly-a ttended Adverse
Events, Adverse Events of Specia l Interest, a nd Other Sa fety Reporting
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysisof safety information, including AEs, SAEs,
MAAEs, suspected AESIs, and PQCs, from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of
participants, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide.
The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory
requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information; all clinical studies
conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures.
AEs will be reported by the participant for the duration of the study. Further details on AEs, SAEs,
MAAEs, suspected AESIs, and PQC can be found in Section 10.4.
8.3.1. Time Period a nd Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event, Medica lly-

Serious Adverse Event Informa tion
All Adverse Events
AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, that are related to study
procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be reported for all
participants from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early
withdrawal.

us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022Clinically relevant medical events not meeting the above criteria and occurring between signing
of the ICF and moment of first vaccination will be collected on the Medical History eCRF page as
pre-existing conditions.
Solicited AEs, collected through a diary, will be recorded for each vaccination from the time of
vaccination until 7 days post vaccination.
All other unsolicited AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be
reported for each vaccination from the time of vaccination until 28 days post vaccination.
Unsolicited AEs with the onset date outside the timeframe defined above (>28 days after previous
study vaccination) , which are ongoing on the day of the subsequent vaccination, should be
recorded as such.
At each visit the participant will be asked if they have had a private/off-study COVID-19 test. If a
participant receives a positive SARS-CoV-2 result from a private/off-study test (whether through
PCR or serological testing; for participants seropositive at baseline, only PCR testing applies)
during the study, and the positive result occurs within 28 days after vaccination, the event will be
reported as an AE. If it occurs after 28 days, the event will be recorded as an SAE only if the event
qualifies as serious. If the event occurs after 28 days, and it is not serious, it will be reported in the
eCRF. The participant can continue in the study for safety follow-up if they choose to; however,
this must be in accordance with local country and site level recommendations for COVID-19 and
they will not be permitted to receive further study vaccination administrations. Any positive
SARS-CoV-2 result should be recorded in the eCRF.
All SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study/vaccination (regardless of the causal
relationship)  will be reported for all participants from the moment of first vaccination until
completion of the participant’s last study-related procedure, which may include contact for safety
follow-up. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an
investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol.
MAAEs are defined as AEs with medically-attended visits including hospital, emergency room,
urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel for any reason. Routine study visits
will not be considered medically-attended visits. New onset of chronic diseases will be collected
as part of the MAAEs. MAAEs are to be reported for all participants from the moment of
vaccination until 6 months after the vaccination, except for MAAEs leading to study
discontinuation which are to be reported during the entire study.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome is considered to be an AESI. Suspected AESIs
(thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia [defined as platelet count below 150,000/µL[ Brighton
Collaboration. Interim Case Definition of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS)
2021])will be recorded from the moment of vaccination until the end of the study/early withdrawal
(see Section 8.3.6) . An AESI Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be
established to evaluate each suspected AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS.
All AEs will be followed until resolution or until clinically stable.

All SAEs, as well as PQC, occurring during the study must be reported to the appropriate sponsor
contact person by study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event.
SAEs, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator, must be reported using an SAE
form. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an
investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol.
Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the sponsor using the SAE Form and Safety
Report Form of the eCRF, which must be completed and reviewed by a physician from the study
site and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of an SAE
should be transmitted electronically or by facsimile (fax) . Telephone reporting should be the
exception and the reporter should be asked to complete the appropriate form(s)  first.
8.3.2. Method of Detecting Adverse Events, Medica lly-a ttended Adverse
Events, Adverse Events of Specia l Interest, a nd Serious Adverse
Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs, MAAEs, suspected AESIs, or SAEs.
Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire
about AE occurrence.
Solicited Adverse Events
Solicited AEs are used to assess the reactogenicity of the study vaccine and are predefined local
(at injection site)  and systemic events for which the participant is specifically questioned, and
which are noted by participants in their diary.
After each vaccination, participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least
15 minutes for the presence of any acute reactions and solicited events.
In addition, participants will record solicited signs and symptoms in a diary for 7 days post
vaccination. All participants will be provided with a diary and instructions on how to complete the
diary (see Overview in Section 8, Study Assessments and Procedures) . Electronic diary
information will be transferred from the Safety Diary source to the sponsor. After review and
verbal discussion of the initial electronic diary entries with the participant, the investigator will
complete his/her own assessment in the relevant sections of the eCRF. Once a solicited sign or
symptom from a diary is considered to be of severity Grade 1 or above, it will be recorded as a
solicited adverse event.
Solicited Injection Site (Local) Adverse Events
Participants will be asked to note in the diary occurrences of injection site pain/tenderness,
erythema and swelling at the study vaccine injection site daily for 7 days post vaccination (day of
vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) . The extent (largest diameter)  of any erythema and swelling
should be measured (using the ruler supplied)  and recorded daily. The case definitions for solicited
injection site events can be found in the references ( Gidudu 2012, Kohl 2007 ) .

Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer provided
for home use. Participants should record the temperature in the diary in the evening of the day of
vaccination, and then daily for the next 7 days approximately at the same time each day. If more
than 1 measurement is made on any given day, the highest temperature of that day will be used in
the eCRF.
Fever is defined as endogenous elevation of body temperature ≥38° C, as recorded in at least
1 measurement ( Marcy 2004 ) .
Participants will also be instructed on how to note signs and symptoms in the diary on a daily basis
for 7 days post vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) , for the following
events: fatigue, headache, nausea, and myalgia.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which the participant is not specifically questioned in the
participant diary.
Medically-attended Adverse Events
MAAEs are AEs with medically-attended visits including hospital, emergency room, urgent care
clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel for any reason. New onset of chronic diseases
will be collected as part of the MAAEs. Routine study visits will not be considered medically-
attended visits.
For details about AESIs, refer to Section 8.3.6.
8.3.3. Follow-up of Adverse Events, Medica lly-a ttended Adverse Events,
Adverse Events of Specia l Interest, a nd Serious Adverse Events
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements
and evaluations as medically indicated to elucidate the nature and causality of the AEs, MAAEs,
SAEs, suspected AESI, or PQC as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests
or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care
professionals.
AEs, including pregnancy, will be followed by the investigator as specified in Section 10.4.
8.3.4. Regula tory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities.
The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where
required)  all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) . The investigator (or
sponsor where required)  must report SUSARs to the appropriate Independent Ethics
Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB)  that approved the protocol unless otherwise
required and documented by the IEC/IRB. A SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities

8.3.5. Pregna ncy
All initial reports of pregnancy in participants or partners of male participants must be reported to
the sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the
appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  are considered SAEs and
must be reported using an SAE reporting form. Any participant who becomes pregnant during the
study must discontinue further study vaccination but will remain in the study and will continue to
undergo all procedures for follow-up and all safety follow-up as outlined in the protocol for all
participants.
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the
infant will be required.
8.3.6. Adverse Events of Specia l Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  are significant AEs that are judged to be of special
interest because of clinical importance, known or suspected class effects, or based on nonclinical
signals. Adverse events of special interest will be carefully monitored during the study by the
sponsor.
AESIs must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness irrespective of seriousness
(ie, serious and non-serious AEs)  or causality following the procedure described above for SAEs.
Specific requirements for the AESI are described below.
8.3.6.1. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia  Syndrome
As described in Section 2.3.1, Risks Related to Study Participation, TTS has been observed very
rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S and is considered to be an AESI in this study.
TTS is a syndrome characterized by a combination of both a thrombotic event and
thrombocytopenia ( American Society of Hematology 2021, Brighton Collaboration. Interim Case
Definition of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome 2021 ) .
Because this syndrome is rare and not completely understood, all cases of thrombosis and/or
thrombocytopenia will be considered a suspected case of TTS until further adjudication can be
performed. An AESI Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be established to
evaluate each suspected AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS. The investigator shall be
responsible for reporting any suspected AESI of TTS using the SAE form and the form detailed in
Section 10.8, Appendix 8. A suspected TTS case is defined as:
 Thrombotic events: suspected deep vessel venous or arterial thrombotic events as detailed in
Section 10.9, Appendix 9

us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022 Thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count below 150,000/µL ( Brighton Collaboration.
Interim Case Definition of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome 2021 )
Symptoms, signs, or conditions suggestive of a thrombotic event should be recorded and reported
as a suspected AESI even if the final or definitive diagnosis has not yet been determined, and
alternative diagnoses have not yet been eliminated or shown to be less likely. Follow-up
information and final diagnoses, if applicable, should be submitted to the sponsor as soon as they
become available.
In the event of thrombocytopenia, study site personnel should report the absolute value for the
platelet count and the reference range for the laboratory test used.
For either a thrombotic event or thrombocytopenia, testing for anti-PF4 may be performed at the
local laboratory or substitute local laboratory; repeat testing may be requested for confirmation
upon sponsor discretion.
Suspected AESIs will require enhanced data collection and evaluation (see Section 1.4.3) . Every
effort should be made to report as much information as possible about the AESI to the sponsor in
a reasonable timeframe.
If an event meets the criteria for an SAE (Section 10.4.1) , it should be reported using the same
process as for other SAEs.
The form detailed in Section 10.8, Appendix 8is intended as a guide for assessment of the AESIs
to facilitate diagnosis and determine treatment options. If the investigator is not the treating
physician, every effort should be made to collect the information requested in the form from the
treating physician and enter the available information in the eCRF.
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Statistical analysis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the immunogenicity and safety data is
outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the SAP.
9.1. Sta tistica l Hypotheses
Formal NI testing will be applied to demonstrate NI of 1-dose and 2-doses of 9x1010 vp, 2.5x1010
vp, 7x1010 vp, 3.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S versus 1- dose and 2-doses of 5x1010
vp Ad26.COV2.S (release titer) , using a NI margin of 2/3 for the GMC ratios.
The 2.5x1010 vp dose will be tested before the 7x1010 vp in the sequential testing due to an
increased risk to fail non-inferiority as a consequence of a smaller sample size in the 7x1010 vp
group as shown in Table 7 .

Based on the above assumptions, assuming approximately a 10.2% dropout, a sample size of
225 participants per active vaccine group (see Table 1 )  isneeded to detect non-inferiority of testing

A target of approximately 240 participants (40 seronegative and 20 seropositive participants) per
dose regimen in Groups 1, 3, 5, and 6 will be enrolled to further characterize the innate, pro-
inflammatory and other relevant (eg, pro-thrombotic)  responses to Ad26.COV2.S to better
understand a possible risk to TTS events. This target may not be met due to the challenges of
enrolling seronegative subjects into the study, so sub-study enrollment may stop at lower numbers.
Participants in the main study and sub-study (participants who are seronegative at enrollment or
baseline)may be combined for the analysis.
Table 7 shows how the power will be affected with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% dropout
due to various reasons (eg, lost to follow-up, participants with major protocol deviations with
impact on immunogenicity, participants who become N-seropositive during the study or with a
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and participants who received their vaccination outside the

The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the NI, in terms of humoral immune response,
of a 1-dose and 2-doses of 9x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, 7x1010 vp, 3.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp
Ad26.COV2.S versus a 1-dose and 2-doses of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (release titer) .
The S-ELISA has been selected as primary endpoint since samples from all participants will be
analyzed using this assay, which has an improved throughput as compared to VNA. The ELISA
will be used as primary endpoint for NI comparison, provided that a robust correlation can be
confirmed between ELISA and VNA. Otherwise, VNA may be considered for the primary
endpoint. In this case, to accelerate availability of results, only samples collected 28 days post-dose
1 or 14 days post-dose 2 will be tested with VNA but not baseline samples.
9.3. Popula tions for Ana lysis Sets
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:
FAS: The full analysis set will include all participants with at least one vaccine administration
documented.
PPI: The per protocol immunogenicity population will include all randomized and vaccinated
participants for whom immunogenicity data are available excluding participants with major
protocol deviations expected to impact the immunogenicity outcomes. In addition, samples
obtained after missed vaccinations or samples obtained after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection (if
applicable)  will be excluded from the analysis set.
NI: The NI analysis set will include all PPI participants who are SARS-COV-2 seronegative at
study entry.
9.4. Sta tistica l Ana lyses
The SAPwill be finalized prior to the first data base lock (DBL)and it will include a more technical
and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This section is a
summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints including primary and
key secondary endpoints. One Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  will be provided for both the main
study and the sub study.
9.4.1. Genera l Considera tions
Analysis populations are defined in Section 9.3. Planned analyses are defined in Section 9.5.
For safety and immunogenicity analyses, results will be analyzed by vaccine group.
Immunogenicity sub-analyses will also be performed by BMI, ethnicity, and other factors as will
be described in the SAP.
If a participant has a positive SARS-CoV-2 test after vaccination, this participant will remain in
the study, but samples obtained after SARS-CoV-2 infection will not be included in the per
protocol immunogenicity analysis set.

vp, 3.5x1010 vp, or 1.25x1010 vp]/GMC 5x1010 vp) , 28 days post-dose 1 or 14 days post-dose 2
with corresponding 97.5% confidence interval (CI)  (2-sided)  (Type 1 error 0.0125 for each
comparison) .
In both sets (1 dose and 2 doses) of comparisons above, 97.5% CIs (2-sided)  for mean difference
in log10-transformed S-ELISA titers between 2 groups will first be calculated and then back-
transformed to the original scale to obtain the GMC ratios and the associated 97.5% CIs (2-sided) .
Non-inferiority between the groups will be established if the 97.5% CI of the estimated GMC ratio
of the groups entirely lies above 2/3.
In the 1-dose (dose 1 of the 2-dose regimen)  and 2-dose set NI comparisons, hierarchical testing
after administration of a single-dose and 2 doses will be applied independently, as reflected in the
Decision Tree-based Hypothesis Testing ( Figure 2 and Section 9.1) . The non-inferiority analyses
will be done on the NI analysis set.
 Note: If a large number of participants become infected during the study (as assessed eg,
by N-seroconversion or by PCR confirmation)  or are SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at
baseline, the main study and sub-study participants (seronegative at baseline)  may be
combined.
 If the power of the combined main study and sub-study is less than 80% then seropostive
subjects at baseline will be included in the analysis. Further details of the analysis will be
provided in the SAP.

Immunogenicity Endpoints
Descriptive statistics (geometric mean and confidence intervals, or median and interquartile range
Q1-Q3, as appropriate)  will be calculated for continuous immunologic parameters. Several
definitions of serological response will be applied as applicable (GMC [S-ELISA]) . Graphical
representations of immunologic parameters will be made as applicable. Frequency tabulations will
be calculated for discrete (qualitative)  immunologic parameters, as applicable.

The immunogenicity analyses will be performed on the PPI population. Immunogenicity analyses
will also be done on the FAS (participants who became infected during the study will be analyzed
as a subgroup and shown in the graphs using different colors and symbols) .
Safety Endpoints
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively
by vaccine group. In addition, for selected tables, tabulations pooled by vaccine dose will also be
provided. All safety analyses will be made on the FAS.
Adverse Events
The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by investigators to identify AEs will be coded using the
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . All reported AEs with onset during the
active vaccination phase (ie, AEs occurring after vaccination up to 28 days post vaccination) , and
all SAEs/MAAEs/AESIs will be included in the analysis. (S) AEscaused by molecularly confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection will be removed at the analysis level from the (S) AE listings and tables
and presented separately. For each AE, the percentage of participants who experience at least
1 occurrence of the given event will be summarized by vaccine group.
Summaries, listings, datasets, or participant narratives may be provided, as appropriate, for those
participants who die, who discontinue intervention due to an AE, or who experience a severeAE,
an AESI, or an SAE.
Solicited local (at injection site)  and systemic AEs will be summarized descriptively. The number
and percentages of participants with at least one solicited local (at injection site)  or systemic AE
will be presented. The frequencies by vaccine group as well as frequencies according to severity
and duration will be described for solicited adverse events. Frequencies of unsolicited adverse
events, separately for all and vaccination-related only, will be presented by System Organ Class
and preferred term, while those of solicited adverse events will be presented only by preferred
term.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Laboratory data (abnormal or graded, when available)  will be listed and/or tabulated by participant
and time point.
Vital Signs
Vital signs including temperature, pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic
and diastolic)  will be summarized over time, using descriptive statistics and/or graphically. The
percentage of participants with values beyond clinically important limits will be summarized.

9.5. Pla nned Ana lyses
The sponsor may be unblinded for this study, but the blind will be maintained at the participant
and study site level up to study end.
The primary analysis, which will be performed on unblinded data, will include safety up to Day 85
and immunogenicity up to Day 71 in the main study and sub study for all groups and will be
performed when all participants have completed the visit that takes place 85 days after the first
study vaccination or discontinued earlier.
The final analysis for the main study will be performed when all included participants from the
main study have completed their last visit (at least 6 months post last vaccination)  or discontinued
earlier. Results from participants in the sub study may be available with the main study. Results
from the main study and the sub study may be combined in one report.
Depending on availability of results, primary and final analysis might be combined.
Further interim analyses may be performed for safety and/or immunogenicity to facilitate decision
making with regards to planning of future studies or for regulatory submission purposes.
The IDMC set for the program will have overview on the safety of this study.
Unblinding due to availability of an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine
Investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an
authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine at the efficacious dose if/when these become available,
including the sponsors. In these cases, the investigator will discuss with the participant available
options and ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an authorized/licensed vaccine according
to local immunization guidelines or recommendation and if the participant wishes to proceed with
the unblinding, the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures. The reason for the

If the participant prefers another company’s vaccine, they will be informed that there are no data
on the safety of receiving two different COVID-19 vaccines. In the event of the participant
unblinding in order to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine, no further study
vaccination will be permitted. Unblinded participants will be asked to continue to be followed in
this study in line with the Schedule of Activities (SoA) to the extent that they permit. Safety and
immunogenicity evaluations will be identical for all participants, including participants that are
unblinded to obtain an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine and who remain in the study, if
applicable and feasible. All data will be analyzed separately from the point of unblinding, for safety
and immunogenicity analysis, as described in the SAP.

study and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor's prior written consent.
The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by the
sponsor in connection with the continued development of Ad26.COV2.S, and thus may be
disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. To permit the
information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide
the sponsor with all data obtained in the study.
The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor and
will contain data from all study sites that participated in the study as per protocol. Recruitment
performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the
study will be used to determine a coordinating investigator for the study. Results of exploratory
analyses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued will be reported in a separate
report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report.
Study participant identifiers will not be used in publication of results. Any work created in
connection with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright
protection (except any publication by the investigator as provided for below)  shall be the property
of the sponsor as author and owner of copyright in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal
Editors (ICMJE)  guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (multicenter)
data and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to
publish study site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to
publish information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for
review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will
be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in
writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days to allow for
filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or
regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor will
not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information.
For multicenter study designs and sub-study approaches, secondary results generally should not
be published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly, investigators
will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived
from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been
submitted for publication, within 18months after the study end date, or the sponsor confirms there
will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will
be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the ICMJE Recommendations
for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which
state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the conception or design
of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the
work or revised it critically for important intellectual content; and given final approval of the
version to be published; and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that

Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified
investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and
study-site personnel before the study, and periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor. Written
instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples.
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study-site personnel before
the start of the study.
The sponsor will review eCRF for accuracy and completeness during on-site monitoring visits and
after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or
designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for
accuracy and consistency with the data sources.
10.3.9. Ca se Report Form Completion
Case report forms are prepared and provided by the sponsor for each participant in electronic
format. All data relating to the study must be recorded in the eCRF or eCOA. All eCRF entries,
corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or authorized study-site personnel.
The investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and correct.
The study data will be transcribed by study-site personnel from the source documents onto an
eCRF, if applicable. Study-specific data will be transmitted in a secure manner to the sponsor.
Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the eCRF. Any
such worksheets will become part of the participant's source documents. Data must be entered into
eCRF in English. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after a participant visit and the
forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit.
All participative measurements (eg, questionnaires)  will be completed by the same individual who
made the initial baseline determinations whenever possible.
If necessary, queries will be generated in the electronic data capture (eDC) tool. If corrections to
aneCRF are needed after the initial entry into the eCRF, this can be done in either of the following
ways:

initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool) .
 Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by the investigator and
study-site personnel.
10.3.10. Source Documents
At a minimum, source documents consistent in the type and level of detail with that commonly
recorded at the study site as a basis for standard medical care must be available for the following:
participant identification, eligibility (including medical history and prestudy medication) , and
study identification; study discussion and date of signed informed consent; dates of visits; results
of safety parameters as required by the protocol; record of all AEs and follow-up of AEs;
concomitant medication; vaccine receipt/dispensing/return records; study vaccine administration
information; and date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation of study vaccine or
withdrawal from the study, if applicable.
The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable.
Participant- and investigator-completed scales and assessments designated by the sponsor (ie,
diary to record solicited AEs, daily signs)will be recordedand will be considered source data. The
participant’s diary used to collect information regarding solicited signs and symptoms after
vaccination will be considered source data.
Specific details required as source data for the study and source data collection methods will be
reviewed with the investigator before the study and will be described in the monitoring guidelines
(or other equivalent document) .
An eSource system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a hospital or
clinic record to document medical care (eg, electronic source documents)  as well as the clinical
study-specific data fields as determined by the protocol. This data is electronically extracted for
use by the sponsor. If eSource is utilized, references made to the eCRF in the protocol include the
eSource system but information collected through eSource may not be limited to that found in the
eCRF.
10.3.11. Monitoring
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site
monitoring)  to monitor this study.
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary. The monitor will
record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post-
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the
monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRF with the source documents
(eg, hospital/clinic/physician’s office medical records) . The nature and location of all source
documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the
eCRF are known to the sponsor and study-site personnel and are accessible for verification by the

us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022sponsor study site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of
verification must be discussed with the study-site personnel.
Direct access to source documents (medical records)  must be allowed for the purpose of verifying
that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will
be discussed with the study-site personnel. The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the
relevant study-site personnel will be available, the source documents will be accessible, and a
suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will
meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study
conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these
remote contacts, study-site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the
study at the site.
Central monitoring will take place for data identified by the sponsor as requiring central review.
10.3.12. On-Site Audits
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at
any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance
with regulatory guidelines and company policy. Remote auditing techniques may also be utilized,
if necessary. These audits will require access to all study records, including source documents, for
inspection. Participant privacy must, however, be respected. The investigator and study-site
personnel are responsible for being present and available for consultation during routinely
scheduled study site audit visits conducted by the sponsor or its designees.
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part
of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a
regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or she has
been contacted by a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection.
10.3.13. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF
and all source documents that support the data collected from each participant, as well as all study
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical
Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s) . The
investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these
documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications
in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical
development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period
if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the

longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept
the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new
custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents
before having obtained written approval from the sponsor.
If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any
documentation relating to this study, the investigator/institution must permit access to such reports.
10.3.14. Study a nd Site Sta rt a nd Closure
First Act of Recruitment
The first site open is considered the first act of recruitment and it becomes the study start date.
Study/Site Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected
and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not
limited to:
 Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB or
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
 Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator
 Discontinuation of further study vaccine development

10.4.1. Adverse Event Definitions a nd Cla ssifica tions
Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a
pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational)  product. An AE does not necessarily have
a causal relationship with the vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended
sign (including an abnormal finding) , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational)  product, whether or not related to that medicinal
(investigational or non-investigational)  product. (Definition per ICH) .
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test
abnormalities.
Any respiratory tract infection that is not due to SARS-CoV-2 infection will be reported as an AE
if it occurs between the time of any vaccination through the following 28 days. Any respiratory
tract infection recorded as an AE in the eCRF will be excluded from any AE analysis if the
molecular test is subsequently found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory tract infections
arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection will not be reported as (S) AEs in the Clinical Study Report
but will be tabulated separately. In general, any (S) AEs caused by molecularly confirmed SARS-
CoV-2 infection will be removed at the analysis level from the (S) AE listings and tables and
presented separately. In general, (S) AEs caused by molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
will be removed at the analysis level from the (S) AE listings and tables and presented separately.
Note: For time period of sponsor’s AE collection, see All Adverse Events under Section 8.3.1.
Serious Adverse Event
An SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for
Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life-threatening
(The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product

Stat
us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022 Is Medically Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These
should usually be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship
between the study vaccine and the event (eg, death from anaphylaxis) , the event must be reported
as a SUSAR even if it is a component of the study endpoint (eg, all-cause mortality) .
At each visit the participant will be asked if they have had a private/off-study COVID-19 test. If a
participant receives a positive SARS-CoV-2 result from a private/off-study test (whether through
PCR or serological testing)  during the study, and the positive result occurs within 28 days after
vaccination, the event will be reported as an AE. If it occurs after 28 days, the event will be
recorded as an SAE only if the event qualifies as serious. The participant can continue in the study
for safety follow-up if they choose to; however, this must be in accordance with local country and
site level recommendations for COVID-19, and they will not be permitted to receive further study
vaccination administrations. Any positive SARS-CoV-2 result should be recorded in the eCRF.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product
reference safety information. For Ad26.COV2.S, the expectedness of an AE will be determined
by whether or not it is listed in the IB.
10.4.2. Attribution Definitions
Assessment of Causality
The causal relationship to study vaccine is determined by the investigator. The following selection
should be used to assess all AEs.
Related
There is a reasonable causal relationship between study vaccine administration and the AE.
Not Related
There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study vaccine administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to support a causal relationship.
By definition, all solicited AEs at the injection site (local)  will be considered related to the study
vaccine administration.

All AEsand laboratory data will be coded for severity usinga modified version of the FDA grading
table, based on version of September 2007, included in Section 10.6.
For AEs not identified in the grading table, the following guidelines will be applied:

and
 functional activities
Gra
de 2 Mode rate Symp toms causing greater than minimal interference with usual

The severity of solicited signs and symptoms will be graded in the diary by the participant based
on the severity assessment provided in the diary and then verified by the investigator using the
toxicity grading scale in Section 10.6. (Note: severity of the measured events will be derived from
the diameter [for erythema and swelling] and the temperature measurements [for fever]) .
10.4.4. Specia l Reporting Situa tions
Safety events of interest on a sponsor study vaccine in an interventional study that may require
expedited reporting or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:
 Overdose of a sponsor study vaccine
 Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study vaccine
 Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study vaccine
 Medication error, intercepted medication error, or potential medication error involving a
Johnson & Johnson medicinal product (with or without patient exposure to the Johnson &
Johnson medicinal product, eg, product name confusion, product label confusion, intercepted
prescribing or dispensing errors)
 Exposure to a sponsor study vaccine from breastfeeding
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that
meets the criteria of an SAE should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF.
10.4.5. Procedures
All Adverse Events
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study vaccine, must be
recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. Whenever possible,

us: Approved,  Date: 16 September 2022diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg, cough,
runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper respiratory
infection") . Investigators must record in the eCRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the
AE to study therapy. All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source
document and reported according to sponsor instructions.
For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open-label studies, the participant must be
provided with a "wallet (study) card" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration
of the study indicating the following:
 Study number
 Statement, in the local language(s) , that the participant is participating in a clinical study
 Investigator's name and 24-hour contact telephone number
 Local sponsor's name and 24-hour contact telephone number (for medical personnel only)
 Site number
 Participant number
 Any other information that is required to do an emergency breaking of the blind
Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved upon the
participant's discontinuation from the study, must be followed until any of the following occurs:
 The event resolves
 The event stabilizes
 The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
 The event can be attributed to agents other than the study vaccine or to factors unrelated to
study conduct
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (participant or health care
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after demonstration of
due diligence with follow-up efforts)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as an SAE.
Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization)  that occurs during
participation in the study must be reported as an SAE, except hospitalizations for the following:
 Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or AE(eg, social reasons such as pending
placement in long-term care facility)
 Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the eCRF) .
Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where the
underlying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened, will not be
considered SAEs. Any AE that results in a prolongation of the originally planned
hospitalization is to be reported as a new SAE.

Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the sponsor using an SAE reporting form and
safety report form of the eCRF, which must be completed and reviewed by a physician from the
study site, and transmitted in a secure manner to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and
follow-up reports of an SAE should be transmitted in a secure manner electronically or by
facsimile (fax) . Telephone reporting should be the exception and the reporter should be asked to
complete the appropriate form(s)  first.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
AESIs will be carefully monitored during the study by the sponsor. Suspected AESIs must be
reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness irrespective of seriousness (ie, serious and
non-serious AEs)  or causality assessment, following the procedure described above for SAEs and
will require enhanced data collection.
10.4.6. Product Qua lity Compla int Ha ndling
Definition
A PQC is defined as any suspicion of a product defect related to manufacturing, labeling, or
packaging, ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, or
performance of a distributed product, including its labeling, drug delivery system, or package
integrity. A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, it
includes any technical complaints, defined as any complaint that indicates a potential quality issue
during manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage
or distribution of the product or the drug delivery system.
Procedures
All initial PQCs must be reported to the sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours after
being made aware of the event.
A sample of the suspected product should be maintained under the correct storage conditions until
a shipment request is received from the sponsor.
10.4.7. Conta cting Sponsor Rega rding Sa fety, Including Product Qua lity
The names (and corresponding telephone numbers)  of the individuals who should be contacted

Medica l Conditions Tha t Lea d or Might Lea d to Increa sed Risk for Severe
Illness From COVID-19
Adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe
illness from COVID-19: Severe illness from COVID-19 is defined as hospitalization, admission
to the ICU, intubation or mechanical ventilation, or death.
Adults of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from the
virus that causes COVID-19b::
 Cancer
 Chronic kidney disease
 COPD
 Heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies
 Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system)  from solid organ transplant
 Obesity (BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher but < 40 kg/m2)
 Severe Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2)
 Pregnancy
 Sickle cell disease
 Smoking
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus
COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of
underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-
19. Based on what we know at this time, adults of any age with the following conditions might be
at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:
 Asthma (moderate-to-severe)
 Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)
 Cystic fibrosis
 Hypertension or high blood pressure
 Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system)  from blood or bone marrow
transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune
weakening medicines
 Neurologic conditions, such as dementia
 Liver disease

Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The overall reason for this amendment is to allow
flexibility to stop enrollment in the sub-study of seronegative participants earlier due to the
increasing challenges of recruiting seronegative participants into the sub study. The amendment
also removes the interim analysis after the first vaccination at 28 days post dose 1 of the main
study. The primary analysis will now include both post dose 1 and post dose 2 data together as the
primary analysis. In alignment with other VAC31518 protocols an exclusion criterion was added

Ame
ndment 4 (3 August 2021)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The mechanism for the rare thrombosis with
thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)  events that have been reported after vaccination with Johnson
& Johnson’s Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is not known. Examining gene expression in blood cells may
inform on the inflammation signals and pro-thrombotic signaling pathways triggered by
Ad26.COV2.S that can predispose for TTS. Gene expression profiles will be generated from blood
obtained from clinical trials to provide insights into putative signaling pathways that may
predispose for TTS and that are triggered by Ad26.COV2.S. Whole blood RNA will be sampled
on early timepoints after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at different dose levels, examining if the
innate gene expression patterns are dose dependent. In addition, serum samples collected at early
timepoints can inform on systemic cytokines and chemokines and lipid mediators of innate
activation to complement the transcriptome analysis. To further characterize the innate, pro-
inflammatory and other relevant (eg, pro-thrombotic)  responses to the Ad26.COV2.S vector to
better understand a possible risk to TTS events, an additional sub study consisting of
40 seronegative and 20 seropositive participants to Groups 1, 3, 5 and 6 has been added to the
study. This sub study will obtain blood samples at additional timepoints for additional analyses of
transcriptome and serum innate responses as outlined above to further explore the mechanism of
these TTS events.

Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The main purpose of this amendment is to move the Day
85 sampling timepoint (28 days post-dose 2)  to Day 71 (14 days post-dose 2)  in order to align
across VAC31518COVID studies. This amendment also updates the amount of blood volume
needed (from 12 mL to 15 mL)  to be collected at baseline and for AESI evaluations due to the
increased volume of blood needed to isolate serum/plasma for the coagulation related assays in the
study. An additional exclusion criterion for participants with a history of capillary leak syndrome
has also been added.

ndment 2 (10 May 2021)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment: This amendment has been created to include additional
safety measures due to reports of adverse events following use of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under
emergency use authorization in the US, suggesting an increased risk of thrombosis combined with
thrombocytopenia. Based on this, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) , which is a
very rare event, will be followed in this protocol as adverse event of special interest (AESI)  that
needs to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. In addition, the protocol has
been adjusted to align with the latest vaccine risk language.
In addition, the blood volume for SARS.CoV.2 serology has been reduced and the exclusion
criterion excluding employees and family members from participating in the study has been added
back into the protocol per health authority request.

Title of Study: 18F-AV-1451- A16 
A Clinico -Pathological Study of the Correspondence Between 18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging 
and Post- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology 
Study Participants:  
Planned number of subjects enrolled: Approximately 200 
Planned number of autopsies: Approximately 80 
Approximately 200 subjects with terminal medical conditions and projected life 
expectancy of ≤ 6 months will be enrolled and imaged with 18F-AV-1451 in order to 
obtain post- mortem histological data on approximately 80 subjects. Enrollment will not be 
formally stratified, but an effort will be made to enroll subjects with cognitive status 
ranging from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia to 
achieve a full range of tau pathology. It is expected that at least 65% of the subjects 
enrolled will have dementia or MCI.  
Front -Runners : 
Up to the first 6 subjects that come to autopsy will be considered front-runners. Avid will 
not be blinded to the front-runner imaging and pathology results and may use these to  
evaluate the study methods and refine the methods if needed for the subsequent blinded 
cases. Subjects that are part of the front-runners will not be included in the P rimary 
Efficacy P opulation. 
Primary Efficacy  Population :  
All subjects with valid autopsies that occur after the f ront- runner group has completed and 
before the sample size requirement /trial stopping criteria (below) have  been met will be 
considered part of the Primary Efficacy Population.  Some subjects may have died and had autopsy material removed at the time the sample size requirement is met. Subjects for 
whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met  will also be 
included in the P rimary Efficacy Population.

Primary Objective :  
This study is designed to test the relationship between ante -mortem 18F-AV-1451 Positron 
Emission Tomography ( PET) imaging and tau neurofibrillary pathology associated with 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) , as measured at autopsy. To accomplish this goal, t wo primary 
analyses will be performed :  
Primary Analysis 1  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers ’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern of 
18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to Neurofibrillary Tangle ( NFT ) 
Score of B3 (Hyman et al., 2012; Montine et al. , 2012) at autopsy will be evaluated; 
and if success criteria are met , 
Primar y Analysis 2 
The diagnostic performance ( sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers ’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern of 
18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic 
change as defined by National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer’s Association  (NIA -AA) 
criteria ( Hyman et al., 2012) will be evaluated . For individuals with cognitive 
impairment, high  level s of AD neuropathologic change are considered adequate to 
explain cognitive impairment or dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co-primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
Secondary Objective:  
Secondary Analysis 1: To assess diagnostic performance of  ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging , based on majority interpretation of 5 independent readers , for detection 
of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to Neurofibrillary 
Tangle (NFT) Score of B3 and for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical 
uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic change as defined by 
National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer’s Association  (NIA -AA) criteria . 
Secondary Analysis 2: To assess agreement among readers  of 18F-AV-1451 PET 
scans .

See Section 5.3, Selection of Subjects. 
Study Design:  
This study is a clinic o-pathological study of the correspondence between 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging  and post-mortem assessment of tau pathology and associated  NIA -AA 
pathological diagnosis. 
The screening and imaging procedures have been designed to be tolerable for eligible  end-
of-life patients.  Individuals with terminal medical conditions  with  projected life 
expectancy of ≤ 6 months and/ or their legally authorized representative (LAR) will 
provide informed consent. T he subject will then  receive a PET scan with 18F-AV-1451 and 
will be followed to death . Subject s that have a historical  brain  Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging ( MRI ), acquired within 12 months of the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging visit, may  
consent to have the scan  made available to the designated imaging core lab . If death does 
not occur within nine months of the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan, the subject may be given the 
opportunity to undergo a second  18F-AV-1451 PET scan and continue in the protoc ol at 
the sponsor’s discretion ( screening assessments will not need to be repeated). If the subject 
subsequently comes to autopsy, the second scan (nearest to time of death) will be used in 
the efficacy analyses.  See below for exceptions related to cognitively normal subjects. 
Approximately 200 subjects may be enrolled and imaged with 18F-AV-1451 PET. It is 
expected that approximately 80 individuals will undergo post- mortem autopsy evaluation 
(including the Primary Efficacy Cohort and up to 6 subjects in a Front-Runner Cohort). 
The Primary Efficacy Cohort will form the basis for the tests of diagnostic performance  
(subjects for whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met 
will also be included in the Primary Efficacy Population) . The primary efficacy cohort will 
include all subjects with a valid PET scan  that come to autopsy before the sample size 
requirement/trial stopping criteria are met. In order to  control for the potential progressive 
change in tau deposition over time, c ognitively impaired s ubjects will not have an autopsy 
performed or be included in the primary efficacy cohort if death does not occur within 
nine months of a valid imaging session.   However, because cortical tau deposition is 
expected to occur very slowly, if  at all, in c ognitively normal (unimpaired) subjects, 
cognitively normal subjects will not be required to undergo repeat scans. Cognitively 
normal subjects will remain eligible for  autopsy, regardless of time from first scan  or 
second scan to autopsy, and will be included in the primary efficacy cohort  if the subject 
comes to autopsy any time before the trial stopping criteria are met. 
Up to  the first 6 subjects that come to autopsy will be considered front- runners.  Results 
from the front-runners will be analyzed on a patient -by-patient basis  and may be used to 
refine the PET or autopsy methods (e.g. pathology staining/quantitation methods ). Upon 
completion of the final front -runner subject  analysis , the final imaging and autopsy

methods will be specified . No additional  PET image reads  or autopsy analyses will be 
performed until the PET imag e read and autopsy methods have been finalized.  The 
primary efficacy analyse s will be performed on those subjects  with valid imaging data that 
come to autopsy after the front -runners (Primary Efficacy Cohort). The front-runners will 
not be included in the primary efficacy analyses, but additional analys es of combined 
primary  plus front -runner cases  may  be performed . 
The first 30 PET scans collected  will be reviewed by a n independent Data Monitoring 
Board ( DMB ). The DMB will assess whether the scans can be evaluated  in a manner 
consistent with methods developed in Phase II (18F-AV-1451-A05 Exploratory Phase 
Cohort ) as determined by criteria outlined in the Data M onitoring Board Charter. The 
DMB will have the ability to recommend unblinding the Sponsor to all 30 cases if a pre-
specified  number of scans in the autopsy population have anomalies not present in the 
early phase studies . Study enrollment will continue during the DMB’s review. In the event 
the Sponsor proceeds with a DMB recommendation for unblinding, the unblinded subjects 
will be excluded from the P rimary Efficacy Cohort (neither the scans nor any autopsies 
will be used in the primary analyse s) or the study may be terminated . If unblinding occurs, 
it must be completed before the final image read and autopsy methods are specified. 
Avid personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy Cohort 18F-AV-1451 PET images .  
A single Avid member will perform periodic quality assurance ( QA) by reviewing a listing  
of the PET image header data (not to exceed 20% unless issues identified that warrant 
additional review ). These QA reviews will serve to ensure image quality control processes 
at the imaging core lab oratory are adequately performed. Avid staff performing the PET 
image data header  QA assessment will not be aware of  the clinical status for the 
subjects/images being reviewed.  The independent blinded readers and DMB will be 
blinded to the subject clinical status and autopsy results. The pathology core lab (s) will be 
blinded to the subject clinical status , PET scan images, and read results . All other Avid 
personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy C ohort 18F-AV-1451 read results and 
pathology data. 
Visits and Assessments:  
Each subject will have a screening visit, up to two 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging visits, and a 
follow- up phone call after each imaging visit.  Subjects who come to autopsy during the 
study period will receive a post- mortem evaluation.  
Specific details of assessments that will be performed at each visit are detailed in Section 
7.1.

18F-AV-1451 retention on PET images from subjects  with valid autopsy data will be 
interpreted by visual examination as either  
• Neocortical U ptake Not Consistent with an AD P attern ( AD-: no increased neocortical 
activity in any region or increased activity is isolated to the mesial temporal, 
anterolateral temporal or frontal region(s) ); 
• Neocortical Uptake Consistent with an AD P attern ( AD+: increased neocortical tracer 
activity in the posterolateral temporal (PLT), parietal (including precuneus), or 
occipital region(s)); or  
• Neocortical Uptake Consistent with an AD P attern and with Likelihood of Disease 
Progression (AD++ , which is a subset of AD+ (n eocortical uptake consistent with an 
AD pattern ) where increased tracer activity is found in the parietal (including 
precuneus) region(s) regardless of uptake elsewhere, or frontal region in addition to 
PLT, occipital, or parietal region(s) ). 
For the purpose of testing the primary analyses, a scan interpretation will be considered positive (hypothesized to correspond to a B3 neuropathology score in Primary Analysis 1 and an NIA-AA score of high AD pathology in Primary Analysis 2) if the scan is interp reted as at least consistent with an AD pattern ( AD+ or AD++).  
Details of the visual PET image review methods will be provided in the Blinded Read Manual.  
Images will also be assessed quantitatively (semi- automated computerized measurement 
of Standard Upta ke Value Ratios [ SUVRs ]) for exploratory analysis purposes. Details of 
the analysis methods will be provided in the Quantitative Methodology Document.  
The 
18F-AV-1451 PET imaging results will not be shared with the investigator sites  or 
subjects and their families  prior to the end of the study.  
Neuropathology Evaluation 
All neuropathological measurements on brain tissue in this trial will be evaluated in a 
standardized and blinded (with respect to PET image results and subject 
identifying/clinical information) fashion in a qualified laboratory. A Technical Autopsy 
Manual and Neuropathology Analysis Plan will be developed for this study containing all methods and measurement procedures. Neuropathological assessment will be derived from 
the NIA -AA guidelines ( Hyman  et al., 2012; Montine et al. , 2012).  Sections from brain 
regions recommended for pathological assessment of AD, as well as additional, pre-
specified neocortical regions will be sampled . Staining will follow the procedures 
recommended in the NIA- AA practical approach guidelines . NFT extent will be assessed  
using standard procedures and NFT scores  (B0-B3) will be recorded  (Hyman  et al. , 2012; 
Montine et al. , 2012). The Truth S tandard  (TS) for Primary Analysis 1 will be constructed 
from NFT scores as shown in Table 1.

Primary Analysis 2  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern of 
18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic 
change as defined by NIA -AA criteria (Hyman  et al.,  2012) will be evaluated. For 
individuals with cognitive impairment, high  level s of AD neuropathologic change are 
considered adequate to explain cognitive impairment or dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co-primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan .  
For Primary A nalysis 1, the hypothesis to be test ed is that for the same 3 out of 5 
independent readers the lower bound of the two -sided  95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
both sensitivity and the specificity of 18F-AV-1451 PET reading results will be ≥ 50%. As 
detailed in  Table 1 above, NFT scores  for autopsy cases will be categorized as either 
B0/B1/B2 or B3 level and will serve as the NFT Score TS for this analysis. 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging  will be classified as eith er AD- or AD+/AD++  by each reade r. Sensitivity 
and specificity will be calculated  for each reader  as the proportions of True Positive (TP) 
and True Negative (TN) cases  correctly identified as such,  according to Table  3 below:

readers,  the lower bound of the 95% CIs for both sensitivity and specificity are ≥ 50% 
(i.e., statistically significant at two -sided significance level of 0.05).  
Like Primary Analysis 1, the hypothesis to be tested for Primary Analysis 2 is that for the 
same 3 out of 5 readers, the lower bound of the 95% CIs for both sensitivity and the 
specificity will be ≥ 50%. For  Primary  Analysis  2, autopsy cases will be categorized as 
either [not, low or intermediate ] vs. [ high] level of AD neuropathologic change according 
to NIA -AA criteri a, considering Braak stage, Thal plaque score, and CERAD amyloid 
neuritic plaque score, and this level of AD neuropatholog ic change will be used as the 
NIA-AA Autopsy Diagnosis  TS (Table 2, above) .  
18F-AV-1451 PET images will be interpreted by visual examination as either AD- or 
AD+/AD++ by each reader . Sensitivity and specificity will then be calculated  for each 
reader  as the proportions of True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN) cases correctly 
identified as such, according to  Table 4 below :

The secondary efficacy analyses will assess the performance of the blinded 18F-AV-1451 
PET scan reader s in the following two ways:  
Secondary Analysis 1: Assess diagnostic performance of ante -mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging based on majority interpretation of 5 independent readers : Diagnostic 
performance will be assessed relative to the Autopsy NFT score TS as per Primary 
Analysis 1 and again relative to the NIA- AA Autopsy Diagnosis TS as per Primary 
Analysis 2.  In each  case (image) , a majority reading result will be derived using each

individual reader’s scan interpretation results. Sensitivity and specificity, and two-sided 
95% CI thereof, will be calculated for the majority interpretation results  relative to the 
appropriate TS. The hypothes es to be tested are: 
1a: the majority reading result will have the lower bounds of two -sided 95% CI ≥ 55 % 
for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of tau neurofibrillary pathology that 
corresponds to NFT Scores of B3, and  
1b: the majority reading result will have the lower bounds of two -sided 95% CI ≥ 55 % 
for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 
neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic change as 
defined by NIA -AA criteria . 
Secondary Analysis 2: Assess agreement among readers of 18F-AV-1451 PET scans: 
Fleiss’ Kappa statistics will be used to assess inter -reader agreement for the diagnostic 
decisions associated with Primary Analyses 1 and 2.  For evaluation of agreement in the 
context of Primary Analysis 1, kappa will be calculated according to the reader 
interpretation classification in Table 3. If Primary Analysis 1 is successful , a second kappa 
will be performed using the reader interpretation classification in  Table 4 . The hypothesis 
to test is the observed kappa values are  ≥ 0.64 and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% 
CIs for this assessment are ≥ 0.55. 
Safety data will be tabulated.  
 
Sample Size Calculation and T rial Stopping Criteria  
Assuming sensitivity/specificity of approximately 80%, a minimum of 14 autopsy cases in 
each of the truth standard groups (pathological positive or negative) is required for the 
lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI to be > 50% for each individual reader.  T he sponsor 
is blinded to the pathology results (truth standard) until after the study is completed and 
the database is locked.  Therefore, in order to ensure that an adequate number of subjects 
are recruited and come to autopsy for each truth standard group, the sponsor will assume that subjects diagnosed on clinical grounds as having dementia due to AD will be truth 
standard positive, subjects diagnosed as having no cognitive impairment (cognitively 
normal) will be truth standard negative.  Based on these assumptions, the study sample size requirement and trial stopping criteria will be deemed to have been met when  
• the number of subjects diagnosed as having impairment due to AD that have come to autopsy, is greater than or equal to 14, AND 
• the number of subjects diagnosed as having no cognitive impairment that have come to autopsy is greater than or equal to 14

The sponsor recognizes that there may be some errors in clinical diagnosis such that some 
patients diagnosed clinically as having impairment due to AD may have a nonAD 
pathology, or limited amounts of AD tau pathology, and thus be truth standard negative, 
and, less often, subjects considered clinically normal may have AD pathology and be truth 
standard positive.  However, given the excess frequency of  cases with AD diagnoses 
relative to clinically normal subjects already recruited in this trial population, any 
diagnos tic errors will likely help ensure a minimum of 14 truth standard negative subjects 
without jeopardizing the criterion for truth standard positive subjects. 
In addition to subjects diagnosed as clinically normal or AD patients, it is expected that 
approximately 10-15 subjects with nonAD impairments will be enrolled and come to 
autopsy in this trial.  However, the proportion of these that will have truth standard 
positive/negative AD tau pathology is very difficult to predict and will depend on the precise cases enrolled .  Thus , it is not expected that these cases will be useful in estimating 
when a sufficient number of cases have occurred in  each truth standard group and are not 
employed in the stopping criteria .  
No new autopsies will begin once the sample size requirement/trial stopping criteria are 
met.  However, some subjects may have died and had autopsy material removed at the 
time the sample size requirement is met. Histology analysis will be completed in subjects 
for whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met and these subjects will also be included in the Primary Efficacy Population.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Molecular imaging biomarkers have the potential to aid in the diagnosis of patients with 
cognitive impairment (Dubois  et al.,  2010; McKhann et al. , 2011). PET ligands such as 
florbetapir F 18 (Wong et al., 2010) provide a minimally invasive estimate of cortical 
beta amyloid (Aβ) neuritic plaque deposition, which is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  and a required element for the neuropathologic diagnosis of 
AD (Hyman  et al. , 2012). More recently, imaging biomarkers for tau protein, the other 
required pathology for AD, have become available (Chien et al. , 2103; Xia et al., 2013). 
Amyloid is believed to accumulate very early in the AD disease process (Jack et al., 
2010) and may be present in other diseases or as an incidental finding in patients with other dementias  (Siderowf et al., 2014; Serrano et al. , 2014). While amyloid deposition is 
required for the diagnosis of AD, its  density or distribution is not associated with disease 
duration or severity (Nelson et al. , 2012).  
In contrast to Aβ neuritic plaques, the density and distribution of phosphorylated tau, 
aggregated in neurofibrillary tangles, increases with AD -related co gnitive impairment 
and correlates with neurodegeneration (Dickson et al., 1997; Duyckaerts et al., 1987; 
Nelson  et al. , 2012). Thus, a PET imaging agent that binds to phosphorylated tau has 
potential application as a biomarker for disease severity and may be useful for selecting patients for therapy , monitoring disease progression  and assessing response to putative 
disease modify treatments . 
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F-18]T807 by Siemens Molecular Imaging Biomarker 
Research group) has been developed as a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical for in 
vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates (Xia et al., 2013; Chien et al. 2013). 
Autoradiography results using tissue sections from human brains showed a strong signal 
in the grey matter of cortical slices from tau positive brains but weak or no binding in tau 
negative, Aβ positive, or tau and Aβ  negative tissue.  Scatchard analysis based on this 
heterogeneous autoradiography assay yielded an estimated Kd of 15nM. A saturation binding experiment using purified Pai red Helical Filament (PHF) Tau isolated brains of 
AD patients yielded a Kd value of 0.54 nM. 
AV-1451 was assessed in competitive binding assays against a panel of 72 of the most 
common central nervous system (CNS) targets and no clinically relevant inhibition was seen.  AV-1451 was positive in the in vitro hERG assay; however, in vivo cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum human dose (MHD). Nonetheless, until suffic ient 
human cardiovascular safety data are available, clinical studies will exclude subjects with 
a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes and subjects taking drugs known to 
prolong the QT interval. 
In vivo  safety pharmacology studies were also con ducted in rats to determine potential 
effects on the CNS and respiratory systems. In these studies no clinically relevant effects 
were reported at doses exceeding 100x the intended MHD. Additionally, non- radioactive 
AV-1451 has been tested in single and re peat-dose toxicology studies in rat and dog. In 
each of these studies the no observable adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were the highest doses tested (150x MHD for single, 50x MHD for repeat).

Potential genotoxicity of non- radioactive AV -1451 was tested in both in vitro  and in vivo 
assays.  In the in vitro  assays, AV -1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity. 
However, in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled 
allometrically), AV -1451 showed no evidence of genotoxicity. The di fferent results in the 
in vitro genotoxicity assays and the in vivo  micronucleus study are likely related to 
differences in the exposure conditions encountered by the target cells in the different test 
systems. In vivo, AV-1451 is cleared rapidly; however, the i n vitro  experiments employ 
static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test article. While the in 
vitro  data show the potential for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide assurance that 
genotoxicity is unlikely to occur at clini cally -relevant doses for human diagnostic studies. 
Three human clinical studies have been completed with 18F-AV-1451. A total of 59 
subjects have been exposed to 18F-AV-1451 in these studies. The following side effects 
have been reported in clinical studies: diarrhea, headache, and altered taste. All reported events were mild in intensity and all subjects recovered from these events.  
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. Generally, the radiotracer 
distribution was consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance.  
There were three organs that received estimated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The 
organ that received the largest estimated dose was the upper large intestinal wall (0.0962 
± 0. 0134 mSv/MBq), followed by the small intestine and the liver.  The Effective Dose 
was 0.0241 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. This results in an estimated Effective Dose of 8.70 mSv 
for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of 
approved 18F- labeled compoun ds such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and florbetapir F 
18 injection.  
Evaluation of the PET images from completed studies demonstrates little focal cortical 
retention of 
18F-AV-1451 in either young cognitively normal ( YCN) or  older cognitively 
normal ( OCN) subjects known to be amyloid negative (florbetapir PET SUVR <1.10; 
Figure  1 Panels A and B). However, OCN subjects frequently demonstrated retention in  
the mesial temporal lobes and some OCN subjects also demonstrated retention in the 
brainstem or striatum ( Figure  1 Panel B).  In MCI and AD subjects, retention appeared to 
spread from mesial temporal lobes to isocortical areas ( Figure  1 Panels C -F). The pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 distribution seen on PET imaging, across subjects with various levels of 
impairment, paralleled the  pattern reported in the classic autopsy series  of older persons 
and subsequently used to define the Braak stage (Braak  and Braak , 1991).  Two clinically 
diagnosed AD subjects that were found to be amyloid negative on a florbetapir PET scan were the exception to this pattern, as their scans were similar to clinically normal elder controls and showed no cortical 
18F-AV-1451 retention ( Figure  1 Panel G).

Comparison of tracer binding to aggregated protein with autopsy material is one means of 
valid ating a novel PET agent. Multiple studies have been completed comparing amyloid 
PET scans to histopathologic assessment of amyloid burden subjects for whom biopsy 
samples were available or who came to autopsy after receiving a PET amyloid scan.  
These studies support the relationship between PET amyloid imaging results and cortical 
neuritic plaque density (Clark et al.,  2011, 2012; Leinonen et al. , 2008; Sojkova et al. , 
2011; Kantarci et al. , 2011; Burack et al. , 2010). The large r autopsy studies (Clark  et al.,  
2012; Curtis et al. , 2015; Sabri  et al. , 2015) demonstrated a high sensitivity and 
specificity for amyloid  PET to discriminate subjects with subsequent autopsy findings of 
no or sparse neuritic plaques (amyloid negative) from those with mode rate to frequent 
plaques (amyloid positive). 
By contrast, systematic studies correlating imaging data from tau ligands with post-
mortem verification of AD pathology have not been completed. The goal of this protocol 
is to generate evidence to support the r elationship between PET imaging with  18F-AV-
1451 PET imaging and AD neuropathology assessed at autopsy.  
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES 
2.1. Primary Objective :  
This study is designed to test the relationship between ante -mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging and tau neurofibrillary pathology associated with AD, as measured at autopsy. 
To accomplish this goal, two primary analyses will be performed:  
Primary Analysis 1  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to NFT Score of B3 (Hyman  et 
al., 2012; Montine et al., 2012) at autopsy will be evaluated; and if success criteria are 
met, 
Primary Analysis 2  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD 
neuropathologic change as defined by NIA -AA criteria (Hyman  et al.,  2012) will be 
evaluated. For individuals with cognitive impairment, high level s of AD 
neuropathologic change are considered adequate to explain cognitive impairment or 
dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co -primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan .

2.2. Secondary Objective: 
To assess performance of  independent, blinded readers of 18F-AV-1451 PET scans: 
Secondary Analysis 1: To assess diagnostic performance of  ante- mortem 18F-AV-
1451 PET imaging, based on majority interpretation of 5 independent readers , for 
detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to 
Neurofibrillary Tangle (NFT) Score of B3 and for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-
1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic 
change as defined by National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer’s Association  (NIA -

5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
5.1. Overall Design and Plan  of Trial  
This study is a clinico -pathological study of the correspondence between 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging and post-mortem assessment of tau pathology and associated NIA -AA 
pathol ogical diagnosis. 
The screening and imaging procedures have been designed to be tolerable for eligible 
end-of-life patients.  Individuals with terminal medical conditions  with projected life 
expectancy of ≤ 6 months and/ or their LA R will provide informed consent. T he subject 
will then  receive a PET scan with 18F-AV-1451 and will be followed to death . Subjects 
that have a historical brain MRI, acquired within 12 months of the 18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging visit, may consent to have the scan made available to the  designated imaging 
core lab . If death does not occur within nine months of the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan, the 
subject may be given the opportunity  to undergo a second  18F-AV-1451 PET scan and 
continue in the protocol at the sponsor’s discretion (screening asses sments will not need 
to be repeated). If the subject subsequently comes to autopsy, the second scan (nearest to 
time of death) will be used in the efficacy analyses.   
Approximately 200 subjects may be enrolle d and imaged with 18F-AV-1451 P ET. It is 
expected t
hat approximately 80 individuals will unde rgo post- mortem a utopsy (including 
the Primary Efficacy Cohort and 6 subjects in a Front-Runner Cohort). T he Primary 
Efficacy C ohort will form the  basis for the tests  of diagnostic p er fo rmance. T he Primary 
Efficacy Cohort 
will include all subjects with a valid PET scan that come to autopsy 
before the sample size requirement/trial stopping criteria  (Section 8.6) are met ( subjects 
for whom a
utopsies a re ong oing a t the time the s ample s ize re quirement is me t will also 
be included in the Primary Efficacy Population) . In order to control for the potenti al 
progressive change in t au de position  over time ,  cognitively impa ire d subjects w ill not 
have an a
utopsy performed or be included in the Primary Efficacy Cohort if death does 
not occur within nine months of a valid imaging session.  H owever, be cause cortical t au 
deposition is expected to occur very slowly, if at all, in cognitively normal (unimpaired) 
subjects, cognitively normal subjects will not be required to underg o repeat s cans. 
Cognitive
ly no rmal subjects w ill remain e ligible for autopsy , regardless of  ti me from  first 
scan or se
cond scan t o autops y, and will be  included in the primary e fficacy cohor t if the  
subject com es
 to aut opsy an y time before the trial st opping  criteria are met . No new 
autopsies will begin once the sample size requirement and tr
ial stopping criteria (Section 
8.6) are met.   However, some subjects may have died and had autopsy material removed 
at the  time the s ample s ize requirement is me t. Histology a nalysis w ill be  completed in

subjects for whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met 
and these subjec ts will also be included in the Primary Efficacy Population.  
Up to the first 6 subjects that come to autopsy will be considered front- runners.  Results 
from the front-runners will be analyzed on a patient -by-patient basis  and may be used to 
refine the PET o r autopsy methods  (e.g. pathology staining/quantitation methods ). Upon 
completion of the final front-runner subject analysis , the final imaging and autopsy 
methods will be specified . No additional PET image reads  or autopsy analyses will be 
performed until the PET image read and autopsy methods have been finalized. The primary efficacy analyse s will be performed on those subjects  with valid imaging data 
that come to autopsy after the front -runners (Primary Efficacy Cohort). The front -runners 
will not be  included in the primary efficacy analyses, but additional analys es of combined 
primary  plus front -runner cases  may  be performed . 
The first 30 PET scans collected will be reviewed by an independent DMB. The DMB will assess whether the scans can be evaluated in  a manner consistent with methods 
developed in Phase II (
18F-AV-1451-A05 Exploratory Phase Cohort ) as determined by 
criteria outlined in the Data Monitoring Board Charter. The purpose of establishing these criteria for review by the DMB is to ensure that s cans in the autopsy population do not 
appear significantly different than scans obtained in early phase studies, where subjects 
were not at end -of-life. The DMB will have the ability to recommend unblinding the 
Sponsor to all 30 cases if a pre- specified number of scans in the autopsy population have 
anomalies not present in the early phase studies. Study enrollment will continue during the DMB’s review.  In the event the Sponsor proceeds with the DMB recommendation for 
unblinding, the unblinded subjects will be excluded from the Primary Efficacy Cohort 
(neither the scans nor any autopsies will be used in the primary analyse s) or the study 
may be terminated.  If unblinding occurs, it must be completed before the final image read 
and autopsy methods are specified. If clinically significant incidental findings  are 
identified on a PET scan, the DMB will communicate the findings to Avid. This process will be described in the DMB C harter.  
Avid personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy Cohort 
18F-AV-1451 PET i mages . 
A single Avid member will perform periodic quality assurance (QA) by reviewing a 
listing of the PET image header data  (not to exceed 20% unless issues identified that 
warrant additional review ). These QA reviews will serve to ensure quality control 
processes at the imaging core laboratory are adequately performed . Avid staff performing 
the PET  image data header  QA assessment will not be aware of the clinical status for the 
subjects/images being reviewed. The independent blinded reader s and DMB will be 
blinded to the subject clinical status and autopsy results. The pathology core lab (s) will 
be blinded to the subject clinical status , PET scan images, and read results . All other Avid 
personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy C ohort 18F-AV-1451 read results and 
pathology data.

5.2. Planned  Dosage and Duration of Treatment  
5.2.1. Dosage and Administration  
All subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration target dose of 370 MBq (10 
mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection. 
5.2.2. Rationale for Dosage  
This trial is designed to evaluate the brain tau protein imaging properties of 18F-AV-1451 
to be used in subjects near end -of-life. 18F-AV-1451 will be administered IV in a 
radioactive target  dose of 370 MBq with a MHD limited to 20  µg of compound by mass . 
This dose is 150-fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity 
study and is 50-fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies.  
Human  dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective 
Dose of 8.70 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to 
the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as FDG and Florbetapir F 18 
Injection. 
The proposed dose has been shown to have acceptable image quality in previous human 
studies.  
5.3. Selection  of Subjects  
Subjects will be enrolled in the study with the intent of capturing  a range of tau 
neurofibrillary pathology in AD. In order to accomplish this goal in living subjects, cases 
will be classified based  on clinical features that are believed to be related to tau pathology 
such as cognitive status and age. Enrollment will not be formally stratified, but it is 
expected that at least 65% of the subjects enrolled will have dementia or MCI. The study 
sponsor will review enrollment on an ongoing basis to ensure that subjects that represent a broad range of age (including individuals aged  > 80 years ) and cognitive performance 
are enrolled.  A limited number of subjects  with end stage dementia may be enrolled at 
sponsor’s discretion both to ensure appropriate balance across the cognitive spectrum and because these subjects may have difficulty participating in the PET scan.  This review will 
be performed based on clinical data only and the sponsor will remain blinded to  PET scan 
results.  
5.3.1. Inclusion  Criteria  
Only s ubjects who meet all of the following criteria will be reviewed and will be  eligible 
to enroll in the study:  
1. Are males or females ≥ 50 years of age ; 
2. Have a projected life expectancy of ≤ 6 months as determined by the principal investigator (terminal medical condition such as end- stage congestive heart 
failure,  end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], end- stage renal 
disease, or end -stage cancer);

AV-1451 PET Imaging and Post- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 25 of 50   
3. Can tolerate a 20 minute PET scan. The principal i nvestigator will carefully 
assess each subject  and use medical judgment to determine whether the subject  
can tolerate the PET scan procedure;  and 
4. Give informed consent or have a legally authorized representative (LAR)  to 
consent for study procedures and brain donation consistent with the legal 
requirements of the State in which they die. 
5.3.2. Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects will be excluded from enrollment if they: 
1. Are aggressively being treated with life sustaining measures (e.g., receiving chemotherapy,  currently on respirator; palliative chemotherapy is allowed ); 
2. Are known to have a structural brain lesion that would interfere either with PET imaging or pathological assessment. (Such lesions  are typically > 2 cm at their 
greatest extent and may include stroke, pri mary or metastatic neoplasm, other 
tumors or cystic lesions. Subjects with a history of major stroke or other structural lesion as well as cases with a history of primary CNS neoplasm or known metastatic cancer  must be discussed with the study sponsor prior to enrollment); 
3. Have a clinically significant infectious disease,  such as  Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis or prion disease; 
4. Are currently  receiving any investigational medications  except with permission 
from  the study sponsor; 
5. Have ever participated in an experimental study with an amyloid  or tau  targeting 
agent (e.g.,  immunotherapy, secretase inhibitor); 
6. Have suspected encephalopathy due to alcoholism or end- stage liver disease;  
7. Are females of childbearing potential who are pr egnant or not using adequate 
contraception; 
8. Subjects who have a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (e.g., hypokalemia, family history of Long QT syndrome) or are taking drugs that are known to cause QT-prolongation (a list of prohibited and discouraged medications is provided by the Sponsor). 
5.4. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Except as noted in the exclusion criteria , all medications (prescription or over-the-
counter) that have been started prior to screening may be continued during the cours e of 
the trial.  All medications that are continued from the start of the trial or that are started 
during the trial (other than the study medication) must be documented in the case record form on the Concomitant Medication Page of the electronic Case Report Form (e CRF).   
5.5. Removal of Subjects from Trial  
Subjects must be removed from the trial if:  
LY3191748
18F-AV-1451-A16: “ A Clinico -Pathological Study of the Correspondence Between 18F-
AV-1451 PET Imaging and Post- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 26 of 50 
1. Informed consent is withdrawn; or
2. The investigator or the sponsor believes it is in the best interest of the subject to
be removed from the trial.
Subjects may b e withdrawn from the trial if a serious adverse event occurs. The date and 
reason for discontinuation should be noted on the e CRF.  
5.6. Premature Termination of Trial/Closure of Center  
The sponsor may discontinue the trial at any time. Reasons for discontinuation of the trial 
may include, but are not limited to, new information on safety or efficacy, requests from 
regulatory authorities, changes in business priorities, or study termination upon review of 
the recommendations/findings of the DMB . Additional reasons for center closure may 
include, but are not limited to, excessive protocol violations, inadequate regard for 
subject safety, failure to follow recommended procedures (e.g., documentation), failure 
or inability to accommodate  Avid/C ontract Research Organi zation (CRO) monitors or to 
provide required access to data and source documents, staff turnover or inadequate 
staffing, and inadequate enrollment. Except in cases affecting subject safety, the 
investigators will be given a minimum of 30 days to complete f inal study evaluations for 
ongoing subjects. In all cases of center or study termination, appropriate steps will be taken to ensure the safety of study subjects. 
6. PRODUCT RISK ASSESSMENT
The most up- to-date and complete information regarding the use of 18F-AV-1451 
Injection can be found in the investigator's brochure.  
In brief, 18F-AV-1451 Injection is an experimental imaging agent that will be used at 
relatively low (tracer) doses. Because 18F-AV-1451 Injection is under clinical 
investigation, it is recommended that subjects receiving 18F-AV-1451 Injection be 
followed closely by means of adverse event reporting and vital signs. There are no data on the effects of 
18F-AV-1451 Injection in human perinatal 
development. For this reason, females must avoid becoming pregnant. Both females and 
males must use adequate contraceptive methods for  24 hours after administration of 18F-
AV-1451 Injection. 18F-AV-1451 Injection must not be administered to females who are 
pregnant or lact ating.  Males with female partners who are pregnant or of childbearing 
potential must agree to refrain from sexual activity for 24 hours following administration 
of 18F-AV-1451 Injection.  Additionally, males must agree not to donate sperm for 24 
hours following administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection.

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 27 of 50   
7.1.1. Screening Visit:  
Screening may take place over several days  and can occur at multiple locations (e.g. 
hospice, subject’s home, research office, or clinic) . All screening assessments will 
preferably be performed within 45 days prior to the PET imaging session. Some 
screening assessments may be performed on the imag ing day prior to injection with 
sponsor approval. Screening assessments will include:  
1. Informed consent (for clinical, imaging and autopsy procedures); 
2. Obtain historical brain MRI images if available;  
3. Demographics and baseline characteristics  (e.g. birth year, gender, race, ethnicity,  
education); 
4. Medical history  and concomitant medications; 
5. Brief physical and neurological exam;  
6. Neurologic disease history (if relevant: date or months since symptom onset, date 
or months since diagnosis, family history of neurologic disease);  
7. Mini-M ental Status Examination  (MMSE) may be obtained if the subject is able 
to cooperate with  the test ; 
8. Caregiver  or informant  to complete  IQCODE ; 
9. Urine pregnancy test (for females  of childbearing potential);  
10. Vital signs , including the most recent height and weight which will be collected 
from subject’s previous medical record; and  
11. A physician  or appropriate designee evaluation and summary of current medical 
status.  
7.1.2. 18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging Visit (s): 
1. The subject will be seen by a physician prior to dose administration who will 
assess their ability to safely tolerate  the imaging procedure; 
2. Females of childbearing potential will have a urine (or serum  if required by local 
IRB)  pregnancy test prior to injection (the result must be negative for the subject 
to be administered 18F-AV-1451); 
3. A target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 will be administered  
intravenously and a 20-minute continuous brain PET imaging will begin 80 
minutes post injection ; 
4. Images will be reconstructed and reviewed immediately after completion of the scan;  
5. Vital signs will be taken immediately prior to administration of 
18F-AV-1451, and 
after completion of imaging, prior to discharge; 
6. Subjects will be observed continuously for signs of adverse events (AE) o r serious  
adverse events (SAE) . All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution;  
LY3191748

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 28 of 50 
7.The injection site will be observed for excessive inflammation or damage to the
surrounding tissue where the dose was injected; and
8.A physician will see the subject prior to discharge to evaluate the subject’sreadiness for  discharge.
Follow-Up Phone Call: 
A follow-up phone call to the subject, ( or caregiver /informant if applicable ), will be 
conducted within 2 or 3 business days of the imaging day, but not before 48 hours post-injection, to confirm subject well-being and to collect information about any new adverse events. If both of these days are not business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the 
following business day. End of study for the purpose of adverse event reporting is 
defined as the completion of the follow-up phone call.  
7.1.3. Death and Autopsy:  
1.The responsible family member or caregiver /informant will be contacted
immediately after  the time of death to obtain a description of events leading up to
death ;
2. Subjects will not have an autopsy performed or be included in the primary
analyses if death does not occur within nine months of the most recent imaging
session  or if tissue has not been acquired before the r equired number of autopsies
for the study has  been c ompleted .
3. If subject and/or LAR consented, additional research and genetic testing will be
performed on brain tissue.
Detailed autopsy procedures are described in the Technical Autopsy Manual.   
7.1.4. Additional PET Imaging 
If death does not occur within nine months of the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan, t he subject 
may b e given the oppor tunity to undergo a second  18F-AV-1451 PET scan and continue 
in the protocol at the sponsor’s discreti on. In order to obtain a second sca n before the 
nine month ex
piry date, it is recommended the second scan be performed any time 
between six and nine months after the first scan. If the  subject a grees t o a second  18F-AV- 
1451 PET scan, s creening assessments will not be repeated. The procedures in Section 
7.1.2 will be performed and updated m edical history /concurrent medications and an 
updated neurological disease diagnosis (according  to bes t av ailable information)  will be  
col
lected. If the subj
ect subsequently comes to autopsy, the second scan (nearest to time 
of death) will be used in the efficacy ana lyses. Because cortical t au de position  is expected 
to occur very slowly, if at all, in cognitively normal (unimpaired) subjects, cognitively 
normal subjects will not be required to undergo repeat scans. Cognitively normal subjects 
will remain e ligible f or autopsy , regardless of  ti me from  first scan or secon d scan to 
autopsy , and will be included in the primary efficacy cohort if the subject comes to 
autopsy any time be fore the tr ial stopping  criteria are me t. Subj ects of other cognit ive 
status  that do not consent to a sec ond 18F-AV-1451 PET scan w ill not be  included in the 
primary analys es unless death occurs within nine months of the initial scan.

7.2. Observations and Measurements  
Informed Consent 
Potential subjects a nd LARs , if applicable, w ill be  all owed to read a writt en informed 
consent form. The principal investigator or designee will explain all study procedures, 
risks, and al ternative therapies t o the subject a nd LA R, i f applicabl e. The subject a nd 
LAR w ill have an opportunity to have all questions answered. The appropriate parties 
will then sign and date the informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate 
in the study and brain donation ( see Section 7.5). A copy of the signed informed consent 
will be  given to the  subject a nd/or LAR.  
All infor
med consent forms must be approved by Avid or designee, and by the 
appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to use. 
IQCODE – Short Version  
Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE; Jorm 1994) is a 
tool use d to assess cognitive impairment in older people. IQCODE will be administered 
to the subject’s caregiver/informant.  
Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
The MMSE  (Folstein et al., 1975) is a brief instrument used to assess cognitive function 
in elderly patients. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention. The maximum score for the first section is 21. The second section tests the ability of the patient to name objects, follow verbal and written 
commands, write a sentence, and copy figures. The maximum score for the second section is 9. The range for the total MMSE score is 0 to 30. The MMSE will be administered at screening to subjects that are able to cooperate with testing.  
Medical History, Neurologic Disease History 
The investigator or designee will obtain a case history at the screening visit.  Whenever 
possible, the medical history will be confirmed by medical records.  
•Relevant demographic information ( e.g. birth year, gender, race, ethnicity,
education);
•Social history /baseline characteristics  (e.g. history of alcohol, drug use, and
smoking, prior CSF or genetic testing results);
•Medical and surgical history;
•Concurrent medications ;
•Neurologic Disease history (if relevant: date or  months since symptom onset,
date or months since diagnosis, family history of neurologic disease);
After the 48 hour follow-up phone call has been completed, additional medical history and concurrent medications will not be collected until death or unless the subject consents to a second  
18F-AV-1451 PET scan.   
Documentation of the events leading up to death will be collected.

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 30 of 50   
Physical Examin ation  
A brief  physical examination will be conducted  by a medically qualified study team 
member  at the  screening  visit.  Clinically significant changes from screening will be 
recorded as adverse events for the relevant study period.  
Neurological Examination  
A brief  neurological examination will be performed  by a medically qualified study team 
member  at the screening visit to evaluate cranial nerves, gait, sensory, and motor 
function, coordination and tendon reflexes. 
MRI  
Historical b rain MRIs that have been obtained within 12 months of the 18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging  visit and are available electronically will be sent to  the designated imaging core 
lab if the subject provides consent. 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs  (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) will be taken in the supine 
position at the following time points:  
• Screening Visit 
• 18F-AV-1451 Imaging Visit  
− Immediately prior to the administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection; 
− After the completion of imaging prior to discharge . 
Height and  Weight  
At the screening visit the most recent body weight and height will be collected from the 
subject’s medical record.   
Optional Brain Tissue Research/Genetic Test ing  
Additional research and g enetic testing is optional, and may be  performed on brain t issue  
and will be outlined in the Neuropathology Analysis Plan or other vendor manual. Where 
local regulations allow, samples will be stored and analysis may be performed on genetic 
variants thought to play a role in dementia or related diseases. Samples will only be used 
for investigations related to disease and drug or class of drugs under study in the context 
of this clinical program. They will not be used for broad exploratory unspecified disease or population genetic analysis.  
Samples will be identified by the subject number and stored for up to 15 years after the 
last subject  visit for the study at a facility selected by the sponsor. The sample and any 
data generated from it can only be linked back to the subject by investigator -site 
personnel. The re sults of this testing will not be shared with the principal investigator or 
subjects’ families.

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 31 of 50   
Pregnancy Testing  
A urine beta -hCG test  will be  performed at  screening  and at the 18F-AV-1451 imaging 
visit(s) prior to injection for females of childbearing potential (defined as pre-
menopausal, less than 2 years post- menopausal or not surgically sterile).  A serum 
pregnancy test may also be obtained prior to injection at the 18F-AV-1451 imaging 
visit(s) if required by the local site.  
Physician Visit 
At screening , a physician or designee must see the subject to evaluate their current 
medical status . 
A physician must see the subject prior to drug administration and prior to discharge from 
the 18F-AV-1451 imaging session . At this time, the physician should review all safety 
data and briefly examine/query the subject regarding potential adverse events or other treatment issues.  
Brain Autopsy 
For those subjects who come to autopsy, brain harvesting will be performed locally by 
the site in accordance with the Technical Autopsy Manual and tissue will be sent to a 
pathology core lab(s) for neuropathological examination according to the 
Neuropathology Analysis Plan , which will be written prior to the first subject 
neuropathology analysis  in this study . Autopsies will not be performed on subjects that 
live longer than nine months after the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan. 
Brain tissue will be under custody of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals for up to 15 years for 
research purposes. During this time Avid may choose to transfer the brain tissue to 
another laboratory for additional study related research, or to  a long term storage facility, 
or back to the clinical site or brain bank at which  the subject was previously enrolled. 
Autopsy reports will be sent to the principal investigators to share with the subjects’ families after the study has been completed . 
7.3. Protocol  for Image Collection  
The designated imaging core lab  will prepare and distribute a PET Technical Operations 
Manual for 18F-AV-1451. Histo rical brain MRI transmission procedures will be outlined 
in a separate document . 
7.4. Good Clinical Practice and Monitoring  
All clinical studies performed under the direction of Avid/CRO will be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements an d International Conference on 
Harmonization  (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Avid/CRO Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP).  
This includes: 
1. IRB approval: An investigation will be initiated at a study site only after the IRB for that study site has given their written approval of the protocol and informed 
consent; 
LY3191748
18F-AV-1451-A16: “ A Clinico -Pathological Study of the Correspondence Between 18F-
AV-1451 PET Imaging and Post- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 32 of 50 
2. Informed Consent: Study procedures will not be initiated until the subject and/or
their legally authorized representative (as appropriate) signs the informed consent
form;
3.Recording and monitoring of adverse events as outlined in Section 7.7.3  including
the notification  of study s ite clinic al investigators, local IRBs a nd the FDA
re
garding serious adverse event;
4. Avid RP’s
 obligation to monitor the participating center on a regular basis; and
5. The termination of a center or the trial if conditions apply, as outlined in Section
5.6. 
7.5. Informed Consent and Subject Information  
Potential subjects, or their LAR  (as appropriate),  will be allowed to read a written 
informed consent form. The principal investigator or designee will explain all study 
procedures, risks, and alternative therapies. The subject and LAR will have an 
opportunity to have all questions answered by a physician. The subject will then sign and 
date the informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study  and 
brain donation. 
End-of-life, as well as, AD s ubjects are potentially a vulnerable population with 
compromised mental capacity. Investigators should take extra care to evaluate a subject ’s 
ability to give consen t. If the subject is capable of giving informed consent then the 
subject should sign on the consent line of the informed consent form. If the subject is not 
capable of giving consent, consent may be given by a LAR, consistent with the 
requirements of the State where the subject resides and local IRB guidance. Subjects with the capacity to understand that they are engaging in a research study should affirm that 
they do not object to participating. Subjects lacking the capacity to assent and/or dissent 
will n ot be precluded from participation.  
All informed consent forms must be approved by Avid or designee, and by the 
appropriate IRB. No study-related procedures shall be performed prior to completion of 
the informed consent process, and signing of the consent form.  A copy of the signed 
informed consent should be given to the subject and/or their legally authorized 
representative for their records.  
7.6. Documentation  
18F-AV-1451 PET scans, as well as historical MRI scans,  will be saved in an appropriate 
electronic format as specified in the imaging  manual s. A copy  of all scans will be saved 
at the site/imaging center  and a copy  of each  will be forward ed to the designated imaging 
core lab as described in the i maging manual s. All other data requ ired by the  protocol will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  All data in the eCRF will be substantiated by “source 
documents,” which consist of the subject’s medical files, etc. All source  documentation 
must be made available to Avid and designees. Completed source documents and e CRFs 
may need to be made available and complete for an inspection by the FDA , other 
international regulatory authorities , or Avid at any time. A ballpoint pen should be used 
LY3191748
18F-AV-1451-A16: “ A Clinico -Pathological Study of the Correspondence Between 18F-
AV-1451 PET Imaging and Post- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 33 of 50 
to ensure that all copies are legible. eCRFs and all other records must be filed  in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations (see Section 10.6). 
7.7. Adverse Events (AE)  
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be followed 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  All AEs must 
be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page of the eCRF. Investigators will be instructed to report to Avid or its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to investigational product or protocol procedure vi a electronic data entry.  If a subject ’s 
treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly report to Avid or its designee via electronic data entry the circumstances and data leading to any such discontinuation of treatment. In cases where the investigator notices an 
unanticipated benefit to the subject , study site personnel should report “unexpected 
benefit” with the actual even t term to Avid or its designee (for example, the complete 
actual term would be “unexpected benefit - sleeping longer”).  
Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop 
dates /time, severity/intensity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome). Additionally, any clinically significant findings from vital sign measurements  
or other study procedures including those that result in a diagnosis should be reported as an AE to Avid or its designee.  
7.7.1. Adverse Event Monitoring  
Each subject  must be carefully monitored for adverse events. An assessment must be 
made of the severity/intensity and  relationship to the administration of the investigational 
product. 7.7.2. Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Events  
For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish among pre-existing conditions, treatment -
emergent adverse events and trial- emergent adverse events.  Pre-existing conditions (i.e., 
undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that begin prior to the Screening Visit) will 
be recorded on the medical history and/or physical exam eCRF pages.  Signs and 
symptoms that are believed to be due to the pre- existing c ondition (started prior to dose 
of investigational product) do not have to be recorded in the AEs section of the eCRF, 
unless there is an increas e in frequency or severity . Additionally, signs or symptoms or 
changes in pre- existing  conditions that occur outside the trial- defined adverse event 
reporting will be recorded in medical history.  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . For the purposes of this study, untoward 
medical occurrences  will be considered associated with the use of 18F-AV-1451, and thus 
be reported as  treatment- emergent  adverse events, if they occur within 48 hour s after 18F-
AV-1451 administration.  
LY3191748
18F-AV-1451-A16: “ A Clinico -Pathological Study of the Correspondence Between 18F-
AV-1451 PET Imaging and Post- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 34 of 50   
In the context of thi s study, adverse experiences including hospitalizations, medical 
complications and death are expected , since terminal illness is a requirement for entry 
into the study. Thus, if the investigator becomes aware of such events  that occur after 
administration of the drug but outside the 48 hour reporting window, these will only be 
reported  as adverse events if  the investigator believes they are attributable to the 
investigational product or protocol procedure. 
In order to capture possible adverse effects of trial participation, any untoward medical 
occurrences occurring after the informed consent until the administration of 18F-AV-1451 
will be recorded in the CRF for report ing as trial-emergent adverse events . If the subject 
consents to a second 18F-AV-1451 PET scan, trial -emergent adverse events will be 
collected in a similar  period, from either date of additional consent (if applicable) or the 
date the dose request for the second scan  is submitted to Avid , up to the second 
administration of 18F-AV-1451. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the following events: 
• Death;  
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization (other than that required by 
protocol; “social hospitalization” or any hospitalization for non- medical 
reasons does not constitute an SAE); 
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying);  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly /birth defect;  
• Considered significant by the investigator for any other reason. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious adverse drug events when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously reported or an adverse 
event that occurs with specificity, severity or frequency that is not consistent with the 
current investigator’s brochure. 
Relationship to Investigational Product 
Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential re latedness of 
each adverse event to protocol procedure and /or investigational product. The assessment 
of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the investigational product 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of 
the eCRF.

AV-1451 PET Imaging and Post- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 35 of 50   
In addition to assessing the relationship of the administration of the investigational 
product to adverse events, an assessment is required of the intensity (severity) of the event.  
The following classifications should be used: 
Mild:  
A mild adverse event is an adverse event, usually transient in nature and generally not 
interfering with normal activities.  
 
Moderate : 
A moderate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to 
interfere with normal activities.  
Severe:  
A severe adverse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and prevents 
normal activities. Note that a severe event is not necessarily a serious event. Nor must a serious event necessarily be severe.  
7.7.3. Adverse Event Documentation  
All adverse events must be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page via the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Documentation must be supported by an entry in the subject file. AEs considered by the Investigator to be clinically relevant should be reported on the 
Adverse Event page of the eCRF. Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates, severity/intensity, relationship to investigational product, actio n taken, and outcome). 
Adverse events fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse event should, in addition, be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form. 
7.7.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Study site personnel must alert Eli Lilly or its d esignee of any SAE within 24 hours of 
their awareness of the event via a sponsor-approved method. Alerts issued via telephone 
are to be immediately followed with official notification on study -specific SAE forms.  
Serious adverse events occurring after a subject receives a dose of investigational product 
will be collected until 48 hours after the  dosing of the investigational product, regardless 
of the investigator’s opinion of causation. Therefore, SAEs that occur later than 48 hours 
after the dos ing of the investigational product are not required to be reported unless the 
investigator feels the events were related to either investigational product or a  protocol 
procedure. 
If a subject  experiences an SAE after signing informed consent (s), but prior to receiving 
investigational product, the event will be reported  on the e CRF  and to Eli Lilly or its 
designee.  Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported

as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the 
study.  
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
8.1. General Statistical Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher. The specific analyses to address the objectives will be described in the Statistical Analysis Pla n (SAP) . 
 
8.2. Populations for Analysis  
Invalid Data  
Subject specimens for which technical errors result in invalid or uninterpretable autopsy specimens (e.g. lost tissue, tissue processed improperly by the site or tissue irretrievably 
missing key identifying information), as determined by the pathology core lab(s), in 
accordance with criteria set in the Technical Autopsy Manual and Neuropathology 
Analysis Plan will be excluded from primary analyse s.  
Subjects with invalid or unevaluable PET data will be excluded from analyses. Criteria for declaring an image invalid or not evaluable will be specified in advance in the Image 
Review Charter.  If an image is considered invalid by the designated imaging core lab , the 
subject will not be follo wed to autopsy. Valid images will be considered un evaluable 
only if 3 out of 5 independent readers declare the image unevaluable for the same reason. 
Subjects with unevaluable images will be excluded from the Primary Efficacy 
Population.  
8.2.1. Primary Objective Analys es 
This study is designed to test the relationship between ante -mortem 
18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging and tau neurofibrillary pathology associated with AD, as measured at autopsy. 
To accomplish this goal, two primary analyses will be performed:  
Primary An alysis 1  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to NFT Score of B3 (Hyman et 
al., 2012; Montine et al., 2012) at autopsy will be evaluated ; and if success criteria are 
met, 
Primary Analysis 2 
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of  a pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD 
neuropathologic change as defined by NIA -AA criteria (Hyman  et al.,  2012) will be

evaluated. For individuals with cognitive impairment, high level s of AD 
neuropa thologic change are considered adequate to explain cognitive impairment or 
dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co-primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
For Primary Analysis 1, the hypothesis to be tested is that for the same 3 out of 5 
independent readers, the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for both sensitivity and 
the specificity of 18F-AV-1451 PET reading results will be ≥ 50%. As detailed in S ection 
8.5 Table 7, NFT scores for autopsy cases will be categorized  as either B0/B1 /B2 o r B3 
level and  will serve as the NFT S core T S for this analysis. 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging 
will be  classified a s either ne ocortical uptake  not consistent with AD (AD-) or neocortical 
uptake consistent with AD (AD+) a nd consistent with AD and likely to progress (AD++) 
by each r eader. S ensitivity and spe cificity w ill be  calc ulated for each r eader as the  
proportions of TP and TN cases correctly i dentified as s uch, according t o T able 5 below:

Two-sided 95%
 CIs for sensitivity and specificity will be calculated using the Wilson 
score method. The first primary endpoint is considered to be met if  for the same 3 out of 
5 readers,  the lower bound of the 95% CIs for both sensitivity and specificity are ≥ 50% 
(i.e., s tatistically significant at two -sided significance level of 0.05).  
Like Primary Analysis 1, the hypothesis to be tested f or Primary A nalysis 2 is tha t for the  
same 3 out of 5 readers, the lower bound of the 95% CIs for both sensitivity and the 
specificity will be ≥ 50%. F or P rimary A nalysis 2,  autopsy cases w ill  be categorized as

amyloid neuritic plaque score, and this level of AD neuropathologic change will be used 
as
 the NIA-AA Autopsy Diagnosis TS as detailed in Section 8.5 Table 8.  
18F-AV-1451 PET images will be interpreted by visual examination as either AD- or 
AD+/AD++ as for Primary Analysis 1 . Sensitivity and specificity will then be calculated 
for each reader as the proportions of TP and TN cases correctly identified as such,  
according to  Table 6 below :

primary endpoint is met if  for the same 3 out of 5 readers, the lower bounds of the 95% 
CIs for both sensitivity and specificity are ≥ 50%.  
8.2.2. Secondary Objective Analys es 
Secondary Analysis 1 :  To a ssess diagnostic performance of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging, based on majority interpretation of 5 independent readers, for detection of 
a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to Neurofibrillary Tang le 
(NFT) Score of B3 and for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that 
corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic change as defined by National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer’s Association (NIA -AA) criteria : 
Majority scan interpretation will be derived using individual readers’ scan interpretation 
results. Diagnostic performance of this majority scan interpretation  will be assessed 
relative to the Autopsy NFT score  TS as per Primary A nalysis 1 and again relative to the 
NIA-AA Autopsy Diagnosis TS  as per Primary A nalysis 2. In each case (image) , a 
majority reading result will be derived using each individual reader’s scan interpretations 
results.  Sensitivity and specificity, and two -sided 95% CI thereof, will be calculated for 
the majority interpretation results  relative to the appropriate TS . The hypotheses to be 
tested are:  
1a: the majority reading result will have the  lower bounds of two -sided  95% CI ≥ 
55% for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of tau neurofibrillary pathology that corresponds to NFT Score of B3, and  
1b: the majority reading results will have the lower bounds of two -sided 95% CI ≥ 
55% for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of a pattern of

neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic change as 
defined by NIA- AA criteria . 
Secondary Analysis 2: Assess agreement among readers of 18F-AV-1451 PET scans: 
Fleiss’ Kappa statistics will be used to assess inter -reader agreement for the diagnostic 
decisions assoc iated with Primary Analyses 1 and 2. For evaluation of agreement in the 
context of Primary A nalysis 1, kappa will be calculated according to  the reader 
interpretation classification in  Table 5. If Primary A nalysis 1 is successful , a second 
kappa will be performed using the reader interpretation classification in  Table  6 . The 
hypothesis to test is the observed kappa values are ≥ 0.64 and the lower bound of the two-
sided CIs  for this assessment are ≥ 0.55.  
8.3. Safety Analysis 
Safety vital signs measurements will be summarized by  subject  and by evaluation time 
point. Change from baseline ( pre-dose time point) values will be determined and 
summarized .  
Adverse events including injection site reactions will be summarized in terms of number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE. The summary will be further broken 
down by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. Adverse events will also be presented by 
severity, relationship to treatment and seriousness. All subjects who experience SAEs or who discontinue due to AEs will be summarized . 
Discontinuation  
All subjects who discontinued participation prior to completing the study will be listed and their discontinuation reasons will be tabulated. 
Vital Signs  
Changes in vital signs from baseline will be summarized.  
8.4. 18F-AV-1451 Image Analysis  
18F-AV-1451 retention on PET images from subjects with valid autopsy data will be 
interpreted by visual examination as either   
• Neocortical Uptake Not Consistent with an AD Pattern ( AD-: no increased 
neocortical activity in any region or increased activity is isolated to the mesial 
temporal, anterolateral temporal or frontal region(s); 
• Neocortical Uptake Consistent with an AD P attern ( AD+: increased neocortical tracer 
activity in the posterolateral temporal (PLT), parietal (including precuneus), or 
occipital region(s)); or  
• Neocortical Uptake Consistent with an AD P attern and with Likelihood of Disease 
Progression (AD++ , which is a subset of AD+ ( Neocortical uptake consistent with an 
AD pattern ) where increased tracer activity is found in the parietal (including 
precuneus) region(s) regardless of uptake elsewhere, or in the frontal region in 
addition to PLT, occipital, or parietal region(s) ).

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 40 of 50   
For the purpose of testing the primary analys es, a scan interpretation will be considered 
positive (hypothesized to correspond to a B3 neuropathology score in Primary Analysis 1 
and  an NIA-AA score of high AD pathology in Primary Analysis 2) if the scan is interpreted as at least consistent with an AD pattern ( AD+ or AD++).  
Details of the visual PET image review methods will be provided in the Blinded Read Manual.  
Images will also be assessed quantitatively (semi- automated computerized measurement 
of SUVRs)  for exploratory analysis purposes . Details of the analysis  methods will be 
provided in the Quantitative Methodology Document.  
The 
18F-AV-1451 PET imaging results will not be shared with the investigator sites  or 
subjects and their families prior to the end of the study. 
8.5. Neuropathology Analysis 
All neuropathological measurements on brain tissue in this trial will be evaluated in a 
standardized and blinded (with respect to PET image results and subject 
identifying/clinical information) fashion in a qualified laboratory. A Technical Autopsy 
Manual and Neuropathology Analysis Plan will be developed for this study containing all 
methods and measurement procedures. Neuropathological assessment will be derived 
from the NIA -AA guidelines (Hyman  et al. , 2012; Montine et al., 2012).  Sections from 
brain reg ions recommended for pathological assessment of AD, as well as additional, pre-
specified neocortical regions will be sampled. Staining will follow the procedures recommended in the NIA- AA practical approach  guidelines . NFT extent will be assessed 
using standard procedures and NFT scores (B0- B3) will be recorded ( Hyman et al., 2012; 
Montine et al., 2012).  The TS for Primary Analysis 1 will be constructed from NFT 
scores as shown in Table  7.

Amyloid pathology will be evaluated using Thal and CERAD rating systems. 
Distrib ution of amyloid (Thal plaque score A0 -A3; Montine et al., 2012) will be 
recorded. The frequency of neuritic amyloid plaques will be evaluated semi -
quantitatively (CERAD score: none, sparse, moderate or frequent). Potential alternative neuropathologies contributing to cognitive impairment will also be considered as 
recommended by Montine et al., 2012, and l evel of AD neuropathologic change will be 
recorded as none, low, intermediate or high per NIA- AA guidelines  (Hyman et al., 2012;

8.6. Sample Size Calculation and T rial Stopping Criteria  
Assuming sensitivity/specificity of approximately 80%, a minimum of 14 autopsy cases 
in each of the truth standard groups (pathological positive or negative) is required for the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI to be > 50% for each individual reader.  The 
sponsor is blinded to the pathology results (truth standard) until after the study is 
completed and the database is locked.  Therefore, in order to ensure that an adequate number of subjects are recruited and come to autopsy for each truth standard group, the 
sponsor will assume that subjects diagnosed on clinical grounds as having dementia due 
to AD will be truth standard positive, subjects diagnosed as having no cognitive 
impairment (cognitively normal) will be truth standard negativ e.  Based on these 
assumptions, the study sample size requirement and trial stopping criteria will be deemed to have been met when  
• the number of subjects diagnosed as having impairment due to AD that have come to 
autopsy, is greater than or equal to 14, AND  
• the number of subjects diagnosed as having no cognitive impairment that have come to autopsy is greater than or equal to 1 4 
The sponsor recognizes that there may be some errors in clinical diagnosis such that some patients diagnosed clinically as having impairment due to AD may have a nonAD 
pathology, or limited amounts of AD tau pathology, and thus be truth standard negative, 
and, less often, subjects considered clinically normal may have AD pathology and be truth standard positive.  However, given the excess frequency of cases with AD 
diagnoses rel ative to clinically normal subjects already recruited in this trial population, 
any diagnos tic errors will likely help ensure a minimum of 14 truth standard negative 
subjects without jeopardizing the criterion for truth standard positive subjects. 
In addition to the above subjects diagnosed as clinically normal or AD patients , it is 
expected that  approximately 10- 15 subjects with nonAD impairments will be enrolled 
and come to autopsy in this trial.  However, the proportion of these that will have truth 
standard positive /negative  AD tau pathology is very difficult to predict and will depend 
on the precise cases enrolled . Thus , it is not expected that these cases will be useful in

estimating when a sufficient number of cases have occurred in each truth standard group 
and are not employed in the stoppi ng criteria .  
No new autopsies will begin once the sample size requirement /trial stopping criteria are  
met.  However, some subjects may have died and had autopsy material removed at the time the sample size requirement is met. Histology analysis will be completed  in subjects 
for whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met and these subjects will also be included in the Primary Efficacy Population.  
9. USE OF DATA AND PUBL ICATION
Avid adheres to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA ) 
Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communicat ion of Clinical Trial Results. A 
complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can also be found at the 
PhRMA website (http://www.phrma.org). Our policy is briefly summarized below: 
•We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlledclinical trials, regardless of outcome.
•As a sponsor, we may recommend that the Investigator(s) delay or declinepublication in cases where the study design , conduct, or data are insufficient
to allow meaningful interpretation. Avid and the Investigator(s) will discuss
the study design and data in advance of the study, and again after completion,
and will strive, through appropriate scientific debate, to reach a consensusregarding the potential merits of publication.
•Avid retains the right to review any manuscripts, presentations, or abstracts
before they are submitted for publication. Where differences of opinion or
interpreta tion exist regarding data planned for publication, the parties (Avid
and the Investigator) should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific
debate. Avid retains the right to delay publication for up to 60 days to protect
intellectual property.
•Anyone who provides substantial contributions should receive appropriate
recognition as an author or contributor when the manuscript is published.
This is a multi-c enter study. The primary analyses will include data from all centers. A 
multicenter publicatio n, reporting the primary analyse s data set, with authorship from all 
contributing centers, should precede any other publications. 
10. INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to Good Clinical Pr actice 
regulations; this may include an inspection by Avid and/or Health Authority representatives (FDA, EMA or international regulatory authorities) at any time.

10.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
The intent of the research program, the trial protocol, the subject information/informed 
consent form and any advertising material used to recruit subjects must be submitted to 
the clinical investigator’s local IRB and its approval must be obtained prior to its use. A copy of the approval must be forwarded to Avid. When necessary, an extension or renewal of IRB approval must be obtained and also forwarded to Avid. 
10.2.  Informed  Consent  
A signed, written informed consent for study procedures and brain donation must be obtained from each subject and/or LAR . A copy of the signed informed consent should 
be given to the subject  and/or LAR  for their records.  A copy of the local IRB’s approved 
version of the informed consent form must be forwarded to Avid or designee for review prior to being used to obtain subject  consent. 
10.3.  Protocol Adherence  
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed exac tly. 
Where a deviation occurs, it must be documented, the sponsor/monitor informed, and a 
course of action agreed upon. 
10.4.  Documents Necess ary for Initiation of t he Trial  
Avid must be provided with the following documents prior to the enrollment of any subjects:  
• Original signed and dated Statement of Agreement page; 
• Copy of the IRB and radiation safety committee approval (if applicable); 
• Copy of the IRB stamped approved consent form; 
• Name and location of the laboratory utilized for laboratory assays, and other facilities conducting tests, including laboratory certification number and date 
of certification if available. Avid may be responsible for supplying these to 
the investigator if a central laboratory is used;  
• List of reference range laboratory values. Avid may be responsible for this if a 
central laboratory is used; and  
• Any additional licenses required in order to order to use 
18F-AV-1451. 
10.5. Investigational Produ ct Control  
The receipt of clinical supplies must be documented at the site . 
All drug supplies for this trial should be retained in a safe and secure place at all times 
during the trial.  18F-AV-1451 should be prepared by a qualified PET manufacturing site 
and administered by a qualified individual under the investigator’s supervision. An up- to-
date drug inventory/dispensing record must be maintained. All drug supplies must be

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 44 of 50 
accounted for. After com pletion of the trial, all remaining clinical supplies must be 
returned to the sponsor or their representative. 
10.6. Data Collection  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used for this trial. Individual subject files 
should include appropriate source documents, including but not limited to subject ’s 
medical records. The files should include information such as visit dates, records of 
medical history, examinations administered, laboratory, concomitant treatment, any adverse event encountered and other notes as appropriate. These constitute “source data”. 
All entries on the eCRFs must be backed up by source data. Original electronic versions 
of imaging studies are also considered source data and should be kept on file by the site/imaging center , and appropriate copies should be forwarded to the designated 
imaging  core lab as specified in the PET Technical  Operations Manual.  
Each subject ’s source file should include an original signed informed consent form. 
When the trial is completed, the informed consent form should be kept on file with other trial related records.  
The eCRFs must be kept in order and up- to-date so that they always reflect the latest 
observations on the subjects that are enrolled in the trial. The eCRFs must be completed 
for each subject  enroll ed in the trial and signed by the investigator. A monitor will verify 
the source data f or all information on the eCRF. 
10.7. Adverse Events  
All adverse events encountered during the clinical trial must be documented on the e CRF, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
Eli Lilly must be notified immediately (as soon as possible, and in all cases within 24 
hours) of a drug experience, condition, development, or event, which is considered 
serious. Eli Lilly must be notified immediately of any findings with the use o f the drug 
that may suggest significant hazards, contraindications, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
and precautions pertinent to the safety of the drug. The investigator will be requested to 
complete a separate report form in addition to the information on t he CRF. See section 
7.7.4  for reporting serious adverse events. 
If an SAE
 is determined to be unexpected (not previously reported or described by Avid), 
and study drug- related, Eli Lilly will notify the investigator in writing. The investigator 
should forward this notification to the IRB within 24 hours of receipt. 
10.8. Records Retention  
All co rrespondence (e.g., with Avid, IRB, etc.) relating to this clinical trial should be kept 
in appropriate file folders. Records of subjects, source documents, and drug inventory sheets pertaining to the trial must be kept on file. Records must be retained until the date 
a marketing application (NDA) is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated, or until 3 years following the date of clini cal trial termination or 
completion, whichever is later. If no application is to be filed or if the application is not

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why This Study is Being Conducted
ABBV -951 (carbidopa phosphate/levodopa phosphate [CDP/LDP]) is a soluble formulation of 
carbidopa/levodopa (CD/LD) prodrugs that is deliverable by continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI).  
ABBV -951 undergoes enzymatic conversion to CD/LD and has the potent ial to achieve efficacy similar to 
levodopa- carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG, denominated carbidopa -levodopa enteral suspension [CLES] in 
the United States [US]) by subcutaneous delivery.
Patients with Parkinson 's disease (PD) require a therapeutic approach that is tailored to their unique 
needs and responses to levodopa.  ABBV -951 enables continuous, subcutaneous, and individualized 
delivery of CD/LD, covering the wide range of levodopa doses required to adequately control motor 
symptoms in patients with advanced PD ( aPD).  Therefore, this novel treatment may provide an 
alternative therapy to many patients whose motor complications are inadequately controlled by their 
current treatment.
While the systemic toxicology and tolerability profiles of CD/LD are well established preclinically and in 
humans, the local (skin) and systemic tolerability following subcutaneous delivery of ABBV -951 are less 
known and are being assessed within the scope of this study.
Systemic and local tolerability have been measured in ani mal models, as well as in the clinical setting.  In 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant preclinical studies in rats and monkeys, doses of ABBV -951, 
considered therapeutically relevant in PD patients, were demonstrated to be well tolerated at the 
infus ion site and did not significantly increase serum phosphate levels.  Local irritation was assessed in 
dogs at a 50/200 mg/mL concentration, following CSCI for 28 days with a fixed indwelling catheter at a 
rate of 0.1 or 0.25 mL/hour (120/480 mg/day and 300 /1200 mg/day, respectively).  120/480 mg/day 
was well tolerated, and the infusion site findings were similar to those of the vehicle control without 
signs of irritation or inflammation stemming from ABBV -951.  Findings at the infusion site of animals 
treat ed with the higher infusion rate (0.25 mL/hour) were confounded by a concurrent bacterial 
infection, and it was not possible to clearly determine whether ABBV -951 was well tolerated; however, 
the infusion of ABBV -951 at the same concentration (50/200 mg/mL ), but at a higher infusion rate 
(0.5 mL/hour) for fewer days (5 days) was well tolerated, with only minimal signs of irritation at the 
infusion site.  In cohorts from the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (Study M15 -733), in which 
ABBV -951 was administe red as a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion for up to 72 hours, 
levodopa exposure showed a low degree of fluctuation, similar to what was observed with the LCIG 
registration studies.  ABBV -951 was generally well tolerated, with only mild report s of pain at the 
infusion site related to high flow rates used to deliver loading doses.  These reports of infusion site pain 
were significantly reduced when the flow rate was adjusted to deliver the loading dose over a longer 
period of time.  No other loc al tolerability issues were observed, and no subject discontinued the study 
due to these events.  No pain or other safety or tolerability interim issues have been reported from 
ongoing Phase 1 studies in PD patients, where ABBV -951 is administered at therapeutic doses for 24 or 
72 hours (Study M15 -738) or for up to 28 days (Study M15 -739).

STUDY M15 -741  |  Version 7.0  |  EudraCT 2018 -002144 -85
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.The dose ranges of ABBV- 951 to be utilized in this study are similar to those administered in the Phase 1 
studies in PD subjects (Studies M15 -738 and M15 -739); however, t he duration of the continuous 
infusion administration will be long -term.  Therefore, subject safety and tolerability over long -term 
exposure will need to be assessed.
This open -label, single -arm, Phase 3 study will be conducted in an outpatient setting to evaluate local 
and systemic safety and tolerability, and explore the efficacy of therapeutic doses of ABBV -951 infused 
continuously for 52 weeks in subjects with PD.
Clinical Hypothesis
CSCI of ABBV -951 is safe and well- tolerated for up to 52 weeks in PD patients with motor fluctuations no 
longer controlled by current PD medications.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The combination of oral levodopa and DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCI), such as carbidopa or 
benserazide, has been used for many years in patients with PD to control motor symptoms, and the 
systemic safety profile is well established.  Furthermore, achieving stable plasma levodopa 
concentrations through continuous infusion has bee n demonstrated previously with LCIG and resulted in 
greater efficacy than oral CD/LD as assessed by a reduction in overall daily "Off"time accompanied by 
increased "On"time without troublesome dyskinesia.  Therefore, it is anticipated that ABBV -951 can 
provide a similar benefit if plasma levodopa concentrations can be maintained stable and within the 
therapeutic window.
Potential risks of receiving an ABBV -951 dose lower than required for PD symptom control include 
experiencing an exacerbation of PD sympt oms ( "Off" state) characterized by increased difficulty with 
movement, tremor, and stiffness.  Potential risks of receiving an ABBV -951 dose higher than what is 
required for motor symptom control include experiencing dyskinesias (abnormal or uncontrolled 
movements) and hallucinations.  Other anticipated risks are well characterized levodopa -related side 
effects, including nausea, vomiting, and dizziness; however, not all of the potential side effects of the 
drug are known.  Subjects may also experience gene ral discomfort or inconvenience related to study 
procedures.
Since ABBV -951 is administered as a CSCI, there is a potential for safety issues related to infusion site 
tolerability.  These issues may include infusion site irritation and inflammation (swelli ng, redness, pain, 
itching), bruising, skin infection, and discomfort related to the feeling of liquid flowing through the 
needle/cannula.  Data from preclinical studies and from a study in healthy volunteers show that infusion 
is generally well tolerated; however, the ABBV -951 infusion rates (i.e., flow rates) that will be used in the 
current study are anticipated to be higher than those used in the healthy volunteer study and therefore 
local tolerability at the infusion site will be a specific focus in th is study.
For details, please see the safety data in the ABBV- 951 investigator's brochure .1
Based on the limited information available to date, exposure to ABBV -951 does not appear to pose 
additional risks to study participants because of the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19).  ABBV- 951 
metabolizes into LD and CD, sharing the same characterist ics of these compounds, which are commonly 
used as symptomatic treatment of PD globally.

PD symptoms (including tremor, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, daytime somnolence, and indication of 
propensity for impulsive behaviors) as asse ssed by the Parkinson 's KinetiGraph™/Personal KinetiGraph™ 
(PKG) wearable device (as allowed by local regulations) from Baseline to the Week 26 Visit.
3.5 Exploratory Research:  Biomarker Research Endpoints
Optional samples will be collected during the study to evaluate known and/or novel biomarkers related 
to PD, related conditions, ABBV- 951, or drugs of a similar class.  Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples 
may be analyzed for genetic markers that may help t o understand PD and the subject 's response to 
ABBV -951.  Genes of interest may include (but are not limited to) those associated with 
pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), genes within the target 
pathway (dopaminergic pathw ays), or other genes believed to be related to PD (alpha -synuclein 
[SNCA]).  Research may also include epigenetic changes in DNA that may correlate with the subject 's 
response to treatment or disease.  Research on samples collected will follow country -spec ific 
regulations.  This research is exploratory in nature, and the results may not be included within the 
clinical study report.
4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
Design and Schematic
This is a 52 -week, Phase 3, open -label, single -arm, mul ticenter study to assess the local and systemic 
safety and tolerability, as well as efficacy, of ABBV -951 administered as a CSCI for 24 hours daily for up 
to 52 weeks.  At study completion, subjects may transition to a 24 -hour CSCI of ABBV -951 open -label 
extension study.  Approximately 240 adult subjects with PD whose motor symptoms are inadequately 
controlled despite their current optimized PD therapy will be enrolled.
Two interim analyses will be performed during the course of this study.  The first inter im analysis will be 
performed after at least 100 subjects have completed 26 Weeks of therapy; the second interim analysis 
will be performed after at least 100 subjects have completed 52 Weeks of therapy.
See Section 5.1for eligibility criteria.  Safety parameters, such as clinical laboratory test results, ECGs, 
and vital signs will be monitored throughout the study (see Sections 3.11, 3.14, and 3.15, respectively, of 
the Operations Manual [ Appendix F ]).
A schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1.  Details regarding study procedures are located in 
Section 3 of the Operations Manual ( Appendix F).

a. The Screening Period may be extended up to a total of 90 days for extenuating circumstances, e.g., supply constraints.
b. The Monitoring Period can occur any time before V3, as long as it lasts for 6 consecutive days.  PD Diaries will also be 
collected for at least 2 consecutive days during the Monitoring Period.  In countries where the PKG watch is not approved, 
the Monitoring Period may be reduced to at least 2 days to account for the collection of PD Diaries and pump tr aining.
Note:  As allowed by local regulations, subjects will receive the PKG-watch following Screening Visit 1 (V1) and will be required 
to wear it (refer to the currently approved manufacturer 's directions) during the Monitoring Period and at least until the 
completion of Week 26 (V11); thereafter, wearing of the PKG-watch will be optional.  The Monitoring Period consists of at least 
6 consecutive days during the Screening Period (prior to V3) where subjects will be required to collect PD diaries and wear the 
PKG watch at the same time.  "As allowed by local regulations " is applicable to all wearable device references throughout this 
protocol and its appendices.  The AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) should be consulted if, in the opinion of
the Investigator, there are circumstances that might interfere with the use of the PKG device (e.g., religious reasons, atopi c 
dermatitis).  A subject's inability to wear the PKG watch, due to logistics hindering the watch from being made available, will 
not preclude him/her from study participation.
Study Periods
Screening Period
The intended 10 -to 42 -day Screening Period (may be extended up to a total of 90 days for extenuating 
circumstances) will consist of 2 screening visits (V1 and V2) and a 6 -day Monitoring Period, to be
completed any time before V3.  Subjects will become familiar with the wearable device and the PD Diary 
during the Screening Period.  During the Screening Period, subjects must be on a stable oral PD 
medication regimen for at least 30 days prior to commencing ABBV -951.  Historical data (medical 
records, etc.) are acceptable documentation for the use of stable medication.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications 5 half -lives or 30 day s prior to 
initial study drug administration, whichever is longer, with the exception of medications containing 
levodopa and catechol -O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, which must be discontinued for at least 
12 hours before initiation of study drug and for the duration of the Treatment Period.  The Screening 
Period may be extended up to a total of 90 days for extenuating circumstances, e.g., supply constraints.
Subjects must be consented for the study prior to discontinuing any prohibited medications f or the 
purpose of meeting study eligibility.  See Section 5.3.  The investigator or his/her designee must confirm 
continued subject eligibility at V3, prior to enrollment.  Considering historical data and the minimum 
time required for the Monitoring Period, the Screening Period may be completed in as short as 10 days; 
it should be targeted to be completed in approximately 40 days and should not excee d a total of 90 days 
overall.
Subjects will be required to wear the wearable device for 6 consecutive days prior to Visit 3 (i.e., the 
6-Day Monitoring Period), in countries where such devices are approved.  The PD Diaries should be 
completed for at least 2 consecutive days of the 6 -day Monitoring Period, prior to Visit 3 (Day 1).
Treatment Period
The Treatment Period starts with the initiation of ABBV- 951 and consists of 2 parts:  a 4 -week 
Optimization Period and a 48 -week Maintenance Period.
Optimization Period :  during the 4 weeks of the Optimization Period, investigators will make all 
necessary adjustments to the subject 's ABBV- 951 dose until the optimal clinical response for the 
individual subject is obtained.  Additional adjustments may be required for the subject 's concomitant PD 
medications (e.g., dopamine -agonists, selective monoamine oxidase B [MAO -B] inhibitors, amantadine, 
safinamide), including tapering down or even suspending such medications, in accordance with the 
prescribing information, to a chieve the therapeutic approach that, in the investigator 's opinion, controls 
the subject 's symptoms in the most satisfactory way.
Maintenance Period :  the Maintenance Period will consist of 48 weeks of a 24 -hour daily CSCI of 
ABBV -951 at the optimal therapeutic dose.  During this 48 -week period, subjects should maintain a 
stable regimen of all concomitant medications unless changes are considered medically necessary, in 
the opinion of the investigator.  ABBV -951 can be adjusted throughout the study.  In th e event of dose 
adjustments for ABBV -951 or other concomitant medications (including adding or suspending other PD 
medications) these adjustments should be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
On the morning of Day 1 (V3) subjects will nee d to be in a clinically defined "Off" state (i.e., no PD 
medications for at least 12 hours before initiation of study drug).  After confirmation of eligibility and a 
brief clinical examination, subjects will receive an oral loading dose of LD+DDCI followed by the 
beginning of the subcutaneous infusion of ABBV -951 at their calculated starting dose.
For each subject, the starting dose level for the continuous infusion rate of ABBV -951 will be calculated 
according to their baseline dose of oral levodopa (or le vodopa equivalent dose [LED]), based on the 
proposed conversion rates from Tomlinson et al,2guidance from Espay et al,3and a conversion 
algorithm based on data from Phase 1 studies (see Section 4.2).
Subjects might also resume PD medications that do not contain levodopa or COMT inhibitors (such as 
dopamine agonists, MAO -B inhibitors, amantadine, safinamide, etc.) as these concomitant medications

and according to the prescribing information, subjects may start to taper off concomitant PD 
medications during the 4 weeks of the Optimizati on Period.
Subjects will be evaluated on the day of, and the day after, initiating ABBV- 951, and then weekly during 
the Optimization Period.  During each visit, the investigator will assess the subject 's PD symptoms by 
interview and neurologic examination and may adjust the subject 's therapeutic regimen by continuing 
tapering off and/or suspending previous concomitant PD medications, and at the same time increasing, 
decreasing, or maintaining the ABBV- 951 infusion rate based on the subject 's clinical response.  If all 
concomitant PD medications have been tapered off, the dose of ABBV -951 may be further adjusted until 
the optimal clinical response for the individual subject is obtained, as determined by the investigator.  
Optimal clinical response is defined by maximizing the functional "On"time and minimizing the number 
of "Off" episodes during the day.  This optimization also minimizes "On"time with troublesome 
dyskinesia.
During the Optimization Period, study visits will occur as follows:
Day 1 (V3)
Day 2 (V4)
Week 1 (V5)
Week 2 (V6)
Week 3 (V7)
Week 4 (V8)
The investigator may perform unscheduled visits to make any needed adjustments within the 4 -week 
Optimization Period.
After Week 4 (V8), all subjects will begin the Maintenance Period and should maintai n a stable 
treatment regimen of ABBV -951 and other concomitant medications, including any PD medications that 
are still being administered after the Optimization Period.  Dose adjustments of medications, including 
ABBV -951, can be made if considered medically necessary, in the opinion of the investigator.  Any 
changes to medications or the dose of ABBV -951 should be recorded in the eCRF.
During the Maintenance Period, study visits will occur as follows: 
Week 6 (V9)
Week 13 (V10)
Week 26 (V11)
Week 39 (V12)
Week 52 (V13) or in case of premature discontinuation.
All visits, apart from the Screening visits (V1 and V2) and V3 (Day 1), will be allowed a window of 
± 3days.
As part of the study procedures, study drug is intended to be dispensed to subjects every 2 weeks during 
the Treatment Period with or without a clinic visit being completed.
Unscheduled clinic visits may occur per investigator discretion as deemed necessary.  The appropriate 
protocol assessments to be conducted at an unscheduled clinic visit ar e to be determined by the

return to the clinic site for additional study drug or drug delivery system components or accessories.
In rare situations where a visit cannot be completed onsite due to an extenuating event (e.g., COVID -19-
related conditions), some assessments may be performed remotely.  Refer to the Operations Manual 
(Appendix F) for further guidance.
Treatment Arm
Subjects will receive an oral loading dose on Day 1 (V3) followed by a 24 -hour daily subcutaneous 
infusion of ABBV -951.  The loading dose will be established by the investi gator per the subject 's oral 
regimen prior to commencing ABBV -951 (see Section 4.2).  The starting continuous infusion rate (F1) will 
be calculated taking into consideration the LED and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ABBV- 951 
(see Section 4.2).  The investigator may adjust the prescribed infusion rate during visits to reach 
optimization of motor symptoms control.  Subjects may choose their daily continuous infu sion rate from 
3preprogrammed infusion rates.  The investigator will determine and program the base daily infusion 
rate (F1) within the allowable range (0.17 to 1.04 mL/hr) and may program 2 additional infusion rates 
(F2 and F3) within a ± 20% limit from the prescribed base infusion rate.  F2 should be an alternative 
higher continuous dose, and F3 should be an alternative lower continuous dose.  F3 may be reduced 
beyond the 20% limit from the prescribed base infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with 
approval from the AbbVie therapeutic area medical director (TA MD).  If programmed, the alternative 
infusion rates (F2 and F3) must be within the allowable range (0.17 to 1.04 mL/hr).  If the alternative 
infusion rates (F2 and F3) are not required, they must be programmed to "OFF ."  Subjects will receive a 
System User Manual that contains instructions for the daily management of their infusion.
Dermatologic Assessment
Subcutaneous delivery of study drug calls for attention during the procedures rela ted to administration 
(general hygiene, skin disinfection, maintenance of a dirt -free environment while manipulating the 
system components, etc.), and subject training and adherence to proper techniques are critical.  
Manipulation at the level of the cannula pad due to disconnection and reconnection of the tubing might 
also lead to skin irritation, abrasion, and other lesions, which could evolve to infection and cellulitis 
because of bacterial contamination.  Infusion site reactions including erythema, pain , or any other 
inflammation signs have been observed.4  Most are mild or moderate in severity and resolve with 
treatment with antibiotics and interventions su ch as incision and drainage.  Some cases might require 
further management and clinical correlation is recommended.  Investigators should obtain dermatologic 
consult if needed.
Absorption of study drug by the subcutaneous tissue may vary depending on the vo lume of drug 
solution infused/day, skin characteristics, hydration, etc.  Accumulation of study drug under the skin, 
manifesting as an elevated area of the skin, with or without induration and/or seepage of study drug 
from the infusion site after removal o f the cannula or during infusion, might be a sign of reduced 
absorption, which could lead to irritation of the area and increased risk of bacterial contamination.  In 
these cases, more frequent rotation of the infusion site (using a new cannula/infusion se t) is 
recommended to minimize the risk of infection.
If any moderate to severe infusion site -related AE, such as cellulitis/abscess formation, ecchymoses, 
subcutaneous nodules, or scarring occurs, or if any infusion site -related reaction is assessed with a n

Operations Manual [ Appendix F]), the investigat or or designee is instructed to do the following:
1.Photograph the skin reaction and follow the appropriate procedure for submission of 
photographs.  In rare situations where an assessment or visit cannot be completed onsite due to 
an extenuating event (e.g. , COVID -19-related conditions), the subject may be asked to obtain 
and submit a self -captured photograph of the skin reaction.
2.Refer the subject to a dermatologist for comprehensive evaluation (including skin biopsy if 
applicable), treatment, and follow -up per standard practice.  The subject should be referred to a 
dermatologist within 2 business days after the photographs are tak en.  The dermatologic visit 
should be completed within 2 weeks from identification of the AE or skin reaction that meets 
the above criteria.  While an in -person dermatology evaluation is preferred, this assessment 
may be performed as a telemedicine visit p er the dermatologist's standard practice.
Post -Treatment Activities
Subjects who prematurely discontinue or are not enrolled in the extension study (M15 -737) will receive 
a 30 -day follow -up call after the end of infusion of study drug, if the subject is w illing.  See Section 5.7
for additional information.
4.2 Discussion of Study Design
Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be used in this study.  All efficacy 
measurements are qualified for assessing disease activity in subjects with PD.
Suitability of Subject Population
The subject population will consist of subjects with PD who report motor compli cations that are 
inadequately controlled by oral medications and who experience a minimum of 2.5 hours of "Off" time 
per day as assessed by PD diaries completed prior to enrollment/Day 1 (V3).  Subjects must be on a 
stable oral PD medication regimen for at least 30 days prior to commencing ABBV -951.
Rationale for Selection of Therapeutic Dose Range
CD/LD remains the standard of care for PD.  It is, however, recognized that the treatment of PD is highly 
individualized; both the treatments administered and their doses must be customized, based on the 
patients 'signs and symptoms and their response to medication.  In practice, this provides a wide 
distribution of patient doses, even within clinical trials.
In the LCIG double -blind, double dummy pivotal trial (S tudies S187.3.001/S187.3.002), the median dose 
of levodopa was 1013 mg/day and the mean dose was 1117 mg/day for 16 -hour daily infusion.  These 
data represent a small subset of subjects where dosing was constrained to maintain the blinding of the 
study.  T herefore, > 90% of subjects used less than 2000 mg over a 16 -hour treatment period.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.In the LCIG open -label safety study (Study S187.3.004), in which > 300 subjects were enrolled, the dosing 
was more reflective of clinical practice, where a significant prop ortion of subjects were able to simplify 
their therapy by discontinuing concomitant oral medications and maintaining only LCIG during the 
waking time.  The LD doses from this study ranged from less than 500 mg/day to more than 
3500 mg/day over a 16 -hour tr eatment period ( Table 1).
ABBV -951 is intended to be a 24 -hour/day therapy (i.e., subjects will be exposed 8 more hours –or 50% 
longer –compared to L CIG exposure).  The results of a pharmacokinetic study (Study M18 -764) 
comparing LD plasma concentrations between LCIG plus LD/CD tablets and ABBV -951 in healthy 
volunteers demonstrated that LD from ABBV- 951 is 8% more bioavailable than enterally -absorbed LD.  
Based on molecular weight (MW), 100 mg of LD are equivalent to 141 mg of levodopa phosphate (LDP).
Using these data, it is estimated that LD doses could range from less than 700 mg/day to about 
4260 mg/day, over a 24 -hour treatment period (approximate ly 1000 -6000 mg LDP).

Doses
Oral Loading Dose
The purpose of the oral loading dose is to allow subjects to achieve symptom control quickly upon 
initiation of treatment.  The loading dose for this study will be an oral dose of LD+DDCI corresponding as 
closely as possible t o the subject 's habitual first morning dose of LD+DDCI.  Immediate -release 
formulations of LD+DDCI medications should be utilized for the oral loading doses.
Loading doses will be administered only once, at the initiation of ABBV -951 treatment, unless dosing is 
discontinued for ≥ 3 hours .  Temporary disconnection (< 1 hour) for daily hygiene or to change empty 
syringes does not count as discontinuation and does not require a loading dose upon resuming the 
infusion (see Section 5.8).
Continuous Infusion Rate
Following the oral loading dose, ABBV -951 will be delivered continuously (24 hours daily) via an infusion 
set connected to a pump.  Each subject 'sinitial base continuous infusion rate (F1) will be calculated 
based on the subject 's oral LD therapy over the 16 -hour treatment period and an algorithm developed 
following a combination of pharmacokinetic and clinical considerations from ABBV -951 Phase 1 studies.  
A subject 's baseline dose of immediate release (IR) LD+DDCI is the starting point f or establishing the 
levodopa equivalent dose (LED) for dose selection (note: the levodopa contained in Stalevo® 
[CD/LD/entacapone] counts as IR).  If a subject is not taking an IR formulation of LD+DDCI, the LED is 
calculated from the primary levodopa -cont aining medication.  The conversion factors to use in 
calculating the total LED for dose selection are provided in Table 2and are based on data from th e 
literature.2,3  The applicable calculation from Table 2and a subject 's baseline CD/LD IR dose should be 
added together to provide the total starting LED for ABBV -951 conversion.

(Rytary)For subjects taking extended -release levodopa, multiply their total daily dose 
of Rytary by the appropriate conversion ratio in the following table to obtain 
their LED.

(e.g., Tasmar)If subjects are taking tolcapone or entacapone, all LED calculated from the 
levodopa -containing products must be multiplied by 1.33 .
Note:  The levodopa dose contained in Stalevo counts as IR.
COMT = catechol -O-methyltransferase; CR = controlled release; IR = immediate release; LED = levodopa equivalent dose
Once a subject 's daily LED has been determined, the starting infusion rate for ABBV -951 should be 
selected from Table 3.  The continuous infusion rates below are estimated for the mid -point of the LED 
intervals provided and are designed to deliver therapeutic levodopa exposure.  The ABBV- 951 infusion 
will be delivered continuously via an infusion se t connected to an ambulatory pump.

Titration
The ABBV -951 base infusion rate (F1) may be adjusted at the investigator 's discretion at any time 
throughout the study to achieve and maintain an optimal therapeutic response for the individual 
subject, which means maximizing the functional "On"time during the day by minimizing the number 
and duration of "Off" episodes (bradyk inesia) and minimizing "On"time with troublesome dyskinesia.  
Due to the capabilities of the infusion pump utilized in Study M15 -741, the infusion rate must be 
increased or decreased by multiples of 0.01 mL/hr, corresponding to approximately 1.7 mg LD/hr, or 
approximately 40 mg LD over the 24 -hour period.  Therefore, an increase in the base infusion rate of 
0.02 mL/hr will result in total increase of approximately 80 mg of LD over the 24 -hour period.  An 
increase of 0.04 mL/hr will result in a total increa se of approximately 160 mg of LD over the 24 -hour

24-hour period, etc.
Should the calculated daily LED from oral medications at Baseline (based on the 16-hour treatment 
period) for a subject be ≥2000 mg, the starting base infusion rate (F1) should be set at 0.70 mL/hr.
The investigator may decide to increase the infusion rate only after assessing the subject for clinical 
efficacy (achieving optimal therapeutic response, as defined above) and safety.  The safety profile of 
ABBV -951 at doses higher than 200/4000 carbidopa phosphate/levodopa phosphate (CDP/LDP) resulting 
from infusion rates > 0.70 mL/hr will be assessed throughout the study via neurological examinations 
and physical assessment, as described in Appendix D .  All AE s will be assessed, with particular attention 
to AESIs of polyneuropathy, weight loss, somnolence, and hallucinations/psychosis.
Alternative Continuous Infusion Rates (F2, F3)
Like other therap eutic approaches for PD, which require an individualized optimization, this study 
provides subjects the ability to select from alternative infusion rates within a specified range, if allowed 
by the investigator.
Two additional infusion rates (F2 and F3) ma y be preprogrammed into the pump by the investigator.  
F2should be an alternative higher continuous dose, and F3 should be an alternative lower continuous 
dose.  The additional infusion rates must be selected within a ± 20% limit from the prescribed base 
continuous infusion rate ( F1).  F3 may be reduced beyond the 20% limit from the prescribed base 
infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with approval from the AbbVie TA MD.
Infusion rates lower than 0.17 mL/hr or higher than 1.04 mL/hr are not a llowed .
If, during the study, the base daily infusion rate (F1) is programmed at 0.17 mL/hr, the alternative lower 
infusion rate (F3) must be disabled.  If, at any point during the study the base daily infusion rate (F1) is 
programmed at 1.04 mL/hr, the alternative higher infusion rate (F2) and the extra dose option (see 
below) must be disabled.
The starting infusion rate must not be higher than 0.70 mL/hr; adjustments may be done only after 
clinical assessment (neurological and physical examination).
If the alternative infusion rates (F2 and F3) are not required, the investigator or his/her de signee must 
disable them by programming them to "OFF"and the subject will not be able to choose alternative 
infusion rates.  If the investigator enables these options , the subject may select the infusion rate from 
these 3 preprogrammed choices (F1, F2, or F3) and will be required to record on the dosing diary the 
time of the day when they change the infusion rate.  The numerical values of the infusion rates cannot 
be m odified by the subjects.
Extra Doses
If the investigator allows it, subjects may self -administer extra doses of ABBV- 951 during the course of 
the 24 hours to address immediate medical needs, such as the rapid deterioration of motor function.   
The ability t o self -administer extra doses, the extra dose volume and lockout time (the interval between 
extra doses) are determined and programmed by the investigator or his/her designee and cannot be 
modified by the subjects.  The investigator can choose the volume o f the extra doses from the following

levodopa, respectively).  The lockout time is programmable from 1 hour to 24 hours in 15 -minute 
increments; the mini mum lockout duration is 60 minutes.  If the investigator elects not to allow the use 
of extra doses, this function can be disabled by setting the volume to "0.00 ."
If the extra dose function is enabled, subjects are required to record on the dosing diary t he time of the 
day when they self -administered an extra dose.  Dosing diaries will be reviewed by the study personnel 
at every study visit.
If the need for extra doses is greater than 5 times per day, the investigator should consider increasing 
the base in fusion rate and increasing the lockout time to limit the number of extra doses per day.  If at 
any time in the study F1 or F2 are set at 1.04 mL/hr, the extra dose option should be disabled.  Doses 
of LDP higher than 6000 mg/24 hr (equivalent to 4260 mg LD /24 hr) are not allowed under any 
circumstances during the study.
The investigator should consider this upper limit when programming alternative infusion rates and/or 
volumes and lockout time of extra doses.  Guidance is provided in Table 4.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.The investigator should consider whether to enable alternative infusion rates and extra doses and 
provide those options to subjects, based on his/her clinical judgment of the subject 's cognitive 
performance, compliance, and personality traits.
Allowing an alternative highe r infusion rate (F2) could facilitate refining the base continuous infusion 
rate during the optimization period.  Subjects who report troublesome dyskinesia, freezing of gate, or 
nocturnal akinesia at baseline are often treated with sub -optimal oral daily doses of LD .5,6  In these 
cases, programming F1 as suggested in Table 3could result in a sub -optimal dose of ABBV- 951.  The 
investigator may program F2, starting with small increments (e.g., 5% –10%), and enable subjects who 
feel underdosed to switch to the alternative higher infusion rate.  Similarly, if subjec ts are expected to 
sustain extended physical activity (e.g., sport) or require higher doses of levodopa at a specific time of 
day, F2 could be temporarily selected to account for the higher dopaminergic demand.  Also, if subjects 
require more than 5 extra doses during the day, they may be instructed to switch to F2 and reduce the 
use of extra doses, while waiting for of the investigator to adjust the base infusion rate at the next study 
visit after reviewing the dosing diary.  It is important that subjects be reminded to log on the dosing 
diary any time they self- administer an extra dose or switch the infusion rate to one of the enabled 
options.
If the investigator prefers not to provide this option or considers the subject not suitable to choose 
among the p rovided options, he/she should disable the alternative higher infusion rate by programming 
it to "OFF."
Investigators may consider whether to allow subjects to switch to an alternative lower infusion rate (F3) 
before going to bed, if subjects report no com plaints of nocturnal akinesia or nighttime symptoms at 
baseline or if subjects have known history of impulse control disorders or nocturnal hallucinations .6-8
Additionally, data suggest that the low variability and fluctuations in plasma LD exposure from 
continuous delivery may translate in an average reduction of efficacious daily levodopa doses ;9hence, if 
between visits during the optimization period, subjects experience sustained dyskinesia, they may be 
instructed to select the alternative lower infusion rate and record it in their dosing diary, until the 
investigator adjusts the base parameters at the following study visit.  The alternative lower infusion rate, 
F3, may be programmed to be up to 20% lower than F1.  F3 may be reduced beyond the 20% limit from 
the prescribed base infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with approval from the AbbVie TA 
MD.
If nocturnal akinesia is present or if bothersome nighttime symptoms exist, investigators should consider 
maintaining the base infusion rate (F1) consistent for the 24 hours and disable the option for the 
alternative lower infusion rate (programming it to "OFF").  Similarly, if the investigator prefers not to 
provide this option or considers the subject not suitable to choose among the provided options, he/she 
should disable the alternative lower infusion rate by programming it to "OFF."

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study
A subject may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons including, 
but not limited to, the following:
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results or A Es, which rule out continuation of the study 
drug, as determined by the investigator or the AbbVie TA MD.
The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the su bject.
The subject requests withdrawal from the study.
Eligibility criteria violation was noted after the subject started study drug and continuation of 
the study drug would place the subject at risk.
Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages and c ontinuation of the study drug would 
place the subject at risk.
The subject becomes pregnant while on study drug.
Subject is significantly noncompliant with study procedures, which would put the subject at risk 
for continued participation in the trial.
Subject answers "yes" to question 4 and/or question 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the 
C-SSRS and/or positive responses to any category of the suicidal behavior portion of the C -SSR; 
these subjects should be referred for appropriate follow -up care a nd the AbbVie TA MD should 
be notified.
For subjects considered to be lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the subject's final status.  At a minimum, 2 telephone calls must be made and 1 certified 
letter must be sen t and documented in the subject's source documentation.
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site.  The investigator may 
also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the s tudy for 
safety reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the investigator.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modification
During the COVID -19 pandemic, it has been necessary to employ mitigation strategies to enable the 
investigator to ensure subje ct safety and continuity of care.  Acceptable mitigation strategies are 
identified and included in the Operations Manual in Appendix F .
Refer to the Operations Manual in Appendix F for details on how to handle study activities/procedures.
5.6 Temporary Suspension of Study Drug Treatment
A subject 's study drug treatment may need to be temporarily suspended for medical reasons 
(i.e., illness, hospitalization).  If such a situation occurs, subjects who experience a suspension up or 
equal to 30 days in duration may be reinitiated on study drug at the dis cretion of the investigator.  A 
suspension of study drug, greater than 30 days in duration, will require approval from the AbbVie TA MD 
prior to drug being restarted.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.5.7 Follow -Up After Subject Discontinuation of Study Drug or From
Study
To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits, unless subjects 
have decided to discontinue study participation entirely (withdrawal of i nformed consent).  Subjects 
should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they prematurely 
discontinue treatment with study drug.
If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation and is willing, the procedures outl ined for the 
Premature Discontinuation Visit ( Appendix D ) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably 
within 2 weeks.  In addition, if a sub ject discontinues study participation or completes the study but will 
not participate in the extension study and is willing, a 30 -day follow -up phone call after the end of the 
infusion of study drug will be completed to ensure all treatment -emergent A Es/SA Es have been 
resolved.

ABBV -951.
Page 33 of 107 
STUDY M15 -741  |  Version 7.0  |  EudraCT 2018 -002144 -85
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.The oral loading dose will be determined by the investigator per therapeutic management prior to 
infusion.  The infusion rate of ABBV -951 (and therefore the total am ount of ABBV -951 administered) will 
be calculated based on the subject 's levodopa equivalent dose (LED) and an ABBV -951 conversion 
algorithm.  The initial dose of study drug and corresponding infusion rate can be adjusted during the 
Optimization Period to reach the individualized therapeutic dose that most adequately controls the 
subject 's motor symptoms as assessed by the investigator through subject interviews and/or other 
evaluations of symptom severity.  The ABBV -951 basal infusion rate can also be adjusted throughout the 
study at the discretion of the investigator.  The investigator may preprogram 3 infusion rates into the 
pump, 1 that corresponds to the base prescribed daily infusion rate (F1) and 2 additional infusion rates 
(F2 and F3) that are progra mmable within a ± 20% limit from the prescribed base infusion rate and 
always within the allowable range (0.17 to 1.04 mL/hr); F2 should be an alternative higher continuous 
dose and F3 should be an alternative lower continuous dose.  F3 may be reduced beyo nd the 20% limit 
from the prescribed base infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with approval from the 
AbbVie TA MD.  If the alternative infusion rates (F2 and F3) are not required, the investigator or his/her 
designee must program them to "OF F."  Thus, subjects might have the freedom to choose among the 
preprogrammed infusion rates or to self- administer extra doses of ABBV- 951 during the day, per the 
investigator' s judgment.  The pump will be programmed by the site per instructions in the Syst em 
Programming Guide.
During the Treatment Period, the ABBV -951 infusion will be self -administered by the subject using study 
devices (i.e., infusion set connected to an infusion pump) indicated for subcutaneous delivery.  The drug 
delivery system will nee d to be loaded with the investigational drug at the same time every day for 
subjects who require 1 vial per day (every 24 hours), or at the same times of the day (every 12 hours) for 
subjects who require 2 vials per day.  To prepare the drug delivery syste m, reference the System User 
Manual instructions: study drug will be loaded into a syringe that will then be connected to the pump.  
The infusion site will be prepared.  The insertion device will be used to insert the cannula and apply the 
cannula pad to t he skin.  The infusion set tubing will be attached to the syringe, primed, and then 
attached to the cannula pad on the subject.  The daily dose will be initiated by starting the 
pre-programmed pump.  When vial changes are performed, depending on how long t he infusion set has 
already been in use, subjects may need to either:  a) obtain all new components or b) obtain all new 
components except for a new infusion set (i.e., infusion set tubing and insertion device/cannula pad, 
which can be used up for 3 consec utive days).  For the latter situation, the subject will use a new syringe 
and a new vial adapter to draw their therapy from a new vial, connect the new syringe to the pump, 
connect their existing infusion set to the syringe, and start their therapy.
The i nfusion set and the infusion site (area of the skin where the subcutaneous cannula is inserted) can 
be left unchanged for up to 3 days when the drug is infused continuously.  This includes maintaining the 
same infusion set when changing empty syringes or u sing a new vial (for those who require two vials per 
day).  However, a new vial adapter and a new syringe are required any time a new vial is used.  The 
infusion set should be changed, and the infusion site rotated every 3 days unless a more frequent 
rotat ion schedule is medically indicated (investigators should consider instructing the subject to rotate 
the infusion site more frequently than every 3 days (e.g., every 2 days or every day) if skin irritation 
and/or drug pooling is observed).  Temporary inter ruptions of study drug are allowed (e.g., for hygiene, 
or changing empty syringes).  A change in vial, vial adapter, syringe and infusion set, and rotation of the 
infusion site are required before resuming infusion for interruptions longer than approximate ly 1 hour.  
If study drug is interrupted for approximately 3 hours or more, a loading dose is recommended to 
quickly achieve symptomatic control (see table below):

The investigator will select the length of the infusion set cannula among those provided, considering 
individual subject characteristics such as thickness of the abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue. The 
appropriate cannula will be long enough to deliver study drug solution to the subcutaneous tissue 
without infiltrating the muscle wall, which can cause pain and/or occlusion of the cannula.
The infusion should be administered to a site with ample subcutaneous tissue and atleast 5 centimeters 
(or 2 inches) away from the site of application of ECG electrodes, and at least 5 centimeters (or 2 inches) 
away from the umbilicus (if the selected area for infusion is the abdomen).  Infusions should not be 
administered to areas of s carred or hardened tissue or stretch marks, to skin folds or creases where the 
body naturally bends a great deal, or to areas where clothing might cause irritation (e.g., near the 
beltline).
In the event of an infusion pump malfunction or other event that temporarily prevents delivery of study 
drug, the time period during which study drug was not delivered will be recorded by the site, in the 
electronic data capture system.  The subject should call the clinical study personnel, so that they may 
attempt to r esume the study drug infusion.  The time that the infusion stopped and/or malfunction will 
be recorded to the minute if known (otherwise, an estimated time will be recorded).  If the infusion is 
resumed, the restart time will be recorded to the minute.  If the study drug infusion is not able to be 
resumed or if the investigator is concerned that the subject may not be able to successfully complete 
the study drug infusion requirements, the subject may be discontinued from the study.
Alternative Infusion Site Locations
Although the abdomen is the preferred infusion site location, situations may occur where an alternative 
infusion site may need to be considered for a subject.  If the investigator believes that an alternative 
infusion site is needed for a partic ular subject, for example, due to abdominal skin reactions that do not 
heal fast enough to allow for rotation, surgical interventions, scar tissue, or anatomical restrictions, the 
following alternative sites may be considered after obtaining approval from AbbVie TA MD:
Thighs:  anterior (both lateral and medial)
Arms:  posterior (both lateral and medial)
Flanks
Investigators should factor in the following when considering one of these sites:
Body composition and distribution of subcutaneous tissue:  look f or places on the skin where 
you can "pinch an inch" to ensure there is adequate subcutaneous tissue (e.g., for males, more 
around the abdomen; for females, more around hips and upper thighs).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Ability to use alternative infusion site.  It might be difficult for subjects to apply the cannula to 
the flank or to the dominant arm by themselves.
Hirsutism:  to minimize issues with adhesiveness of cannula pad, avoid areas with excess hair or 
consider removing hair without causing blade -related skin trauma.  If sha ving with razor, 
consider doing 1 day or 2 days prior to cannula insertion.  Alternatives to razor shaving are 
trimming or use of hair removal creams.
Sweating:  to minimize issues with adhesiveness of cannula pad and risk of folliculitis (especially 
if blade-shaven), avoid areas where the subject sweats significantly and avoid tight -fitting 
clothes on the chosen area.  Also consider using commercially available ancillary adhesive 
materials.
Sleep position:  discuss expectation with subject to either adjust sleeping position or consider an 
alternative location that does not impact sleep habits.
Physical activity and exercise:  consider choosing sites with the least risk of being impacted by 
the physical activity and consider using ancillary adhesive material s to prevent activity -related 
dislodgement of the cannula and subsequent inadequate infusion delivery (intradermal rather 
than subcutaneous).  Avoid sunscreen or lotion on the area and if used, ensure the area is 
cleaned with alcohol pad/wipes and allowed to dry completely before inserting the cannula.
Subject preference:  subject's desire for cannula concealment (thigh and flank) versus no 
concealment (arm).
The alternative infusion site(s) may be used sporadically or integrated into the routine with the 
abdomen rotation at the investigator's discretion.  If an alternative site is used exclusively long term, it is 
preferable to alternate (right/left) and maintain the 2.5 -cm (1 -inch) distance from the previous infusion 
site when returning to the same side. Sites will record information in subject 's source documentation 
on the alternative infusion site(s) used.
Packaging and Labeling
ABBV -951 will be supplied as solution for infusion in vials in an open -labeled fashion and packaged in a 
carton containing 6 v ials per carton.  ABBV- 951 will be labeled as ABBV- 951 12/240 mg/mL 
(CDP4´/LDP4´) S. INF. 15 mL Vial.  Each vial and carton will be labeled as required per country 
requirements.  Each label must remain affixed to the vial and carton.
AbbVie will supply ABB V-951 and the study pump, its accessories, syringe/drug reservoir, infusion sets, 
and vial adapters.  Non- investigational medicinal products (e.g., rescue therapy with LD+DDCI IR tablets 
or levodopa inhalation powder) must be obtained commercially, unless local regulations require the 
sponsor to provide them.
Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
ABBV -951 must be stored under refrigeration between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and must be protected 
from light.  ABBV -951 must be allowed to warm in the sealed via l to room temperature for 30 minutes 
prior to transfer to the drug reservoir/syringe.  The investigational products are for investigational use 
only and are to be used only within the context of this study.  The study drug supplied for this study 
must be m aintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label 
(refrigerated) until the time of use or until returned to AbbVie.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Tote bags, cold packs, cooler bags, disposal containers, and alcohol swabs, may be provided to study 
subjects.  Batteries might be provided by AbbVie, based on country -specific regulations and will be 
locally sourced.
The drug delivery system, including the infusion pump, infusion set, and syringes, must be used as 
indicated and training will be provided to the clinical study personnel and/or a home care nurse 
provided by the sponsor.  Detailed instructions for the use of the drug delivery system pump are listed in 
the pump ABBV -951 System User Manual and the ABBV -951 System Programming Guide.
Subject Iden tifier Assignment
An interactive response technology (IRT) system will assign a unique identification number to each 
subject at Screening Visit 1 (V1).  For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, clinical study 
personnel must register the subject as a screen failure in the IRT system.
For subjects who rescreen (e.g., due to Vitamin B 12deficiency), the screening number assigned by the 
IRT at the initial screening visit should be used.  Treatment will be administered in an open -label 
manner.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain the subject number assigned to them at Screening Visit 1 (V1) 
throughout the study.
Contact information and user guidelines for the IRT use will be provided to each site.
Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
ACSCI of study drug will be delivered over 24 hours daily for up to 52 weeks via an infusion set 
connected to a pump.  Each subject 's base continuous infusion rate (F1) will be initially calculated based 
on the subject 's daily LED and an algorithm develope d following the analysis of pharmacokinetic data 
from Phase 1 studies.  The dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response for the individual 
subject, which means maximizing the functional "On"time during the day by minimizing the number 
and durat ion of "Off" episodes (bradykinesia) and minimizing "On"time with disabling dyskinesia.
Study Drug/Study Devices Accountability
The investigator or his representative will verify that study drug and study devices are received intact 
and in the correct amo unts.  This will be documented by signing and dating a proof of receipt or similar 
document.  A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug and study devices will be 
maintained in the IRT system.  For those subjects who are allowed to benefit fr om a direct to patient 
shipment of the study drug and study devices, the third -party vendor contracted by the sponsor may be 
responsible of those steps described above.
Subjects will be instructed to return used drug vials with vial adapters attached withi n the original vial 
carton; subjects will also be instructed to return unused vials in the original vial carton.  Used syringes, 
infusion sets (inserter and infusion set tubing) will be collected into a disposal container and returned to 
the study site for proper disposal or an alternative sponsor -approved method of disposal shall be used.  
Unused syringes, infusion sets (inserter and infusion set tubing) and vial adapters will be returned by the 
subject to the site at the end of the study.  At the end of t he study, subjects will be instructed to return 
the pumps, and the sites would reconcile the pump in the IRT system.

Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events:  Study Drug
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relations hip with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is co nsidered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of A Es on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AE s will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/pr ocedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure was 
planned prior to study entry; however, if the pre -existing condition deteriorate s unexpectedly during 
the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for 
which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, me ets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to AbbVie clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (as appropriate) as an 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.2 of the Operations 
Manual for reporting details and contact information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length 
of time or prolong s the subject 's hospital stay.  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant An event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not

significance such as headache, nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in d eath or hospitalization, but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospitalization, 
prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All A Es reported from the start of study drug infusion until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug 
administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  In 
addition, study procedure -related serious and nonserious A Es will be collected from the time the subject 
signs the study -specific informed consent.
AEs will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may indicate a trend 
or risk to subjects.
Adverse Reactions and Serious Adverse Rea ctions
An adverse reaction (AR) implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between a 
suspected medicinal product and an AE.  An AR, in contrast to an AE, is characterized by the fact that a 
causal relationship between a medicinal pr oduct and an occurrence is suspected.
Serious adverse reactions (SARs) are defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in death, are 
life-threatening, require in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, result in 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or are a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) refers to individual SAE case reports from 
clinical trials where a causal relationship between the SAE and the IMP is suspected by either the 
sponsor or the investigator, is not listed in the applicable Reference Safety Information, and meets 
one of the following serious criteria :  results in death, is life -threatening, requires hospitalization or 
prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is 
a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  All individually reported SARs ar e considered suspected.
AbbVie will be responsible for SUSAR reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
guidelines.

The following AESIs will be monitored during the study:
●Polyneuropathy
●Weight loss
●Halluci nations/psychosis
●Somnolence
Hallucinations, especially visual hallucinations, are a common symptom in patients with PD and could be 
associated with disease progression, comorbid pathologies, and/or concomitant medications.  Older 
subjects, especially wit h history of hallucination and psychosis, are more at risk of exacerbating 
psychotic symptoms even if these are well controlled with antipsychotic medications at Baseline.  
Hallucinations might be prevented by managing psychogenic medications that might ha ve been 
introduced during the parent study or while in the current study.  Should hallucinations appear during 
this study, standard of care may be applied.  This should include a conservative approach of assessing 
alternative etiologies and addressing them as appropriate and if none are found, waiting a few days to 
see if the phenomenon resolves spontaneously; the ultimate decision on how an individual subject is 
managed during the study, however, is the responsibility of the investigator or designee.
Local tolerability will be assessed.  Infusion site evaluations will be performed at each scheduled clinic 
visit and may be performed at an unscheduled clinic visit.  Any observation of infusion site 
irritation/reaction (> 2 or > C on the infusion site eva luation scale) must be recorded as an AE.  Other 
infusion site -related reactions such as cellulitis/abscess formation, ecchymoses, subcutaneous nodules, 
or scarring should be evaluated and recorded as A Es.  An independent review of moderate and severe 
infusion site -related reactions will be performed.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
Investigators will rate the severity of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe.
Investigators will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject 's 
usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subje ct's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of the 
study drug:
Reasonable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.

Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events:  Study Medical Device
Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any untoward 
clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or other persons whether or 
not related to the investigational medical devi ce.
If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as an SAE within 24 hours after 
the site is made aware of the SAE:
Led to death, injury, or permanent impairment to a body structure of body function
Led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that either resulted in:
a life -threatening illness or injury, or
a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or
medical or surgic al intervention to prevent life threatening illness
Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.
A planned hospitalization for a preexisting condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without a 
serious deterior ation in health, is not considered an SAE.
Adverse Device Effects
Adverse device effects are A Esrelated to the use of an investigational medical device.  This includes any 
AE resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use, the deployment, the 
implantation, the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of the investi gational medical device.  
This includes any event that is a result of a use error or intentional abnormal use of the investigational 
medical device.
Serious Adverse Device Effects
Serious adverse device effects are adverse device effects that have resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of an SAE.
Device Deficiency
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of an investigational medical device related to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance.  This may include malfuncti ons, use error, or inadequacy in 
the information supplied by the manufacturer.
If a device deficiency meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours 
after the site is made aware:

Any device deficiency that may h ave led to a SAE if:
suitable action had not been taken or
intervention had not been made or
circumstances had been less fortunate
New findings/updates in relation to already reported events
Device Causality Assessment
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the reportable device 
event.
Not Related –Relationship to the device can be excluded when:
the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of a similar 
devices and p rocedures;
the event has not temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device or the 
procedures;
the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologica lly implausible;
the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure –when clinically feasible –and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the 
level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serio us event;
the event involves a body site or an organ not expected to be affected by the device or 
procedure;
the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g., and underlying or concurrent 
illness/clinical condition, an effect of another device, d rug, treatment, or other risk factors);
the event does not depend on a false result given by the investigational device use for diagnosis 
when applicable;
harm to the subject are not clearly due to use error.
In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, 
depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event.
Unlikely –the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can be 
reasonably explained by anothe r cause, but additional information may be obtained.
Possible –the relationship with the use of the investigational device is weak but cannot be ruled out 
completely.  Alternative causes are also possible (e.g., an underlying or concurrent illness/clinica l 
condition or/and an effect of another device, drug, or treatment).  Cases were relatedness cannot be 
assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.

effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;
harm to the subject is due to error in use;
the event depends on a false result given by the investigational de vice used for diagnosis, when 
applicable;
In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, 
depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a s tudy subject must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site 
becomes aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study subject, 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject 's partner during the study, written informed consent 
from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  AbbVie will provide a 
separate consent form for this purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject 's partner(s) will be collected from the 
date of initiatio n of the infusion through 30 days after the end of the infusion.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is 
considered an SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site becomes awar e of the 
event.

7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be fi nalized prior to the interim database lock.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 240 subjects will be enrolled to obtain exposure data from at least 100 subjects treated 
with 24 -hour daily CSCI of ABBV -951 for at least 12 months and to meet country requirements.  With 
240 subjects receiving ABBV -951, the probability to observe an AE with an annual incidence rate of 
0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 is 70%, 91%, and 99 %, respectively .
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects who receive at least 1 ABBV -951 infusion and have a 
baseline and treatment observation for at least 1 efficacy outcome measure.  The Treatment -Naive 
Analysis Set (TNAS) consists of all subjects in the FAS who have the initial exposure to ABBV -951 in 
Study M15 -741, i.e., subjects who had received ABBV -951 in another study prior to participating in 
Study M15 -741 are excluded from the TNAS.
The Safety Anal ysis Set consists of all subjects who receive any ABBV- 951 infusion.
All analyses will be conducted by dose subgroup (low dose or high dose) with a cutoff of 2800 mg LDP 
but could be revised based on an assessment conducted when 50 subjects reach Week 4 or the end of 
the Optimization Period.  Each subject will be categorized to a dose subgroup based on the average total 
daily dose over the treatment period.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
This is a single -arm, open -label study.  Unless stated otherwise, a ll analyses on efficacy variables will be 
performed with the FAS using data collected no more than 1 day after the end of the infusion of 
ABBV -951.  An exploratory efficacy analysis of normalized daily "Off"time will be conducted on the 
TNAS.  A paired -sample t -test will be performed for testing the change from Baseline.
For all efficacy endpoints, the change from Baseline to each planned visit and to the final visit will be 
summarized in a descriptive manner for each dose subgroup and overall subjects.  T he statistics include 
the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set.  Safety will be assessed by A Es, the 
Infusion Site Evaluation Scale, laboratory values, vital sign measures, ECGs, and safety scales including

will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The number and percentage of subjects with treatment emergent A Es by MedDRA system organ class 
and preferred term, by severity, and by relationship to study treatment as assessed by the investigator 
will be provide d for each dose subgroup and overall subjects.  For continuous safety outcomes, the 
change from Baseline will be analyzed in a descriptive manner by visit for each dose subgroup and 
overall subjects.  For categorical safety outcomes, the number and percent age of each category will be 
summarized by visit for each dose subgroup and overall subjects.  Hypothesis testing will not be 
performed.
7.5 Interim Analysis
Two interim analyses will be performed during the course of this study.  The first interim analysis will be 
performed after at least 100 subjects have completed 26 Weeks of therapy; the second interim analysis 
will be performed after at least 100 subjects have completed 52 Weeks of therapy.
8ETHICS

The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be 
submitted to the IEC/IRB for review and approval.  Approval of both the protocol and the informed 
consent form(s) must be obtained before any subject is enroll ed.  Any amendment to the protocol will 
require review and approval by the IEC/IRB before the changes are implemented to the study.  In 
addition, all changes to the consent form(s) will be IEC/IRB approved.
A subject may withdraw consent for optional biomarker samples at any time and remain in the clinical 
study.  Data generated from optional biomarker samples before subject withdrawal of consent will be 
retained.
8.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, Inte rnational Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and 
guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the

In the event a significant disaster/crisis (including the COVID -19 pandemic) o ccurs leading to difficulties 
in performing protocol -specified procedures, AbbVie may engage with study site personnel in efforts to 
ensure the safety of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the 
study while trying to best manage subject continuity of care.  This may include alternative methods for 
assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use 
of a local laboratory instead of a central laboratory), and shipping investigational product and/or 
supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity of treatment where allowed.  In all cases, these 
alternative measures must be allowed by local regulations and permitted by IRB/IEC.

and incorporate necessary protocol modifications due to the COVID -19 pandemic, as well as other 
changes as follows:
1.Sample size estimation was updated to approximately 240 subjects to accommodate 
participation of additional countries, to account for the higher -than -expected dropout rate and 
to gain additional safety data.
2.Clarified that F3 infusion rate may be reduced beyond the 20% limit from the prescribed base 
infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with approval from the AbbVie TA MD.
3.Included information on the re -evaluation of the benefit and risk to subjects participating in the 
study to reflect that there is no additional risk to subjects due to COVID -19 (Protocol 
Section 2.2).
4.Modified/added eligibility criteria to minimize additional risk to study subjects or exclude 
subjects positive for COVID -19 (Protocol Section 5.1).
5.Clarified that protocol deviations may include modifications due to COVID -19 (Protocol 
Section 5.9)
6.Added instructions for COVID -19 pandemic -related acceptable protocol modifications and to

Study visits may be impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  This may include changes such as remote 
visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study procedures, 
among others.  Additional details are provided in the subsequent section.  Every effort should be made 
to ensure the safety of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study.  If visits 
cannot be conducted onsite due to travel restrictions or other pandemic -related reasons, follow the 
guidance below on how to proceed.
If a subject has screened and is unable to complete screening activities on site after Screening Visit 1, 
the Screening Period should be extended as described in Protocol Section 4.1 r ather than performing 
remote Visit 2, since Day 1 and Day 2 visits are required to be completed onsite.  The guidance that is 
provided for Week 1 visit and beyond should be followed if the COVID -19 restrictions at your site have 
changed once your subject i s enrolled.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
During the COVID -19 pandemic, if it is not possible for all study procedures to be performed as specified 
due to travel restrictions or other reasons, the following modifications are a llowed:
If permitted by local regulations, the IRB/IEC and the subject, study visits for Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 
13, and 39 may be conducted remotely.  The Enrollment Visit (Day 1), Day 2 visit, Week 26 visit, 
and the Final Week 52/Premature Discontinuation v isit are required to be completed onsite.  It 
is highly recommended that all visits during the Optimization Period (Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 visits) 
be conducted onsite whenever possible.
Some study visits and/or activities may be performed by phone/remotely.  These are indicated 
by a hashtag (#) in the appropriate visit tables below.
During a phone/remote visit, activities that do not need to be performed are indicated by a 
minus sign ( –).
Scheduled and unscheduled labs may be drawn by a local clinic/hospital/l aboratory if COVID -19 
restrictions prevent a subject to visit the site.  All procedures performed at local facilities must 
be performed by appropriately qualified personnel.
Study visits and/or activities should be performed as scheduled whenever possible.   If it is not 
possible to do so due to the pandemic, the following modifications are allowed:
For Week 26 and Week 52, if the visit cannot be rescheduled within the visit window, 
contact the sponsor.  Subjects should remain on study drug as much as possib le through 
Week 52/Premature Discontinuation.
If an activity is missed during a remote visit, perform the activity at the earliest feasible opportunity.  
Laboratory draws must be obtained as soon as feasible.

documentation should indicate that verbal consent was obtained.
Informed consent will be obtained at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as shown in Section 2.
3.2 Eligibility Criteria
All subjects will be evaluated to ensure th ey meet the eligibility criteria at Screening Visits 1 and 2 (V1 
and V2) and prior to enrollment on Day 1 (V3) as shown in Section 2.
3.3 Medical Histor y
A complete medical history, including demographics and histories of alcohol or drug abuse, that in the 
investigator's judgment might impact compliance with study execution, will be taken at Screening Visit 1 
(V1) as shown in Section 2.  Additionally, chronic disorders (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hay fever, 
polyneuropathy) that began prior to Screening Visit 1 (V1) and are still present at Screening Visit 1 (V1) 
should be recorded on the Medical History Form.  The medical history obtained at Screening Visit 1 (V1) 
will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.  All psychiatric, neurological, behavioral, and/or 
cognitive diagnoses should be reported.  Updates should be made to the medical/neurological/PD 
history with any findings from laboratories, dermatologists, etc. related to the period before initiation of 
study drug.  Medication (prescription or over -the-counter, including vitamins and herbal supplements) 
use from 30 days prior to informed consent form signature through the end of the study will also be 
recorded.
3.4 Clinical Assessments
A clinical assessment will be conducted on all subjects at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as shown in Section 2.  
This will include an assessment of the subject's PD treatment history, including the Advanced 
Parkinson's Disease (aP D) Clinician Assessment.1  To qualify for enrollment in the study, the subject 
should provide the investigator with a comprehensive history of thei r current and past (possibly up to 
5years) PD medication.  This should be done according to the subject's recollection, as well as available 
history in a subject's chart.
The investigator or qualified designee will complete the aPD Clinician Assessment to determine if the 
subject has inadequate control of their motor symptoms despite treatment with PD medications and 
therefore requires advanced PD treatment.
3.5 Study Drug Prescription Record
Starting on Day 1 (V3) through the end of the study as shown in Sect ion 2, the subject's pump settings 
(continuous infusion rate in mL/hr and extra dose volume in mL) should be recorded at the conclusion of 
each vis it on the study drug prescription record.

No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.3.6 Infusion Site Evaluation
The investigator or qualified designee will evaluate the infusion site area (abdomen) from Day 1 (V3) 
through the end of the study, as shown in Section 2.
At the time of each evaluation, the following rating scales will be used:2
Irritation –Numeric Grades
0 = No evidence of irritation
1 = Minimal erythema, barely perceptible
2 = Moderate erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal papular response
3 = Erythema and papules
4 = Definite edema
5 = Erythema, edema, and p apules
6 = Vesicular eruption
7 = Strong reaction spreading beyond the test site
Irritation –Letter Grades
A = No finding
B = Slight glazed appearance
C = Marked glazing
D = Glazing with peeling and cracking
E = Glazing with fissures
F = Film of dried ser ous exudates covering all or portion of the patch site
G = Small petechial erosions and/or scabs
Any observation of infusion site reaction with irritation criteria > 2 or > C must be recorded as an 
adverse event (AE).
Dermatologic Assessment
If any moderate to severe infusion site related AE, such as cellulitis/abscess formation, ecchymoses, 
subcutaneous nodules, or scarring occurs, or if any infusion site related reaction is assessed with an 
irritation numeric grade equal to 7 on the Infusion Site Evaluation scale, the investigator or designee is 
instructed to do the following, which will be documented in the eCRF:
1.Photograph the skin reaction and follow the appropriate procedure for submission of 
photographs .  In rare situations where an asse ssment or visit cannot be completed onsite due to 
an extenuating event (e.g., COVID -19-related conditions), the subject may be asked to obtain 
and submit a self -captured photograph of the skin reaction.
2.Refer the subject to a dermatologist for comprehensiv e evaluation (including skin biopsy, if 
applicable), treatment, and follow -up per standard practice.  The subject should be referred to a 
dermatologist within 2 business days after the photographs are taken.  The dermatologic visit 
should be completed with in 2 weeks from identification of the AE or skin reaction that meets 
the above criteria.  While an in -person dermatology evaluation is preferred, this assessment 
may be performed as a telemedicine visit per the dermatologist's standard practice.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Photograph y data will be considered source documentation.  Dermatologic assessments may be 
performed during clinic visits (scheduled or unscheduled).
Sites will request medical records from the dermatologic visit.  Upon receipt of records or reports 
generated from t he dermatologic visit, sites will promptly submit them to AbbVie or designee consistent 
with typical study data reporting requirements.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Infusion Site Evaluation (ISE) may be completed remotely via video 
conference at the study visits specified in Section 2(provided the video is of sufficient quality).  If the ISE 
is completed via video conference, the subject will be asked to describe the reaction (swelling, redness, 
etc.).  Further, if the ISE meets the criteria for dermatologic assessment, request that a photo of the 
reaction be provided to the site in ac cordance with local regulations.  AEs should be reported per 
protocol.
3.7 Drug and Alcohol Screen
Subjects should have no history of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse within the last 6 months 
that can preclude adherence to the protocol, in the opin ion of the investigator.
Urine specimens will be tested at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as shown in Section 2for the presence of drugs 
of abuse and for alcohol.  The panel for drugs of abuse will minimally include the drugs listed below.  
These analyses will be performed by the site or by the certified central laboratory.  If the screen is 
performed by the site, test kits and the confirmation of positive results will be provided by the central 
laboratory.  A positive confirmation will result in the subject's exclusion from the study only if in the 
opinion of the investigator, the subject's history of drug abuse could preclude adherence to the 
protocol.  Si milarly, if there is documented proof that the detected drug is appropriately prescribed by a 
physician, the subject might be enrolled in the study.
Cannabinoids
Opiates
Barbiturates
Amphetamines*
Cocaine
Benzodiazepines
* A positive confirmation of amphet amine use, even if appropriately prescribed by a physician, will result in the subject's 
exclusion from enrollment in the study, as amphetamines are dopamine depleting agents and therefore prohibited in this 
study.
3.8 Adverse Event Assessment
AEs will be ass essed at every visit throughout the study as shown in Section 2.  The investigator will 
routinely monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs throughout the study.  The 
investigator will assess and record any AE in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if 
known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the AE 
to stud y drug, and any action(s) taken.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.For serious adverse events (SAEs) considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated 
with study drug or the study device components, the investigator will provide an "other" cause of the 
event.  For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by clinical study personnel, or reported spontaneously by the 
subject will be recorded.
All AEs will be followed to a satisfactor y conclusion.
See also Section 4.1.
3.9 Prior and Concomitant Medications
Investigators and/or trained site staff will review and record all prior and concomitant medications at 
every visit throughout the study as shown in Section 2.
3.10 Patient -Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the self -administered patient -reported outcome (PRO) instruments.  Subjects 
should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the PRO instrument and to provide the 
best possible resp onse to each item.  Clinical study personnel shall not provide interpretation or 
assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Clinical study personnel will 
encourage completion of the PRO instrument at all specified visits and wi ll ensure that a response is 
entered for all items.
Subjects will also complete rater -administered PRO instruments, such as the Columbia -Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS), the Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease -
Rating Scale (QUIP -RS), and other assessments.  All applicable clinical, safety, health outcome, and 
cognition assessments will be administered only by individuals qualified by the sponsor.  Every effort 
must be made by the investigative sites to ensure tha t each subject is rated by the same rater 
throughout the subject's participation in the study.
Prior to administration of respective scale(s), designated raters will be trained on and certified (if 
appropriate) in the use of all the scales used in this study.  The objective of this certification/training is 
to ensure uniformity across sites in the administration and scoring of these assessments.
The sponsor, in conjunction with the selected rater training vendor, if applicable, will determine the 
minimum rater qualifications for each of the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications 
prior to participation in the training process.  The names and qualifications of all clinical study personnel 
to be involved in rating scale administration will be submitted for approval upon site selection.  The 
qualifications of the raters will be verified through the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be trained 
and tested for competency and, if they meet established requirements, certified accordingly.  Individual 
exceptions to these requirements must be approved by the sponsor via the rater training vendor if 
applicable.
Only those persons who have been trained as raters for this study may rate subjects.  Raters who cannot 
participate in the initial pre -study training or who become involved in the study at a later time will not 
be permitted to perform study ratings until they have satisfactorily completed an individualized training

investigator or his/her designee.  Raters may be reassessed periodically throughout the study.
The PRO assessments are described below.  COVID -19 pandemic -related acceptable protocol 
modifications are described at the end of th is section.
SLATE Device PRO (i.e., rater tablet):  The preferred method is to collect data using direct entry into the 
SLATE device, even when collected remotely.  Paper PROs may be used in certain cases; please discuss 
with the sponsor.  Specifications a re outlined below.
Site rater -administered scales via SLATE Device PRO:  This includes MDS -UPDRS, C -SSRS, QUIP -RS, 
EQ-5D-5L, and PDQ -39, as applicable for each visit.  The qualified rater at the site can conduct those 
assessments remotely as specified by p rotocol except for the MMSE and MDS -UPDRS Part III (Motor 
Examination).  As default, the system does not allow raters to jump to the MDS -UPDRS Part IV without 
having completed Part III.  In this case, "Unable to Rate" is the response choice on the MDS -UPDR S 
Part III that should be used to skip through the questions.
Paper versions of certain scales may be available for remote administration.  Please discuss with the 
sponsor.
Source documentation should clearly indicate how each scale was obtained (e.g., in -person, 
phone, video conference) with time/date noted for each scale and with rater's initials.  Study 
personnel will transfer paper documentation to TrialManager (via SLATE device [i.e., rater 
tablet]) per instructions provided to the study site.
Subject Dosing Diary
Subjects will complete a dosing diary.  The time a new syringe dose is started, changes in the preset 
pump flow rate, self -administered extra dose times, stoppage in therapy (e.g., vial change -out, shower),
replacement of infusion sets, pump errors (e.g., occlusion alarm), and LD+DDCI tablets or levodopa 
inhalation powder self -administered by the subject during the study as possible rescue therapy should 
be recorded for 2 consecutive days prior to any study visits (as specified in Section 2).  Additionally, all 
instances of the use of rescue therapy, change in pump flow rates, and self -administered extra doses 
should be documented in the dosing diary throughout the study.  Completed dosing diaries should be 
submitted to the investigator at the first available occasion.
PD Diary
PD Diary Subject Training and Screening Requirements
The subject will be required to have PD Diary training that will include how to understand their PD 
symptomatology and how to complete the PD Diary.  Training will occur during Screening Visit 1 (V1).
Completion of the PD Diary
The core of the PD Diary is the questionnaire that the subject will use to record Parki nsonian symptoms.  
The subject will be prompted to record in the PD Diary whether he/she has been "On," "Off," or 
"Asleep" and what the severity of his/her dyskinesia (troublesome or not troublesome) was.  The PD 
Diary is to be completed for a full 24 hour s of each day, reflecting both time awake and time asleep.  On 
PD Diary recording days, the subject will be instructed to make an entry upon waking and every 
30minutes during their normal waking time and upon awakening from time asleep.

OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M15- 741 VERSION 7.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.The PD Diary will be completed on 2 consecutive days prior to Day 1 (V3) during the Monitoring Period, 
and for 2 consecutive days immediately prior to the visits specified in Section 2.  Subjects should be 
reminded with a phone call prior to each visit to complete the PD Diary and to reinforce the importance 
of PD Diary completion.  If during the study, the subject incorrectly completes the PD Diary, they should 
receiv e re-training on PD Diary completion.
PD Diary Concord ance Assessment
Following the initial PD Diary training during Screening Visit 1 (V1), the subject will complete a PD Diary 
over a minimum of 3 hours for a concordance evaluation while he/she is in the clinic at Screening Visit 1 
(V1) as shown in Section 2.  During this period, the subject must experience at least 1 transition from 
"Off" to "On" or from "On" to "Off," which must be observed by the investigator or a qualified rater.  
The investigator or an experienced and medically qualified study site designee (e.g., NP, PA, DO, MD, or 
PhD) assigned by the investigator will also complete a separate PD Diary for this period indicating their
assessment of the subject's motor state.  There must be at least 75% concordance between the subject's 
PD Diary and the PD Diary completed by the investigator or qualified designee.  If no transition from 
"Off" to "On" or from "On" to "Off" occurs during the time of concordance evaluation and/or the 
concordance is lower than 75%, the concordance testing may be prolonged at the discretion of the 
investigator or designee.  If the concordance is less than 75%, the subject will undergo re -training of PD 
Diary completion and repeat the concordance evaluation at Screening Visit 2 (V2).  Subjects previously 
enrolled in Study M15 -739, for whom recognizable/identifiable "Off" and "On" state (motor 
fluctuations) have been already established and confirmed do not need to complete the concordance 
test.  The PD diary concordance test may also be omitted for subjects for whom 
recognizable/ identifiable "Off" and "On"state (motor fluctuations) have been already established and 
confirmed, and for unforeseen circumstances, require rescreening.
EuroQol 5 -Dimension Questionnaire
The EuroQol 5 -dimension questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) is a standardized instrument developed by the 
EuroQol Group as a measure of health- related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health 
conditions and treatments.  The EQ -5D-5L consists of 2 parts:  the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ 
visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions:  mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression.  Impairment in each of the 5 dimensions is measured on a 5 -level scale, where 
1= no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3 = moderate problems, 4 = severe problems, and 5 = extreme 
problems.  The patient is asked to rate his/her current health by ticking the box next to the statement 
that most appropriately describes their health status in each of the 5 dimensions.  The patie nt's overall 
health can be described as a single number (formed by the combination of the levels of impairment 
across each of the 5 dimensions) that ranges from 11111 (full health/ no problems) to 55555 (extreme 
impairment in all dimensions).  The health s tatus is converted to an index value using a country -specific 
weighted scoring algorithm.  The index value for the United States (US) ranges from a worst score of
–0.109 to a best score of 1.
In addition, the patient is also asked to self -rate their curren t health on a vertical visual analogue scale 
(VAS).  The scale ranges from 0 (labelled as "the worst health you can imagine") to 100 (labelled as "the 
best health you can imagine").  The VAS provides a complementary approach to the descriptive system 
for q uantifying the patient's health based on their own judgment.

Columb ia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C- SSRS is a systematically administered instrument designed to assess suicidal behavior and 
ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, and assess the lethality of attempts.  Additional features 
assessed include fre quency, duration, controllability, reason for ideation, and deterrents.
Answering "yes"to question 4 and/or question 5 of the suicidal ideation portion of the C -SSRS relative to 
the previous year, or to any category of the suicidal behavior portion of the C-SSRS relative to the last 
2years, is considered as an indicator of high risk for suicide and subjects will need to be evaluated 
immediately by the investigator.  Similarly, if subjects express suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior at 
any time during t he study, the investigator must evaluate the subjects immediately and consider 
whether they remain suitable for participation in the study.  The AbbVie therapeutic area medical 
director (TA MD) should be notified immediately.
Under no circumstances should a subject who has positively endorsed or expressed suicidal ideation be 
left alone, be allowed to exit the site, or go home before a qualified medical professional has evaluated 
the subject's risk.
A qualified rater will administer the C -SSRS at the visits specified in Section 2.  The C -SSRS will be 
administered prior to initiation of the continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) of ABBV -951 on Day 1 
(V3).
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire
The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39) is a disease -specific instrument designed to measure 
aspects of health that are relevant to subjects with PD, and which may not be included in general health 
status quest ionnaires.  Each item is scored on the following 5 -point scale:  0 = never, 1 =occasionally, 
2 =sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
Higher scores are consistently associated with more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors 
and stiffness.  The results are presented as 8 discrete domain scores and as a summary index.  The 
PDQ -39 domain scores and summary index range from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better 
perceived health status.
A qualified rater will administer the PDQ -39 at the visits specified in Section 2.  The PDQ -39 will be 
administered prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951 on Day 1 (V 3).
Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
The Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS -UPDRS) is an 
investigator- used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of PD.  Every effort should be m ade by the 
study sites to ensure that each subject is rated by the same rater throughout the subject's participation 
in the study.  The MDS -UPDRS assessment will be performed by an approved, trained rater.  To be 
qualified by the sponsor and the rater vendor, all raters must have participated in the rater training and 
have a current valid rater certificate.
The MDS- UPDRS consists of the following sections:
Part I: Non -Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living (nM -EDL)

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Part II: Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living (M -EDL)
Part III: Motor Examination (including Hoehn and Yahr stage)
Part IV: Motor Complications
Some sections require that multiple grades be assigned to each extremity.  The MDS -UPDRS total score 
(Parts I -III) ranges from 0 to 236 with 236 representing the worst (total) disability, and 0 representing no 
disability.
For the duration of the study, the MDS -UPDRS will be administered in the subjects' best "On" state with 
the exception of Day 1 (V3).  Before starting the infusion of the investigational drug, subjects will initially 
complete the MDS -UPDRS Part III in a practically defined "Off" state (i.e., without having taken any 
anti- PD medication since the evening of the day before the visit).  The assessment should be repeated 
after initiation of the infusion during the subject's best "On" state, which should be 1 to 2 hours after 
the beginning of the ABBV -951 infusion.  If possible, the MDS -UPDRS should be done at the same time of 
day at each visit throughout the trial by a qua lified rater.  At all indicated visits specified in Section 2, a 
complete MDS -UPDRS (Parts I through IV) will be done during "On" time.
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
In countries where a validated translation of the MDS -UPDRS scale is not available, the Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) version will instead be used.
The UPDRS is an investigator -used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of PD.  Every effort 
should be made by the investigative sites to ensure that each subject is rated by the same rater 
throughout the subject's participation in the study.  The UPDRS assessment will be performed by an 
approved, train ed rater.  To be qualified by the sponsor and the rater vendor, all raters must have 
participated in rater training and have a current valid rater certificate.
The UPDRS consists of the following sections:
Part I Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
Part II Activ ities of Daily Living
Part III Motor Examination
Part IV Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)
Part V Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
For the duration of the study, the UPDRS will be administered in the subject's best "On" state with the 
except ion of Day 1 (V3).  Before starting the infusion of the investigational drug, subjects will initially 
complete the UPDRS Part III in a practically defined "Off" state (i.e., without having taken any anti- PD 
medication since the evening of the day before th e visit).  The assessment should be repeated after 
initiation of the infusion during the subject's best "On" state, which should be 1 to 2 hours after the 
beginning of the ABBV -951 infusion.  If possible, the UPDRS should be done at the same time of day at
each visit throughout the trial by a qualified rater.  At all indicated visits specified in Section 2, a 
complete UPDRS (Parts I through V) will be done during "On" time.
Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale -2
Although a number of scales exist to evaluate sleep disturbances, only 3 are endorsed and 
recommended by the Movement Disorders Society.  One such scale specific for PD is the Parkinson's

OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M15- 741 VERSION 7.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), which has been modified to the PDSS -2.  The purpose of the PDSS -2 is to 
characterize the various aspects of nocturnal sleep problems in patients with PD.  The PDSS- 2 
instrument has been shown to be reliable, valid, precise, and a potentially treatment responsive tool for 
measuring nocturnal disabilities and sleep disorders in PD.  The PDSS -2 consists of 15 questions that 
evaluate motor and non -motor symptoms at night and upon wakening, as well as disturbed sleep 
grouped into 3 domains:  motor symptoms at night (5 items), PD symptoms at night (5 items), and 
disturbed sleep (5 items).  Specifically, the questions assess overall sleep quality, insomnia, sleep 
fragmentation, restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic leg movements of sleep (PLMS) , rapid eye 
movement behavior disorder (RBD), hallucinations, nocturia, nocturnal immobility, pain and cramps, 
morning akinesia, tremor, and sleep apnea.  The PDSS -2 was developed from the PDSS based upon the 
need for a treatment measuring tool containing PD-specific sleep disorders; the instrument was 
extended to address specific sleep disturbances such as RLS, akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea.  Daytime 
sleepiness was removed from the PDSS -2, as it is a more complex PD symptom.
To increase ease of use, the visual analogue scale of the PDSS was transformed into a frequency 
measure in the PDSS -2.  The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5 -point 
Likert -type scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very often] with the exception of Question 1 s core ranging 
from 0 [very often] to 4 [never]).  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.  The 
recall period is for the past week.
A qualified rater will administer the PDSS- 2 at the visits specified in Section 2.  The PDSS -2 will be 
administered prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951 on Day 1 (V3).
Mini- Mental State Examination
The Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a brief, 30 -point questionnaire, administered by a trained 
rater, that provides a quantitative measure of cognitive mental status in adults and is used widely to 
screen for cognitive impairment and to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a give n point in 
time, to follow the course of cognitive changes in a patient over time, and to document response to 
treatment.  The MMSE will be used in this study to screen for cognitive impairment.  The MMSE score 
ranges from 0 to 30 with lower scores indicat ing greater impairment.  The subject must have a score 
≥24 at Screening Visit 1 (V1) to be eligible for study participation.  Subjects with MMSE scores 19 to 23 
inclusive may still be enrolled in the study if, in the investigator's opinion, the cognitive impairment does 
not preclude the subject from completing study -required procedures.  Subjects with moderate or severe 
impairment (MMSE scores of 18 or below) may not be enrolled.  A qualified rater will administer the 
MMSE at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as show n in Section 2.
Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease -Rating Scale
The QUIP -RS is a brief, self -completed or rat er-administered rating scale to assess the severity of 
symptoms of impulse control disorders (ICDs) and related behaviors reported to occur in PD.  In this 
study, QUIP -RS will be rater administered.  The QUIP -RS can also aid in supporting a diagnosis of IC Ds 
and related disorders in PD.  The QUIP -RS uses a 5 -point Likert scale that requires individuals to rate the 
severity of each symptom based on its frequency.  The potential advantages to using a rating scale 
include detection of subsyndromal behaviors, establishment of clear cutoff points with a good balance 
between sensitivity and specificity, and the ability to monitor changes in symptoms over time.
The QUIP -RS has 4 primary questions (pertaining to commonly reported thoughts, urges/desires, and 
behavio rs associated with ICDs), each applied to the 4 ICDs (compulsive gambling, buying, eating, and

Likert scale (score 0 –4 for each question) to gauge the fr equency of behaviors, and instructs patients to 
answer questions based on behaviors that occurred in the preceding 4 weeks (or any 4 -week period in a 
designated time frame).  The QUIP -RS is administered with an instruction sheet that provides examples 
of the behaviors being assessed and a brief description of the Likert scale categories for frequency 
(i.e., never [0] = not at all, rarely [1] = infrequently or 1 day/week, etc.).  Scores for each ICD and related 
disorder range from 0 to 16, with a higher scor e indicating greater severity (i.e., frequency) of 
symptoms.  Due to overlap, hobbyism and punding were combined in the validation process to form a 
single diagnosis (hobbyism -punding), with a total score ranging from 0 to 32 for the combined disorder.  
The total QUIP -RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112.
The behaviors can be described as:
(i) Gambling (casinos, internet gambling, lotteries, scratch tickets, betting, or slot or poker machines);
(ii) Sex (making sexual demands on others, promiscuity, prostitution, change in sexual orientation, 
masturbation, internet or telephone sexual activities, or pornography);
(iii) Buying (too much of the same thing or things that you don't need or use);
(iv) Eating (eating larger amounts or different types of food than in the past, more rapidly than normal, 
until feeling uncomfortably full, or when not hungry);
(v) Hobbyism (specific tasks, hobbies or other organized activities, such as writing, painting, gardening, 
repairing or dismantling things, collectin g, computer use, working on projects, etc.);
(vi) Punding (repeating certain simple motor activities, such as cleaning, tidying, handling, examining, 
sorting, ordering, collecting, hoarding, or arranging objects, etc.);
(vii) Medication use (consistently taking too much of your Parkinson's medications, or increasing on your 
own, without medical advice, your overall intake of Parkinson's medications)
The frequency of behaviors are described as never (0) = not at all, rarely; (1) = infrequently or 
1day/week; sometimes (2) = at times or 2 to 3 days/week; often (3) = most of the time or 
4 – 5days/week; very often (4) = nearly always or 6 -7 days/week.
A qualified rater will administer the QUIP -RS at the times described in Section 2.
Parkinson's KinetiGraph
Developed by Global Kinetics Corporation, the Parkinson's KinetiGraph™ system (PKG™ or Personal 
KinetiGraph™ as it is known in the US), is an innovative mobile he alth technology.  The PKG™ provides 
continuous, objective, ambulatory assessment of the symptoms of PD including tremor, bradykinesia, 
and dyskinesia.  The PKG™ also provides an assessment of daytime somnolence and an indication of 
propensity for impulsive behaviors.  The PKG™ system consists of a wrist -worn movement recording 
device known as the PKG™ -Watch, proprietary algorithms, and a data -driven report known as the PKG™.  
Data are collected continuously by the PKG™ -Watch during activities of daily livin g in the home 
environment.  The PKG™ -Watch should be worn by the subject continuously except for recharging once 
a week (e.g., the night of the 7th day, every week).  The data are uploaded for processing at the time of 
recharging.
As allowed by local regul ations, subjects will receive the PKG -watch following Visit 1 (V1), after being 
received by the study site, and prior to the Monitoring Period.  The Monitoring Period can occur any 
time before V3, as long as it lasts for 6 consecutive days.  Subjects will be required to wear the 
PKG-watch (refer to the currently approved manufacturer's directions) for at least the 6 -day Monitoring 
Period during the Screening Period to at least the Week 26 Visit (V11); thereafter, wearing of the

references throughout this protocol and its appendices.  The AbbVie TA MD should be consulted if, in 
the opinion of the Investigator, there are circumstances that might interfere with t he use of the PKG 
device (e.g., religious reasons, atopic dermatitis).  A subject's inability to wear the PKG watch, due to 
logistics hindering the watch from being made available, will not preclude him/her from study 
participation.  During the 6 -day Monit oring Period, subjects should be active (engaged in usual activities 
of daily living and not sitting or resting on a couch or chair or lying in bed) for at least 30 minutes before 
taking their first oral dose.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, PROs eligible for completion at the study visits for Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 
and 39 may be conducted remotely.  In this situation, sites will read the PRO questions and response 
options to the subject and record the subject's responses.  The subject's ability to view the PRO to 
understand the questions and response options should be preserved.  Sites may share the questionnaire 
by video conference or send the questionnaires (email or hard copy) to the subjects to allow them to 
read/understand the questions and responses when the subject is providing responses over the phone.  
The date and time of PRO data collection should be recorded along with the name of the individual who 
collected the information.
3.11 Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected at the visits specified in Section 2.  The Day 1 (V3) 
samples will be collected prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951.  The last laboratory test results 
prior to initiation of the CSCI will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment for a particular test.
A certifi ed central laboratory will be used to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  
Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study.  Follow -up safety 
laboratory tests may be performed by a certified labo ratory other than the site's local laboratory.
Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples will be provided by the 
central laboratory via the laboratory manual.

b. Special laboratory tests to detect vitamin deficiencies, i.e., vitamin B 12, vitamin B 6, folic acid, homocysteine, and MMA 
levels will be performed at Screening Visit 1 (V1), on Day 1 (V3 ), and at Week 6 (V9), Week 26 (V11), and Week 52 (V13).  
An abnormal vitamin B 12level of questionable clinical significance (indeterminate or low normal results at Screening Visit 1 
[V1]), requires MMA and homocysteine laboratory assessments to be reviewed for determination of vitamin B 12deficiency 
prior to entry into the study.  If, at any time during the study, a subject displays symptoms of polyneuropathy, the 
investigator must perform this laboratory panel and any other assessment that the investigator feels is appropriate for 
further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms.
If a laboratory test value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory 
result to be clinically significant, the investigator will:
repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value;
follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution; or

case, the laboratory result will be recorded as an AE.
All laboratory abnormalities that occ ur during the study must be evaluated by the investigator to 
determine if they indicate a new disease process, an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition, 
or require further action and therefore may need to be reported as AEs.  Accordingly, for any values 
outside of the reference range, the investigator will indicate on the report if the result is clinically 
significant or not clinically significant.  If a laboratory abnormality meets criteria for a potentially 
clinically significant (PCS) labora tory value, the investigator must either report an associated AE or 
document in source the reason(s) the finding was not considered an AE.  See Appendix A.
Any laboratory value that remains abnormal at premature discontinuation/end of study and was judged 
to be clinically significant will be followed according to accepted medical standards until resolution of 
the abnormality.
Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests
A pregnant or breastfeeding female subject will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this 
study.
Pregnancy testing is not required for females of non -childbearing potential.  Determination of 
post -menopausal status will be made during the Screening Period based on the subject's history.
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at V1 and a urine pregnancy test will be performed as shown 
in Section 2for all women of childbearing potential.  The urine sample for the Day 1 (V3) urine 
pregnancy test will be collected prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951.
The serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central laboratory.  Ur ine pregnancy tests will be 
performed and analyzed at the site during the study visit if there is a scheduled visit.  If there is not a 
scheduled visit, subjects may either have a pregnancy test at the site as an unscheduled visit or at home 
with a pregnan cy test kit provided by the site.  If a urine pregnancy test is performed at home, site 
personnel will contact the subject to capture the results of any study -related pregnancy tests and record 
these results in the source records only.  If a urine pregnanc y test is positive, the results should be 
confirmed with a serum hCG test that will be performed by the central laboratory.
If the serum pregnancy test at V1 is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure.  If the result of 
the serum pregnancy tes t is borderline, it should be repeated to determine eligibility.
If the pregnancy test is:
Positive after the serum pregnancy confirmation, the subject is considered a screen failure;
Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the study;
Still borderline, the AbbVie TA MD should be consulted.

An 8 -hour fast is recommended for blood samples to be drawn for clinical chemistry.  If a subject is not 
able to fast when necessary due to unforeseen circumstances, the nonfasting status will be re corded in 
study source documentation.
Urinalysis
Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits.  Specified abnormal 
macroscopic urinalyses defined as leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than nega tive, 
or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a microscopic analysis at the central laboratory.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID -19 pandemic prevent the 
subject from having blood drawn for laboratory testing at the study site, if possible, arrange for subjects 
to have laboratory work done at a local laboratory, hospital, or other facility.  Local laboratory results 
should be o btained along with reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source documentation.  
The investigator should review local laboratory results as soon as possible.
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration may be continued provi ded the 
investigator has reviewed all prior laboratory results and confirms and discusses with the subject that 
there is no safety concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current 
labs.  The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible.
3.12 Subject Withdrawal from Study
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the end of the infusion of study drug and the 
primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation.  The informatio n will be 
recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) page; however, these procedures should 
not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator 
feels are necessary to treat the subject 's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject 
will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or 
not the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
3.13 Biomarker Sampling
Optional samples for biomarker testing will be collected at the visits specified in Section 2.  All samples 
should be labeled and shipped as outlin ed in the study -specific laboratory manual.
3.14 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
Single electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be recorded at the visits specified in Section 2after the subject has 
been supine for at least 5 minutes.  Subjects will be instructed to remain stationary (no talking, laughing, 
deep breathing, sleeping, or swallowing) for approximately 10 seconds during the ECG recording.  When 
an ECG is re corded at a time near that of a blood collection, the ECG should be obtained prior to the

the end of the visit.
Clinical study personnel will transmit ECG data to an ECG central laboratory for processing and reading 
by a qualified cardiologist (central reader) who will independently review each ECG.  The central reader 
will evaluate a single ECG lead (Lead II, with V5 or V2 [in that order] evaluated if L ead II cannot be 
evaluated).  Heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval will be measured for each 
ECG with 3 to 5 beats.  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) will be determined using Fridericia's 
correction method (QTcF).
The central reader will also provide the interpretation of the ECG (i.e., "normal" or "abnormal").  The 
central ECG laboratory will send the ECG report to the site within 3 business days.  The investigator (or 
physician designee) will review the central reader's report/assessment and document his/her review by 
signing and dating the central ECG laboratory report.  Only the central ECG laboratory's data will be 
collected into the database.  The investigator should review and reconcile if necessary his/her 
interpretation of the ECG (normal/abnormal) with the central ECG laboratory in case of relevant 
divergent assessments and reconcile as he/she determines is appropriate.
The original ECG tracing and the central reader's interpretation, each with the investigator's signature 
and date, will be retained in the subject's records at the study site as source documents.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
In the event that an ECG may not be performed due to study modifications related to the COVID -19 
pandemic, perform the 12 -lead ECG at the next earliest feasible visit or arrange to have an alternative 
acceptable local facility perform the ECG for the subje ct.
3.15 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be collected for both clino and orthostatism (supine and standing).  For clino vital signs, 
blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been supine for at least 5 minutes.  
For orthostatic vital si gns, blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been 
supine for at least 5 minutes and then, after the subject has been standing for 2 minutes.  When vital 
sign measurements are scheduled at the same time as a blood collection, vi tal sign measurements 
should be obtained prior to blood collection.
Vital signs will be measured at the visits specified in Section 2.  Orthostatic vital signs will be measured 
on Day 1 (V3), and at Week 1 (V5), Week 6 (V9), Week 26 (V11), and Week 52 (V13) (or premature 
discontinuation).  Vital signs on Day 1 (V3) will be measured after initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951 prior 
to the end of the visit.
See Appendix Bfor criteria for PCS vital sign values.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, subject visits may be conducted remotely.  In these situations, vital 
signs may be obtained by the subject as needed and recorded in the subject's source documentation.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.These data should not be recorded in EDC, as data are not obtained on calibrated devi ces and may not 
be obtained by medically trained individuals.
3.16 Height and Weight
Height and body weight will be measured at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as shown in Section 2.  Height will be 
measured at Screening Visit 1 (V1) only; weight will measured at the visits specified in Section 2.  The 
subje ct should not wear shoes during either measurement.
See Appendix Bfor criteria for PCS weight values.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, subject visits may be conducted remotely.  In these situations, height 
and weight measurements may be performed by the subject as needed and recorded in the subject's 
source documentation.  These data should not be recorded in EDC, as data are not obtained on 
calibrated devices and may not be obtained by medically trained individuals.
3.17 Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening Visit 1 (V1), on Day 1 (V3 ), and at 
Week 6 (V9), Week 26 (V11), and Week 52 (V13) as shown in Section 2.  The physical examination 
performed at Screening Visit 1 (V1) will serve as the baseline physical examination for clinical 
assessment.  A symptom -directed physical examination will be performed at each following visit when 
necessary.  Any significant physical examination findings after dosing will be recorded as AEs .
3.18 Neurological Examination
A neurological examination will be performed at the visits shown in Section 2.  Neurological findings 
beyond those rela ted to PD should be reported in the eCRF.  The neurological examination performed at 
Screening Visit 1 (V1) will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.  Any significant neurological 
findings after dosing will be recorded as AEs.
The neurological ex amination will consist of the following:
Mental status –assessment of orientation, speech, and memory.
Cranial nerves –assessment of cranial nerves II –XII, including a funduscopic examination.
Motor system –assessment of tone and strength .
Sensory sys tem –brief survey for light touch and temperature.
Reflexes –assessment of deep tendon reflexes and plantar responses (Babinski sign).
Coordination –assessment of upper and lower extremities.
Gait and station .

AbbVie pers onnel, or its delegate, will train the site how to calculate each subject's LED, to program the 
pump to administer the continuous dose and to titrate the dose for each subject as needed.  In addition, 
the site will be trained to prepare the drug delivery system by (i) loading the study drug into the syringe, 
(ii) placing it into the pump, (iii) attaching the infusion set to the subject and syringe, (iv) priming the 
syringe and infusion set, and (v) operating the pump.  Clinical study personnel will receive the ABBV -951 
System User Manual and the ABBV -951 System Programming Guide.
Subjects will receive training on the drug delivery system (e.g., pump, infusion set, syringe, vial, and vial 
adapter) at the visits specified in Section 2.  Training on Day 1 (V3) will occur prior to initiation of the 
CSCI of ABBV- 951.  In addition to training, subjects will receive training materials for reference.
Subjects m ay be trained at Screening Visit 2 (V2) by site staff or nurses contracted by the sponsor on use 
of the drug delivery system.  These nurses must be trained on how to use the drug delivery system prior 
to training study subjects.  In addition, subjects may receive in -home visits from nurses to provide 
additional training and support with the drug delivery system.  During these in -home visits, the home 
health care nurse may ask questions about any problems or concerns the subject is having using the 
drug deli very system.  The home health care nurse will record the subject's answers and provide these 
to the study site for review.
3.20 Drug Delivery System Dispensing and Return
Study drug is intended to be dispensed to subjects every 2 weeks during the Treatment Per iod with or 
without a clinic visit being completed.  The drug delivery system, including tubing and other accessories 
will be dispensed as needed.
Additionally, a subject (or authorized representatives, if allowed per local regulations) may return to the 
clinic site for additional study drug or drug delivery system components or accessories.
For eligible subjects at participating sites, and as allowed by local regulations, the study drug, its delivery 
system and accessories may be directly delivered to the subject's preferred address by a third party 
vendor contracted by the sponsor.
4SAFETY MANUAL
4.1 Methods and Timing of Safety Assessment
All serious and nonserious AEs that could be related to study procedures will be collected from the time 
the subject signs the study -specific informed consent until the start of study drug infusion.  From the 
start of study drug infusion until 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment, all AEs and SAEs will 
be collected whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  After 30 days following 
completion of study treatment, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will 
not be collected).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.If a subject has a confirmed or susp ected COVID -19 infection and study drug was interrupted, the 
investigator should contact the sponsor emergency medical contact listed above before reintroducing 
study drug.
4.3 Product Complaint Reporting
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVie 
within 24 hours day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
All follow -up information is to be reported to the spo nsor (or an authorized representative) and 
documented in source as required by the sponsor.  Product complaints associated with AEs will be 
reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product complaints may r equire return of the product with the alleged complaint condition (infusion 
pump, infusion set, etc.).  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the 
investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If returns cannot be ac commodated within 30 days, 
the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to investigate and 
determine if any corrective actions are required ( refer to Protocol Section 6.1, Complaints and Adverse 
Events for details).
5COUNTRY- SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
5.1 Sample Retention Requirements
AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the optional biomarker samples in a 
secure storage space w ith adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained 
while research on ABBV -951 (or drugs of this class) or PD and related conditions continues, but for no 
longer than 20 years after study completion or according to local require ments.
5.2 SUSAR Reporting
AbbVie will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) reporting for 
the IMP in accordance with global and local guidelines and Appendix A of the Investigator Brochure will 
serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI).  The RSI in effect at the start of a Development Safety 
Update Report reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting period.  For follow -up reports, the 
RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the "suspected" Serious Adverse Reaction will be used to assess 
expectedness.

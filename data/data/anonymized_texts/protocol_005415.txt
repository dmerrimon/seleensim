  EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:    
 
 
STUDY DE SIGN  
 
This is a mu lti-center, Phase 1/1b clinical trial that will be conducted to define the MTD, RP2D 
and safety and tolerability of the combination of AT13887 and olaparib in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study will begin with an explorat ion of the dose and 
regimen of the combination of these 2 novel agents. As viable regimens are identified, an expansion cohort of patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal or triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients will  be enr olled with one of the schedules, for 
confirmation of safety, PK and PD. This cohort will include patients with BRCA -wildtype 
TNBC or patients with platinum resistant epithelial ovarian or fallopian or primary peritoneal cancers. A total of 40 patien ts is expected to be enrolled; approximately 20 in the exploration 
cohort and an additional 20 in the expansion cohort.  In mouse xenograft models, continuous daily administration of olaparib yielded greater 
antitumor activity than intermittent administrat ion at the same or  at higher dose levels so it is 
recommended that olaparib  is administered continuously. Therefore, in this trial we propose that 
olaparib will b e dosed orally continuously twice daily. 
 Regarding AT13387, the optimal schedule for HSP90 in hibitio n is unclea r. However, our 
tolerability and efficacy studies with  olaparib and AT13387 in ovarian PDX models, support 
twice weekly dosing of AT13387 (on Days 1 and 2 every week, i.e. 2 days  on/5 days off). The 
twice weekly (Days 1 and 2) of AT13387 was also chosen ba sed on previous experience by Dr 
Shapiro with another HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib (STA -9090)
1. Therefore , the proposed regimen 
will be olaparib  twice  daily for 28 consecutive days  and AT13387 on Days 1 and  2 every week, 
3 weeks of a 4 week (28 day) cycle (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16).  Cycle 0 is only 7 days and Cycle 1 begins 8 days after start of Cycle 0, i.e. immediately after 
Cycle 0 ends. During cycle 0, olaparib will be administered alone twice  daily for 1 week (D1 -7).  
Cycle 1 and beyond, olaparib  will continue to be administered twice  daily  (days 1-28) and 
AT13387 will be administered for 2 consecutive days on 3 of a 4 week  cycle. Given that our 
hypothesis is that AT13387 sensitizes to olaparib  by inhibi ting HR, by  administering olaparib  
alone for  cycle 0 only, we can test  the hypothesis as a “proof of mechanism” for the combination 
of AT13387 and olaparib . Specifically, we expect that there will be induction of BRCA1 and 
RAD51 foci after administr ation of olaparib  alone and reduced formation of these foci and 
downregulation of expression of HR pathway genes after the combination of AT13387 and olaparib.  A standard 3+3 design will be utilized. Doses of olaparib will range from 50mg–300 mg twice daily; AT1 3387 doses will range from 20 –160 mg/m2 (20 -40-80-120- 160) using a ping-pong

5 strategy  as shown in the Table below . DLT events will be based on adverse events during cycles 
0 and 1, utilizing CTCAE v.5.0. 
 There will be no stratification factors for the phase I of th is study. We anticipate that between 2 -3 
patients will be enrolled per month  to this study. If the RP2D is at the highest dose level, we 
would expect a sample size of approximately 40 subjects. Therefore, recruitment for the current 
study will b e done in a pproximately 12- 18 months. The schedule will facilitate the assessment of 
olaparib PK (C
max, Tmax AUC, t 1/2) and PD in the absence and presence of AT13387. 
  The following escalation scheme will be followed (one cycle is  28 days): 
DOSE LE VEL olaparib (tablets, oral, 
twice daily dosing 
continuous) AT13387 (IV two consecutive days weekly)  
-4 50mg BID 10mg/m2 
-3 100mg BID 10mg/m2  
-2* 50mg BID 20mg/m2

3*** 300mg BID 80mg/m2 
4 300mg BID 120mg/m2 
5 300mg BID 160mg/m2 
 
     *If dose level -2 is tole rated, then escalation of AT13387 in combination with olaparib 50mg 
BID will be attempted i.e.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 1.1 Primary Objectives  
 To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTDs) of olap arib and AT13387 administered in 
combination in patients with  advanced solid tumors.  
 1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 To identify the dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with olaparib and 
AT13387 administered in combination as assessed by CT CAE v 5.0. 
 To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of the combination of olaparib and AT13387.   To determine the plasma ph armacokinetics of olaparib and AT13387. 
 To document anti- tumor activity of the combination of olaparib and AT13387 as assessed by 
RECIST 1.1 and progression free survival (PFS). Although the clinical benefit of [ this/these ] 
drug(s) has not yet been establ ished, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible 
therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient will be car efully monitored for tumor response and 
symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.  
 1.3 Exploratory Objectives 
   2. BACKGROUND  
 2.1 Study Diseas es 
 2.1.1 Ovarian Cancer  
 
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies, with an esti mated 
22,000 new cases and 15,000 deaths in the United States per year
28.  Patients initially are 
diagnosed during exploratory laparotomy, during which time surgical staging is performed and gross disease is debulked.  Over 70% of patients present with advanced disease, with spread of disease to the upper abdomen (Stage III) or more widely metastatic disease such as malign ant 
pleural effusions or liver/splenic intraparenchymal lesions (Stage IV).  Post- operative adjuvant 
chemother apy is indicated for all patients with advanced disease, and options include 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel or intrave nous chemotherapy with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel.  In over 70% of cases, platinum and taxane-based com binatio n 
therapy results in a clinical complete remission, typically defined as having no evidence of residual tumor, based on a normal serum CA-125 level, normal exam, and normal radiographic study such as a CT scan.  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
10  
Unfortunately, despite achieving init ial remission, the majority of patients will develop a relapse 
of their cancer and eventually die of disease due to the persistence of chemoresistant and  
platinum- resistant cancer cells.  Despite aggressive surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, 
the cha nce of achieving long- term disease- free survival for subjects with stage III and stage IV 
disease is only approximat ely 25% and <10%, respectively29.  Other less common Mullerian 
tumors such as primary peritoneal serous cancers and fallopian tube cancers have similar clinical courses and behavior.  Thus, it is these 3 types of gynecologic cancers into one entity for the purpose of treatment and clinical investigation.   Relapse in advanced ovarian cancer is generally incurable, and the goal of treatment changes to palliation.  The treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer with conventional cytotoxic agents is limited by the development of chemoresistance as well as intolerable side effects.    2.1.2
 Triple -Negative Breast Cancer  
 There is an  estimated 180,510 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the United States per 
year, and approximately 41,910 deaths attributed to t his cancer
30.  Up to 20% of breast cancers 
are negative for expression of all three receptors and cons titute the subtype TNBC.  
 C
hemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment for women with TNBC, but the current 
standard of care is inadequate.   D espite treatment with chemotherapy, TNBC is associated with 
poorer outcomes compared to other breast cancer su btypes. TNBC has an aggressive clinical 
course, marked by higher rates of visceral and central nervous system metastases and worse survival compared to hormone receptor-positive subtypes
31. 
 Approximately 70% of breast cancers in  individuals carrying a germline BRCA1  mutation are 
TNBC; BRCA1 -associated and sporadic TNBCs share many histopathologic features.  These 
cancers are frequently high grade, have fre quent p53 mutations, and are typically basal-like by 
hierarchical clustering of transcriptional profiles with these cancers sharing a pattern of g enomic 
instability characterized by allelic loss32-33. 
 Drugs such as cisp latin h ave demonstrated activity in TNBC.   A recently published neoadjuvant 
cisplatin study in TNBC using 4 cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 every 21 days showed efficacy
34.  These similarities have led to speculation that BRCA1 -associated and at least a 
subset of sporadic TNBCs may share defects in a BRCA1 -associated pathway as do HGSC  (high 
grade serous cancer), hence the reaso n for both cancer subtypes to be included in this protocol 
with observed similarities between TNBC and HGSC bo th clinically as well as from a genetic 
standpoint35.   
 2.2 CTEP IND Agent s 
 2.2.1 P
ARP inhibitor olaparib  
 
Olaparib is a potent and well -tolerated oral inhibitor of polyadenosine 5’-diphosphoribose [poly-
(ADP -ribose)] polymerization (PAR P)-1 and PARP2.  Olaparib is an active monotherapy in 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
11 tumors with defective components of homologous recombination repair (HRR), which includes 
those with BRCA1/2 mutations. A first- in-man phase 1 dose escalation trial of single agent 
olaparib in a patient  cohort enriched for patients with BRCA germline mutations indicated 
substantial PARP inhibition in surrogate tissues and anti- tumor activity in 4 0% of ovarian cancer 
patients with germline BRCA mutations,  using combined RECIST  and GCIG CA-125 crite ria 2-4. 
 Mechanism of Action  
Preclinically, olaparib displays antitumor activity against a variety of tumor cel l lines and this 
sensitivity of the cells is believed to depend upon components of a defective HRR capability (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). As a major example of this selective activity, both BRCA1 - and 2- deficient ( -/-) tumors are sensitive to  PARP inhibition. Early studies indicated 
that PARP inhibition in BRCA1/2 homozygous null cells, but not the i sogenic BRCA 
heterozygous cells, led to cell death. BRCA1 and 2 are proteins necessary for proper function of HRR, the high fidelity repair system  that addresses DNA  double- strand breaks (DSBs). The 
backup repair system to HRR is base-excision repair (BER) , which requires PARP function and 
primarily addresses single-strand breaks (SSBs). However, the system works both ways in that repair of SSBs in BER can lead to  stalled replication forks that strain the system and cause 
double strand breaks, result ing in a situation that requires intact HRR and BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
Thus, HRR dysfunction sensitizes cells to PARP inhibition leading to further chromosomal 
instability, cell cycle  arrest and apoptosis 
2. This sensitivi ty is s uggested to result in a large 
therapeutic window for PARP inhibition in mutation carriers. Pre -clinical studies support  
these findings showing tha t other BRCA mutant, but not wild -type, human cell lines are  
highly sensitive to olaparib5. 
 Nonclinical Pharmacology and Efficacy 
Olaparib has demonstrated cellular activity in the low nM range with a cellular dose  for 
50% inhibition (IC50) of 2 nM in HeLa cells (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). 
The effectiv e concentration for inhibiting cellular PARP activity in cancer cells by >90% 
is approximately 30 nM to 100 nM olaparib in several tumor cell lines inclu ding ovarian 
A2780, breast MCF-7, and colorectal SW620. These concentrations lead to significant ablati on of P ARP activity (based on the inhibition of PAR formation), with maximal  
PARP -1 inhibition occurring at around 100 nM. Consistent with this, maximal 
potentiation of an appropriate DNA SSB-inducing chemotoxic agent (MMS) was also seen in vitro at 100 nM , which equates to 43.4 ng/mL. 
 An analysis of the correlation of olaparib response with several standard -of-care (SOC)  
chemotherapies in a panel of breast cancer cell lines has demonstrated a strong  
correlation with both carboplatin (0.84, p=0.0006) and c amptoth ecin (0.8, p=0.0018) 
(Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). This is consistent with what is known about the types of DNA damage they induce (in tra-strand and inter-strand cross- links for  
platinum and trapped topoisomerases- DNA adducts for camptothecins, both of which 
result in DNA DSB formation in replicating cells) and the DDR pathways that deal with  
them (primarily HRR in cells undergoing DNA replication). The same does not hold for a mechanistically unrelated chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel ( -0.11) w hose mechanism  
of action is unrelated to the induction of DNA damage.

Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
12 The analysis of olaparib and platinum response was extended to additional t umor  
indications where platinum treatment is SOC and included ovarian, non- small cell lung  
cancer (NSCL C) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (Olaparib  
Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). Consistent with the breast cancer cell line data, the 
strong correlation between platinum response and olaparib response was observed. These in vitro data have been extended further into in vivo patient- derived tumor explant (PTX) 
models of both breast and NSCLC and again the correlation is seen between platinum sensitivity and olaparib sensitivity.  In vitro combination studies demonstrate that olaparib is able to potentiate the  
cytotoxicity of DNA -damaging agents, including the monomethylating agent 
temozolomide (melanoma, glioblastoma, colorectal), topoisome rase-1 inhibitors such as 
camptothecin, irinotecan, and topotecan (ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal), and plati numbased  
agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin (breast) (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure,  
2013). Studies with BRCA1- deficient orthotopically -transplanted in vivo mouse 
mammary tumor models showed that, in addition to single agent activity of olaparib, sequential treatment of mice with olaparib following a single dose of platinum agent increased the time to progression on treatment and extended O S. These data support the 
idea that olaparib can extend the antitumor effect of platinum agents when gi ven as a 
maintenance treatment.  
 Following single oral doses, absorption was rapid (maximum plasma concentration [Cmax] <2 hours in mice, rats and dogs) while bioavailability was <60% in male and female mice, <20% in male and female rats and ~79% in male dogs (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). Low oral bioavailability in rat may have been due to poor absorption or rapid 
first pass metabolism. Distribution of olaparib is in the gastrointestinal tract and in tissues 
associated with th e metabolism and eliminat ion of foreign compounds. Further investigations are 
still ongoing. Excretion is primarily via the feces and, to a lesser extent, the urine.  
Inves tigations in human in vitro systems indicated metabolism of olaparib was CYP  mediated 
and that CYP3A4 and 3A5 were the dominant metabolic enzymes (Olaparib  Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2013). Similar studies indicated flavin mono-oxygenase- 3 was not able to me tabolize 
olaparib. In in-vitro direct inhibition assays, olaparib (100 μM) had only limited effect against 
CYP3A (up to 46% inhi bition) and less effect against other CYPs tested. In time dependent 
inhibition assays, olaparib had only very minor effects against CYP3A and no effect against 
other CYPs. Clinically significant dir ect inhibition of intestinal CYP3A is possible but 
significant effects against hepatic CYP3A  are less likely. The CYP induction potential of 
olaparib was investigated in cultures of human hepatocytes. At the highest olaparib concentration (30 mcM), minor induction of CYP2B6 activity was observed (<40% positive control) and smaller effects on CYPs 2C9 and 2C19 activities were noted. These changes were unlikely to be of clinical significance. A small decrease in CYP3A activity was noted, which may suggest tim e 
dependent inhibition, however, this was not explored further.  In studies using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK) II cells transfected with multidrug 
resistance 1 (MDR1; Pgp), BCRP or MRP-2 drug efflux transporters, olaparib was shown to be a substrate of MDR1 but not BCRP or MRP -2 (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). In the 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
13 same systems, olaparib was an inhibitor of BCRP and MRP-2 but had little or no inhibitory 
effect on MDR1.  In isolated human hepatocytes, olaparib was a substrate for organic anio n transport 
proteins. In the same system, olaparib was shown to be an organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) inhibitor (IC50 11.9 μM) (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). In HEK -293 
cells transfected with OATP1B1, olaparib functioned as an inhibitor and IC50 values of  
20.3 mcM and 27.1 mcM were derived (substrate dependent). Using the criteria defined in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines on the investigations of drug interactions (EMA 2013), it is possible olaparib may precipitate an interaction via hepatic drug uptake transporters, particularly OCT1.  
 SimCYP population PK simulations of the separate effect of co -administration of  
itraconazole and rifampicin (clinically relevant CYP3A inhibitor and inducer,  
respectively) on olaparib PK in huma ns, when administered at the recommended human 
dose, were performed (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). The itraconazole (200 mg twice daily [BID] x 7 days) simulation indicated olaparib (400 mg bd x 7 days) steady state Cmax and area under the conce ntration -time curve (AUC) would increase by 2.8 and 
3.5 fold, respectively. The rifampicin simulation (600 mg x 6 days) indicated olaparib (400 mg BID x 6 days) steady state Cmax and AUC in the presence of rifampicin would be reduced to 33% and 29%, respectively, of the values in the absence of rifampicin.  Nonclinical Toxicology  
Olaparib has been tested in dogs and rats (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). There were no noted effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory parameters of an  
anesthesized d og or any behavioral, autonomic, or motor effects in the rat. Toxicology 
studies indicate that the target organ of toxicity is the bone marrow. Ex vivo  work has 
confirmed that olaparib is also active against human marrow. The cytotoxic effect  
becomes evident at a higher concentration than required to fully ablate PARP activity.  
28-day dog and rat studies demonstrate a reversible myelotoxic effect that is mild to  
moderate. Platelets are first affected, followed by white blood cells. In 26 -week repeatdose 
studies in rats, doses were well -tolerated in male rats, with hematological effects  
and increased spleen weights observed at all dosages. In female rats, doses of 15 mg/kg/day resulted in significant reduction in body weight. Hematological effects and increased spleen weights were again observed at all dosages. The difference between  
sexes was considered to be due to the fact that females had greater plasma exposure  
levels than males. In 26- week repeat -dose studies in dogs, olaparib was well- tolerated.  
Hematological changes were observed, characterized by pancytopenia.  
 Clinical Pharmacology  
Olaparib is rapidly absorbed following capsule oral dosing in cancer patients (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). Mean volume of distribution was 40.3 L, mean plasma clearance was 4.55 L/h, and the estimated terminal half -life (t1/2) was between 5 and 12  
hours. Exposure increased proportionally with dose at doses up to 100 mg but increased in a less than proportional fashion at higher doses. On multiple dosing, there w as no  
evidence of time dependency of the PK and no marked accumulation. There was no 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
14 evidence of ethnic difference in olaparib PK between Japanese and Caucasian patients.  
Recovery of administered radiolabelled olaparib dose was >94% in four patients and  
approximately 60% in a further two with the lower recoveries apparently due to slower 
fecal excretion of dosed material by these two patients. Drug- related material was  
eliminated in the urine (35-50%) and in the feces (12- 60%) with 6-20% of the dosed 
material recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. Plasma concentrations of olaparib 
were similar to those of total radioactivity up to 6 or 8 hours after dosing but the profiles diverged thereafter indicating the presence of circulating metabolites. Metabolite  
identification in plasma and the excreta is ongoing. Studies of the relative single -dose bioavailability of capsule vs. tablet formulations 
showed that at the two lower tablet doses, the Cmax with the tablet formulation tended to  
be slightly higher and the AUC was similar (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  
However, at the highest tablet dose (250 mg), the exposure delivered by the tablet formulation (both Cmax and AUC) was higher than that delivered by the 400 mg capsule. The tablet and the capsule f ormulations cannot therefore be considered to be 
bioequivalent. Further details regarding PK comparisons between the capsule and tablet formulations may be found in the 2013 Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure.  Clinical Efficacy  
The first clinical study in man of olaparib (KU -36-92) was a dose- escalation study in  
patients with advanced solid tumors (Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2013). Preliminary data demonstrated that olaparib is generally well -tolerated at doses up to and 
including the MTD of 400 mg BI D in patients with various solid tumors. As of October  
2, 2013, approximately 2103 patients with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, melanoma, and other advanced solid tumors have received olaparib, either as monotherapy or in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents. AEs considered to be associated with  
olaparib included anemia (mild to moderate), neutropenia (mild to moderate), and 
thrombocytopenia (generally mild to moderate, sometimes severe), nausea and vomiting  
(mild to moderate), and fatigue (mild to mode rate).  
Olaparib has also been studied in an expansion phase in BRCA- deficient ovarian cancer  
at a dose of 200 mg BID. Fifty patients were treated, including 48 with BRCA- deficient 
germline mutations and two patients of unknown status or significance. Twenty (40%) patients achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST and/or  
GCIG- CA125 criteria. An additional three patients experienced stable disease (SD) for  
more than four cycles 
4. A multicenter  phase 2 study enrolled two sequential cohorts of women 
with known germline BRCA2 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent advanced ovarian cancer to receive olaparib continuously at a dose of 400 mg BID (Cohort 1) or 100 mg BID (Cohort 2) 
6. 
Responses were observed in 33% (11 of 33) patients enrolled in the 400mg BID cohort and 13% (3 of 24) patients enrolled in the 100 mg BID cohort. A phase 2 study of olaparib in advanced serous ovarian cancer and triple- negative breast c ancer included a cohort of 46 ovarian 
cancer patients who were known not to carry a germline BRCA mutation, in which an overall response rate (ORR ) of 23.9% was observed 
7. 
Additional studies of olaparib as monotherapy or in combination with a platinum reagent for treatment of metastatic BRCA -deficient ovarian cancer are ongoing. Results from a 
phase 2 trial investigating olaparib as maintenance therapy following platinum- based  
therapy for platinum -sensitive serous o varian cancer demonstrated a significant  
NCI Protocol #: 10031

15 progression-free survival (PFS) benefit (8.4 vs. 4.8 months, P<0.001), with subgroup 
analyses demonstrating evidence of ben efit regardless of BRCA status 8, 9. Additional pha se 1 
and 2 trials in both BRCA- defic ient and BRCA-competent ovarian cancer are currently ongoing. 
Olaparib was granted accelerated approved by the FDA in the United States as  
monotherapy in women with advanced ovarian cancer associated with germline BRCA mutation in the companion diagnostic test BRACAnalysis CDx and who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy for ovarian cancer on December 19, 2014.  2.2.2 H
SP90 inhibitor AT13387 
 Mechanism of Action: AT13387 (onalespib ) is a synthetic non- ansamycin small  molecule that 
acts as an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90, which regulates the folding, 
stability and degradation of many oncogenic signaling proteins, is upregulated in a variety of tumor cells. HSP90 inhibitors are thought to affect multiple aberrant signaling pathways and may therefore be of clinical benefit in the treatment of a wide range of cancers.  
 Pharmacodynamic Properties:  AT13387 (onalespib ) exhibited high affinity for the ATP 
binding site at the N-terminal domain of HSP90, and was a potent inhibitor of the growth and survival of a variety of tumor cell lines. AT13387 (onalespib ) caused degradation of multiple 
HSP90 client proteins, key regulators of cell proliferation and survival. In cancer xenograft models in nude or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]- sensitive or -resistant non- small -cell lung cancer [NSCLC] driven by mutated epidermal 
growth factor receptor [EGFR] or translocated anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]; vemurafenib -sensit ive and - resistant B isoform of RAF kinase [BRAF] mutant melanoma), 
AT13387 ( onalespib ) inhibited tumor growth and was best tolerated weekly or twice weekly. In 
upfront combination with kinase inhibitors, AT13387 (onalespib) was able to delay the emergence of resistance in melanoma and NSCLC xenograft models. AT13387 (onalespib ) 
caused prolonged knockdown of HSP90 client proteins in cells and tumors with a half- life of 38 -
75 hours in tumor xenografts in mice, suggesting a potential for prolonged effect afte r a single 
dose.  Pharmacokinetics (PK): After intravenous (IV) administration to mice, rats, and dogs and intraperitoneal (IP) administration to mice,  AT13387 (onalespib) displayed a short plasma half -
life in mice and rats (1 -3 hours) and a moderate half-life in dogs  (11 hours) despite high plasma 
clearance. Volume of distribution was greater than total body water indicating  distribution of 
AT13387 ( onalespib ) into tissues. PK studies demonstrated that AT13387 ( onalespib ) is highly 
distributed into xenogra ft tumors and is cleared slowly from tumors. The in vitro intrinsic 
clearance of AT13387 ( onalespib ) determined in isolated intact hepatocytes was high across all 
the species tested (mouse, rat, dog and human; scaled values ranged from 35 mL/min/kg in 
human to 184 mL/min/kg in rat).  Binding of AT13387 (onalespib) to plasma proteins was 
moderate and comparable across all species tested, ranging from  77.2% in dog plasma to 90.1% 
in mouse plasma.  Blood:plasma distribution in mouse, rat, dog and human whole blood ranged 
from 0.8, indicating approximately equal distribution between the plasma and cellular fraction, to 5.0, showing that AT13387 (onalespib)  favored partitioning into the red blood cells, depending 
on concentration and species.  The potential for AT13 387 ( onalespib ) to inhibit cytochromes 
P450 (CYP) 1A2, 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, and 2C19 was assessed, and results indicated a concentration

Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
16 giving half- maximal inhibition (IC50) >10μM, suggesting a low potential for clinically 
significant drug -drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. AT13387 (onalespib ) is a 
substrate for P -gp, a modest inhibitor of BCRP and P-gp, and strong inhibitor of MATE1 and 
MATE2 -K. Glucuronidation, sulphation and N- oxidation appear to be routes of metabolism for 
AT13387 ( onalespib ) based  on in vitro studies of cryopreserved hepatocytes as well as 
metabolites detected in samples in vivo. In a radiolabeled mass balance study in dogs, a mean 
maximum measured concentration (Cmax) of 793 ng-Eq/g occurred at the end of infusion. Area under the curve concentration -time curve from time 0 to the last data point (AUC0 -t) values were 
5924 hr•ng-Eq/g and 7590 hr•ng- Eq/g for male and female dogs, respectively, with half life 
(t1/2) values of 21.3 and 20.5 hour, respectively. The majority (~83% in the male and ~72% in the female) of [14C] AT13387 (onalespib)- derived radioactivity was excreted via feces, with less 
found in urine (~15% in the male and ~22% in the female).  
 Non clinical safety: No adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects were observed i n the rat 
with AT13387 ( onalespib ) doses up to 200 mg/kg in males and 125 mg/kg in females, compared 
with control vehicle -treated animals.  In a cardiovascular and respiratory (CV/R) safety study in 
Beagle dogs, a dose- related increase in heart rate was observed at 4 mg/kg and above, from 10 
minutes after the start of infusion, which peaked at the end of infusion and returned to control levels by approximately 5 hours after the end of infusion. The increased heart rate  observed at 15 
mg/kg was associated with a concomitant decrease in blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and  
mean arterial). AT13387 (onalespib ) had no significant effect on QT interval or QTc at any dose 
level tested.   
The toxicity profile of AT13387 ( onalespib ) was evaluated in rats and dogs. Infusion- site 
reactions were observed in both species, including local irritation/inflammation.  While clinical 
pathology changes suggestive of adverse effects in the bone marrow, kidney, and liver were  
observed for both species, histopathologic changes were only seen in dogs and included testes, gallbladder,  bone marrow (sternum), kidneys, and thymus. The overall effects observed in 
surviving rats and dogs were  transient and reversible, with the exception of the testicular lesions 
observed in dogs at high doses, for which  the recovery period of 14 days was not sufficient.  
In the definitive 1 -cycle rat study, no unambiguous target organs of toxicity were identified and 
the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) was estimated to be 50 mg/kg/dose given twice 
per week for 3 weeks (2QW×3). A dose severely toxic to 10% of rodents (STD10) could not be confidently determined in rats, although safety was established in this species. Dosing for 3 cycles in rats using the 2QW×3 regimen (for 3 of 4 weeks per cycle) resu lted in systemic 
inflammation secondary to local irritation at the infusion site, which led to mortalities beyond the first cycle and early termination of higher dose groups. A less aggressive, once- weekly (current 
clinical regimen for study AT13387 -05) infusion study in rats is ongoing. In dogs dosed via a 
peripheral vein for 1 cycle, a clear dose -effect relationship was established for AT13387 
(onalespib ). Histopathology in dogs revealed changes in the bone marrow, thymus, testes, 
gallbladder and kidney at 3, 10/7, and 12.5/10/7 mg/kg. The nominal highest non- severely toxic 
dose (HNSTD) was 3 mg/kg/dose given 2QW×3 over 1 or 3 cycles, and the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/dose on the same schedule for 1 cycle and 0.5 mg/kg over 3 cycles.  Clinical Studies:  
 AT13387 (onalespib ) is administered by IV infusion over 1 hour.

 Number of s ubjects treated with AT13387 (onalespib) for the purpose of safety reporting in 
various clinical trials include 275 subjects:  
i) Six subjects died within 30 days of receiving treatment with AT13387 ( onalespib ) 
in Astex trials from causes not attributed to progression of disease. The causes of all deaths were considered to be not related to treatment. ii) For Astex -sponsored studies, the most common serious adverse events (SAEs) by 
System Organ Class (SOC; subjects counted once per SOC), regardless of relationship, through the cut-off date of 30 December 2014, were categorized under Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders (23/237; 10%); Gastrointestinal Disorders (17/237; 7%); and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (12/237; 5%). Individual event terms reported for >3 subjects were 8/237 (3.4%) for dyspnea (6 resolved, 1 decreased in severity, and 1 not resolved); 6/237 (2.5%) for diarrhea (5 resolved and 1 not resolved); 5/237 (2.1%) each for dehydration (4 resolved and 1 resolved wi th sequelae) and pulmonary embolism (4 resolved and 1 
not resolved); and 4/237 (1.7%) each for back pain (all resolved), muscular weakness (1 resolved, 1 decreased in severity, and 2 not resolved), and pneumonia (2 resolved and 2 fatal). For Studies AT13387-01, -02, -04, and -05, the most common individual events (occurring in ≥25.0% of subjects) were diarrhea (70.5%), fatigue (51.5%), nausea (48.9%), decreased appetite (35.4%), and vomiting (32.9%). Most AEs were reported as Grade 1 or 2. The most common r elated AEs (occurring in ≥25.0% of 
subjects) across all studies were diarrhea (65.0%), nausea (41.8%), and fatigue (40.9%). Most related AEs were reported as Grade 1 or 2. Related Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported for ≥2.0% subjects were diarrhea (10.5%), fatigue (3.8%), and anemia 
(3.4%). 
 The PK of AT13387 ( onalespib ) showed dose- dependent increase in AUC0 -t and Cmax from 10 
to 310 mg/m2/dose with relatively low inter-individual variability. Elimination half- life (t1/2 el) 
was dose-independent with mean cohort values ranging from 6.6 to 11.5 hours. Maximum t1/2 
observed was 14 hours. There was no notable accumulation or reduction in exposures between Day 1 and Day 18 (twice weekly) or Day 1 and Day 15 (once weekly) of Cycle 1. The AT13387 (onalespib ) PK profile an d exposures were similar across several studies, whether as a single 
agent (AT13387-01) or in combination with imatinib (AT13387- 02), abiraterone acetate 
(AT13387-04), or crizotinib (AT13387-05), at comparable dose levels, indicating no potential for inter actions affecting AT13387 ( onalespib ) PK by these agents. Plasma increases in HSP70 
were detected at all dose levels in Study AT13387-01. HSP70 induction is a pharmacodynamic marker of target engagement, but has not been demonstrated to be predictive of cl inical response.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
18 Dedicated drug -drug interaction studies have not been conducted. However, olanespib PK does 
not appear to be affected when coadministered with imatinib (AT13387-02), abiraterone acetate 
(AT13387-04), or crizotinib (AT13387-05).  Olanespib did not affect the PK of crizotinib.  
 In terms of efficacy, in Study AT13387-01 (monotherapy), the best response to treatment was 1 partial response (PR) in a subject with GIST and stable disease persisting for ≥6 months in 4 subjects (2 with GIST, 1 with  adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right parotid, 1 with metastatic 
uveal melanoma). In Study AT13387- 02 (coadministration with imatinib) in GIST subjects, 
disease control at 4 months occurred in 5 (19.2%) subjects. In ongoing Study AT13387-05 (coadministration with crizotinib) in NSCLC subjects,  4 PRs have been reported during the dose-
escalation part of the study (Part A).  
 Overall, risks and common AEs in clinical studies include:  
• Gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation), which are mostly Grade 1 to 2 and manageable with medications. • Local infusion -related irritation occurring during the infusion or systemic infusion 
reactions occurring during the infusion or shortly afterwards. Systemic reactions are reversible and often characterized  by flushing, itching, rigors, chills, nausea, 
tachycardia/ bradycardia, alterations in blood pressure, and dizziness. Incidence increases at higher doses.  
• Visual impairment including peripheral flashes (photopsia), blurred or double vision, floaters, color distortion and dimness, difficulties with light/dark accommodation, tunnel vision or other field defects, halos, apparent movement of stationary objects, and complex disturbances. Symptoms are generally Grade 1, 
intermittent, reversible, and transient,  lasting a few seconds to  a few minutes and 
occurring on 1- 3 days/cycle.  
• Other common toxicities include fatigue, decreased appetite, dizziness, anemia, headache, muscle spasms,  insomnia, chills, dehydration, and hyperhidrosis. 
• Renal AEs were reported in combination with imatinib. • Electrocardographic (ECG) analysis of AT13387 (onalespib) as monotherapy could not exclude a smal l effect on cardiac repolarization (QTcF duration), <10 ms, which 
is not likely to be clinically re levant. Dose -related changes in heart rate and in QTc 
were reported in combination with imatinib.  
 2.3 Rationale 
 PARP -i
nhibitors as anticancer agents:  PARP -inhibitors (PARPis) have demonstrated single 
agent activity in homologous recombination (HR)- deficient tumors 2-4, 6, 10, 11.  Of these drugs, 
olaparib has been the most widely studied thus far, associated with an objective response rate (ORR) of 28% -33% and a median duration of response of 28-41 weeks in BRCA1 or 2-mutated, 
recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. PARPis have also demonstrated activity in BRCA1-mutated triple negative breast cancers 
7, 12. In addition, an association between response to olaparib and 
platinum sensitivity has been observed, and in BRCA1/2 -mutated epithelial ovarian cancer the 
olaparib clinical benefit response decreases from 69.2% in platinum -sensitive disease, to 45.8% 
in platinum- resistant disease, to 23.1% in platinum- refractory disease 4.  Olaparib has also 
demonstrated objective response rate (ORR) in 24% of non- BRCA1/2 -mutated ovarian cancer; 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
19 (50% among platinum sensitive but only 4% among platinum resistant non-BRCA1/2 ovarian 
cancers)7. This activity is thought to be related to the presence of defective homologous 
recombination (HR) in these tumors which may occur in the absence of germline BRCA1/2 muta tions. For example in ovarian cancer, defective HR may result from genetic and epigenetic 
alterations involving members of the HR DNA- repair pathway, i.e. somatic BRCA1/2 muta tions, 
hypermethylation of BRCA1 or RAD51C, amplifi cation or mutation of EMSY, focal deletion or 
mutation of PTEN, mutation of ATM or ATR, and mutation of Fanconi anemi a genes 
13.  
Tumors that exhibit defective HR via mechanisms that are unrelated to germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are com monly referred to as having a ‘BRCAness’ phenotype 
14, 15.  Although 
several potential biomarkers of BRCAness and defective HR have been developed 16-19, there is 
currently no clinically available biomarker of HR -deficient cancers that accurately predicts 
defective HR and responsiveness to platinum and PARP inhibitors, and this is an area of high priority for ovarian and breast cancer research.  
 PARPis in HR proficient tumors: T
 he promise of PARP inhibitors in the management of 
ovarian and breast cancers is t empered by the fact that HR -proficient cancers do not respond well 
to these agents, suggesting that approximately 50% of ovarian cancer patients (i.e. those without HR alterations) do not benefit from this novel class of drugs.  Combination of PARPis with agents that inhibit HR may represent an effective strategy to sensitize HR proficient tumors to PARPis and thus potentially expand use of these agents beyond patients with HR deficient EOCs. Strategies designed to selectively disrupt HR in cancer cells and  sensitize them to PARP 
inhibition, thereby extending the use of this class of agents to HR-proficient cancers, include PI3K -pathway inhibition 
20, 21 and CDK inhibition 22, both of which have been translated to 
clinical trials.  
 
Rationale for combination of HSP90 and PARPis:   Multiple components of the HR pathway 
are HSP90 clients, including BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51, suggesting that HSP90 inhibition 
may similarly sensitize can cer cells to PARP inhibition. We have previously shown that 
exposure of HR -proficient breast cancer cell lines to HSP90  inhibitor (HSP90i) 17 -AAG(17 -
allylamino -17-demethoxygeldanamycin) downregulated HR, ATM and Fanconi Anemia 
pathways 23. In HR -proficient epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, 17 -AAG suppr essed HR as 
assessed using the RAD51 foci formation assay and this was further confirmed using the Direct Repeat -GFP reporter assay. Furthermore, 17-AAG downregulated BRCA1 and/or RAD51 
protein levels, and induced significantly more γH2AX activation in com bination with olaparib 
compared to olaparib alone
23.  Of note, sublethal concentrations of 17- AAG sensitized HR -
proficient EOC lines to olaparib and carboplatin thereby provide the preclinical rationale for using a combination of PARP inhibitors/HSP90  inhibitors in HR -proficient EOC. Similar 
experiments have also been conducted in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, showing that HSP90 inhibition depletes BRCA2, BRCA1 and RAD51 from HR- proficient NCI -H1299 
cells and sensitizes them to PARP inhibition thus providing the proof of principle that HSP90 inhibitor mediated sensitization to PARP inhibition can occur in additional solid tumor models.   I
n addition, we have recently published on a novel mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance 24.  
MDA- MB-436 triple -negative breast cancer cells harboring a BRCA1 BRCT domain mutation 
were rendered rucaparib -resistant via exposure to graded concentrations over time.  Resistance 
was associated with HSP90 -mediated stabilization of the mutant protein, without evidence for 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
20 BRCA1 re version mutation.  Because the BRCT domain mutant protein cannot engage CtIP, 
there was a concomitant 53BP1 mutation in resistant clones, which lowered 53BP1 levels and 
permitted BRCA1 -independent end resection.  However, the mutant protein remains capable of 
binding to PALB2 and BRCA2 and is critical for efficient RAD51 loading, mediating restoration of HR and ultimate resistance.  Importantly, resistance was reversed with the application of an HSP90 inhibitor, so that PARP inhibitor sensitivity was restor ed
24. 
 We have also performed additional in vitro and in vivo experiments to demonstrate the cytotoxicity of the combination of an HSP90 inhibitor with a PARP-inhibitor.  a. In vitro: We have now assessed the combin ation of the PARP-inhibitor talazoparib 
(BMN673) and the HSP90-inhibitor AT13387 in 4 HR proficient ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR4, OVCAR5, SKOV3 and CAOV3) using colony formation assays. In all cases, addition of sublethal concentrations of AT13387 enhanced the cytotoxicity of talazo parib  
(BMN673). b. In vivo: We have performed tolerability and efficacy studies of PARP-inhibitor olaparib and 
the HSP90 -inhibitor AT13387 in ovarian PDX models. 
We initially performed tolerability studies and as shown in Figure 1, doses of olaparib up to 100mg/kg po daily x 3 weeks and AT13387 up to 45mg/kg po for 2 days (D1,D2) on / 5 days off x 3 weeks (i.e. Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16) were well tolerated without weight loss in the mice.  
 
 Figure 1. Tolerability of olaparib and AT13387 combination in ovarian PDX models.  Efficacy studies were subsequently performed. Olaparib was dosed at 100mg/kg po daily x 4 weeks, AT13387 was administered at 45mg/kg po for 2 days (D1,D2) on / 5 days off x 4 weeks (i.e. Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23). As shown in Figure 2, the combination of AT13387 and olaparib induced inhibition of tumor growth in several ovarian PDX  models as opposed to 
NCI Protocol #: 10031

21 vehicle control, olaparib alone and AT13387 alone. 
 
 
 Figure 2 . AT13387+olaparib vs olaparib alone vs AT13387 alone vs vehicle in ovarian PDX 
models.  
 Of note, all models except for DF83 were derived from patients with platinum resistant tumors. Strikingly, the DF101 model was derived from a patient with BRCA1 -mutation and platinum and 
PARPi resistant disease, which has been resistant to combinations of olaparib and the PI3K inhibitors BKM120 or BYL719. Finally, we noted that 2 of the models harbored CDKN2A loss and 1 CCNE1 amplification. Amplification of CCNE1 is one of the most common focal copy number change events in serous ovarian cancer, occurring at a frequency of 20%; these tumors are enriched for platinum resistance and are associated with inferior outcome. Furthermore, in the TCGA dataset, expression of CDKN2A, which is a negative regulator of cyclins and cyclin -
dependent kinases, is very low or not expressed in approximately 1/3 of ovarian cancer cases.  
 Based on these tolerability and efficacy studies with olaparib and AT13387 in ovarian PDX models, we will proceed with twice weekly dosing of AT13387 (on Days 1 and 2 every week, i.e. 2 days on/5 days off).   2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
  Clinical Pharmacology: 
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
22 The pharmacokinetic study has been designed to assess the effect of olanespib on the steady state 
pharmacokinetics of olaparib and if  the pharmacokinetics of olanespib is affected by the 
concurrent administration of olaparib.  Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed in all patien ts enrolled in the dose escalation and expansion cohorts to provide data that may be 
informative for dose escalation decisions and correlation analysis with clinical and 
pharmacodynamic data.  Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed to define the plasma  
concentration -time profile of olaparib over the dosing interval for the day 7 dose when given 
alone in cycle 0.  Pharmacokinetic samples will also be collected over a 24 h interval on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 to define the plasma profiles for olaparib and olanespib .   
 The sampling schedule has been devised to accommodate treatment on an outpatient basis.  Patients will be instructed to take the two daily doses of olaparib at the same time every day during 
the pharmacokinetic study.  The morning dose of ol aparib should be taken at a time that will allow 
the patient to arrive at the clinical to obtain pharmacok inetic samples before dosing and to remain 
for an additional 8 hours.  The second daily dose of olaparib should be taken approximately 12 hours after the morning dose.  It is very important that the patient is aware that the morning dose 
of olaparib must n ot be taken before arriving at the clinic on cycle 0 day 7, cycle 1 day 1, and 
cycle 1 day 15.  The olanespib i.v. infusion should be started at the s ame time that the patient 
takes the olaparib dose on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1.  The first set of blood samples (3 mL) on cycle 0 day 7 will be obtained at the indicated times according to the PK Sample Collection Time Points table below.  The second and th ird sets of blood samples (6 mL) on cycle 1 day 1 
and cycle 1 day 15 will be obtained at the same time points as indicated by the PK Sample Collection Time Points table below, with one additional sample collected 30 min after completing the 1 h IV infusion of olanespib.  Procedures for PK sample  collection, processing, 
storage, and shipment is provided in Appendix G.

Analytical method s for the determination of olaparib and olanespib by high performance liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection h ave been developed and validated as 
recommen ded by the FDA Guidance for Industry:  Bioanalytical Method Validation, May 2001 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/ucm070107.pdf ).  Individual patient plasma 
concentration -time curves will be analyzed by noncompartmental methods using routines 
supplied in the WinNonlin Professional software package (Pharsight Corp., Cary, NC).  Pharmacokinetic parameters and variables will be calculated according to standard equations.  Mean values of pharmacokinetic parameters will be statistically compared using the two -tailed t -
test of the log -transformed data.

 3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
24 3.1.1 For the dose escalation cohort:   
i) Patients must have histologically or cytologica lly confirmed malignancy that is 
metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effec tive. 
ii)  Patients may have received any number of prior therapies. 
3.1.2 For the dose expansion cohort: 
i) Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of either: 
a) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer of high grade serous histology which has re curred despite standard therapy . Up to 3 prior lines in the 
platinum resistant setting (i.e. up to 3 lines after patients have become platinum resistant); patients may have received unlimited lines while platinum sensitive . 
b) triple- negative breast cancer (TNBC) whic h has recurred despite standard therapy. 
Recurrent TNBC needs to have metastatic disease and patients with an in breast recurrence are not eligible.  Up to 4 prior lines in the recurrent setting for patients 
with triple -negative breast cancer  are allowed .  
ii) Patients with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer mus t have platinum 
resistant disease defined as progression within 6 months after last platinum regimen. Platinum refractory disease is allowed.  
iii)  Patient s with triple -negative breast cancer may not be BRCA1/2 germline mutation 
carriers  
3.1.3 Age ≥18 years. Because  no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the 
use of olaparib  in combination with AT13387 in patients <18 years of age, children are 
excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.  
3.1.4 There m ust be availability of a formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor specimen . 
3.1.5 ECOG  performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky > 60%, see Appendix A). 
3.1.6 Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.  
3.1.7 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: 
− leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL  
− hemoglobin  ≥10 g/dL with no blood transfusion in the past 28 days  
− absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL  
− platelets  ≥100,000/mcL  
− total bilirubin  within normal institutional limits  
− AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit of no rmal 
− creatinine  ≤ the institutional upper limit of normal  
OR 
− creatinine clearance  ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

− Any clinically significant electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia and  
hypomagnesemia, should be corrected before treatment.  
− Pre-Study evaluation must include an ophthalmologic exam by an opthalmologist 
(not optometrist) and should minimally include visual acuity testing, slit lamp examinati on, and fundoscopic examination. F ollow up eye-exams will only be 
performed if subjects develop/report any visual impairment.  Visual impairment may include peripheral flashes (photopsia), blurred or double vision, floaters, color distortion and dimness, difficulties with light/dark accommodation, tunnel vision or 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
25 other field defects, halos, apparent movement of stationary objects, and complex 
disturbances. Follow up eye- exams will minimally include visual acuity testing, slit 
lamp examination, and fundoscopic examination; additional testing wi ll be based on 
symptoms, what is observed and ophthalmologist recommendations.  
3.1.8 For the expansion cohort only: measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 with at least one measurable target lesion.  
3.1.9 The effects of olaparib  in combination with AT13387on the devel oping human fetus are 
unknown.  For this reason and because olaparib  and AT13387 are anti -neoplastic small 
molecule inhibitors , which are agents that are potentially  teratogenic, women of child -
bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contracep tion (hormonal or barrier 
method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry , for the duration of study 
participation , and for 3 months after the last dose of study drugs. Should a woman 
become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her pa rtner is participating in 
this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months af ter completion of olaparib  and/or 
AT13387 administration.  
3.1.10 Patients must be able to swallow tablets and have no significant impairment in gastrointestinal absorption.  
3.1.11 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.      
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
26 3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
3.2.1 Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for 
nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earl ier. 
3.2.2 All acute, clinically significant treatment -related toxicity from prior therapy, except for 
alopec ia, must have resolved to Grade ≤ 1. 
3.2.3 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.  
3.2.4 Patients with known active or history of brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.  
3.2.5 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to olaparib  and AT13387 used in study. 
3.2.6 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
3.2.7 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib  and AT13387 are agent s 
with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with  AT13387 or olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is 
treated with  olaparib or AT13387.  
3.2.8 HIV- positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the 
potential for  pharmacokine tic interactions with olaparib or AT13387.  In addition, these 
patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow -suppressive 
therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination 
antiretroviral therap y when indicated. 
3.2.9 Known history of QT/QTc prolongation or Tor sades de Pointes (TdP). Patients who  are 
currently receiving treatment with medication with a known risk to prolong the QT 
interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes and the treatment cannot either be  discontinued 
or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drugs.  
3.2.10 Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are ineligible (see Appendix C ).  The 
study team should check a frequently- updated medical reference for a list of drugs to 
avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.  
3.2.11 Participants  with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features 
suggestive of MDS/AML .  
 3.3 Inclusion of Wom en and Minorities  
 NIH policy requires that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations be included in all NIH -supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving NIH-
defined clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the funding Institute & Center ( IC) Director that inclusion is inappropriate 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
27 with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research.  Exclusion under other 
circumstances must be designated by the Director, NIH, upon the recommendation of an IC Director based on a compelling rationale and justification.  Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources.  Women of childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research.    Please see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.pdf . 
 Members of all races and et hnic groups are eligible  for this trial.  For the expansion cohort, only 
women develop ovarian cancer, but men with recurrent triple negative breast cancer  will be 
eligible for this study.  Please refer to Planned Enrollment Report table in Section 13.2.  
  4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

 4.2 Site Registration  
 This study is supported by the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  Each inve stigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this 
protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to  the following:  
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number 
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization  
• A valid IRB approval  
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements.  
 
In addition, the site -protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572  
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site 
 Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by the CIRB for this study are not required to submit IRB approval documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office. For sites using the CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process.  Signatory Institutions must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Ins titution must inform the CTSU 
which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are participating in the 
study.  4.2.1 D

 4.3 Patient Registration  
 4.3.1 OP
EN / IWRS  
 Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis.  It 
is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data interchange and with the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient registration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by Registrars in OPEN / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data management system, Medidata Rave.  
 For trials with slot reservation requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment initiation to check slot availability.  Registration staff should ensure that a slot is 
available and secured for the patient before completing an enrollmen t. 
 Once a slot reservation request has been made, the following source documentation  
should be emailed to the Lead Institution Project Manager or designee for confirmation of eligibility.  
 
• Copy of required laboratory tests: 
• CBC with differential  
• Serum che mistries (sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, BUN,  creatinine, 
glucose, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, ALP, AST (SGOT), ALT  
(SGPT) , total bilirubin, total protein ) 
• Coagulation (PT or INR with PTT) 
• Signed informed consent form 
• HIPAA authorization form (if sepa rate from the informed consent document)  
• EKG  
• MUGA or ECHO  
• CT scan  or MRI (with documentation of measurable disease per RESIST 1.1)  
• Pathology report 
• Documentation that archival tissue is available  
• Screening or most recent clinic visit note (including documentation of oncologic 
history, past medical history, concomitant medications, and vitals) 
• Clinic note from eye exam 
 
The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and 
treatment information.   Please print this confirmation for your records.

4.4 General Guidelines  
 Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 7 days. Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient does not 
receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study may be canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
  5 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 Screening tests including tumor measurements must be done and deemed acceptable per  
Section 3 and completed ≤ 4 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy. Treatment will be 
administered on an  outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in 
Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
32 intent to treat the patient's malignancy.  
 
Dose Escalation  
A standard 3+3 design will be utilized, escalating if 0/3 or 1/6 participants have a DLT during Cycles 0 and 1  of therapy.  Cycle 0 is only 7 days and Cycle 1 begins 8 days after start of Cycle 0, i.e. immediately after Cycle 0 ends. If ≥ 2 DLT’s are encountered on a dose level, that dose level will be considered the DLT dose, and the next dose level lower will be considered the MTD. Dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) will be 
based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (C TCAE), Version 5.0 and 
refers to toxicities experienced during the first 1 cycle of treatment.  Based on our tolerability and efficacy studies with olaparib and AT13387 in ovarian PDX models, AT13387 will be administered for 2 consecutive days every week for 3 weeks of a 4 week (28 day) cycle (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16). The RP2D of AT13387 administered IV for 2 consecutive days every week for 3 weeks of a 4 week (28 day) cycle (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16) is 160 mg/m2/dose.  Doses of olaparib will range from 50 mg–300 mg twice daily; AT13387 doses will range from 
20–160 mg/m2 (20-40- 80-120-160) using a ping-pong strategy as shown in the Table below.

Given Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
0 out of 3 Enter 3 patients at the ne xt dose level. 
≥2 Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be declared the maximally administered dose (highest dose administered).  Three (3) additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were treated previously at th at dose. 
1 out of 3 Enter at least 3 more patients at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to the next dose level. 
• If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared the maximally  administered dose.  Three (3) additional 
patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose.  
≤1 out of 6 at highest dose level

34 In mouse xenograft models, continuous daily administration of olaparib yielded greater 
antitumor activity than intermittent administration at the same or at higher dose levels so it is 
recommended that olaparib  is administered continuously.  
 
The twice weekly (Days 1 and 2) of AT13387 was also chosen based on previous experience by Dr. Shapiro with another HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib (STA -9090)
1 . Therefore , the proposed 
regimen will be olaparib  twice  daily and AT13387 on Days 1 and 2 every week, cycle (Days 1, 
2, 8, 9, 15, 16) of a 28 day cycle.

(4 weeks)  
   
AT13387  See dose level table 
above  1-hour IV

15,16  
 During cycle 0, olaparib  will be administered alone twice  daily at the same times each day ,12 
hours apart, for 1 week (D1-7).  Cycle 1 and beyond, olaparib will continue to be administered 
twice  daily and AT13387 will be administered for 2 consecutive days every week for 3 weeks of 
a 4 week  cycle, i.e. on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of a 28 day cycle. On days that olaparib and 
AT13387 are administered on the same day, during cycle 1, AT13387 should be started at the same time that the patient takes olaparib. For all other cycles, olaparib can be administered at any time during the AT13387 infusion. Given that our hypothesis is that AT13387 sensitizes to olaparib by inhibiting HR, by administering olaparib  alone for cycle 0 only (7 days) , we can test 
this hypothesis as a “proof of mechanism” for the combination of AT13387 and olaparib . 
Specifically, we expect that there will be induction of BRCA1 and RAD51 foci after administration of olaparib alone and reduced formation of these foci and downregulation of expression of HR pathway genes after the combination of AT13387 and olaparib. To reiterate, olaparib will be ad ministered alone in cycle 0 (7 days) ; in all subsequent cycles, olaparib  will be 
administered daily and AT13387 will be administered QDx2 for QWx3 (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16) 
of a 28 day cycle.   COMPLIANCE:  The patient will be requested to maintain a medica tion diary of each dose of 
medication.  A copy of the medication diary is in Appendix F . It will be returned to clinic staff at 
the end of each cycle.  The dose will depend on which combination and dose level the participant is on. Participants will be reassessed for tumor response every 2 cycles (8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1), +/ - 1 week. 
During the DLT dosing period (Cycles 0 and 1), if dosing needs to be interrupted for toxicities, both drugs should be stopped and reinstituted simultaneously when appropriate according to Section 6. During cycles 2 and beyond, if a toxicity can be ascribed to a specific study drug, then that drug may be stopped while the non- offending drug can be maintained (see Section 6). 
Patients will have up to 28 days to resolve a toxic ity to at least grade 1; if the toxicity does not 
decrease to grade 1 or less, the patient will be removed from the study . Furthermore, DLT 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
35 definition also includes toxicities that do not resolve to at least grade 1 within 28 days to allow 
patients to start Cycle 2. In other words, if patients are unable to start Cycle 2 because the toxicities have not resolved to at least grade 1 after 28 days, then this is also a DLT. During the first 2 cycles of therapy, participants will be seen w eekly for blood count and 
chemistry/liver/renal panels in addition to clinical sta tus (which includes performance status, 
history/physical, medication reconciliation, vital signs). The DLT a ssessment period will be 
during the first 5 weeks of therapy (i.e., cycle 0 and 1). PK samples will be collected during 
cycle 1 as per section 2.3. During cycle 1, patients will be called by someone on the research team  on Monday through Friday to confirm they are dosing study medications correctly. I f the 
patient is bei ng seen in clinic on one of these week days and confirmation of dosing was 
obtained during the clinic visit then a phone call is not necessary.  Intrapatient Dose Escalation  
Intrapatient dose escalation in this trial will be allows given that AT13387 and olaparib have non-overlapping toxicities and that both drugs are not associated with any cumulative toxicities. Intrapatient dose escalation may occur as long as patients are tolerating their current drug dose levels, the next higher dose is deemed safe via the 3+3 design, and dose escalation is agreed upon with the treating physician and principal investigator. This dose escalation will not count towards the next cohort of 3+3 in the formal escalation of the trial. Patients must be treated on their initial dose level for at least 2 cycles before their dose can be escalated. Patients who have 
their dose escalated will follow the same rules for dose delays and modifications as described in section 6.0.  Since DLT refers to toxicities experienced during cycle 0  and the first cycle of 
treatment, and intrapatient dose escalation is allowed after patients have been treated on their initial dose level for at least 2 cycles, toxicities after intrapatient dose escalation are not considered DLTs. There is no maximum number of times a patient can be dose escalated, as long 
as they have acceptable toxicities for 2 cycles on a specific dose level and are receiving benefit from the study drugs.   
5.1.1 Pre-Treatment Criteria

36 interrupt ed for toxicities, the offending drug(s) should be stopped and reinstituted when 
appropriate according to Section 6. If one study drug is being taken the study clock does not 
stop, and the offending drug will be marked as held at the start of the next cycl e. The study clock 
will not stop for drug(s) held and restarted within a cycle. If on day one both drugs are held, the next cycle will not start until one or both of the drugs are restarted.

 At All Times During the Study  
Participants must meet the following criteria at all times during the study to continue  
dosing: 
• No evidence of life- threatening medical problems.  
• No evidence of an impending bowel obstruction. 
• Patient must be able and willing to swallow capsules. 
 
5.1.2 olaparib  
Administration  
Olaparib at the appropriate dose level will be given orally continuously twice daily. Table ts are 
taken by mouth and can be taken with a light meal/snack if needed to r educe stomach irritation.  
The correct number of tablets comprising the appropriate dose should be taken at the same times each day with approximately 240 mL of water. The olaparib tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved, or divided.   
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
37 A 28 -day supply (+/-4 day window to allow for holidays and vacations) of Olaparib will be 
dispensed at the start of each cycle. Participants wil l be provided with a pill diary (Appendix F), 
instructed in its use, and asked to bring it with them to each appointment.  
 If vomiting occurs shortly after the olaparib tablets are swallowed, the dose should only be replaced if all of the intact tablets can be seen and counted. Should any participant  
enrolled on the study miss a scheduled dose, the participant will be allowed to take the  
scheduled dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after that scheduled dose time. If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the  next scheduled time.  
 Dosing: Please refer to section 5.1.  
 
5.1.3 AT13387 (Olanespib)  
 
Administration  
 In this trial, AT13387 will be administered in the following dosing schedule: One hour IV infusion (+/- 10 minutes) on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle (twice -
weekly  for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle); refer to section 5.1 for dose schedule. Dosing of 
AT13387 will be based on the weight obtained on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle, and this weight can be used for dosing on the following day, that is, days 2, 9 and 16, respectively.. AT13387 dose rounding will be done as per institutional guidelines.   Treatment with AT13387 ( onalespib ) may be associated with local infusion -related irritation, as 
well as systemic infusion reactions, which occur either during the infusion or shortly afterwards (same day).   Infuse over 1 hour (+/- 10 minutes) through a central line or a well- defined peripheral vein.  If using 
a peripheral line, be sure to aspirate venous blood prior to starting the infusion.  Check the infus ion 
site every 15 minutes and change the site of infusion should evidence if swelling or discoloration is observed.  
 If patient experiences pain at the infusion site, slow the infusion rate (i.e. > 1- hour duration) and/or 
infuse D5W or 0.9% NS through a “ Y” connector.  The additional volume of D5W or 0.9% NS 
dilutes AT13387 concentration at the local site of the infusion and alleviates the irritation. Premedication with dexamethasone, antihistamine and 5HT3 antagonists can also be given.  
 
5.2 Definition of Dos e-Limiting Toxicity  
 Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0.   Definition of DLT: Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) refers to both non -hematologic and 
hematologic toxicities experienc ed during cycle 0 and the first cycle (i.e. first 4 weeks) of 
treatment.   
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
38 A DLT will be defined as any of the following, numbers 1-5, occurring during Cycle s 0 and 1: 
 
1. Non-Hematologic Toxicity Any Grade 3 or 4 event, excluding: 
• Grade 3 Fatigue 
• Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting controlled with supportive measures within 24 hours 
• Grade 3 constipation controlled with supportive measures within 24 hours 
• Grade 3 diarrhea controlled with supportive measures within 24 hours 
• Grade 3 hypophosphatemia 
• Grade 3 hyponat remia  
• Grade 3 hypomagnesemia 
• Grade 3 rash that resolves to grade 2 or grade 1 within < 5 days 
 2. Hematologic Toxicity  
• Grade 4 neutropenia of > 7 day’s duration 
• Febrile neutropenia (a disorder characterized by an ANC < 1000/mm3 and a single temperature of > 38.3 °C (101 °F) or a sustained temperature of > 38 °C (100.4 
°F) for more than one hour. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or bleeding associated with grade 3 thrombocytopenia. 
• Requirement for repeated blood transfusion within 4-6 weeks 
• All other Grade 4 hematol ogic toxicities  
 3. Any study treatment related death.  
 4. Any Grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity considered, in the opinion of the investigator, to be dose- limiting.  
 5. Inability to take 75% or more of the planned dose for olaparib and  4 out of 6 doses for 
AT13 387 in Cycle 1 due to treatment -related AEs.  
If patients cannot take 75% or more of the planned olaparib or who receive fewer than 4 doses of AT13387, for reasons other than toxicity or DLT, these patients will not be evaluable for DLT assessment and will  be replaced.  
 If a participant experiences a DLT, a PK sample should not be drawn.  Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 6.  The study team will review data and the progress of the study on a monthly bases including during the expansion cohort  
5.3 Dose Expansion Cohorts 
 Once the RP2D is reached, an additional 20 patients with either TNBC or ovarian cancer will be treated at this dose.  Monitoring of all safety and toxicity data is done by the Principal Investigator and the Corresponding Organization on a real- time basis as data are entered into 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
39 Medidata Rave using the Web Reporting Module. All participating sites are expected to notify 
the Principal Investigator when a DLT has occurred.    
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 Please see section 8 for potential drug interactions.  
 Patient should receive general concomitant and supportive care medications based on best  
medical practice. Neupogen and other bone marrow-supportive agents, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents, are not allowed during treatment. The use of any natural/herbal products or other “folk remedies” is not allowed on study. All medications must be recorded in the case report form and be reviewed by t he treating physician at each visit.  
 Because there is a potential for interaction of olaparib  and/or AT13387 with other concomitantly 
administered drugs, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter medications , or alternative therapies.  The Principal Investigator should be alerted if 
the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with the potential for drug interactions.  Participants on chronic medications that can be given co ncomitantly with protocol dru gs should 
be maintained on the same dose and dose schedule throughout the study period, as medically 
feasible. The investigator should instruct the participant to notify the study site about any new 
medications he/she takes aft er the start of the study dru g. All supportive measures consistent 
with optimal patient care will be giv en throughout the study. Bisphosphonates, vitamin D and 
calcium supplementation, topical medications, antiemetics, anti- diarrheal medications, 
anticoagulants and anti- infective agents may be used at the discretion of the treating physician. 
 In general, the use of any concomitant medication/the rapies deemed necessary for the care of the 
patient is permitted with the following exceptions: 
• Other investigational therapies must not be us ed while the participant is on the study.  
• Myeloid growth factors are not permitted during any cycle of therapy. 
• Anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic or radiation therapy, and surgery) other than the study treatments must not be given to participants while he/she is on the  study. If 
such agents are required for a participant then the participant must be removed from this 
study. 
 The study team should check a frequently- updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid 
or minimize use of.  APPENDIX B – AT13387 PATIENT DRUG INFORMATION handout and wallet card should be provided to patients.  Medications that could alter the QTc interval  
 Participants must also not take medications that could alter the QTc interval which are listed in Appendi ces C and  D. Medications listed in Appendix C can be used but with caution. Please note 
that some anti -emetics have a known risk for Torsades de Pointes ( TdP) and are prohibited.  
If a participant, after study enrollment, requires the concomitant use of any QT  prolonging 
medication with a possible or conditional r isk for torsade de pointes then the investigators, at 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
40 their discretion, may co- administer such medic ations. Participants receiving such medications 
must be monitored. Refer to Appendix C for a list of QT prolonging medications to be used with 
caution. Please refer also to Appendix  D for a list of prohibited QT prolonging medication.  
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 
• Clinical progression  
 
• Patient non -compliance 
 
• Pregnancy 
 
o All women of child bearing potential should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect the y might be pregnant (e.g., missed 
or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
 
o The investigator must immediately notify CTEP in the event of a confirmed pregnancy in a patient participating in the study. 
 
• Termination of the study by s ponsor 
 
• The drug manufacturer can no longer provide the study agent 
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the oral medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
 
Due to the expiration date of the terminal lot of AT13387 (Onalespib), all participants must discontinue AT13387 treatment before May 31, 2020.  Patients may continue olaparib alone after May 31, 2020.  The reason(s) for protocol therapy discontinuation, the reason(s) for study removal, and the corresponding dates must be documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
41  
  
5.6 Duration of Follow Up 
 Final Visit 
The final visit will occur at the time the participant discontinues study medication.  
Following the Final Visit, participants will be followed for disease progres sion (if reason 
for treatment discontinuation is other than progression) and survival. Follow- up will be  
reported in 3 month intervals for up to two years after removal from study treatment or  
until death, whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study treatment for  
unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
 Follow Up  
Participants will be followed for disease progression (if reason off treatment is other than  
progression) and survival. Follow- up will be reported in 3 month intervals for up to two  
years after removal from study treatment or until death, whichever occurs first.  
Participants removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be  
followed until resolution or stabil ization of the adverse event.  
 
5.7 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent for data submission  
• Death  
• Completion of all study requirements  
 The re ason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the 
Case Report Form  (CRF). Alternative care options will be  discussed with the participant.  
In the event of unusual or life- threatening complications, p articipating investig ators must 
immediately notify the Principal Investigator.   6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 Dose delays and modifications will be made using the following recommendations. Toxicity assessments will be done using version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) until March 31, 2018. CTCAE version 5.0 will be used for toxicity assessments beginning April 1, 2018. The CTCAE is identified and located on the CTEP website at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. If possible, 
symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti- emetics, anti -diarrheals, etc.).  
All adverse events experienced by participants will be collected from the time of the first  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
42 dose of study treatment, through the study and until the final study visit. Participants continuing 
to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contacted for additional assessments until the 
toxicity has resolved or is deemed irreversible.  
 
6.1 Anticipated Toxicities  
 A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the agents administered in  
this study appears below and will determine whether dose delays and modifications will be made or whether the event requires expedited reporting in addition to routine reporting. Please refer to 
section 7 for specifics.  
 
6.2 General Toxicity Management, Dose Modifications / Delays 
 The management of general adverse events not otherwise specified will be as per the table in 
section 6.2.1; for specific toxicities of diarrhea , QTc prolongation, nausea and hematological 
toxicities, ple ase see section 6.3 . 
 Investigators will make the determination of whether a toxicity is related either to  olaparib  or 
AT13387. If dose reductions are necessary, the agent that will be dose reduced will be the one that has toxicities attr ibuted to it. If both drugs are causing drug- related toxicities, both agents 
will be dose reduced one dose level (i.e. immediately lower dose on dose escalation Table, Section 5.1).  
6.2.1 General Dose Modifications and Management of olaparib and 
AT13387 toxicities  
 For toxicities that have their own management algorithm as listed in 6.2, please see that specific section below.  
 In this phase 1 study, doses of olaparib  and AT13387 will be administered at the same dose level 
throughout a cycle if no toxicities that require a dose reduction occur.  If any individual participant develops a DLT, the study drugs should be held. If the toxicity is not resolved within 28 days, the participants will be removed from the study. Participants who experience a DLT that resolves to baseline or Grade 1 and whose therapy has been held for less than or equal to 28 days may resume therapy at the next lowest dose of drug(s), if necessary.

Grade 1  Consider loperamide (4 mg at first onset, followed by 2 mg q 2 –4 hours 
until free of diarrhea for 12 hours. The total maximum daily  dose of 
loperamide should not exceed 8 tablets (16 mg). Maintain dose level.  
Grade 2  Loperamide (4 mg at first onset, followed by 2 mg q 2 –4 hours until free of 
diarrhea for 12 hours. The total maximum daily dose of loperamide should not exceed 8 tablets (16 mg). Omit dose until resolved to ≤ grade 1, then 
restart the same dose.  
Grade 3 and 
Grade 4  Loperamide as above. Omit dose until resolved to Grade ≤ 1, then reduce 
AT13387 by 1 dose level.  
 Diarrhea has been reported within the ongoing studies of AT13387. In order to effectively manage diarrhea and mitigate the escalation in severity or duration of diarrhea, patient education as well as proper management of diarrhea is mandatory.  
The following section outlines the recommended algorithm for management and treatment of AT13387-induced diarrhea.  Patient history of diarrhea  
At screening, the patient’s history of diarrhea should be reviewed and the patient should be 
appropriately informed of potential study drug-induced diarrhea and its management: 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
44 • Review  previous medical history of diarrhea within the last 12 months; laxative use, 
colon surgery, abdominal and pelvic irradiation, nocturnal diarrhea, pain, ulcerative 
colitis and  other diarrhea -inducing diseases/conditions; 
• Stop all diarrheogenic agents at screening if possible, otherwise exclude from trial; 
• Instruct patients regarding risk of developing diarrhea;  
• Perform baseline clinical/laboratory studies according to the trial protocol (e.g. one could rule out carrier state of Salmonella spp., Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter spp., Giardia, Entamoeba, Cryptosporidium which can lead to opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients) 
• Explain the frequency of diarrhea and its relationship to NCI CTCAE grading  
 First report of diarrhea  
• Obtain history of onset and duration of diarrhea 
• Description of number of stools and stool composition (e.g. watery, blood, mucus in stool) 
• Assess patient for fever, abdominal pain, cramps, distension, bloating, nausea, vomiting, 
dizziness, weakness (i.e., rule out ris k for sepsis, bowel obstruction, dehydration) 
• Obtain medication profile (i.e., to identify any diarrheogenic agents) and dietary profile 
(i.e., to identify diarrhea -enhancing foods)  
Proactively look for occurrence of diarrhea. If no problems occur, instruc t the patient to call  
when a problem does arise. 
 Management of diarrhea General recommendations:  
• Stop all lactose -containing products, alcohol 
• Stop laxatives, bulk fiber (e.g. Metamucil®) and stool softeners (e.g. docusate sodium, Colace®)  
• Stop high-osmolar food supplements such as Ensure Plus® and Jevity Plus® (with fiber) 
• Drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day (e.g. water, Pedialyte®, Gatorade®, broth) 
• Eat frequent small meals (e.g. bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast)  
It is recommended that patients are provided with loperamide tablets at the start of each cycle. Patients should be instructed on the use of loperamid e at Cycle 1 in order to manage signs or 
symptoms of diarrhea at home. Patients should be instructed to start oral loperamide (in itial 
administration of 4 mg, then 2 mg every 4 hrs (maximum of 16 mg/day) at the first sign of loose 
stool or symptoms of abdominal pain. These instructions should be provided at each cycle and the site should ensure that the patient unde rstands the instruction. At the beginning of each cycle, 
each patient should be specif ically questioned regarding any experience of diarrhea or diarrhea 
related symptoms. If symptoms were experienced, then the site should question the patient regarding the actions taken fo r these symptoms.  
Intensive management of diarrhea must be instituted at the first sign of abdominal cramping, loose stools or overt diarrhea. Note that all concomitant therapies used for treatment of diarrhea must be recorded on the Concomitant Medic ation s/Non -drug Therapies eCRF. Loperamide is the 
first- line treatment of diarrhea (any Grade) in this recommended  algorithm. Persistent symptoms 
may require the adminis tration of high dose loperamide followed by treatment with second- line 
agents such as opium t incture and octreotide acetate, based on severity and duration of diarrhea 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
45 and related sig ns/symptoms. Another first- line treatment for diarrhea is diphenoxylate 
hydrochloride/atropine sulfate. T his medication may be used in place of loperamide however it is 
import ant to note that loperamide and diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate must not be 
used in conjunction with one another due to the risk of developing paralytic ileus. Upon 
treatmen t with any antidiarrheal agents, the patient’s response to t reatment shoul d be observed 
and appropriately documented in the source document and eCRF.  
 Treatment of diarrhea CTCAE grade 1 or 2 Diarrhea CTCAE grade 1 or 2 will be treated with standard loperamide (initial at first  
administration 4 mg, then 2 mg every 4 hrs (maximum of 16 mg/day) or after each unformed  
stool).  
 12-24 hrs later:  
Diarrhea resolved  
• Continue instructions for dietary modification  
• Gradually add solid foods to diet 
• Discontinue loperamide after 12 hrs diarrhea -free interval  
Diarrhea unresolved  
Persisting diarrhea CTCAE grade 1 or 2 will be treated with addition of opium tincture or  
dihydrocodeine tartrate tablets/injections with monitoring of patients condition to rule out dehydration, sepsis, ileus) medical check and selected workup if patient does not need hospitalization (see section Diarrhea workup and additional test in the particular trial  
protocol). Observe patient for response to antidiarrheal treatment.  
Persisting diarrhea CTCAE grade 3 or 4 may be treated with hospitalization, high dose loperamide (initial 4 mg, then 2 mg every 2 hrs) and addition of opium tincture (DTO) or dihydrocodeine tartrate tablets/injections, start of IV fluids and antibiotics as needed with  
monitoring of patient’s  condition (to rule out dehydration, sepsis, ileus) medical check and  
workup (perform appropriate additional testing). Observe patient for response.  
 
After 12 -24 hrs:  
Diarrhea resolved  
• Continue instructions for dietary modification  
• Gradually add solid foods to diet 
• Discontinue loperamide and/or other tre atment after 12 hrs diarrhea -free interval  
Diarrhea unresolved  
• If diarrhea still persisting (CTCAE grades 1 and 2), after 2x 24 hrs with high dose 
loperamide and opiates then admit to hospital and employ measures as for CTCAE grade 
3 and 4 until diarrhea resolved. 
• If diarrhea still persisting and progressed to CTCAE grades 3 and 4, employ measures described below. 
 Treatment of diarrhea CTCAE grade 3 or 4 Severe diarrhea CTCAE grade 3 or 4 may be treated with hospitalization, high dose loperamide (initial 4  mg, then 2 mg every 2 hrs and addition of opium tincture or 
dihydrocodeine tartrate tablets/injections, start of IV fluids and antibiotics as needed with  
monitoring of patients condition (to rule out dehydration, sepsis, ileus) medical check and 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
46 workup (s ee section Diarrhea workup and additional test in the particular trial protocol).  
Observe patient for response.  
 
After 12 -24 hrs:  
• If diarrhea persisting administer s.c. Sandostatin/octreotide (100 -500 mc g tid)  
• Continue IV fluids and antibiotics as needed 
• If diarrhea CTCAE grade 3 or 4 still persists patients should receive opium tincture or 
dihydrocodeine tartrate injections s.c. or i.m. 
• If diarrhea CTCAE grade 3 or 4 is still persisting s.c. Sandostatin/octreotide (500 -1000 
mcg TID) should be administered. 
• To control and/or resolve diarrhea, next cycle of treatment should be delayed by 1 or 2 
weeks. Treatment should be continued only when diarrhea resolved. 
 
Diarrhea workup  
Perform appropriate tests:  
Spot stool analysis 
• Collect stool separating it from urin e (special containers, analysis immediately, 
exceptionally freeze samples)  
• Blood 
• Fecal leukocytes (Wright's staining and microscopy) or 
• Clostridium difficile toxin  
• Fecal cultures including Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Giardia, Entamoeba, Cryptosporidium (which can lead to opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients),  plus Shigella and pathogenic E. coli - enterotoxigenic, enterohemorrhagic etc., 
possibly Aeromonas, Pleisiomonas (if suspected exposure to contaminated water) 
 Endoscopic exam inations  
Endoscopic examinations may be considered only if absolutely necessary. The bowel is likely  
to be fragile with evidence of colitis and thus great care and caution must be exercised in  
undertaking these invasive procedures. 
• Gastroscopy to obtain jejunal fluid - re. bacterial overgrowth for cultures and biopsy of 
proximal jejunum to assess extent of inflammatory jejunitis  
• Sigmoidoscopy - reassessment of colitis  
 
6.3.2 QTc prolongation  
 Management of QTc prolongation:  
At the screening visit a 12- lead electr ocardiogram (ECG), and an echocardiogram or MUGA 
(ECHO/MUGA) will be performed to assess eligibility. A 12 lead ECG will be done in triplicate 
at 2-5 minute intervals  as part of screening, cycle 1, day 15, cycle 2, day 15 and day 1 of each 
following cycle.  
 
Management of QTc Prolongation  
Observation  Action  
QTcF > 500 ms First Occurrence:   
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
47 (> grade 3) or > 
60 ms change 
from baseline on at least two separate ECGs Omit AT13387.  
Perform a repeat ECG within one hour of the first QTc of >500ms or >60 ms from baseline: if QTcF remains >500ms or >60 ms from baseline, repeat ECG as clinically indicated, but at least once a day until QTcF returns to <480ms.  Seek cardiologist input; address electrolytes, calcium and magnesium abnormalities; concomitant medication must be reviewed.  
Once QTcF prolongation has resolved, AT13387 may be restarted at one lower dose level.  Second Occurrence:   
Permanently discontinue AT13387  
 
6.3.3 Nausea  (olaparib and AT13387)  
 
Nausea  Management/Next Dose for 
olaparib  Management/Next Dose for  
AT13387  
≤ Grade 1  No change in dose  No change in dose  
Grade 2  Hold until ≤ Grade 1.  Resume at 
same dose level.  Hold until ≤ Grade 1.  Resume at 
same dose level.  
Grade 3  Hold* until < Grade 2.  Resume at 
one dose level lower, if indicated.** Hold* unti l < Grade 2.  Resume at 
one dose level lower, if 
indicated.**  
Grade 4  Off protocol therapy  Off protocol therapy  
*Patients requiring a delay of >2 weeks should go off protocol therapy.  
**Patients requiring > two dose reductions should go off protocol ther apy. 
Recommended management:  antiemetics.  
 
6.3.4 Hematologic Toxicities  
 Management of Hematologic Toxicities  If: 
any study treatment is interrupted/delayed because of one or more of the following: 1) ≥ 2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade >2 neutropenia 
2) ≥ 2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade >2 
thrombocytopenia 3) ≥ 2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade >2 anemia and 
or development of blood transfusion dependence  
Note: Myeloid growth factors are not permitted during any cycle of therapy.  
 Then:  
Weekly blood counts should be performed during the study treatment interruption/delay. 
If the levels have still not recovered to CTC Grade ≤ 1 after 4 weeks of dose interruption, 
the participant should be referred to a hematologist for further investigations. Bone  marrow 
analysis or blood cytogenetic analysis should be considered at this stage according to standard 
hematological practice.  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
48  
For any participants with an episode of grade 3 anemia, the olaparib  dose should be  reduced to 
the next lowest dose of drug . If grade 3  anemia persists despite one dose reduction, the dose of 
olaparib can be reduced by  another dose. A maximum of 2 dose reduct ions can be made. 
Participants should be  transfused as per institutional policies. For participants who receive 
multiple blood  transfusions because of an emia that is related to olaparib  use, the treating 
investigator can  dose reduce olaparib  in consultation with the Principal Investigator.  
 
Dose Modification and Management of Hematologic Adverse Events  
Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 
1000/mcL (1.0 x 109/L)  
AND  
Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcL  
AND  
Hemoglobin ≥ 8g/dL  Maintain dose level  
Absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mcL (1.0 x 109/L) OR  
Platelets < 75,000/mcL  
OR  
Hemoglobin < 8g/dL Hold tr eatment for up to 28 days until absolute 
neutrophil count ≥  1000/mcL, platelets ≥  75,000/mcL, 
and hemoglobin ≥  8 g/dL. Treatment will be  
restarted at one dose level lower for th e drug(s) 
causing the toxicity, if the participant has experienced 
a DLT in cycle 1, or for participants in  
cycle 2 and beyond. 
 Treatment may be restarted at the same do se level for 
participants still in the DLT period and have not 
experienced a DLT, after discussion with the PI.  
 Patients whose counts have not recovered to absolute neutrophil count ≥  1000/mcL, platelets ≥  75,000/mcL, 
and hemoglobin ≥  8 g/dL after 28 days should be 
removed from study.  
 The overall PI of the study should be informed regarding all dose modifications.  
 
  7 ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
7.1 Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List(s) (CAEPRs)  
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
49 The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by body system.  In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset of AEs, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is iden tified with bold and italicized text.  The SPEER is a list of events that are protocol-
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm  for further clarification.  
 NOTE:  The highest grade currently reported is noted in parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  Report O NLY AEs higher than this grade expeditiously.  If this CAEPR is part of a 
combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

Note : AT13387 (Onalespib) in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any adverse event 
currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination may result in events never previously 
associated with either agent.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized until March 31, 2018 for AE reporting.  CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting beginning April 1, 2018. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- A Es for the agent that are bold and italicized in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed i n the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1.1) should be reported through CTEP- AERS only if the 
grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER. 
- Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in 
section 7.3.4. 
 
•
 Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
55 - Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
 
    
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP- AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site ( https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the 
“NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below (Section 7.3.2).  
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be made to CTEP by telephone at 301- 897-7497.  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by the 
original submitter at the site.  
 
7.3.1 D
istribution of Adverse Event Reports  
 
CTEP- AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator and Adve rse Event Coordinator(s) (if 
applicable) of the Corresponding Organization or Lead Organization, the local treating physician, and the Reporter and Submitter .  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for 
other e- mail recipients.  
 
7.3.2 E
xpedited Reporting Guidelines 
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol- specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting , regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 D
eath due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression ” 
under the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.” Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., 
radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.

56 Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse 
Events that Occur on S tudies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Administration 
of the Investigational Agent/Intervention 1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of t he following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events  (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via electronic 
submission within the timeframes detailed in the table below.  
Hospitalization Grade 1 and Grade 2 Timeframes  Grade 3 -5 
Timeframes  
Resulting in 
Hospitalization

Hospitalization  
≥ 24 hrs  Not required  
NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR. 
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be submitted electronically within 24 hours of learning 
of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24- hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted electronically within 10 
calendar days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24-hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
7.4 Routine Ad verse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events m ust be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
expeditiously through CTEP- AERS  must also be reported in routine study data 
submissions.  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
57  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  AEs are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during the trial using Medidata Rave.  For this trial the  Adverse Event CRF is used for routine 
AE reporting in Rave.  
7.5 Secondary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by  treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/interventio n, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP -AERS.  Three options are available to 
describe the event:   
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.   
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initia l malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE  
reporting unless otherwise specified .

administered in this study can be fo und in Section 7.1. 
 
8.1 CTEP IND Agent(s)   
 
8.1.1 CTEP  IND AT13387 (NSC 749712)  
 Chemical Name:    ( 2,4-dihydroxy-5- isopropyl -phenyl) -[5-(4-methyl -piperazin -1-ylmethyl) -1,3- 
dihydro- isoindol -2-yl]-methanone,  L-lactic acid salt  
 Other Name:  AT13387AU, onalespib 
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
58 Classification:      Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor  
 
Molecular Formula:   C24H31N3O3.C3H6O3   M.W.:  499.61 
 Mode of Action :  AT13387 is a synthetic non- ansamycin small molecule that inhibits heat shock 
protein 90 (HSP90.  HSP90 seems to affect multiple aberrant signaling pathways and therefore may be of clinical benefit in several cancer treatments.  
  How Supplied:  AT13387 is supplied by Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc. and distributed by CTEP, NCI as a 265 mg free base equivalent (L- lactic acid salt) v ial, containing white to off- white 
lyophilized powder.  The agent is formulated in pH 5.0 (red cap).  Preparation:   Reconstitute the 265 mg lyophilized powder with 10 mL of Sterile Water for 
Injection (SWFI) resulting in 25.7 mg/mL concentration (10.3 mL t otal volume).  A sticky mass 
will be formed. Vigorously shake the vial. Agitate until the contents are fully dissolved (about 5 minutes).  Leave the diluted vial at ambient temperature for 15 -30 minutes to allow any foam to 
dissipate. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted vial(s) at 2
0 to 80 C not to exceed 8 
hours. Withdraw the calculated dose of AT13387 and further dilute it in 250 mL of D5W or 0.9% NS. The Prepared IV solution is compatible in PVC or non-PVC infusion bags.    Store the prepared IV solution refrigerated at 2
0 to 80 C not to exceed 8 hours if not used 
immediately .  When removed from the refrigerator, allows the prepared IV solution to sit at room 
temperature between 15 to 30 minutes before administering to patients. The prepared IV solution must be used within 24 hours -i.e., from the time the drug vial is diluted to the time the IV 
administration is complete.   Protection from light during the infusion period is not required.  
 Storage:     Store the intact vials at 15
0 to 25ºC (59 to 77ºF) .  Protect from light.  
 If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return AT13387 to 15
0 to 25ºC (59 to 
77ºF) and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including 
documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of suitability.  
 Stability:     Shelf life surveillance of the intact vials is ongoing .    
 
Route  of Administration:     Intravenous  
 
Method of Administration :  Infuse over 1 hour through a central line or a well -defined peripheral 
vein (Note: an in -line filter is NOT required).  If use a peripheral line, be sure to aspirate venous 
blood prior to starting the infusion.  Check the infusion site every 15 minutes. Change infusion site 
should evidence of swelling or discoloration is observed.   
 Potential Drug Interactions:   AT13387 is a substrate of UGT with a relatively low affinity for UGT isoforms. In vitro data demonstrate tha t AT13387 is a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A3 
and UGT1A9.   AT13387 is also a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, - 3A4, -2D6, -2C9 and -2C19.  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
59 AT13387 appears to metabolize via the glucuronidation, sulphation and N -oxidation.  
 
Pre-clinical studies suggest that AT1 3387 is a substrate of P -gp, the efflux ratios was above 2 
(ranging from 3.4 to 4.6); a moderate inhibitor of BCRP (35.9% +/ - 2%, p=0.0001) and P -gp 
(31.3% +/ - 1.2%, p= 0.0009), and a strong inhibitor of MATE1 (94.6% +/ - 0.2%, p=0.0001) and 
MATE2 -K (91.2% +/ - 1.2%, p= 0.0002). 
 Patient Care Implications:  There are no genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, developmental and 
reproductive studies conducted with AT13387.  Women of childbearing potential should not become pregnant or breastfeed and men should not fathe r a child during the study.  All subjects 
must use acceptable contraceptive measures during the treatment of AT13387 and 3 months after the last dose of the investigational drug.  
Systemic infusion reactions (e.g., vomiting, itching skin, or swelling), slow  the infusion and/or 
administer NS or D5W through a “Y” connector in parallel to AT13387 IV infusion.  Pre -
medication (e.g., dexamethasone, H -1 and H -2 antagonist) may be given before subsequent 
infusions and/or administer additional volume of 500 mL over 1 hour if medically appropriate.  
Avoid extravasation. For local irritation, apply cold compress or topical pain medication.  
 Availability  
 AT13387 is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by the Division of Cancer Treatment 
and Diagnosis (DCT D), NCI.  AT13387 is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement 
between the Pharmaceutical Collaborator and the DCTD, NCI (see Section 12.3).  
 AT13387 clinical drug development program is completed.  The current clinical supply is 
expiring on May 31, 2020; thus, all patients must be off treatment by May 31, 2020. 
 
8.1.2 CTEP IND olaparib (NSC 747856) 
 
Chemical Name:  4-[(3-{[4- (cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazin -1-yl]carbonyl}-4-
fluorophenyl)methyl]phthalazin-1(2 H)-one  
 
Other Names:  AZD2281; KU-0059436; CO- CE 42 
 Classification: PARP inhibitor  
 CAS Registry Number:  763113-22-0 
 Molecular Formula:   C
24H23FN 4O3  M.W.: 434.46 
 Approximate Solubility:  0.1 mg/mL pH independent solubility across physiologic range  
 Mode of Action:  Olaparib is an inhibitor of subclasses 1, 2, and 3 of polyadenosine 5’ 
diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP -1, PARP -2, and PARP -3). In tumors that are deficient 
in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway (example, BRCA mutants), inhibition of PARP by olaparib causes accumulation of DNA do uble-strand breaks and 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
60 genomic instability. Olaparib may also enhance the effects of DNA damage caused by 
ionizing radiation and chemotherapy.  
 Description:  crystalline solid  
 How Supplied: AstraZeneca supplies and the CTEP, DCTD  distributes olaparib as g reen, film-
coated tablets in 25 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg strengths.  
 
• 25 mg tablets are 6 mm round- shaped  
• 100 mg tablets are 14.5 mm x 7.25 mm oval -shaped  
• 150 mg are 14.5 mm x 7.25 mm oval -shaped  
 
Tablets are packaged in induction-sealed high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child -resistant closures. Each bottle contains 32 tablets with desiccant.  
 Tablet core components include active drug substance, copovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, mannitol and sodium stearyl fumarate. Film coating contains hy droxypropyl 
methylcellulose (hypromellose), macrogol 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow and iron oxide black.  
 Storage: Store in a secure location below 30° C (86° F). Sites are not permitted to re -package 
tablets. Once the bottle is opened, olaparib tablets must be used within 3 months of the opening date; unused tablets should be discarded. Instruct patients not to open a bottle until they are ready to use it.  
 Stability:  Shelf -life studies are ongoing.  
If a storage temper ature excursion is identified, promptly return olaparib (AZD2281) to 
room temperature and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of suitability.    
 
Route  and Method  of Administration:   Tablets are taken by mouth and can be taken with a light 
meal/snack if needed to reduce stomach irritation.  
 Potential Drug Interactions:  In vivo  data indicate that CYP3A4/5 is important for olaparib 
metabolism and clearance in humans. For this reason, avoid concomitant administration of strong and moderate CYP 3A4/5 inducers and inhibitors.  Consult the protocol document or study investigator prior to making any dose adjustments related to potential drug -drug 
interactions.  
 
In vitro data shows olaparib is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but not for organic 
anion- transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), orga nic cation transporter 1 
(OCT1), multi -drug resistance protein 2 (MRP -2) efflux transporter or breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP). Administration of strong P -gp inhibitors and inducers should be 
avoided with concurrent olaparib.   
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
61 Based on in vitro  data, olaparib inhibits CYP 3A4 and UGT1A1 enzyme systems  and 
induces CYP 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 and potentially induces CYP 2C9, 2C19 and P -gp. 
Therefore, avoid concomitant administration of sensitive substrates, particularly those with 
narrow therapeutic range s.   
 Olaparib is also an inhibitor of P -gp, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, multi -drug and toxin 
extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) and a weak inhibitor of BRCP, but not an inhibitor of OATP1B3 or MRP -2. In vitro  studies suggest that olaparib may increase 
exposure of substrates of these transport systems, although the clinical relevance is not clear. 
The manufacturer recommends that statins, in particular, should be administered with caution when given concomitantly with olaparib.  
 Patient Care Implications:  Pre-clinical data indicate that olaparib adversely affects embryofetal 
survival and development. Therefore,  women of child- bearing potential  and their partners 
should agree to use two (2) highly effective forms of contraception throughout study participat ion and for at least one  (1) month after the last dose of olaparib.   Male study 
participants should avoid fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for three (3) months after the last dose of olaparib. The study investigator should discuss t he most 
appropriate forms of highly effective contraceptive methods for each patient.  
 
Because the adverse events related to olaparib may include asthenia, fatigue and dizziness, patients should be advised to use caution while driving or using machinery. 
 
8.1.3 A
gent Ordering and Agent Accountability 
 
8.1.3.1 NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or 
their authorized designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped dir ectly to the institution where the 
patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP-assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied inves tigational agents.  The responsible 
investigator at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), an d Financial Disclosure 
Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP -
supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution.  
 
A starter supply is not allowed.  A confirmation of patient enrollment is needed in the “Comments” field in OAOP for the initial drug shipment.  
 Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator-designated shipping designees and 
ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application.  Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” account status and a “current” password.  For questions about drug orders, transfers, 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
62 returns, or accountability, call or email PMB any time.  Refer to the PMB’s website for 
specific policies and guidelines related to agent management.   
 
8.1.3.2 Agent Inventory Records  
 The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a careful record of the receipt, dispensing and final disposition of all agents received from the PMB using the appropriate NCI Investigational Agent (Drug) Accountability Record (DARF) available on the CTEP forms p age.  Store and maintain separate NCI 
Investigational Agent Accountability Records for each agent, strength, formulation and ordering investigator on this protocol.   
 
8.1.3.3 Investigator Brochure Availability  
 
The current versions of the IBs for PMB -supplied agents will be accessible to site 
investigators and research staff through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application.  Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” account status and a “current” password.  Questions about IB access may be directed to the PMB IB coordinator via email.

  9 BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 Based on the results of our preclinical work, we hypothesize that the HSP90 inhibitor AT13387 will enhance the anticancer effects of the PARPi olaparib at tolerable doses in patients with 
advanced solid tumors.    During cycle 0, olaparib  will be administered alone once dail y for 1 week (D1- 7).  Then i n cycle 
1 and afterwards, olaparib  will continue to be administered twice  daily and AT13387 will be 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
63 administered for 2 consecutive days every week for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle, i.e. on Days 1, 2, 
8, 9, 15 and 16 of a 28 day cyc le. Given that our hypothesis is that AT13387 sensitizes to 
olaparib by inhibiting HR, by administering olaparib  alone for cycle 0 only, we can test this 
hypothesis as a “proof of mechanism” for the combination of AT13387 and olaparib. 
Specifically, we exp ect that there will be induction of BRCA1 and RAD51 foci after 
administration of olaparib  alone and reduced formation of these foci and downregulation of 
expression of HR pathway genes after the combination  of AT13387 and olaparib.  
 Three biopsies, one pr etreatment, one after olaparib  alone and one after one of the combinations 
of olaparib /AT13387 will be voluntary, but encouraged in the expansion and dose escalation 
cohorts.   
9.1 Exploratory/Ancillary Correlative Studies

 The pharmacokinetic study has been designed to assess the effect of olanespib on the steady state pharmacokinetics of olaparib and if the pharmacokinetics of olanespib is affected by the concurrent administration of olaparib.  Pharmacokinetic sampling  will be performed in all 
patients enrolled in the dose escalation and expansion cohorts to provide data that may be informative for dose escalation decisions and correlation analysis with clinical and pharmacodynamic data.  Pharmacokinetic sampling will b e performed to define the plasma 
concentration -time profile of olaparib over the dosing interval for the day 7 dose when given 
alone in cycle 0.  Pharmaco kinetic samples will also be collected over a 24 h interval on days 1 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
64 and 15 of cycle 1 to define the plasma profiles for olaparib and olanespib .   
 
The sampling schedule has been devised to accommodate treatment on an outpatient basis.  Patients will be i nstructed to take the two daily doses of olaparib at the same time every day during 
the pharmacokineti c study.  The morning dose of olaparib should be taken at a time that will allow 
the patient to arrive at the clinical to obtain pharmacokinetic samples before dosing and to remain for an additional 8 hours.  The second daily dose of olaparib should be tak en approximately 12 
hours after the morning dose.  It is very important that the patient is aware that the morning dose of olaparib must not be taken before arriving at the clinic on cycle 0 day 7, cycle 1 day 1, and 
cycle 1 day 15.  The olanespib i.v. inf usion should be started at the same time that the pa tient 
takes the olaparib dose on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1.  The first set of blood samples (3 mL) on cycle 0 day 7 will be obtained at the indicated times according to the PK Sample Collection Time Points  table below.  The second and third sets of blood samples (6 mL) on cycle 1 day 1 
and cycle 1 day 15 will be obtained at the same time points as indicated  by the PK Sample 
Collection Time Points table below, with one additional sample collected 30 min after completing the 1 h IV infusion of olanespib.  Procedures for PK sample  collection, processing, 
storage, and shipment is provided in Appendix G.

10 STUDY CALENDAR  
 In pre- study/screen t he baseline eye e xam, physical examination, medical history, concomitant 
medications recorded, ECOG PS, complete blood count with differential and platelets, and clinical chemistry should be done ≤ 14 days prior to initiation of treatment. However, if these 
initial examinations are obtained within 3 days prior to the initiation of treatment they do not have to be repeated. Scans to document evaluable disease (i.e., tumor measurement) should be performed ≤  28 days prior to initiation of treatment and should be performed as close to the start 
of treatment as possible.  
 Assessments must be performed prior to administration of any study agent.  
 No treatment window will be allowed for Cycle 0 and C ycle 1 , however, Cycle 1 day 1 
assessments can be done on day 7 of Cycle 0 . A +/ - 3 day window will be allowed for Cycle 2 
Day 1 and subsequent treatment cycles Day 1 . If D ay 1 is adjusted, days 8 and 15 will be re -
adjusted accordingly, A +/- 1 day window will be allowed for Day 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 and 
subsequent treatment cycles.

a. Vital signs will include resting heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and weight, and  at the screening visit will include 
height. After Screening, height will not  be measured. Vital signs and weight will be obtained prior to chemotherapy 
administration . Dosing of AT13387 will be based on the weight obtained on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle, and this weight 
can be used for dosing on the following day, that is, days  2, 9 and 16, respectively .  
b. Clinical chemistry will include measurements of glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, magnesium, potassium, chloride, 
calcium, CO2, ALP, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, total protein, and albumin. 
c. Coagulation studies will be performed at baseline only (PT or INR with PTT); they will be repeated beginning of every 
cycle if patient on coumadin.  
d. ECGs will be performed in triplicate at 2-5 minute intervals.  All ECGs after Cycle 2 will be performed on Day 1 of the 
cycle.  
e. More frequent eye ex ams can be performed as clinically indicated . Pre-Study evaluation must include an ophthalmologic 
exam by an opthalmologist (not optometrist) and should minimally include visual acuity testing, slit lamp examination, and 
fundoscopic examination. Follow up eye -exams will only be performed if subjects develop/report any visual impairment.  
Visual impairment may include peripheral flashes (photopsia), blurred or double vision, floaters, color distortion and dimness, difficulties with light/dark accommodation, tunnel vision or other field defects, halos, apparent movement of 
stationary objects, and complex disturbances. Follow up eye -exams will minimally include visual acuity testing, slit lamp 
examination, and fundoscopic examination; additional testing will be  based on symptoms, what is observed and 
ophthalmologist recommendations .  
f. CT scans of the chest and abdomen and pelvis are required at baseline and every 2 cycles  (± 7 days). The same method of 
assessment and the same technique must be used to characteriz e each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
subsequent imaging procedures. Patients continuing study treatment for a minimum of 1 year may have the tumor imaging assessments expanded to every 4 cycles (12 weeks [±7 days]). Patients with unacceptable toxicity should be discontinued 
from the study; patients with SD or response to therapy will continue treatment. Patients without evidence of undue toxicity 
may continue treatment with study drugs until disease progression occurs as long as they are achieving clinical benefit and 
desire to continue therapy. Patients with progressive disease per RECIST 1.1 will be discontinued from the study.  
g. Refer to section 9.1 for details.  
h. The End of Study Treatment Visit will be performed at the 30 day follow -up visit. Reassessments for toxicity, disease 
progression, and survival will be performed 30 days from last treatment dose.  
i. Please see section 5.6 for specifics on Follow -up. 
j. Patients who continue on olaparib monotherapy will have concomitant meds, physical exam, vital signs, CBC w/diff, 
platelets, serum chemistry, and adverse event evaluation on day 1  only of each cycle following AT13387 discontinuation.  
 
 11 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 Although the clinical benefit of Olaparib and AT13387 have not yet been esta blished, the intent 
of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.  Patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria.  For the purposes of this 
study, patients should be re- evaluated every  8 or 9 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
68 confirmatory scans will also be obtained  every 8 or 9 weeks following initial documentation of 
an obje ctive response.  
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response every 8 weeks.  In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 8 weeks  (not less than 4) 
weeks follow ing initial documentation of objective response. 
 R
esponse and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1 D
efinitions  
 Evaluable for toxicity .
   All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with  olaparib  and/or AT13387.  
 Evaluable for objective response.  Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had  their disease 
re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non- T
 arget Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had the ir disease re- evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2 D
isease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) by chest x- ray or as ≥10 mm  (≥1 cm)  with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 N
ote:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not 
be considered measurable.    Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node m ust be ≥15 mm  (≥1.5 cm)  in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
69 slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm] ).  At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-m easurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm]  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm  [≥1 
to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 N
ote:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 Target lesions.   A
 ll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total , representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which c an be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 Non-ta
rget lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rar e cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3 Met
hods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
70 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions   
 Clinical lesions will only be considered mea surable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm  (≥1 cm)  diameter 
as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -r
ay   Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm  (0.5 cm) or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm  (0.5 cm) , the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations  (e.g. for body scans).   
 U
se of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameter s for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 PET- CT  A
t present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of  a 
PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
71 assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, L ap
 aroscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence f ollowing complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 Tumor markers   T
 umor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in compl ete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first- line trials in ovarian cancer [JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 Cytology, Histology  These te c
 hniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  T
he cytological confirmation o f the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG- PET
   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible  'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  a. N
egative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are n eeded to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing 
site of disease on CT that is not pro gressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD. 
c. FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease- specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
72 may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4 R
esponse Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (<1 cm) . 
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diamet e
 rs of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD) :  A
 t least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm  (0.5 cm).  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 Stable Disease (SD) :  N
 either sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
11.1.4.2
 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -ta
 rget lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
[<1 cm]  short axis).  
 N
ote:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clin ical response.  
 Non-CR/
Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 Progressive Disease (PD) :
   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 A
lthough a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional , the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
73 status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

75 12.1 Study Oversight  
 
This protocol is monitored at several levels, as described in this section.  The Protocol Principal Investigator is responsible for monitoring the conduct and progress of the clinical trial, including the ongoing review of accrual, patient-specific clinical and laboratory data, and routine and serious adverse events; reporting of expedited adverse events; and accumulation of reported adverse events from other trials testing the same drug(s).  The Protocol Principal Investigator and statistician have access to the data at all times through the CTMS web -based reporting portal.   
 For the Phase 1 portion of this study, all decisions regarding dose escalation/expansion/de-escalation require sign -off by the Protocol Principal Investigator through the CTMS/IWRS.  In 
addition, for the Phase 1 portion, the Protocol Principal Investigator will have at least monthly, or more frequently, conference calls with the Study Investigators and the CTEP Medical Officer(s) to review accrual, progress, and adverse events and unanticipated problems.    All Study Investigators at participating sites who register/enroll patients on a given protocol are responsible for timely submission of data via Medidata Rave and timely reporting of adverse events for that particular study.  This includes timely review of data collected on the electronic CRFs submitted via Medidata Rave.  
 All studies are also reviewed in accordance with the enrolling institution’s data safety monitoring plan.  
12.2 Data Reporting 
 
Data collection for this study will be done exclusively through Medidata Rave.  Access to the 
trial in Rave is granted through the iMedidata a pplication to all persons with the appropriate 
roles assigned in the Regulatory Support System (RSS).  To access Rave via iMedidata, the site user must have an active CTEP IAM account  (check at < https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam  >) and

12.2.1 M ethod 
 This study will be monitored by the Clinical Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS).   Data will be 
submitted to CTMS at least once every two weeks via Medidata Rave (or other modality if approved by CTEP).  Information on CTMS reporting is available at:   
http://www.theradex.com/clinicalTechnologies/?National -Cancer -Institute -NCI-11.  On-si
te 
audits will be conducted on an 18- 36 month basis as  part of routine cancer center site visits. 
More frequent audits may be conducted if warranted by accrual or due to concerns regarding data quality or timely submission.   For CTMS monitored studies, after users have activated their 
accounts, please contact  the Theradex Help Desk at (609) 799-7580 or by email at 
CTMSSupport@theradex.com  for additional support with Rave and completion of CRFs.
 
 
12.2.2 R esponsibility for Data Submission 
 
For ETCTN trials, it is the responsibility of the PI(s) at the site to ensure that all investigators at the ETCTN Sites understand the procedures for data submission for each ETCTN protocol and that protocol specified data are submitted accurately and in a timely manner to the CTMS via the electronic data capture system, Medidata Rave.   
 
Data are to be submitted via Medidata Rave to CTMS on a real -time basis, but no less than once 
every 2 weeks.  The timeliness of data submissions and timeliness in resolving data queries will be tracked by CTMS.  Metrics for timeliness will be followed and assessed on a quarterly basis.  For the purpose of Institutional Performance Monitoring, data will be considered delinquent if it is greater than 4 weeks past due.  
 
Data from Medidata Rave and CTEP -AERS  is reviewed by the CTMS on an ongoing basis as 
data is received.  Queries will be issued by CTMS directly within Rave.  The queries will appear on the Task Summary Tab within Rave for the CRA at the ETCTN to resolve.  Monthly web-based reports are posted for review by the Drug Monitors in the IDB, CTEP.  Onsite audits will 
be conducted by the CTMS to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, GCP, and NCI policies and procedures with the overarching goal of ensuring the integrity of data generated from NCI -sponsored clinical trials, as described in the ETCTN Program Guidelines, which may 
be found on the CTEP (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm )  and 
CTSU websites.  
 
A
n End of Study CRF is to be completed by the PI, and is to include a summary of study 
endpoints not otherwise captured in the database, such as (for phase 1 trials) the recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D), and a description of any dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs).  CTMS will 
utilize a core set of eCRFs that are Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR)

12.5  Genomic Data Sharing Plan 
 
Not applicable   13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1  Study Design/Endpoints  
 The phase I component of this study will employ a 3+3 design, escalating if 0/3 or 1/6 participants have a DLT during Cycles 0 and 1, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.    The planned dose escalation and dose levels of olaparib and AT13387 for this study are outlined in Section 5.1. Additional dose levels or schedules may be tested based on ongoing phase I results and/or preclinical testing.  
 Safety: Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) refers to toxicities experienced during cycles 0 and 1 of  
treatment. A DLT will be defined using the criteria in Section 5.2.  
Probabilities of escalatio n in a 3+3 design are tabulated below for a series of assumed true 
toxicity rates (based on a binomial distribution):  
True 
Toxicity 
Rate  0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.8 0.9 
Probability 
of 
Escalation  0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.053 0.032 0.009 0.001 
    At least 6 patients will be treated at MTD, and no more than 1 patient should experience a DLT at the MTD level.  Based on the exact binomial distribution, we would be unlikely to escalate the dose level (the probability is 0.053) if the true toxi city was 65% or greater.  
 To evaluate the properties of the 3+3 (x+y) escalation/de -escalation design , a simulation study 
was performed. In the simulation study, each dose- level was considered to be the ‘true MTD’, 
defined using a two- parameter logistic mo del for the dose -toxicity relationship of each agent. 
Using an intercept of 0.183 and slope of 1 on the log2- scale for each agent, the probability of a 
DLT at the true MTD of the combination would be the common assumption of 33.3% and odds would double with a doubling of either agent.

* In the simulation study, dose levels are defined as being above the MTD if the probability of a DLT under the bivariable logistic model is greater than 33.3%.   
13.2  Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 Depending on the number of dose levels, it is anticipated that between 15 and 30 patients will be enrolled to the dose escalation portion of this study and an additional 20 patients with either TNBC or ovarian cancer will be enrolled in the dose expansion cohort. With 20 patients treated at the MTD, the probability of observing at least one serious toxicity event is 0.88 if the true toxicity rate is 10% and 0.64 if the true toxicity rate is as low as 5%. With 20 participants, the maximum width to a binomial exact 90% confidence interval is 0. 456. 
 We anticipate that between 2 -3 patients will be enrolled per month to this study. If the RP2D is 
at the highest dose level, we would expect a sample size of approximately 40 subjects. Therefore, recruitment for the current study will be done in approximately 12-18 months.

13.3  Stratification Factors  
 There will be no str atification factors for this study.  One expanded MTD cohort of epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients will be enrolled with one of the schedules, for confirmation of safety, PK and PD. A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in this expansion cohort.   
13.4 Interim Analysis  
 For the dose expansion cohort, a continuous monitoring plan will be conducted following the method of Ivanova, et al
36 with Pocock- style boundaries for early stopping . Required i nput 
parameters are the proportion which represents a maximum- tolerated  level of  toxicity, θ ,  and the 
probability of early stopping , φ, if θ  is true  toxicity rate.  
 We specified θ = 0.333 according to the MTD corresponding to the 3+3 design, and allow for a φ 
= 0.2 chance of early stopping. Boundaries are listed in the table below. If the number of subjects with toxicity reaches the specified limits, accrual of additional patients to this study will stop 
until satisfactory changes to the RP2D  have been made to ensure subject safety

13.6  Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.6.1 Evaluation of Toxicity 
 All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment.  
 
13.6.2 Evaluation of response 
 All participants included in the study m ust be assessed for response to treatment, even if  
there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each participant  
should be assigned one of the following categories: 
1) complete response,  
2) partial response, 3) stable disease,  
4) progressive disease,  
5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity,  
7) early death becaus e of other cause, or  
9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). 
By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical database.  
All of the participants who met the eligibility criteria and who re ceive at least one dose of  
study drug will be included in the main analysis of the response rate.

APPENDIX B : PATIENT DRUG INFORMATION HANDOUT AND WALLET CARD 
 
Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non -Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 The patient ____________________________ i s enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drug, olaparib (AZD2281).  This clinical trial is sponsored by the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI).  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.   These are the things that you as a prescriber need to know:  
  Olaparib interacts with certain specific enzymes in the liver and certain transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of cells.  
• The enzymes in question are CYP 3A4/5, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and UGT1A1. Olaparib is 
cleared by CYP3A4/5 and is affected by strong and moderate inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4/5. Ola parib inhibits CYP3A4 and UGT1A1enzymes and may increase levels of 
other drugs that are cleared by these enzymes.  Olaparib induces CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 
enzymes and has the possibility of inducing CYP 2C9, 2C19 enzymes that may result in decreased levels of  other drugs that are cleared by these enzymes.   
• The transport proteins in question are P -glycoprotein (P-gp), o rganic anion -transporting 
polypeptides  (OATP1B1 and OAT3), organic cation transporters ( OCT1 and OCT2), 
multi- drug and toxin extrusion proteins  (MATE1 and MATE2K) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP). Olaparib  requires P -gp to move in and out of cel ls and 
concomitant administration of strong P-gp inhibitors and inducers should be avoided. Olaparib inhibits P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K 
transporters and has the possibility of inducing P-gp and that may affect the transport of other drugs that depend on these proteins to move in and out of cells. Use caution when taking substrates of these transporters, such as stati ns. 
            
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached infor mation card in your wallet .   
 
Olaparib may interact with many drugs which can cause side effects. Because of this, it is very 
important to tel l your study doctors about all of your medicines before you enroll on this clinical 
trial.  It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your medications with your doctors, include medicine you buy without a prescription (over- the-counter remedy), 
or any herbal supplements such as St. John’s Wort. It is helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you.  Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your health care providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists) you are taking part in a clinical trial.  
NCI Protocol #: 10031 
Version Date:  February 10 , 2020 
 
88 
 
These are the things that you (the patient) and your prescribers need to know : 
 
Olaparib must be used very carefully with other medicines that need certain liver enzymes and transport proteins to be effective or to be cleared from your system.  Before you enroll onto the clinical trial, your stud y doctor will work with your regular health care providers to review any 
medicines and herbal supplements that ar e considered “strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 
and P- gp.” Olaparib inhibits enzymes “CYP3A4, UGT1A1, P -gp, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, 
OAT3, MAT E1, MATE2K and BCRP.” Olaparib possibly induces “CYP 1A2, 2B6, 3A4, 2C9, 
2C19 and P-gp.”  These characteristics may change how other medicine works in your body. 
 
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may 
contain ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctor or pharmacist to determine if there coul d be any side effects.  
• Avoid ingesting grapefruit, grapefruit juice and Seville oranges while taking olaparib. 
• You may need to be monitored more frequently if you are taking any drugs that have 
narrow therapeutic ranges. 
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or 
call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any medicine .   
• Your study doctor’s name is __________________________________________                
     and he or she can be contacted at _____________________________________.

89 Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non -Study Health care Team  on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental study drug, AT13387 (onalespib).  This clinical trial is sponsored by the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI).  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important information 
for others who care for this patient.  
 These are the things that your prescriber needs to know:  
  Pre-clinical data show that AT13387 (onalespib) interacts with certain specific enzymes in the 
liver and certain transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of cells.   The enzymes in question are UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9 and CYP 1A2, 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, and 2C19.    
• AT13387 (onalespib) is metabolized by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3  and may be affected by 
other drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes.   
• AT13387 (onalespib) is a “weak” inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9 and CYP 
1A2, 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, and 2C19 and may affect the metabolism of other drugs. 
• The proteins in questions are P-gp, BCRP, MATE-1, and MATE2-K.  AT13387 
(onalespib) is a P -gp substrate and may be affected by other drugs that inhibit/induce      
P-gp.  AT13387 is a “moderate inhibitor” of BCRP and P-gp, and a “strong inhibitor” of MATE1 and MATE2 -K and may affect transport of other drugs in and out of cells.  
               
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached information card in your wallet .   
 
AT13387 (onalespib) may interact with other drugs which can  cause side effects.  For this 
reason, it is very important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you enroll onto this clinical trial.  It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any regular medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When

98 APPENDIX G:  PHARMACOKINETIC SAMPLE COLLECTION AND HANDLING  
 
1. Do not collect pharmacokinetic blood samples from the catheter  used to infuse olanespib, 
including the port of a multi -lumen catheter that was not used for infusing the drug.   
2. When using a peripheral catheter  for sampling , use a syringe to cle ar the catheter of the 
lock solution approximately 1 min before the specified sample  time and withdraw about 
0.5 mL of blood into the syringe for disposal.   
3. Collect s amples in a 3.0 mL (cycle 0) or 6.0 mL (cycle 1) plastic purple stoppered 
Vacutainer tube with spray dried K2EDTA. 
4. Immediately after filling the tube, gently invert the collection tube 5- times to thoroughly  
mix the blood with the anticoagulant and place the tube on wet ice until centrifuged .  
5. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for  10 min at 4°C within 30 min after collection.   
6. Use a disposable pipette to transfer the plasma, removed without disturbing the blood 
cells,  equally into two  (2) 2.0 mL self-standing polypropylene cryogenic storage vials 
with external threads for Aliquot A and Aliquot B.   
7. Affix  a computer printed label with the following information onto the tube:  CTEP 
Protocol No., Subject Study No., Sample No., Aliquot #.  O rient the label crosswise 
toward the upper part of the tube being careful not to overlap the vial cap.  Wrap the label with polyester protective label tape (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 11-867B) to prevent the label from detaching from th e vial when stored frozen.   
8. Immediately place the cryovials in crushed dry ice until transferred to an ultralow temperature freezer (≤ -70°C) for storage until shipment.  
9. Ship the complete set of "Aliquot A" samples for each patient afte r the last sample has 
been collected.   Ship the Aliquot B samples separately after verifying receipt of the 
Aliquot A samples.  Do not send the Aliquot A and Aliquot B samples for the same patient in the same package.   
10. Place the sample tubes for each patient in a separate zip lock plastic bag and seal the bag.   
11. Put at least three inches of crushed dry ice in a seamless styrofoam container.   
12. Place the plastic bag(s) containing the samples in the box, on top of the crushed dry ice, and cover with an additional three inches or more of dry ice.   
13. Seal the styrofoam container within a tight -fitting cardboard shipping box.   
14. Send the samples on Monday to Wednesday by overnight courier for delivery by 10:00  
a.m. on the following day.  Never ship samples on a Thursday or Friday.

100 APPENDIX H: DIARRHEA MANAGEMENT  
Diarrhea  is a common problem experienced  by many  patients and is a risk with olaparib as well 
as AT13387.  If it is not controlled quickly, it can lead to dehydration. 
 
WHEN TO CALL YOUR  DOCTOR TO REPORT DIARRHEA  
• Fever  100.5° or higher with diarrhea.  
• If you are  experiencing diarrhea for the first time after starting therapy.  Based on questions 
answered during that phone call, we will advise starting Imodium AD  if it seems the symptoms 
are related to the trea tment.  
• If you still have  diarrhea  24 hours after starting  Imodium AD ( your doctor may advise 
additional medications or want to evaluate you in person if there is a concern that you are becoming dehydrated).  
OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHEA:  
• For diarrhea t hat occurs more than 2 episodes a day , use Imodium AD. We recommend that 
you have Imodium AD on hand at home before  starting therapy. 
o 1st episode of diarrhea : Take  2 caplets  (4mg) 
o During the day: Take  1 caplet  (2mg) after each episode of d iarrhea  
o During the night: Take  2 caplets (4mg)  at bedtime  if you are still having diarrhea  
DRINK  PLENTY OF FLUIDS  
• Drink  8 to 10 large glasses of liquids  a day to replace those  lost by diarrhea.  Drink  small  
quantities  at a time slowly.  
• AVOID caffeinated, very hot, or very cold fluids  
Examples of fluids:  
o Water ( should only be part of the 8 to 10 glasses a day) 
o Jello   
o Gatorade   
o  Clear soup  or broth   
EAT  SMALL MEALS  OFTEN  
• A good choice of foods for diarrhea is the BRAT  diet: 
o B- bananas 
o R- rice 
o A- apple sauce 
o T- toast  
• When  these  foods are being well tolerated,  then you can add other  bland low fiber foods  
such as: 
o Chicken- white  meat  without the skin,  steamed  rice, crackers,  white  bread,  pasta 
noodles without sauce,  and canned  or cooked fruits  without skins  
o Foods high in potassium:  bananas,  apricots  without  skin, peach  nectar,  potatoes  
without  skin,  broccoli, halibut,  mushrooms, asparagus,  non- fat milk 
• Foods that can make diarrhea  and cramping  worse:  
o Fatty,  fried,  greasy,  or spicy  foods can cause more  problems and discomfort  
o High -fiber foods: bran, whole grain  cereals,  dried  fruit,  fruit skins, popcorn, nuts and 
vegetables  
o Foods that cause gas: Beer,  beans,  cabbage, carbonated  drink

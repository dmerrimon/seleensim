1.1 Purpose 
This Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describes the primary and secondary outcome 
measures and additional outcome measures of the NICHD P1081 study that will be included in 
the primary manuscript, and which address, at a minimum, the primary and key secondary 
objectives of the study . The Primary SAP outlines the general statistical approaches that will be 
used in the analysis of the study. It has been developed to facilitate discussion of the statistical 
analysis components among the study team, and to provide agreement between the study team 
and statisticians regarding the statistical analyses to be performed and presented in the primary 
analysis report . It also describes the analyses for the primary and secondary outcome measures 
that 
will be posted on ClinicalTrials.gov .  
Detailed outlines of tables, figures, and coding descriptions that will be included in the Primary 
Analysis Report are included in the Analysis Implementation Plan (AIP).  
Analyses for the Primary Analysis Report will be finalized once the last participant has completed 
the Week 24 study visit, all queries have been resolved, and the study database closure/data lock 
has been completed.  
Outlines of analyses for objectives and outcome measures not included in the Primary SAP will 
be provided in a separate SAP at a later date .

2 Study Overview 
2.1 Study Design 
P1081 is a multicenter, two arm, randomized, open-label trial comparing the ability to achieve 
virologic suppression at delivery, tolerability, and safety in HIV-1 infected pregnant women with a 
gestational age between 20 and 36 weeks who are antiretroviral naïve or have received short-
course zidovudine (for a maximum of 8 weeks) only for prevention of mother- to-child transmission 
(PMTCT) in previous pregnancies, and their infants. 
P1081 has a target enrollment of 334 evaluable mother-infant pairs (approximately 167 per 
treatment arm), which is projected to require enrolling approximately 394 mother-infant pairs. 
Mothers (and infants) will be randomized in equal proportions to one of the two treatment arms. 
The randomization will be stratified by gestational age at entry (20- <28 weeks, 28-<31 weeks, 
31-<34 weeks, and 34-<37 weeks) and by whether the mother will use lamivudine/zidovudine or 
an alternative, locally supplied nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). The rationale for 
stratifying the randomization by gestational age is that women who enter the study later in 
gestation will be less likely to achieve the desired viral load decrease compared with women who 
enroll earlier in gestation. The rationale for stratifying the randomization by the chosen NRTI 
backbone is ensure balance in the two treatment arms, in case of unforeseen differential effects 
on viral load, tolerance, safety, or pregnancy outcomes. 
Participants will be randomized to either arm A (lamivudine/zidovudine + efavirenz) or arm B 
(lamivudine/zidovudine + raltegravir) and receive their study drugs antepartum. During active 
labor, all participants will continue to receive study drugs. In addition, in place of the oral fixed 
dose combination of lamivudine/zidovudine, participants may receive intravenous zidovudine, 
other dosing regimens of oral zidovudine, or lamivudine and/or additional drugs during labor, 
according to local standard of care/guidelines.  
Infants will receive ARV treatment according to specific local guidelines. 
All women will receive their randomized study regimen from study entry through delivery. Women 
who meet local guidelines for receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) will continue triple ART after 
delivery according to local guidelines.  
2.2 Hypotheses 
Primary Hypothesis: 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 6 of 22 1. Efavirenz and raltegravir are effective, safe and tolerable as part of HAART regimens to 
be used in late pregnancy when rapid viral load suppression is for PMTCT of HIV.  
Secondary Hypotheses:  
1. Efavirenz-based triple ARV regimens will decrease the level and infectivity of plasma and 
cell-associated virus more rapidly (by 1 week of ART) compared to II-based triple ARV 
regimens.  
2. Transmitted HIV drug-resistance among women will be prevalent at 10-15% of the 
population. Transmitted resistance will be associated with delayed decay of plasma HIV-
1 RNA levels compared to women without primary resistance, and, when ART is stopped 
with further selection of resistance (especially selection of lamivudine and/or NNRTI 
resistance). 
2.3 Study Objectives 
This Primary S AP address es the primary and key secondary objectives listed in the study 
protocol . Other study objectives listed in the protocol will be addressed in subsequent analysis 
pla
ns. All objectives outlined in the protocol are listed below. Those that are not covered by the 
Pr
imary SAP are indicated as “ Not addressed in this Primary SAP ”.  
Note: One secondary objective, to “Compare decay of plasma HIV-1 infectivity between the 
treatment regimens”, is no longer relevant. This objective was applicable under Version 2.0 of the 
protocol when it was a three-arm study with an arm containing a Protease Inhibitor (PI). Because 
this arm was dropped in Version 3.0 of the protocol, the objective is no longer valid. Therefore, 
the infectivity assays will not be run and this objective will not  be addressed by this, or any 
subsequent analysis of P1081 data. 
 
2.3.1 Primary Objectives 
1. To compare the ability of two triple ARV regimens (one containing efavirenz and the other 
raltegravir) begun during the third trimester of pregnancy to achieve a viral load of <200 
copies/mL at the time of delivery. [Protocol Objective 2.1.1] 
2. To compare the safety and tolerability of two triple ARV regimens (one containi ng 
efavirenz and the other raltegravir) begun during the third trimester of pregnancy. 
[Protocol Objective 2.1.2] 
2.3.2 Secondary Objectives 
1. To compare the kinetics of viral decay between the treatment regimens [Protocol 
Objective 2.2.1] 
a. Compare decay of plasma and vaginal HIV-1 RNA and DNA between the 
treatment regimens. 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 7 of 22 b. Compare decay of plasma HIV-1 infectivity between the treatment regimens. 
[Note: because the PI arm was dropped from a prior version of this study, 
this objective is no longer relevant; the infectivity assays will not be run 
and this objective will not be addressed.  
2. To compare infant outcomes including stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight, 
perinatal HIV transmission and to compare (in HIV-infected infants) drug resistance 
between the two treatment regimens.  
3. To assess the baseline prevalence and selection of HIV-1 drug-resistance to the study 
drugs, using standard genotyping and ultrasensitive genotyping methods. 
2.3.3 Exploratory Objectives 
1. To describe the population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of efavirenz and raltegravir 
during the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum using sparse sampling and to 
evaluate potential relationships between PK parameters, pharmacogenomics and viral 
load changes. [ Not addressed in this Primary SAP ] 
2. To describe the maternal vaginal and infant nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal 
microbiome environment and the potential association with adverse outcome in HIV 
exposed uninfected children. [ Not addressed in this Primary SAP ] 
2.4 Overview of Sample Size Considerations 
Justification for the proposed sample size is given in Protocol Section 8.4.1. In brief, t he target 
sample size of 334 evaluable mother-infant pairs was chosen to provide 80% power to detect an 
important difference (an absolute difference of ≥15% was deemed clinically important to detect) 
between the two treatment arms in the primary efficacy outcome measure (defined in Protocol 
Section 8.2.1), with a two-sided Type I error rate (α) of 0.05, and allowing for interim efficacy 
analyses and non- evaluable women. Allowing for 5% of women to be non-evaluable for the 
primary efficacy outcome measure and another 10% of enrolled women to have genotypic 
resistance to study drug(s) at entry (see Protocol Section 1.6 for details regarding this 
assumption), an overall non-evaluability rate of 15% was assumed. Under this assumption, a 
target accrual of 394 enrolled women was proposed to achieve the target evaluable sample size 
of 334 women. 
2.5 Overview of Formal Interim Monitoring 
2.5.1 Ongoing Team Monitoring 
The core protocol team will have regular conference calls to ensure that its members are aware 
of ongoing issues concerning the conduct of the study and will review reports about the status of 
the study on a monthly basis (the frequency may be decreased if the study team deems this 
appropriate). These will include reports on accrual, baseline characteristics, AEs, specimen 
completeness, and the proportions of women who are non-evaluable for the primary outcome 
measure or are found to have had genotypic resistance to any of the study drugs at screening (as 
defined in protocol Appendix IV). These reports will present results that are pooled across the 
randomized treatment arms and not broken out according to arm.  
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 8 of 22 The core protocol team will monitor safety closely. A summary of maternal and infant AEs will 
initially be generated monthly to help identify possible safety issues early on. The frequency of 
these reports may be decreased to bimonthly or quarterly if no significant safety concerns are 
identified.  
Accrual to this study will be monitored by the NICHD and protocol co-chairs in accordance with 
standard operating procedures. Also, the team will monitor site protocol activation of the African 
sites to ensure that the number of sites participating is sufficient to complete the accrual in a 
timely fashion. If accrual is not adequate to meet the enrollment goals specified in protocol 
Section 8.4.2, the team will identify the reasons for lack of accrual and possibly amend the 
protocol accordingly. 
2.5.2 DSMB Reviews 
 
This study will also be monitored by a NIAID-sponsored Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). The DSMB will review information concerning accrual, characteristics of participants, 
quality and completeness of data and specimen collection, retention, AEs, and the proportions of 
women who are non-evaluable for the primary outcome measure or who are found to have had 
genotypic resistance to any of the study drugs at screening (as defined in protocol Appendix IV) 
at least annually after the first woman is randomized.  
Two interim efficacy analyses will be conducted when data on the primary outcome measure are 
available for approximately one third and two thirds of the planned enrollment. Under the accrual 
assumptions in the protocol, we anticipate that these interim analyses would be reviewed 
approximately one year and two years after the first enrollment to Version 3.0. The interim 
efficacy analysis schedule may be modified if accrual assumptions turn out to be inaccurate or if 
recommended by the DSMB.  
The interim efficacy analyses will be based on comparison of the primary outcome measure 
between treatment arms, as described in Section 2.8 below. The Haybittle-Peto stopping 
boundary will be used as a guideline for considering a recommendation of early stopping. This 
guideline requires a p-value <0.001 at an interim analysis for early stopping to be considered. 
To assist with decisions about recommending early stopping for lack of benefit (futility), 
conditional power and predicted interval analyses will be presented to the DSMB. The conditional 
power analysis will assess the power to detect the hypothesized treatment differences specified 
in protocol Section 8.4 upon continuation, conditional on the data observed so far. The predicted 
interval analysis will provide information on effect size estimates and potential improvement in 
precision upon continuation, under various assumptions regarding the data yet to be collected 
(e.g., that hypothesized treatment differences are true, that the observed trend continues, that th e 
null hypothesis is true, and under best-case and worst-case scenarios).  As a non-binding 
guideline for lack of benefit (futility), if the conditional power is low, say less than 20%, and the 
projected improvements in precision of effect estimates upon continuation are small, a 
recommendation of early termination may be considered. However, due to the lack of and need 
for efficacy and safety data for potent ARV regimens in the P1081 study population, the protocol 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 9 of 22 team requests that the DSMB consider both the results of the above analyses and other factors 
that may argue for or against continuation (including whether there are safety or ethical concerns, 
the accrual rate, information to be gained from secondary objectives and sub-studies, new 
internal or external scientific information, and the existence/progress of other trials addressing the 
study questions), in deciding whether to recommend early stopping.  
Although a recommendation for early termination would be based primarily on the primary 
efficacy analysis, consideration should be given to the consistency of effects seen on the primary 
and secondary efficacy outcome measures. Strong evidence of a difference in the primary 
outcome measure favoring one arm, but with evidence favoring the other arm with an important 
secondary efficacy outcome measure, might support the continuation of both arms. However, a 
significant difference between arms with respect to a secondary efficacy outcome measure, in the 
absence of strong evidence of a difference with respect to the primary outcome measure, would 
not be grounds for early stopping of an arm. 
3 Outcome Measures 
This Primary SAP includes analytic detail for all primary and secondary outcome measures that 
will be included in the Primary Final Analysis Report or submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov (regardless 
of the timeline for reporting). 
Note: As noted above, one secondary objective, to “Compare decay of plasma HIV-1 infectivity 
between the treatment regimens”, is no longer relevant and the infectivity assays will not be run . 
Therefore, there are no outcome measures associated with this objective.   
 
3.1 Primary Outcome Measures 
3.1.1 Efficacy  
Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure [Protocol Objective 2.1.1]: Plasma HIV-1 viral load <200 
copies/mL at the delivery visit (or if there is no viral load measurement at the delivery visit, viral 
load <200 copies/mL within 3 weeks prior to delivery).  
3.1.2 Safety and Tolerability 
Primary Safety Outcome Measure [Protocol Objective 2.1.2]: Occurrence of at least one “new” 
adverse event of Grade ≥3 as defined in the DAIDS Toxicity Grading Table through Week 24 
postpartum. This analysis will be done separately for each of women and infants. “New” events 
for women are signs and symptoms, hematologies, chemistries, and diagnoses that occur on or 
after randomization (or increase in Grade after randomization). For infants, “new” events are 
those adverse events that occurred on or after birth.   
Primary Tolerability Outcome Measure [Protocol Objective 2.1.2]: Permanent discontinuation of 
efavirenz or raltegravir (whichever was assigned) prior to labor and delivery for any reason 
(including loss to follow-up) will be considered a treatment failure in this analysis (note: switching 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 10 of 22 any of the NRTIs with continuation of efavirenz or raltegravir will not be considered a treatment 
failure). Temporary holds of efavirenz or raltegravir will not be considered a treatment failure. 
 
3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
3.2.1 Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures 
The following are secondary efficacy outcome measures: 
Viral Load at Delivery [Protocol Objective 2.1.1] 
 Virologic suppression to below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) of the assay at, or within 
21 days prior to, delivery.  
 Almost all women had their plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load at delivery (or last viral load up to 21 
days prior to delivery) measured using an assay with an LLQ=40. For these women, a viral 
load ≤40 with a censor code indicating that the viral load was below the LLQ will be 
considered successes. Others will be considered failures.  
 For women who had their viral load measured using an assay with an LLD≠40, the outcome 
measure will be defined as follows: 
o For women who had their viral load measured using an assay with a LLQ<40, all women 
will be considered successes who had a viral load <40, regardless of whether the censor 
code indicates that the measured viral load was below the LLQ. If the measured viral load 
is ≥40, they will be considered failures.  
o For women who had their viral load measured using an assay with a LLQ>40, the 
outcome measure will be defined in two ways. 
 In the primary analysis of this outcome measure, they will be considered successes if 
their viral load was ≤LLQ and the censor code indicates that the value was below the 
LLQ, regardless of what the LLQ for that assay was. Otherwise, they will be 
considered failures. 
 In a sensitivity analysis of this outcome measure, all women who had a LLQ >40 will 
be considered failures, regardless of what the measured viral load and censor code 
were. 
Composite Efficacy Outcome Measure [Protocol Objectives 2.1.1 and 2.1.2] 
A key secondary outcome measure will be a composite outcome measure that combines efficacy 
and tolerability (Protocol Objectives 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Specifically, this composite outcome will be 
a binary outcome measure of (1) a successful viral load (plasma HIV-1 RNA) decrease from entry 
to study week 2 (day 11-17) and viral load <1,000 copies/ml at all time points after 4 weeks on 
study drugs, until delivery; and (2) tolerability (remaining on the assigned study regimen). The 
viral load decrease and tolerability components of the composite outcome measure will be 
defined as follows:  
 Rapid viral load decrease for women who deliver after 4 weeks on study drugs: A successful 
viral load decrease is defined as having both (i) a plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥2.0 log10 below 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 11 of 22 baseline or <200 copies/mL at Week 2 (day 11- 17 after initiation of treatment) and (ii) a 
plasma HIV-1 RNA level <1,000 copies/mL at all time points after 4 weeks on study drugs, 
until delivery.  
 Rapid viral load decrease for women who deliver before or at 4 weeks on study drugs: A 
successful viral load decrease is defined as a plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥2.0 log10 below 
baseline or <200 copies/mL at Week 2 (day 11- 17 after initiation of treatment).  
 Tolerability: Permanent discontinuation of efavirenz or raltegravir prior to delivery for any 
reason (including loss to follow-up) will be considered a treatment failure in this analysis 
(note: switching any of the NRTIs with continuation of efavirenz or raltegravir will not be 
considered a treatment failure). Temporary holds of efavirenz or raltegravir will not be 
considered a treatment failure.  
The baseline value will be the value obtained at the study entry visit. If this value is not available, 
then the baseline value will be the screening value. If a woman has more than one viral load 
measurement within a visit window, the earliest measurement will be used in the analysis.  
3.2.2 Kinetics of Viral Decay Outcome Measures 
Kinetics of Viral Decay [Protocol Objective 2.2.1] 
 HIV-1 RNA and DNA viral load in maternal blood and vaginal swabs (only blood plasma RNA 
viral load will be analyzed in the primary analysis report; vaginal swabs and blood plasma 
DNA viral load will be assayed at a later date) at Week 4 and 6 from initiation of treatment.  
o For viral load, the outcome measures are viral load <200 copies/mL and <LLQ. This 
outcome will be analyzed twice; once at Week 4 and once at Week 6. The viral loads 
closest to 28 days (but within 24-32 days) and 42 days (but within 38-46 days) from 
initiation of treatment will be used for Week 4 and Week 6 respectively. The viral load 
obtained closest to the target date will be used for each visit. In the event that there are 
multiple viral loads that were obtained the same amount of time from the target visit date, 
the earliest of the viral loads will be used. 
o  
 
 Change on a l og10 scale in HIV-1 RNA and DNA viral load from entry (or screening if there is 
no entry viral load) to each time point prior to delivery. 
o The viral load at each time point will be the viral load closes t to the time point and within 
the allowable visit window given in the Schedule of Evaluations (Protocol Appendix I). If 
there are multiple viral loads that were taken an equal amount of time from the target 
date for that visit, the earliest will be used. 
o Log 10 change from baseline to Week X will be calculated as Log 10(Week X viral load ) – 
Log 10(Baseline viral load ). 
 
 Infectivity of plasma during the initial 2 weeks of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is not 
addressed ; as previously described, this outcome measure is no longer relevant and the 
assays will not be done ). 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 12 of 22 3.2.3 Infant Outcomes: 
Adverse Pregnancy Events [Protocol Objective 2.2.2]: 
The following adverse pregnancy outcomes will be examined individually and analyzed both 
individually and in combination: 
o Stillbirth/fetal demise  
o Premature birth (<37 weeks gestation at delivery)  
o Low birth weight (<2500 grams)  
For each analysis, the unit of analysis will be the pregnancy (i.e. mother-infant pair). All pairs 
where at least one delivery occurred on-study will be eligible for each analysis. If a mother 
carrying twins had discordant pregnancy outcomes, the mother will be considered an event if 
either of the twins had that outcome. A sensitivity analysis will include only M-I pairs where the 
mother was evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis.  
In addition to the analyses for each individual adverse pregnancy outco me, a composite analysis 
will be performed. A M-I pair will be considered an event if an infant (or at least one of the infants 
in the case of twins) that was delivered on-study experienced at least one of the listed adverse 
pregnancy events. The analysis population will be the same as for the individual analyses. 
Similarly, a sensitivity analysis that includes only M-I pairs where the mother was evaluable for 
the primary efficacy analysis will be performed. 
NOTE: If numbers permit, both the individual analyses and the composite analysis will be 
repeated, with more extreme definitions for premature birth (<34 weeks gestation at delivery) and 
low birth weight (<1500 grams).  
Infant HIV-Infection [Protocol Objective 2.2.2] 
 Infant HIV-infection status will be analyzed. Infants who are classified as “Infected” or 
“Probably infected, based on best available data” will be considered infected. Infants who are 
classified as “Uninfected” or “Negative, based on best available data” will be considered 
uninfected.  
HIV-1 Drug Resistance in HIV Infected Infants [Protocol Objective 2.2.2] 
 HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (as defined in Protocol Appendix IV) will be examined at the 
time of detection of infant HIV infection. These samples will not be assayed in time to include 
in the primary analysis report, so they will be included in a subsequent analysis report. 
 
3.2.4 HIV-1 Drug Resistance Outcome Measures 
HIV-1 Drug Resistance [Protocol Objective 2.2.3] 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 13 of 22  HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (as defined in Protocol Appendix IV) will be examined at the 
following timepoints: 
o Screening (among women) 
o Between 2-4 weeks postpartum (among women who have stopped ART)  
o At the time of inadequate virologic response as defined in Protocol Section 6.2.9  
 All women who have a resistance result for at least one class (RT and/or IN) of ARVs at that 
time point (screening, postpartum, and/or at the time of inadequate virologic response as 
defined in the Protocol) will be evaluable at that time point. Because IN resistance is 
expected to be rare, RT and IN resistance will be analyzed and described as separate 
outcomes.   
 Only screening samples among women will be assayed in time to be included in the primary 
analysis report. All postpartum samples for women will be assayed and analyzed in a 
subsequent analysis report.  
3.2.5 Post Hoc Outcome Measures 
Composite Ranked Endpoint of Pregnancy Outcomes and Safety Events [Protocol Objectives 
2.1.2 and 2.2.2] 
 The following outcomes will be ranked from worst (top) to best (bottom): 
o Infant or Maternal death  
o Fetal death (≥ 20 weeks gestation) 
o Infant HIV infection 
o Extremely and very early preterm (<34 weeks gestational age at delivery )  
o Congenital anomaly 
o Extremely low birthweight (<1500 grams) 
o Preterm delivery (34 to <37 weeks gestational age at delivery )  
o Hospitalization 
o Low birthweight (1500-<2500 grams) 
o Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (maternal or infant) 
o None of the above 
 The composite ranked outcome will then be analyzed.  
Time-to Viral Suppression 
 Time-to viral load<200 copies/mL will be calculated as the number of days from entry . 
Because viral suppression is measured at distinct visits, true suppression occurs sometime 
between the last visit where viral load≥200 copies/mL and the first visit where viral load<200 
copies/mL. Therefore, we calculate an interval censored time- to-event as follows: 
o The lower bound of the interval will be the number of days from entry to the last observed 
patient visit on or before delivery where the participant did not have a viral load<20 0 
copies/mL. 
o The upper bound of the interval will be the number of days from entry to the first visit on 
or before delivery at which the participant had a viral load<200 copies/mL. 
o Participants who deliver or go off-study prior to delivery and prior to achieving viral 
load<200 copies/mL will only have a lower bound (i.e. these participants will be censored 
at their last contact on or before delivery).

  Page 14 of 22 3.3 Exploratory Outcome Measures 
All exploratory outcome measures will be analyzed at a later date. The samples needed to 
address these outcomes will be assayed in batch at a later date; thus, the analysis of these 
objectives and the outcome measures used will be described in detail in a subsequent analysis 
plan, and are not addressed in this Primary SAP. These outcome measures will not be submitted 
to CT.gov. 
4 Statistical Principles 
4.1 General Considerations 
 All participants randomized will be considered eligible for inclusion in analyses, regardless of 
whether they are later determined to be ineligible for the protocol. Specific analysis 
populations may have additional requirements for eligibility. 
 Additions of or changes in outcome measures that are identified after analysis has begun will 
be identified as post hoc. 
 Unless otherwise noted, baseline/entry values refer to the value closest to and on or before 
randomization. 
 Visit windows used in analysis will be the expected date of the visit +/- 3 days (e.g. a Week 4 
analysis visit would consider values observed from day 25-day 31). If there are multiple 
values within an analysis window, the value in the database that was observed closest to the 
expected date of the visit will be used. In the event that multiple values are equidistant from 
the expected visit date, the earliest of these observed values will be used. 
 Because this is a randomized clinical trial, no statistical comparisons across groups for 
baseline characteristics are planned. 
 For interim efficacy reviews, the Haybittle-Peto stopping guideline will be used. P-
values<0.001 will be considered statistically significant, and may inform the DSMB’s decision 
to stop the trial. For safety analyses at interim reviews, the nominal P-value will be 
considered significant if P<0.05. Because the Haybittle-Peto guideline is used for each 
interim efficacy analysis, no adjustment for alpha-spending will be used. In final analysis, all 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability comparisons will be considered statistically significant if 
P<0.05.  
 For Phase III and pivotal Phase II and IV studies, NIH requires primary analyses of treatment 
comparisons to be summarized by sex and by race and treatment interactions with sex and 
race to be tested.  For NICHD P1081, the primary analyses of treatment comparisons will be 
summarized by race and treatment interactions with race will be tested (analyses by sex are 
not possible because NICHD P1081 does not enroll men). These analyses are required so do 
not represent multiple comparisons and are presented in the primary study analysis 
regardless of power issues. 
4.2 Analysis Populations 
4.2.1 Eligibility Violations and Exclusions 
Two women who were randomized to NICHD P1081 were later discovered to have received 
ARVs prior to study entry (participants are required to be ARV naïve, with at most 8-weeks short-
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 15 of 22 course ZDV for the prevention of transmission in a previous pregnancy). These women were kept 
on study per the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) principle, and are eligible for inclusion in all analyses 
(provided they meet all other eligibility requirements for that analysis).  
One infant who was delivered on-study (as a live birth) was noted to be part of a multiple 
gestation. However, the M-I pair was randomized as a singleton birth. Upon querying the site, the 
woman was determined to have had a spontaneous abortion that resulted in fetal demise of the 
second infant at approximately 18 weeks gestation. Because eligible women for the study must 
have a gestational age of at least 20 weeks at entry, this spontaneous abortion outcome occurre d 
prior to study entry. Because the twin’s outcome occurred prior to study entry, this woman and 
her live-birth infant will be considered to be a singleton M-I pair in all analyses of outcome 
measures where a comparison is performed (i.e. a P-value is produced); the twin and its 
outcomes will be excluded from all such analyses. However, due to data discrepancies that would 
result from reporting a singleton birth from a multiple gestation, the twin that was a fetal demise at 
18 weeks was retroactively enrolled so that the outcome may be reported in descriptive tables.  
4.2.2 Primary Efficacy Population 
The primary efficacy outcome is viral load at (or within 21 days prior to) delivery. Therefore, 
eligible women will be those women who remain on-study through delivery and have a delivery 
CRF in the database. Evaluable women will be those with either a screening or entry viral load 
≥200 copies/mL, a valid HIV-1 RNA viral load at (or within 21 days prior to) delivery, and a valid 
genotypic resistance result for all study ARV classes that indicates no known resistance 
mutations (a detailed list of protocol-specified resistance mutations is given in Protocol Appendix 
IV). Women who have known resistance or a missing resistance result for at least one study ARV 
class will be excluded from the primary efficacy analysis, but will be included in sensitivity 
analyses (further details in Section 4.3 Analysis Approaches).  
4.2.3 Primary Safety Population 
All women and infants enrolled will be considered eligible for inclusion in their respective primary 
safety analyses (the primary safety analysis will be done separately, both among women and 
among infants). Women who receive at least one dose of their assigned study drug, and their 
infants, will be evaluable for their respective primary safety analyses. 
4.2.4 Primary Tolerability Population 
All women enrolled will be considered eligible for inclusion in the primary tolerability analysis. 
Women who received at least one dose of their assigned study drug will be considered evaluable. 
Because only women receive study drug, infants will not be included in this population.   
4.3 Analytic Approaches 
4.3.1 Primary Analyses 
For each of the primary efficacy, safety, and tolerability analyses, the comparison between arms 
of the proportion of participants who meet each respective outcome will be assessed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the following gestational age strata: 20-<28 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 16 of 22 weeks, 28-<31 weeks, 31-<34 weeks, and 34-<37 weeks. Further considerations unique to each 
analysis are described in following sections.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis will be a comparison of the proportion of women who have viral 
load <200 ml at (or within 21 days prior to) delivery. This analysis will be performed three ways:  
A. The primary analysis will exclude women who have genotypic resistance to any study drugs 
at screening or do not have complete resistance results.  
B. A secondary analysis will include these women, to compare the two real-world strategies of 
starting therapy with either Arm A or Arm B and possibly switching ARVs when the resistance 
test results become available, subject to the potential biases described in protocol Section 
8.1. 
C. For the final analysis only, a sensitivity, “all-comers” analysis will include all  include all 
women who have a viral load measurement at or within 21 days prior to delivery, regardless 
of genotypic resistance results or baseline viral load. This analysis is subject to the same 
biases as the secondary analysis above.  
D. For interim analyses only, if there are substantial numbers of missing raltegravir resistance 
results (e.g., >10% missing) because integrase resistance testing is not standard procedure 
at some labs, a sensitivity analysis will repeat the primary analysis after including the women 
who are missing raltegravir resistance results but are otherwise evaluable, and these women 
will be counted as having no raltegravir resistance (based on two studies showing a very low 
prevalence of genotypic resistance to integrase inhibitors in Brazil).  
For interim analyses only, the above efficacy analyses will be restricted to evaluable women who 
had an estimated delivery date 4 weeks or more before the data freeze date, to avoid 
overrepresentation of preterm deliveries that occur right before the data freeze date. A sensitivity 
analysis will also be conducted in which the above analyses are repeated after including all 
evaluable women who delivered up to the data freeze date. For the final analysis (when all 
women will have already delivered), no restriction on estimated delivery date will be used in the 
efficacy analyses.    
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted as needed to assess the potential impact of missing data 
on the conclusions of the study. Of primary concern are missing viral load measurements at 
delivery for women who have achieved a successful viral load decrease at time points at which 
measurements are available. In sample size calculations, it was assumed that approximately 5% 
of women would be missing their viral load measurement at delivery (or within 21 days prior).  
Therefore, the proportion of women who have a viral load measurement at delivery (or within 21 
days prior to delivery) will be examined, and sensitivity analyses will be done if <95% of eligible 
women have a viral load measurement (i.e. if >5% of women do not have a delivery viral load 
measurement). The sensitivity analyses will be done in two ways: (a) as an extreme, by assuming 
that a missing viral load measurement at delivery would have shown successful or unsuccessful 
viral load decrease in a way that would minimize the difference between randomized groups, and 
(b) more plausibly, by assuming that a missing viral load measurement at delivery would have 
shown an unsuccessful viral load decrease with probability equal to the estimated probability of 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 17 of 22 an unsuccessful viral load decrease at delivery among women in the same group who had that 
evaluation and had a successful viral load decrease at other evaluations prior to delivery.    
If the proportion of women who are missing their viral load measurement at delivery is much 
larger than expected, multiple imputation analyses may also be warranted. Therefore, if >10% of 
women are missing their viral load measurement at delivery (i.e. <90% of eligible women have a 
viral load measurement at delivery) multiple imputation will be performed. The primary efficacy 
analysis will be replicated including women who were missing their viral load at delivery (but 
excluding those who were non-evaluable for other reasons). These women who have a missing 
delivery viral load will have that viral load imputed via logistic regression. Thirty imputations will 
be performed and each imputed dataset will be analyzed individually as described in the primary 
analysis above. The CMH statistic that is calculated in each of these thirty analyses will then be 
transformed and pooled to generate an overall CMH statistic and associated P-value (Note: 
Because the chi-square distribution is highly skewed for smaller degrees of freedom, obtaining a 
combined result of the CMH test from multiple imputations requires a transformation to normalize 
the CMH statistic. In this analysis, the Wilson-Hilferty transformation will be used for this purpose .  
Since both the randomization and primary analysis are stratified by gestational age at enrollment 
(because women who enrolled later in gestation would be less likely to achieve virologic 
suppression at delivery), a test for a treatment- by-gestational age stratum interaction will be 
implemented. This test will be performed via logistic regression among the primary efficacy 
analysis population, and will include treatment (efavirenz vs raltegravir), gestational age stratum 
(20-<28 weeks vs. 28-<31 weeks vs 31-<34 weeks vs. 34-<37 weeks) , and the treatment- by-
gestational-age-stratu m interaction as predictors. The primary outcome measure (HIV-1 RNA 
viral load <200 copies/mL) will be the response variable. If the model does not converge, for 
example due to a small or zero event-rate in one arm/stratum combination, then adjacent 
gestational age strata will be combined. They will be combined first by trimester (20-<28 weeks 
vs. 28-<37 weeks). If this model also fails to converge, additional combinations will be made by 
combining adjacent strata. These combinations will attempt to keep the number evaluable in each 
new stratum balanced, and may combine adjacent strata when one stratum (or more) have a low 
or zero event rate.  
If there is evidence of a significant treatment- by-gestational age stratum interaction, stratum-
specific estimates of the primary efficacy outcome measure for each treatment arm will be 
provided for the four gestational age strata used for the randomization, for each of the three 
efficacy analysis populations:  the primary efficacy analysis population (Analysis A above) ,  the 
population that includes those with genotypic resistance (Analysis B above), and the population 
that additionally includes those with baseline/screening RNA<200 copies/mL (Analysis C above) .    
 
Primary Safety Analysis 
The primary safety analysis will be a comparison of the proportion of participants who 
experienced at least one grade 3+ adverse event on or after randomization. This comparison will 
be done twice; once for women and once for infants.  
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 18 of 22 For women, this analysis will be replicated in additional sensitivity analyses. The safety sensitivity 
analysis will replicate the primary safety analysis, but will be censored at delivery; only events 
that occur on or before delivery will be considered (the primary safety analysis includes all events 
through the end of follow-up at 24 weeks postpartum). Both the primary and sensitivity safety 
analyses will also be replicated including only women who were evaluable for the primary efficacy 
outcome measure.  
Primary Tolerability Analysis 
The primary tolerability analysis will be a comparison of the proportion of women who 
discontinued their assigned treatment, for any reason, prior to delivery. This comparison is only 
performed among women because infants do not receive study treatment.  
 
4.3.2 Secondary Analyses 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
o Viral load <LLQ at delivery 
 The proportion of women who achieve a viral load below the lower limit of 
quantification at (or within 21 days prior to) delivery will be compared between arms 
using a CMH test. Women who were evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis will 
be evaluable for this outcome measure. If there is a significant proportion of women 
who are non-evaluable due to missing genotypic resistance results, this analysis will 
be replicated in sensitivity analyses using the same approach as the primary efficacy 
analysis.  
 The analysis population, sensitivity analyses, and stratum-specific analyses of this 
outcome measure will be the same as for the primary efficacy outcome. 
 The above analyses will be replicated using a standardized LLQ. The definition of 
this outcome has been defined previously in Section 3 of this Primary SAP. 
o Composite Efficacy Analysis 
 The composite efficacy analysis will be a comparison of the composite efficacy 
outcome measure between arms using a CMH test stratified by gestational age at 
entry. The gestational age strata will be the same as for the primary analyses. 
 Similarly, the composite efficacy analysis will be performed in the same three ways 
as the primary efficacy analysis. The interim analyses will also be restricted to 
women who had an estimated delivery date four weeks or more prior to the data 
freeze date. For final analysis, no restriction on estimated delivery date will be used. 
 Differential rates of non-evaluability or preterm delivery between study arms could 
lead to biased results; for example, an excess of preterm deliveries in one arm could 
lead to more women in that arm delivering before 4 weeks on study drugs and 
therefore not needing to maintain viral load <1,000 copies/ml after 4 weeks on study 
drugs, which could inflate the response rate in that arm. To address this concern, the 
rates of non-evaluability and preterm delivery will be compared between study arms, 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 19 of 22 additional analyses will compare the study arms with respect to each individual 
component of the composite outcome measure, and sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted to assess the potential impact of missing evaluations on the conclusions 
of the study (see Protocol Section 4.3.1 for details). 
 
Kinetics of Viral Decay Analyses 
o Maternal HIV-1 RNA blood plasma viral load at Week s 4 and 6 
 The proportion of women who have viral load <200 copies/mL at Week 4 from 
initiation of treatment will be compared between the two arms via a CMH test 
stratified by gestational age at entry. This analysis will also be performed at Week 6.   
 The population for both analyses will include women who have a baseline viral load 
measurement; additionally, the comparisons at Week 4 and Week 6 will be 
performed among women who have a viral load result for that week.  
 
o Log 10 change in maternal HIV-1 RNA blood plasma viral load from entry to each time 
point prior to delivery 
 We will analyze this outcome measure descriptively at each time point. The median 
(Q1-Q3) change in Log 10 viral load will be presented.  
 The population for this analysis will include women who have a baseline viral load 
measurement; additionally, the descriptive statistics at each week will be calculated 
among women who have a viral load result for that week.  
 
o Log 10 change in maternal HIV-1 RNA vaginal viral load, as well as both blood plasma and 
vaginal DNA viral load, will be analyzed as above among women. This analysis will be 
performed at a later date, when the virology results are available, and will not be included 
in the primary analysis report.  
Infant Outcomes 
o The proportion of infants who experience each of the following outcomes will be 
compared between the treatment arms. Because there are expected to be small numbers 
of each event observed, each comparison will be performed utilizing a Fisher’s exact test .  
 The following events will be analyzed 
 Sillbirth/fetal demise 
 Premature birth will be assessed twice; once considering <34 weeks gestational 
age as a premature birth, and once considering <37 weeks gestational age as a 
premature birth 
 Low birth weight will be assessed twice; once considering a weight of <1500 
grams as a low birth weight and once considering <2500 grams as a low birth 
weight. 
 Infant HIV infection status  
 The unit of analysis will be the M-I pair. If a woman had a multiple gestation, that M- I 
pair will be considered an event if at least one of the infants delivered experienced 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 20 of 22 that event. All women who delivered on study, and their infants, will be eligible for 
each analysis. Evaluable M-I pairs will be those that had a value recorded for that 
outcome measure. In the case of a multiple gestation, an M-I pair will be evaluable 
for analysis of each outcome measure if at least one of the infants had a recorded 
value for that outcome measure. 
o Additionally, the proportion of M-I pairs that experience at least one adverse pregnancy 
outcome will be analyzed.  
 The analysis will be performed with two groups of events.  
 The first considers stillbirth, very premature birth (<34 weeks gestation), and very 
low birth weight (<1500 grams) as events.  
 The second considers stillbirth, premature birth (<37 weeks gestation) and low 
birth weight (<2500 grams) as events. 
 Both analyses will be performed using a Fisher’s exact test. If the number of events 
permits, this test will also be replicated using a CMH test stratified by gestational age 
at entry (using the same gestational age strata as in the primary analyses). 
 Similarly, the unit of analysis will be the M-I pair. All women who delivered on study, 
and their infants, will be eligible for this analysis. Evaluable M-I pairs will be those 
where at least one infant in that gestation had a value recorded for at least one of the 
outcomes (birthweight, gestational age at birth, delivery outcome). A M-I pair will be 
considered an event if at least one of the infants born on study as part of that 
gestation had at least one of the outcomes.  
o Among the HIV-infected infants, any HIV-1 drug resistance mutations defined in the 
Protocol (Appendix IV) that are identified at the time of first positive HIV-1 RNA test will 
be listed (the numbers are anticipated to be too small for any formal comparisons or 
summary statistics). 
 Note: Infant resistance data will not be available at the time of the primary final 
analysis, and thus will not be included in the primary analysis report.   
HIV-1 Drug Resistance 
o The proportion of women who show any resistance mutation defined in the Protocol 
(Appendix IV) on a sample taken at or before entry will be assessed descriptively, and a 
95% confidence interval will be estimated using a Wilson score. The proportion of women 
who show resistance to each individual class of antiretrovirals (reverse transcriptase and 
integrase inhibitors) will also be assessed, and a 95% Wilson score confidence interval 
will be estimated. There will be no formal comparison between arms.   
o A similar analytic approach will be used to estimate the proportion of women who have, 
or have developed, genotypic resistance to study drugs at Week 2-4 postpartum and at 
the time of inadequate virologic response.  
o Note: The post-entry resistance data will not be available at the time of the primary final 
analysis, and thus will not be included in the primary analysis report.   
4.3.3 Post Hoc Analyses 
DOOR-type Composite Pregnancy Outcome 
NICHD P1081  Version 1.0 
Primary Statistical Analysis Plan   02/28/2019 
 
  Page 21 of 22 o The DOOR-type outcome analysis will be an analysis of the composite pregnancy 
outcome measure , the Composite Ranked Endpoint of Pregnancy Outcomes and Safety 
Events. This analysis will compare the two treatment arms via an ordinal logistic 
regression, adjusted for gestational age at entry (the same gestational age strata used as 
in the primary efficacy analysis will be included as a covariate).  
o Sensitivity analysis: the above analysis will be replicated including only M-I pairs where 
the mother was evaluable for the primary efficacy outcome measure.   
 
Time-to Viral Suppression 
o Time-to viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA viral load<200 copies/mL) curves will be estimated 
using the Expectation Maximization Iterative Convex Minorant (EMICM) algorithm in 
SAS, using PROC ICLIFETEST.  
 The generalized log-rank statistic will be used to compare the treatment arms. The 
default weighting method of Sun (i.e. all weights are equal to one) will be used.  
 The variance and standard error of both the survival curves and the generalized log-
rank statistic will be estimated using multiple imputation. The seed for the imputations 
will be the SAS date (20180) that corresponds to the date the latest version of the 
protocol was finalized (April 2nd, 2015), and 1000 imputations will be performed .  
 Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for Q1, median, and Q3 time-to viral 
load<200 copies/mL will also be estimated for each treatment arm using the EMICM 
algorithm. 
o Primary analysis: all women who received at least one dose of study drug and had 
baseline and/or screening viral load ≥200 copies/mL will be included. 
o Sensitivity analysis: the above analysis will be replicated including only women who were 
evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis (Analysis A).

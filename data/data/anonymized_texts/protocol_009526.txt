Page 7of 251 Introduction
This statistical analy sis plan (SAP) documents the statistical methodology  and data 
analysis algorithms and conventions to be applied for statistical anal ysis and reporting of 
efficacy  and safet y data of trial31-10-270.  The first approved protocol, dated 30 Mar 
2010, and its amendments (amendment 1 -23 Nov 2010, amendment 2 -08 Apr 2013, 
amendment 3 -11 Apr 2013, amendment 4 -08Jul2015 )are taken into consideration in 
developing this SAP.   
2 Trial Objective s
2.1 Primary Objective
Tocontinue to provide aripiprazole intramuscular (IM) Depot treatment (400 mg or 300 
mg) to subjects with schizophrenia completing the 52 -week, open -label safety  and 
tolerability  trial31-08-248 (hereafter referred to as trial248).  Subjects can receive this 
treatment until aripiprazole I M Depot is commercially  available in an y dosage [including 
generic formulation (s)]in the country  that the trialis being conducted or until the trial
end date of 31 Dec 2018 is reached.
2.2 Secondary  Objective
The s econdary objective of this trialis to collect long -term safety  data on aripiprazole I M 
Depot in addition to what was collected in trial 248 (52-weeks).   
3 Trial Design
This is an open -label, multicenter rollover non -comparative trial. Theadult subjects with 
schizophrenia who completed aripiprazole IM Depot treatment in trial 248 are allowed to 
enroll this trial.  No subject who discontinued or did not complete trial 248 are allowed to 
enroll in this trial.The trialdesign is presente d in Figure 3 -1and Figure 3 -2.
Eligible subjects enter this trialdirectly  after completing the end of treatment visit ( week 
52) of trial 248 .  The end of treatment evaluations conducted at the last trialvisit for trial 
248serve as the baseline evaluations for this trial.  Subjects continue to receive 
aripiprazole IM Depot every  month as a continuation of their previous monthly  dose in 
trial 248 .  The monthly  dose can be modified, either reduced from 400 mg to 300 mg to 
address tolerability  or increased from 300mg to 400mg to address efficacy , at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Following the baseline visit, subjects receive monthly  injections and at the same visit, 
adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications arerecorded and the Columbia 
Protocol 31 -10-270 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                        
Page 8of 25Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS) arecompleted. Every  3 months, all of the 
monthly  assessments are completed along with a urine pregnancy  test for women of 
childbearing potential (WOCBP).  Every  6 months, al l of the 3 -month assessments are 
completed along with the Clinical Global I mpression -Severit y (CGI -S) scale, vital signs, 
and extrapy ramidal s ymptoms (EPS) assessments (including the Abnormal Involuntary  
Movement Scale [AIMS], Simpson -Angus Scale [SAS], and Barnes Akathisia Rating 
Scale [BARS]).  At the 12 -month visit, all of the 6 -month assessments are completed 
along with clinical laboratory  tests and assessments of body  weight, height, and waist 
circumference.  
Urine drug screening a nd blood alcohol t esting are obtained at baseline and can be re -
obtained at the investigator’s discretion at an y time during the trial.  A Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS) for subject -reported rating of pain at the most recent injection site and the 
investigator’s assessment for p ain, redness, induration, and swelling of the mo st recent 
injection site are performed at baseline and may  be reassessed at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Clinical laboratory  tests, phy sical examination, and electrocardiogram 
(ECG) obtained at baseli ne may  also be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
based on clinical necessity .  
A Trial Completion visit or Earl y Termination visit ( −2/+10 days) include s the following 
assessments: C -SSRS, AEs, concomitant medications, a urine pregnancy  test for 
WOCBP, CGI -S, vital signs, EPS assessments (AIMS, BARS, SAS), clinical laboratory  
tests, and body  height and weight.
A 30 -Day Post Treatment Follow -up phone call ismade 30 day s (3days) after it has 
been determined that the subject no longer partic ipate s in this trialand include squestions 
about an y AEs that have occurred and an y concomitant medications taken since the last 
visit
The subject population iscomprised of subjects who have completed Trial 248 and in the 
investigator’s judgment may  benefit from continued participation in an aripiprazole I M 
Depot trial, in countries where aripiprazole IM Depot is not commercially  available. It is 
anticipated that 500 to 800 subjects from estimated 250 sites in trial 248 enroll in this 
trial.

Page 10of 254 Sample Size and Pow er Justification
In this open -label, single arm rollover trial, no formal sample computations were 
employ ed.  The anticipated number of subjects from Trial 248 that is predicted to enroll 
in this trialis approximately 500 to 800.
5 Statistical Method
5.1 Data /Data Sets Specifications
5.1.1 Data Sets A nalyzed
The following anal ysis samples are defined for this trial:
Enrolled Sample:  All subjects who sign the informed consent sform for the trial
and enter the trial.
Safety  Sample:  All subjects who receive at least one dose of open -label
aripiprazole IM depot.   
Efficacy  Sample:  All subjects who enter and have at least one post -baseline 
efficacy  evaluation.
  
Due to the open -label single -arm nature of the trial, all endpoint swill be summarized 
using descriptive statistics . Continuing variables will be tabulated for f requency , mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD), maximum and minimum . Categorical variables will be
tabulated for frequency  and percentage .  No formal statistical analy ses are planned due to 
the open -label nature of this trial.  Subjects w ho enrolled in this trialrolled over directly
from Trial 248. Subjects who enrolled in Trial 248 either rolled over from Trial 31 -07-
246 or Trial 31 -07-247, or directl y entered Trial 31 -08-248 as de novo subjects ( i.e., 
subjects never enrolled in Trial 31 -07-246 or 31 -07-247). The data will be summarized 
by enrollment source into Trial 248as well for all subjects.
5.1.2 Definition of Baseline and Last Visit
Baseline is defined as the last visit with available data in Trial 248 .  The l ast visit is 
defined as the last visit with available data at the completion or on/before early 
termination .  Thesedefinitions apply to all efficacy  analy sisandsafety  analy sis.  
5.1.3 Handling Missing Data
Due to nature of this trialdesign, no missing data are imputed.  However, t rial day s are 
derived using the formula: Trial Day  = Date of assessment -Date of firstaripiprazole IM 
depot injection in trial 270 + 1.  Based on the number of trial day s, assessments will be
mapped into the corresponding trial months in the summary  tablesas described in Table 
5.1.3-1.

5.2 Disposition of Subjects
Disposition of subjects for the enrolled sample will be summarized by region, country
and center . Subject duration by  month and reason for discontinuation will be tabulated
forthe enrolled sample.  Subjects who are evaluated at last scheduled visit during the 
treatment period are defined as completers. Subjects who are evaluated at the last 
scheduled visit during the treatment period are defined as completers, i.e ., subjects who 
have their last scheduled visit, orwho discontinue due to the commercial availability  of 
trialdrug in the country  are defined as completers.   
5.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summa rized using descriptive statistics
for the enrolled sample . These characteristics including age, race, ethnicit y,gender, 
weight, height and body  mass index (BMI) , will be tabulated for the enrolled sample .
5.4 Efficacy  Analysis
Change from baseline in CGI  Severit y (CGI -S) score will be summarized by  scheduled 
visit using descriptive statistics for the efficacy  sample.  CGI -S score (range 1 -7) are 
directly  derived from CGI -S panel.  
5.5 Safety  Analyses
5.5.1 Adverse Events
All adverse even ts (AEs) arecoded by  system organ class and Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) preferred term (Version 21.0 or later). A treatment -
emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE which starts after start of trialmedication 
(Aripiprazole IM Dep ot), or an AE continues from baseline and becomes serious, 
worsening, trialdrug-related or results in death, discontinuation, interruption or reduction 
of trialmedication during this trial.  All ongoing AEs and clinicall y significant AEs from

Page 13of 25Trial 248 a re recorded as Medical History  for this trial.If the AE increases severit y or 
frequency  during this trialperiod, a new AE arerecorded.  The incidences of the 
following treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized for thesafet y 
sample :  
TEAEs by  severit y
Potentially  drug -related TEAEs
TEAEs with an outcome of death
Serious TEAEs
Discontinuations due to TEAEs
Listing and incidences of AEs described above aretabulated for thesafet y sample.  
Deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuat ion from trialor trialtreatment arelisted 
for the enrolled sample.  In addition, incidences of TEAEs will be provided for the 
following subgroup analy ses: region (US, non -US), sex (male, female), race (Caucasian, 
Black or African American, American Indi an or Alaska Native, Asian, other), age (< 45 
years old, ≥ 45 years old), ethnicity  (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino), and 
BMI at baseline ( ≤ 28 kg/m 2, > 28 kg/m 2).  
5.5.2 Clinical Laboratory  Tests
Clinical laboratory  tests include serum chemistry  analysis, hematology  analy sis, 
urinaly ses and other lab analy sis.  The potentiall y clinically  relevant laboratory  test 
abnormalities will be listed by  subject and by  test for thesafet y sample, respectivel y.  
Criteria for the potentially clinically  relevant laboratory  test abnormalities per protocol 
are provided in Appendix 1 .  Per Hy ’s law, the subjects with AST or ALT >3 x upper 
limit of normal value and total bilirubin >2 x upper limit of normal values will be listed 
as the potential Hy’s law cases.   The incidences of potentially  clinicall y relevant
laboratory tests abnormalities based on the observation from the scheduled and the 
unscheduled post -baseline visits will be tabulat ed.  In addition, incidence of potentially  
clinically  relevant laboratory tests in potassium (<= 3.0 mEq/L  or >= 5.5 mEq/L ) and 
neutrophils (<= 1500 /mm3) per FDA recommendation will be provided .  Summary  
statistics (frequency , mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the clinical 
laboratory  measurements at all scheduled visits, and changes from baseline at scheduled 
visit and last visit swill be presented for thesafet y sample.  
If laboratory  tests assessments are repeated for the same visit, the last repeated values are 
used for summary  tables.  This is accomplished by sorting patient data by  visit date and 
visit time (if applicable) within the same visit identification.  If the lab data are recorded 
as ranges (i.e., including below or above limit of quantification), these data are not

incidence .  
The incidence of prolactin level above the upper limit of normal range (potentially  
clinically  relevant change) will be tabulated by gender and the designat ed visits for the 
safet y sample.  Thechange from baseline in prolactin levels will be presented by  gender 
at scheduled visit and last visit for the safet y sample. 
Additionally , incidence of treatment -emergent clinically  relevant changes in fasting lipid 
parameters and glucose (as defined in Table 5.5 .2-1) will be summarized for thesafet y 
sample.

5.5.3 Vital Signs D ata
Vital signs include bod y temperature, respiration rate, pulse, s ystolic blood pressure, and 
diastolic blood pressure in supine and standing position.  I n addition, body  weight and 
waist circumference are measured.  The potential clinically  relevant vital sign 
abnormalities will be listed by  subject.  Criteria for the potential lyclinically relevant vital 
sign abnormalities are provided in Appendix 2 .  Incidences of clinical r elevant vital signs 
abnormalities based on the observatio n from the scheduled and unscheduled post -baseline 
visits will be tabulated for thesafet y sample. In addition to waist circumference and 
weight , vitals sign parameters at each visit, and change from baseline at the post -baseline 
visits will be summarized forthe safet y sample .  Body  weight changes will be evaluated 
for thesafet y sample b y calculating m ean change from baseline and by tabulating the 
incidence of >=7% weight gain or loss b y visit.  
If vital sign assessments are repeated for the same visit, the last repeat values are used for 
production of summary  tables.  This is accomplished by  sorting patient data by  visit date 
and visit time (if applicable) within the same visit identification.  
5.5.4 Electrocardiograms (ECG) Data
All ECG analy ses are made using observed data. Baseline is defined as average of ECG 
measurements at baseline visit as specified in Section 5.1.2 .  Last visit is defined as 
defined as average of ECG measurements at last visit as spe cified in Section 5.1.2 .  
Missing ECG data are not imputed.  For the calculation of QT correction b y heart rate, 
QTcis missing only  if all 3consecutive beats are unreadable.  As long as there is at leas t
1 beat available in the le ad, the data are included in the anal ysis. For each ECG, QT and 
RR intervals from three consecutive complexes (representing three consecutive heart 
beats) are measured manually .  The QT correction is performed on beat -to-beat basis.  
The mean of ratios (be at-to-beat) is calculated b y (QTc1 + QTc2 + QTc3)/3 using each 
Protocol 31 -10-270 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                        
Page 16of 25QT-RR pair: (QT1, RR1), (QT2, RR2) and (QT3, RR3).  The corrected QT intervals for 
QTcB, QTcF, and QTcN are defined as follows:
QTcB is the length of the QT interval corrected for heart rate b yBazett’s formula: 
QTcB = QT / (RR) 1/2.  
QTcF is the length of the QT interval corrected for heart rate b y Fredericia’s 
formula: QTcF = QT / (RR) 1/3.
QTcN is the length of the QT interval corrected for heart rate b y the FDA 
Neuropharm Division formula: QTcN = QT/(RR) 0.37.  
Potentially  clinically  relevant ECG abnormalities will be listed by  subject.  Criteria for 
potentially  clinicall y relevant ECG abnormalities are provided in Appendix 3 .  The 
incidences of abnormal ECGs of poten tially  clinical r elevance based on the observation at 
the scheduled and the unscheduled post -baseline visits will be tabulated for the safet y 
sample .  Descriptive statistics of change from baseline in heart rate and ECG intervals of 
PR, QRS, RR, QT, QT cB, QTcF, and QT cN will be presented for each scheduled visit and 
last visit for thesafet y sample, respectivel y.  
In summarizing the incidence of abnormalities, a subject must have had an evaluation 
that meets abnormality  criteria by  the end of trial.  Incid ence rate will be calculated as the 
number of subject s having at least one abnormality  within the trial divided by  the number 
of subject s who are both exposed to trialmedication and have an on -treatment evaluation. 
In addition, incidence sof categorical c hange in ECG -QTc will be provided for change 
from baseline >30 millisecond , change from baseline >60 millisecond , new onset >450
millisecond , new onset >480 millisecond and new onset >500 m illisecond for the safet y 
sample. Change from baseline in ECG parameters will be calculated at scheduled visit 
and last visit for thesafety  sample.  
If ECG assessments are repeated for the same visit, the last repeat values areused for 
production of mean change from baseline .This is accomplished b y sorting subject data 
by visit date and visit time (if applicable) within the same visit identification.  
5.5.5 Physical Examination
Physical examination findings will be listed by  subject .
5.5.6 Other Safety  Data A nalysis

Protocol 31 -10-270 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                        
Page 17of 25AEs, and injec tion-site-related AEs, will be tabulated for safet y sample. In addition, 
proportion of subjects received anticholinergic medication for treatment -emergent EPS -
related events will be assessed for safet y sample. 
5.5.6.2 Extrapy ramidal Sy mptoms Rating Scales
Extrapy ramidal s ymptoms rating scales included the SAS, AI MS, and the BARS. The 
SAS total score (range 10 to 50) isthe sum of the rating scores for 10 items from the SAS 
panel in the CRF. The AIMS movement rating score (range 0 to 28) isthe sum of the 
rating sc ores for facial and oral movements (items 1 to 4), extremity  movements (items 5 
and 6), and trunk movements (item 7). A missing value of an y item for the SAS or the 
AIMS movement scale could result in a missing SAS total score or AIMS movement 
rating score . The BARS global score (range 0 to5) isderived from the global clinical 
assessment of akathisia from the BARS panel in the CRF. Mean changes from baseline 
on the SAS total score, AIMS movement score, and the BARS global score will be
summarized by  visit in descriptive statistics.  
5.5.6.3 Suicidality
Upon administration of the Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
assessments, each subject is evaluated for active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent. Data collected from t he C-SSRS assessment swill be summarized by the scheduled 
visit for thesafet y sample reporting suicidal ity;suicidal behavior onl y, emergence of 
suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation only , emergence of suicidal ideation, emergence of 
serious suicidal ideation, and worsening o f suicidal ideation.  
Suicidality  is defined as reporting any  suicidal ideation or behavior. Suicidal behavior 
only is defined as reporting an y type of suicidal behavior s(actual attempt, interrupted 
attempt, aborted attempt and preparatory  acts or behav ior) throughout assessment period. 
Emergence of suicidal behavior is defined as having no suicidal behavior at baseline and 
reporting an y type of behavior at post -baseline.   Suicidal ideation only  is defined as 
reporting an y type of suicidal ideation.  Em ergence of suicidal ideation is defined as 
having no suicidal ideation at baseline and reporting an y type of ideation during 
treatment.  Emergence of serious suicidal ideation is defined as having no suicidal 
ideation at baseline and reporting serious suic idal ideation with score of 4 or 5 on suicidal 
ideation severit y rating during the treatment.  At suicidal ideation severit y rating
assessment, each person is giving a score of 0 (no ideation present) to 5 (active ideation 
with plan and intent).  Worsening of suicidal ideation is defined as having more severe in 
most severe suicidal ideation rating at post baseline than at baseline. Numbers of 
subject s reporting suicidal behavior will be reported by  type of suicidal behavior.  
Protocol 31 -10-270 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                        
Page 18of 25Mean and mean change from ba seline in suicidal ideation intensity  total score for most 
sever ideation will be summarized by  scheduled visit for the safet y sample . The suicidal 
ideation intensity total score is sum of suicidal ideation severit y rating scores for 
frequency , duration, c ontrollability , deterrents and reasons for ideation.  For each item, 
each subject getsthe intensity  score from 0 (none) to 5(worst) .  Therefore, suicidal 
ideation intensity total score is range from 0 to 25.  If the subject did not endorse an y 
suicidal ideation, a score of 0 is given for the intensity  scale.  
5.5.6.4 Injection Site Reaction and Pain
Injection site reaction and pain areassessed every 6 months in the visual analogue scale 
(VAS )score (range 0 -100mm) before and after IM depot injection at the scheduled visit .  
Descriptive statistics for VAS score will be tabulated by visit for the safet ysample.  
Assess ment pre 1st IM depot injection is used as baseline.  Proportions of subject s rated 
as absent, mild, mo derate and severe level b y the investigator for localized pain, redness, 
swelling, and induration will be tabulated by visit forsafety sample .  In an addition, 
descriptive statistics for i njection site reaction and pain areprovided by  order of injection.  
5.5.7 Other Data A nalysis
5.5.7.1 Concomitant Medication
Proportions of subjects from the enrolled sample taking concomitant medications will be
tabulated b y drug classification using the WHO drug prior to taking trialmedication , in 
the trialperiod and in the follow -up period , respectively .  
Proportions of subjects taking concomitant medications such as benzodiazepine and 
anticholinergic will be provided. Concomitant medications for benzodiazepine and 
anticholinergic will be converted into lorazepam equivalent and benztropine equivalent, 
respectivel y, using the appropriate conversion factors. Daily dose of benzodiazepine 
(lorazepam or equivalent) and anticholinergic (benztropine or equivalent) concomitant 
medications will be summarized.  Daily  dose for each subject is calculated in total dosage 
of the specific concomitant medications divided by the duration of subject in the trial
period.
5.5.7.2 Duration of Exposure to Trial Medication
Exposure to aripiprazole IM depot for theenrolled sample will be summarized in 
percentage of subjects receiving injections, average dose level per injection and average 
trialday of receiving each injection . In an addition, percentage of subjects will be
presented b y dosing level per injection .  
Protocol 31 -10-270 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                        
Page 19of 255.5.7.3 Compliance of Trial Medication
To maintain subjects on a schedule within acceptable time window is critical for subjects 
to achieving and maintaining stability  of ps ychotic sy mptoms for the completion of this 
depot trial.  A missed dose of IM depot is defi ned as a lapse of>38 day s between 
injections. The minimum interval of 26 days and maximum interval of 38 day s between 
injections is to ensure that therapeutic plasma concentrations of aripiprazole are 
maintained. Compliance of trialmedication ( aripipraz ole IM Depot) will be summarized 
for the enrolled sample , in proportion of subjects having 100% compliance, along with 
thefollowing key  features of compliance :
the intervals between Aripiprazole I M depot injections <26 day s;
missing at least 1 injection ;
missing 2 consecutive injections at an y time in the trial;
missing 3 injection swithin a 52-week time period.

Protocol Title :
Protocol H125001: An Open -Label Phase1/2 Study of JCARH125, BCMA -targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor 
(CAR) T Cells, in Subjects with Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Sponsor: Juno Therapeutics, Inc. , a wholly owned
subsidiary of Celgene CorporationStudy Phase: Phase 1/2
Study Rationale:
Substantial progress in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has been made over the past 2 decades with the 
development of proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib and carfilzomib ), immunomodulat ordrugs (IMiDs) 
(eg,lenalidomide, pomalidomide), andmonoclonal antibodies (elotuzumab and daratumumab). Howe ver, MM
remains incurable and nearly all patients eventually relapse with disease that becomes increasingly resistant to 
treatment with each additio nal line of therapy. High -dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant 
performed either at the time of initial diagnosis or at relapse, is considered the standard of care for younger 
patients (less than 70 years of age) with newly diagno sed MM. Although high -dose therapy with AS
CT is not 
curative, event -free survival and overall survival are prolonged compared to treatment with standard -dose 
myeloma treatments alone.
Autologous Tcellstransduced with a recombinant chimeric antigen recept or (CAR) are engineered to bind to a 
tumor -specific antigen .BCMA is an ideal target for CAR T cell therapy since its expression is highly restricted to 
MM cells and plasma cells, and therefore, the toxic effect of anti -BCMA CAR T cells on normal cells is minimal . 
Adoptive cellular therapy using CAR T cell stargeting specifically expressed antigen on tumor cells has become 
one of the exciting breakthrough sin MM immunotherapy.

safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of JCARH125 toidentify the RP2D .The Phase2expansion 
portio n of the study  will further evaluate the safety , PK, and antitumor activity of JCARH125 at the RP2D (s).
An additional phase 2 cohort will evaluate the safety and tolerability of JCARH125 at the RP2D(s) in subjects 
with R/R MM who have relapsed following prior treatment with a BCMA -directed anti -myeloma the rapy 
including TCE, ADC, or CAR T -cell therapy.
The Phase 1 anakinra cohort will evaluate the safety and tolerability of JCARH125 at the dose level 3 and/or dose 
level 3a following prophylactic use of anakinra .
Phase 1 Dose Escalation :
The JCARH125 dose le vels planned to be evaluated in Phase1 are provided in the table below. Dose -
escalation/de -escalation will follow a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI -2) algorithm with a target 
dose-limiting toxicity  (DLT )rate of 30% and an equivalence interval of 25% to 35%. Dose -escalation may be 
halted once adose level with acceptable safety and satisfactory antitumor activity has been selected for
evaluation in Phase 2.A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) may not be define d in this study.

aIntroduced with Protocol Amendment 4 (10 September 2018) as a part of safety measures. 
bIntroduced with Protocol Amendment 5 ( 31May 2019 )as a possible intermediate dose level. 
Note: Additional intermediate dose levels may be evaluated based on ongoing safety and efficacy data.
For a dose level to be considered safe, at least 3 DLT -evaluable subjects must have completed the 21 -day DLT 
evaluation period and the level estimated to be safe per the mTPI -2 algo rithm. The decision to open a dose level 
for enrollment will be made by the Sponsor based on results from the mTPI -2 algo rithm after consult ations with 
the Principal Investigators at each site as appropriate .
The first 3 subjects treated in the study will be treated with JCARH125 at Dose Level 1(50× 106 CD3+CAR+ 
cells).Within thefirst dose cohort, treatment of the first 3 subjects will be staggered by a minimum of 14days. 
At each higher dose level , treatment of the first 3 subjects within thedose cohort will be staggered by a minimum 
of 7days. Staggering of subjects in a dose cohort may be lifted after a minimum of 3subjects have been treated 
in that dose cohort, have completed the 21 -day DLT evaluation period, and the dose level is determined to be safe 
according to the mTPI -2 algorithm .
A maximum of 3 subjects will initially be treated at a dose level. If no ne of these 3 subjects expe rience a DLT, 
the dose may be escalated to the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 subjects experiences a DLT at a dose level, then 
additional subjects will be enrolled at this dose level and dose -escalation/de -escalatio n decisions will be made per 
the mTPI -2 algorithm after the DLT data for these additional subjects are available. If 2 of 3 subjects experience 
a DLT at a dose level, then the dose will be de -escalated to the next lower dose level. If all 3 subjects experience 
a DLT at a dose level, the dose w ill be de -escalated and this dose and all higher doses will be removed from 
further evaluation in the trial.
To be considered evaluable for DLT, a subject must have received the conforming JCARH125 cell product at the 
assigned dose of JCARH125 and complete d the 21-day evaluation period or experienced a DLT prior to 
completing the 21 -day evaluation. Subjects who are not evaluable for DLT will be replaced.
Based on the cumulative safety and antitumor activity data from subjects treated in Phase 1, one or more dose 
levels will be selected for further evaluation in the Phase 2 portion of the trial (the RP2D); this dose level(s) will

determined per the mTPI a lgorithm in order to select the dose level(s) to be evaluated in Phase 2.
Phase 1 Anakinra Cohort - Prophylactic Treatment with Anakinra
Up to 14 subjects will be treated at the dose level 3 and/or dose level 3a with the addition of the prophylactic 
treatment with anakinra. The purpose is to investigate the potential benefit of prophylactic treatment with
anakinra on the onset, incidence and severity of CRS.
All subjects who receive conforming JCARH125 product and receive at least 1 dose of prophylact ic anakinra will 
be evaluated for safety and tolerability of JCARH125 following prophylactic treatment with anakinra. Subjects 
will receive 2dosesof 100 mg anakinra administered subcutaneously (SC) prior to JCARH125 infusion , one the 
night before and one3 hours before JCARH125 infusion. Subjects will continue with anakinra for 5 consecutive 
days at a dose of 100 mg SC. In the case of CRS onset, anakinra 100 mg SCshould be administered twice daily 
until CRS resolution. The anakinra dose should be adminis tered at approximately the same time every day. In the 
case of worsening of CRS and/or in case of onset of neurological toxicity, the toxicity guidelines from the 
protocol should be followed. 
Ifprophylactic treatment with anakinra reduces the incidence , severity or delay s the time to onset of CRS, 
prophylactic treatment with anakinra may be implemented in the Phase 2 portion of the trial.
Phase 2 Expansion
In the Phase2 portion of the study, subjects will be treated at the RP2D (s)identified in Phase 1. The primary 
analy sis population for evaluation of JCARH125 efficacy (ie, the efficacy analysis set) will include all subjects 
treated at the RP2D (s)in Phase 2 expansion , subjects treated at the RP2D (s)in Phase 1 dose escalation , and 
subjects treated at the RP2D(s) in the Phase 1 anakinra cohort who have measurable disease as determined by the 
central laboratory at the last disease assessment prior to JCARH125 infusion and receive conforming product .
The efficacy analysis set will include at least 75subje cts who are evaluable for both safety and efficacy.
Phase 2a –Prior BCMA -directed Anti -Myeloma Therapy Cohort
In the Phase 2a portion of the study, 3 separate cohorts of subjects with exposure to prior BCMA -directed anti -
myeloma therapy cohort including TCE, ADC or CAR T -cell therapies will be treated at the RP2D(s) identified 
in Phase 1. All subjects who receive conforming JCARH125 product will be evaluated for safety and tolerability 
of JCARH125. 
Cohort 1: 14 subjects who have been exposed to prior BCMA -directed CAR T -cell therapy
Cohort 2: 14 subjects who have been exposed to prior BCMA -directed TCE
Cohort 3: 14 subjects who have been exposed to prior BCMA -directed ADC therapy
Study Procedures and Evaluations for Subjects in Phase 1dose esca lation , Phase 1 anakinra cohort ,Phase 
2, and Phase 2aprior BCMA -directed anti -myeloma therapy cohort
A tumor biopsy sample (bone marrow biopsy , bone marrow aspirate andplasmacytoma biopsy if applicable ) will 
be obtained from all subjects during initial screening. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled 
and willundergo leukapheresis to enable JCARH125 product generation. Subjects may receive bridging therapy , 
excluding experimental and biological agents (daratumumab, eg) ,after leukap heresis and before lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy if deemed necessary by the treating physician for disease control during JCARH125 
manufacturing. Bridging therapies must be discontinued at least 14 days prior to initiatio n oflymphodepletion 
and subjects mu st continue to meet eligibility criteria pertaining tomeasurable disease, adequate organ function, 
active infections, pregnancy, and washout of prior therapy before initiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. If 
JCARH125 cannot be made from the first leuk apheresis product, additional leukapheresis may be allowed after 
consultation with the Sponsor.
Following successful JCARH125 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase and will receive one 
cycle of JCARH125 treatment. A treatment cycle will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine 
(30 mg/m2/day) and cy clophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day) for 3 day sfollowed by a single dose of JCARH125 
administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1.JCARH125 will be administered 2 to 7days after comple tion of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy unless clinical or logistical circumstances require modification of this timing.
Dose adjustments or changes to the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen may be indicated due to the 
subject’s creatinine clearance .

Follow -Up Period
Subjects will be followed under this protocol for 2 years after JCARH125 administration for safety , disease 
status, additional anticancer therapies, and survival. If disease progression occurs during this 2-year timeframe, 
subject sshould still be followed per the Schedule of Evaluations outlined in Appendix A. The number of 
JCARH125 cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow will be assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(
qPCR )from the time of JCARH125 administration until the end of the study .Disease assessments will be 
performed approximately every 4 weeks following JCARH125 administration for the first 6 months, an d then 
every 3months until 2years after JCARH125 administration or until disease progression, whichever comes first.
Bone marrow biopsy ,bone marrow aspirate and plasmacytoma biopsy if applicable will be performed for all 
subjects for disease response evaluations, PK, and/or research assessments at Day 15, Day 29, Month 3, Month 6, 
Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, for confirmation of CR, and in the event of disease progression .Response to 
JCARH125 will be assessed according to IMWG c
riteria. All subjects will have their response to JCARH125 
assessed by the Investigator .In addition, all subjects treated at the RP2D , will have their response sassessed by
the Investigator and by anIndependent Review Committee (IRC). Evaluation of the pr imary  efficacy endpoint of 
ORR in Phase 2 will be based on IRC assessment.
All subjects who receive JCARH125 will be asked to enroll in a separate Celgene -sponsored long -term follow -up 
(LTFU) study at the time of completion or discontinuation from this study. Subjects who enroll in the LTFU 
protocol will sign a separate informed consent form and may be followed per current FDA guidelines for up to 
15years after JCARH125 administration for long-term JCAR -related safety and efficacy .
Oversight Committees :
Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB )will review cumulative study data approximately 
quarterly  over the course of the study to evaluate safety, protocol conduct, and scientific validity and integrity of 
the trial. In addition, in the event of a toxicity that meets the protocol -defined criteria for pausing the study, the 
DSMB will be convened to evaluate the comprehensive safety data and to make a recommendation for study 
continuatio n, modification, or termina tion. The DSMB has been assembled under a dedicated charter specifically 
developed for safety oversight of Juno -sponsored studies.
Independent Review Committee
An IRC will determine response and progression status for all subjects treated in the Phase2expansion portion of 
the study , as well as subjects in the Phase 1dose escalation portion of the study ,thePhase 1 anakinra cohort , and 
the Phase 2a prior BCMA -directed anti-myeloma therapy cohort who were treated with JCARH125 at the 
RP2D (s),for the purpose of the primary efficacy analysis .

Investigational Product, Do se, and Mode of Administrati on:
The JCARH125 investigational drug product is composed of autologous CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells that express a 
BCMA -specific CAR. The drug product is provided as a combined CD8+ and CD4+ frozen T -cell suspension in 
a medium containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMS O) for IV administration.
JCARH125 will be administered as a single IVdose on Day1 (between 2 to 7days after completion of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy ).
Rationale for Starting Dose of JCARH125 in Phase 1dose escalation :
The starting dose level for JCARH125 in Phase1is 50×106CD3+ CAR+ Tcells.The starting dose for this 
first-in -human Phase1 trial with the JCARH125 investigational agent was selected based upon the clinical 
experience of other investigational CAR T cell agents in hematological malignancies of the B -cell lineage, 
including MM , including CAR Tcells targeting BCMA .Subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and MM have been treated with doses 
ranging f rom 107to 109CAR+ Tcells. As of May 2017, i n a clinical trial testing BCMA -specific CAR Tcells in 
a population similar to those to be enrolled in this trial, subjects had been treated with up to 800×106 CAR+ 
Tcells with no DLTs ,and there had been no reports o f Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.

Confidential and Proprietary 11 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 2020Protocol Number: H125001 Product Name: JCARH125
Study Duration:
The enrollment period is expected to take approximately 36months and the follow -up period for each subject is 
approximately 24months after JCARH125 administration .Thus, the total duration of the study is expected to be 
approximately 60months.
Duration of Subject Participation:
The expected duratio n of participation for each subject in this treatment protocol will be approximately 
26months.
Study Sites:
It is planned to enroll subjects at approximately 20sites in the United States.
Efficacy Assessments:
Disease r esponse will be assessed according to the IMWG Uniform Response C riteria. The following 
assessments are used to assess disease status :measurement of M protein in blood and urine by electrophoresis
and immunofixation ,quantification of sFLC (κ and λ )in blood ,skeletal survey ,and imaging by positro n 
emission tomography ( PET)/computed tomography ( CT)or diffusion -weighted magnetic resonance imaging 
(DW -MRI) in subje cts with extramedullary disease. In addition, a ll subjects who achieve a CR must have a bone 
marrow evaluation , radiological assessment (for subjects with a history of extramedullary disease) for 
confirmatio n of CR per the IMWG criteria and must have a sample evalu ated for MRD status if applicable .
Safety Assessments:
Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and laboratory abnormalities (type, frequency, and 
severity ) will be collected. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will include infusion re actio ns, cy tokin e 
release syndrome (CRS), neuro logic toxicity, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) , tumor lysis syndrome 
(TLS) , severe infections, and severe prolonged cytopenias ; the list of AESIs may be updated during the course of 
the study  based on observed safety signals.
Replication -competent lentivirus (RCL) and viral vector sequence testing will be performed at specified time 
point s during the study using polymerase chain reaction (PCR )-based assays.

window may be extended following discussion with the Investigators.
Criteria for Pausing the Study during Phase 1 Dose Escalation ,Phase 1 Anakinra Cohort , or Phase 2a :
Further enrollment or treatment of subjects in any or all appropriate cohort swill be paused pending notification 
of the DSMB and appropriate regulatory authorities if any subject experiences any of the following events within 
30 days of a JCARH125 infusion:
Life-threatening ( Grade 4) toxicity attributable to JCARH125 that is unexpected and unrelated to 
chemotherapy
Expected toxicities that would not lead to study interruption include Grade4 CRS, neurotoxicity (e g, 
confusion, aphasia, seizures, convulsions, lethargy, and/or altered mental status), fever, hypotension, 
hypoxia, TLS, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In addition, intensive care unit (ICU)
admission, the need for dialysis, and/or the need for mechanical ventilatio n are also expected. These
expected toxicities may also result in secondary toxicities of Grade 4 renal toxicity, hepatic toxicity, or 
other organ involvement. Any Grade 4 toxicity that is not considered to be a DLT (refer to listed 
exceptions) will not le ad to study interruption.
An unacceptably high incidence, across multiple dose levels or after at least 1 0subjects have been 
treated at the RP2D, of expected Grade 4 toxicities, including Grade4 CRS (> 40%), Grade 4 
neurotoxicity (> 30%), Grade4 renal t oxicity not associated with disease progression (> 30%), and 
Grade 4 hepatotoxicity (> 30%), attributable to JCARH125 or chemotherapy
Death related to JCARH125 therapy
Criteria for Terminating the Study (or Cohort) Prematurely :
Further enrollment or treatment of subjects in any or all appropriate cohort swill be terminated for the following 
reasons:
Any subject develops confirmed RCL during the study
The Sponsor, Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee , or DSMB de cides that subject 
safety may be comp romised by  continuing the study (or cohort)
The Sponsor decides to discontinue the development of JCARH125 entirely (or for the indications under 
evaluation in a given cohort)

Other Assessments:
The following assessmen ts will be performed at specified time points:
PK assessments :Assessment of JCARH125 expansion and persistence will be determined by qPCR to detect the 
JCARH125 transgene. JCARH125 PK will be assessed from the time of the JCARH125 infusion until the end of 
study.
 
 
 
 
Health -related quality of life (HRQoL) assessments :HRQoL will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 
questionnaire including the QLQ -MY2 0MM module , as well as the EuroQol instrument EQ -5D-5L.
Statistical Methods:
Phase 1 Dose -Escalation Cohorts
Statistical analyses of the primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will be primarily descriptive for the 
Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial ; summaries will be provided by dose level and overall. The incidence 
of DLTs, the incidence and sev erity of AEs, and the incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities will be 
described and summarized.
Phase 1 Anakinra Cohort - Prophylactic Treatment with Anakinra
Data from the Phase 1 anakinra cohort will be summarized separately but subjects treated in this cohort at the 
RP2D(s) will also be pooled with subjects treated at the RP2D(s) in Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 
expansion for the primary analyses . Statistical analyses of the primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints wil l 
be primarily descriptive for th is cohort . The incidence and severity of AEs and the incidence and severity of 
laborato ry abnormalities will be described and summarized.  The number and percentage of subjects developing 
Grade ≥2 CRS, as well as an upper 1-sided 80% confidence interval (CI)will be provided and benchmarked 
against the observed rate from dose levels 3 and/or 3a from the dose escalation portion of the trial.  A similar 
analy sis will be provided for the number and percentage of subjects with no CRS occurring on study days 1, 2, or 
3.  The onset of Grade ≥2 CRS will be summarized descriptively and will be referenced to onset of Grade ≥ 2 
CRS in subjects treated at the RP2D(s) in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the trial.
Phase 2 Expansion Cohort
The efficacy analysis se tfor formal statistical hypothesis testing consists of all subjects across Phase1dose 
escalation , the Phase 1 anakinra cohort ,and Phase2 expansion who have measurable disease at the last disease 
assessment prior to JCARH125 infusion and who receive co nforming product at the RP2D (s).
The primary endpoint for Phase 2 is ORR, defined as the rate of sCR + CR + very good partial response ( VGPR )
+ partial response ( PR),as assessed by the IRC. A key secondary endpoint for Phase 2 isCRrate, defined as the 
rate of sCR + CR as assessed by the IRC.
Disease response will be assessed until disease progr ession, end of 
study, death ,or the start of another anticancer therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ).Subjects 
without any reported disease respon se assessments will be considered non -responders. Formal statistical 
hypothesis testing of ORR and CR will be based on the IRC.
Exact binomial tests at the 1 -sided 0.025 significance level will be used to evaluate the statistical hypotheses to be 
formally  tested and an exact 2 -sided 95% confidence interval for ORR and CR will be provided for each analysis 
set using the Clopper -Pearson procedure.
A gatekeeping approach will be used to control the overall type 1 error rate for the analyses of the primary 
endp ointand the CR endpoint. The CR endpoint will only be tested for statistical significance if the primary 
endpoint is significant at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level .

Phase 2a Prior BCMA -directed Anti -Myeloma Therapy Cohort
Each Phase 2a cohort will be analyzed separately from the Phase 1 dose -escalatio n cohorts and the Phase 2
expansion cohort.  Statistical analyses of the primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will be primarily 
descriptive for the Phase 2a portion of the trial. The ORR and CR will be summarized.  The incidence and 
severity  of adverse events ( AEs)and the incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities will be described and 
summarized. 
Timing of Analyses
The primary analysis for ORR is planned afte r at least 75 subjects in the efficacy analy sissethave been evaluated 
for response .The exact timing of the analysis will be determined after discussions with regulatory agencies .
An interim analysis may be performed after at least 20 subjects have been treated at the RP2D (s)pooled across
Phase 1dose escalation , the Phase 1 anakinra cohort ,and Phase 2 expansion and are evaluable for response (ie, 
have had at least 1 post -treatment disease assessment and all objective responses confirmed). The purpose o f the 
interim analysis is to inform the development program for JCARH125. There are no intentions to stop the trial 
early  for positive efficacy ;therefore ,no adjustment to the alpha level will be made for the final analysis.
Sample Size
A sample size of approximately 75 treated subjects at the RP2D(s) is planned for the primary efficacy evaluation.  
A sample size of up to 120 subjects is planned for Phase 1dose escalation with up to approximately 10 6subjects 
potentially evaluated in Pha se 1 dose escalation at dose levels not at the RP2D(s). The Phase 1 anakinra cohort 
will be comprised of up to 14 subjects and is planned to be included in the primary efficacy evaluation for 
subjects treated at the RP2D(s).  Phase 2awill be comprised of up to 42 subjects (up to 14 subjects per cohort).
Assuming approximately 5% to 10% of subjects may not be evaluable for the primary endpoint due to reasons 
such as not being evaluable for DLT assessment, receiving non -conforming product, or not having mea surable 
disease after receiving bridging chemotherapy, a total sample size of 245 subjects is planned for this Ph ase 1/2 
study.

1.1. Multiple Myeloma
Multiplemyelo ma(MM) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the clo nal pro liferat ion 
of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Clinical features of symptomatic disease are summarized by 
the so-called “CRAB criteria,” which consist of hypercalcemia, renal impairme nt, anemia, and 
bone lesio ns (Palumbo, 2011 ; Gerecke, 2016 ; Naymagon, 2016).
It is estimated that there will be approximately  32,110 new cases di agnosed and 12,960 deaths 
from MM in the United States (US) in 2019 ( Siegel, 20 19).Myeloma primarily  affects older 
individuals; the median age at diagnosis is 69 and less than 15% of those newly diagnosed are 
under the age of 55 
(Howlader, 2016 ).
Although MM remains incurable, significant progress has been made over the past 20 years with 
the development of proteasome inhibitors ( eg, bortezomib and carfilzo mib), immunom odulators  
(IMiDs) ( eg, lenalid omide, po malidomide ), and monocl onal ant ibodies (elotuzumab and 
daratum umab). Newly diagnosed patients who are medically fit co mmo nly receive induction 
therapy  prior to autol ogous stem  cell transplant (SCT) with a triplet combinat ion regimen 
consist ing of a proteas ome inhibitor and dexamethasone, together with lenalidomide, 
cyclophosphamide, or thalidomide (Raza, 2017). For older or medically  unfit pati ents, first -line 
treatm ent m ay consist of l enalido mide wit h low-dose dexamethasone, a melphalan -containing 
regimen, or a dose -adjusted triplet regimen without SCT. The availabilit y of these newer agents 
has extended median survival from  3to 4years to m ore than 7 years after init ial diagnosis 
(Anderson, 201 1). 
Depth of response has been shown to correlate with improved overall survival in mult iple 
myelo ma.Multiple studi es have shown that patients with MM who achiev e a com plete response 
(CR) fo llowing therapy  with or wi thout transplant had prolonged overall survival compared with
patients achieving less than CR (van de Velde, 2007 ; Lahuerta, 2008 ; Gay, 2011 )
.Assessment 
for minimal residual disease (MRD) by both flow cy tometry and deep sequencing demonstrate sa 
correl ation between achieving an MRD -negative status and increased overall survival
(Martinez -Lopez, 2014 ; Rawstron, 2015 ).
Despite improvements in the treatment of newly diagnosed MM, nearly all  patients relapse and 
beco me increasingly resistant to treatment which may be attributed, at least in part, to genetic 
heterogeneit y of myel oma cells and clonal evo lution during treatment (Cornell, 2016 ; Chung, 
2017). Treatment of R/Rdisease remains challenging. Patients refra ctory  to both IMi Ds and 
proteasome inhibitors have a median overall survival of only  9 months (Kumar, 2012
).The 
development of the monoclonal ant ibodies elotuzumab and daratumumab has expanded 
treatm ent opti ons for pati ents wi th relapsed disease; however, agents with a novel mechanism of 
action are still urgently needed to combat development of resistance to exist ing therapies.
1.2. BCMA as a Therapeutic Target
B-cell maturation ant igen (BCMA), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 
superfamily , is a cell surfac e protein expressed on normal and malignant plasma cells that is 
involved in regulat ing the maturation of B cells and differentiation into plasma cells. It is 
induced during different iation of plasma cells in parallel wit h the l oss of expression of a relat ed

Confidential and Proprietary 29 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 2020receptor for B -cell act ivation factor (BAFF -R). Binding of BCMA to its ligands, B- cell 
activat ion factor (BAFF) and a proliferat ion-inducing ligand (APRIL), leads to survival of 
plasma cells, result ing in enhanced humoral immun ity.BCMA is highly expres sed on MM cell 
lines and oncells fro m patients with MM, and expressio n appears to increase wit h progression of 
the disease (Tai, 2015 ).Importantly, BCMA protein is not expressed by hematopoiet ic stem 
cells, naïve B cells, or normal non -hematopoiet ic cells (Carpenter, 2013 ; Tai, 2015 ).Thus, with 
the except ion of possible B-cell aplasia ,which is easily managed, toxicit y associ ated wi th 
on-target/off -tumor interacti ons is not expected to be a concern with agents targeting BCMA.
1.3. BCMA -targeted Therapies
Three therapeutic modalit ies to target BCMA expressing myelo ma cells have entered clinical 
trials: CAR T cells, ant ibody  drug conj ugates, and T cell engagers . The reasons for l ack of 
response or relapse fo llowing these therapies is not well understood. Cross resistance across 
modalities has not been rigorously  tested. Difference s in mechanism o f action or the desi gn of  
CAR T constructs suggest that these agents may be potentially act ive when administered in 
sequence.
1.3.1. BCMA -targeted CAR T Cells
One therapeut ic strategy  that has dem onstrated particular promise in hematologic cancers has 
been the development of chimeric ant igen receptors (CARs) targeting the CD19 ant igen for the 
treatm ent of CD19- positive B-cell malignancies. CARs are artificial single -transmembrane 
domain receptors typically composed of an extracellular ant igen-speci fic binding do main linked 
to native T -cell receptor signaling do mains, ty pically CD3ζ in tandem  with either the CD28 or 
4-1BB costimulatory  dom ain.The antigen -binding domain may be generated using a 
single
-chain variable fragment (scFv) from an ant ibody  with appropriate ant igen specificit y.
Antitumor activit y against m alignant B cells expressing the CD19 ant igen is achieved via 
transduction of a patient’s Tcells with a retrovi ral or lentiviral vector containing the 
CD19 -specific CAR and re -infusio n into the patient. Engagement of the CAR Tcells with 
CD19 -expressing B cells elicit s an immune response result ing in the targeted killing of the 
malignant cells. CRrates as high as approximately 90% have been reported in pat ients with acute 
lymphoblast ic leukem ia (A LL),and overall response rates (ORRs) ofapproximately  80% and 
approximately  90% have been reported in pat ients with non-Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) and 
chronic lymphocy tic leukemia (CLL) , respectively (Park, 2016a ;Turtl e, 2016a ;Abramson, 
2017) . 
Based on the encouraging activit y of CD19 -targeted CAR Tcells in B -
cell malignancies, 
BCMA -directed CAR Tcells are being evaluated for treatment of MM. In preclinical studies, 
Tcells transduced wi th anti-BCMA CAR produce d cytokines ( eg, interferon gamma [ IFN-γ]) 
and proliferated upon stimulat ion with BCMA -expressing target cells (Carpenter, 2013 ).In 
addition, ant i-BCMA CAR Tcells killed BCMA -expressing m ultiple myelo ma cells and 
eradi cated BCMA -expressing tum ors in m ouse xenograft m odels (Carpenter, 2013 ).
Several Phase1 clinical trials evaluating different ant i-BCMA CAR Tcell-products are ongoing.
Early results fro m a Phase 1 clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) by the National Cancer Inst itute (NCI) 
evaluat ing ant i-BCMA CAR Tcells in pat ients with MM appear promising:

the second with a partial remissio n that was ongoing at the time o f publicat ion) (Ali, 2016 ).
Toxicit y reported for both patients treated at this dose level included symptoms associated with 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (fever, hypotensio n, dy spnea) and prol onged cy topen ias.
In a Phase 1 CRB -401 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), as of 29 March 2018, 43 subjects with R/R MM in 
dose-escalat ion (n = 21) and dose -expansio n (n = 22) cohorts were treated at 4 dose levels o f 
idecabtagene autoleucel (an invest igational BCMA -targeted CAR T cell product). No dose -
limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs) were observed at any dose level studied. Subjects enro lled in the 
optimal dose levels (>150 × 106CAR+ T cells) had received a median of 8 prior regimens (range 
3 to 23). Cy tokine rel ease syndrom e (CRS) occu rred in 63% of subjects, most ly Grade 1 or 2 in 
severit y and manageable. Responses were achieved by  95.5% of subjects at the optimal dose 
levels. The percentage of s ubjects with co mplete response (CR) or better (CR and stringent CR) 
was 50%, and 36.4% of s ubjects had a very good partial response (VGPR). Median progressi on-
free survival ( PFS) was 11.8 months in all subjects and 17.7 months in subjects who were MRD-
negat ive (Raje, 2018 ). The pivotal Phase 2 KarMMa study  of bb2121 further confirm ed an 
overall response of 73% with a 31% CR rate. Safety results were consistent with the CRB -401 
study  data. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 84% of subjects and neurotoxicit y of any 
grade occurred in 15% of sub jects. Grade 3 or hi gher CRS and neuro logic toxi city (NT)were 
only observed in <6% of subjects ( BMS , 2019 ).
One CAR construct emplo ying a human BCMA -binding domain is current ly undergoing 
evaluat ion by the Universit y of Penn sylvania (UPenn) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). A total of 25 subjects

bb21217 is an investigat ional BCMA -targeted CAR T cell therapy that uses the bb2121 construct 
with a modified m anufacturing process designed to improve CAR T cell funct ional persistence. 
The p hospho inosit ide 3 -kinase inhibitor bb007 is used during ex vivo culture to enrich the drug 
product for T cells wit h a m emory-like phenoty pe. Asof 20April 2019, 22 subjects (median age

Antibody –drug conj ugate s,composed of recombinant monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs )covalent ly 
bound to cy totoxi c chemicals via synt hetic chemic al linkers , represent the fast -growing class of 
cancer therapeutics (McCombs ,
2015). The antibody -drug conj ugate ( ADC )first identifiesand 
bindsto the ant igen on the surface of tumor cells via the mAb , and then is absorbed or 
internalized. After the ADC is internalized, the cy totoxi c chemicals are released in the lysoso mes 
and transported to cy tosol to kill the tumor cells .

phagocy tosis against pati ent MM cells. ( Tai, 2014).
Belantam ab m afodotin was evaluated in DREAMM -2, an open -label, 2 -arm trial that recrui ted 
patients wi th R/R MM who have received at least 3 lines of ant i
-myelo ma therapy . Patients were 
rando mized to receive 2 separate doses of the agent, either 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg, via 
intravenous infusio n every 3 weeks on day  1 of each cycle until disease progression or 
unacceptab le toxicit y. The overall response rate in each group exceeded 30%, with 31% of 
patients receiving 2.5 mg/kg (n = 97) and 34% of patients receiving 3.4 mg/kg (n = 99) achieving 
a response. Corresponding rates of very good partial response or better were 19% and 20% 
(Trudel , 2019). Two addit ional ant i -BCMA ADCs, MEDI2228 and AMG 224, are in ongoing 
Phase 1trials for R /RMM—[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], respectively. In the former, 
BCMA is conjugated via a protease- cleavable pyrrolobenzodi azepine warhead linker, while 
AMG 224 i s comprised of an ant itumor maytansine derivative connected to antibody  lysine 
residues via the non -cleavable 4 -(N-maleimido methyl) cy clohexane -1-carboxylate linker.
1.3.3. BCMA -targeted TCE 
T
-cell engagers ( TCE)are antibodies which bind simultaneously to a surface tumor cell ant igen 
and a component of the T -cell receptor (TCR) complex to induce T cell –mediated killing of 
tumor cells harboring the target surface ant igen. After format ion of a cy tolytic synapse, the T 
cells release perforin and granzyme B, finally leading to apoptosis of the tumor cells
(Brischwein , 2006) . Activat ion of T cells leads to transient release o f cytokines, which engages 
other immune cells and broadens the immune response against the tumor tissue and ult imately 
leads to proliferation o f T cells and serial killing of tumor cells (Hoffmann ,
2005; Gruen , 2004;
Baeuerle ,
2009) . Bispecific T -cell engager ( BiTE )antibody  constructs are highly  potent and 
efficacious mo lecules but have a short half -life due to their small size (55kDa) . BLINCYTO is 
the first anti-CD19 BiTE approved by  the FDA for the treatment of adults and children wi th 
relapsed or refractory  B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B -cell precursor 
acute lymphoblast ic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete remissio n with minimal residual 
disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%. ( BLINCYTO prescribing informat ion, 2019).
Two BiTEs directed against BCMA are current ly in Phase 1 development, including AMG 420 
and AMG 701, a bispecific TCE targeting BCMA and CD3. No clinical data have been 
published for AMG 701; however, the predecessor compound, AMG 4 20, dem onstrated a 
response rate of 70% among 10 subjects with R /
R MM who were treated at the highest dose 
level. From  42 patients who have received AMG 420 ,2 patients died due to adverse events
(AEs)(acute respiratory  distress from  flu / aspergillosis; fulminant hepat itis related to adenovirus 
infect ion); neither were treatment related. Serious adverse events occurring in >1 patient were 
infect ions (n=12) and polyneuropathy  (PN, n=2). Treatment -related SAEs included 2 grade 3 
PNs and 1 edema. Grade 2 -3 CRS was seen in 3 patients (Topp , 2019).
CC-93269 i s another BCMA TCE . Resul ts from a phase 1 dose escalat ion trial with data cutoff 
of 24 May  2019 showed an ORR of 53% (1
0/19) subjects . Cytokine rel ease syndrom e occurred 
in 90% of subjects, with only 1 grade 3 CRS (6%) was reported (Costa, 2019 ).

The JCARH125 investigational drug product comprisesautol ogous CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells that 
have been transduced using a replicat ion-incompetent, self -inact ivating lentiviral vector 
encoding a CAR directed to BCMA. The drug product is provided as a co mbined CD8+ and 
CD4+ frozen T -cell suspensio nin a formulat ion containing dimethyl sulfo xide (DMSO).
JCARH125 is administered by  intravenous (IV) infusio n.
The BCMA -specific CAR comprises a binding domain iso lated fro m a human scF vphage 
display library , an  hinge regio n,  transmembra ne domain, and 4- 1BB and 
CD3ζ si gnaling domains.  
In vitro pharmaco logy proof -of-concept studi es have demo nstrated the abilit y of JCARH125 to 
proliferate, secrete pro -inflammatory cytokines, and kill BCMA -expressing cells. This act ivity is 
minimally  affected by  the addi tion of  increasing amounts of soluble BCMA. Studi es conducted 
in tum or xenograft m odels in mice bearing BCMA -positive multiple myelo ma tumor cells 
demonstrated tum or clearance and improved survival fo llowing JCARH125 administration.
Addit ional details are provided in the JCARH125 Investigator’s Brochure.
1.5. Potential Risks of BCMA -Targeted CAR T Cells 
The CAR T cell products furthest along in clinical development target the CD19 B -cell ant igen 
that is expressed by mo st B-cell malignancies. Across CD19 CAR T cell programs, the most 
concerning safet y issues have been CRS and neurotoxicit y.CRS is a potentially life -threatening 
condi tion associated with the release of pro -inflammatory cytokines that occurs following 
activat ion of the CAR Tcells upon ant igen engagement. Symptoms may be evident as early as 
1day after CAR T cell infusio n and can include high fever, fa tigue, nausea, headache, dy spnea, 
tachy cardi a, rigors, hy potensi on, hypoxia, myalgia, arthralgia, and/or anorexia. The ri sk of 
severe CRS (sCRS) in patients with B -cell malignancies appears to be correlated with burden of 
disease at init iation of treatment (Geyer, 2016 ;Park, 2016b ; Hay, 2017 ; Kymriah 
(tisagenlecleucel) prescribing i nformation, 2018 ).Corti costeroi ds,interleukin-6 receptor 
inhibitor such as tocilizumab, or interleukin -6 inhibi tor such as siltuximab are most commo nly 
used to treat severe symptoms of CRS.
Neurotoxi city, which m ay manifest as al tered m ental  status, aphasia, altered level o f 
consciousness, encephalopathy, and/or seizures, can occur in the context of CRS symptoms, 
before o r after onset of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Several fatal cases of cerebral edema 
have been reported following administration of different CD19- directed CAR T cell products
(Hu, 2016 ; Turtle, 2016b ; Harris, 2017 ; Turtl e, 2017 ).The pathogenesis of CAR T cell-induced 
neurotoxi city and optimal  treatm ent regimens for reversing s ymptom s have yet to be determined.
Based on the data available fro m ongoing BCMA CAR T cell trials (see Secti on1.3), CAR 
Tcells targeted against the BCMA ant igen appear to display some similar toxicit ies. CRSwas 
commo nly observed; symptoms of CRS were generally  Grade 1 or 2 in severit y.Grade 3 CRS 
was reported for 2 of 33subjects (6%) treated with bb2121 (one each at dose leve ls of 450×106
and 80 0×106CAR + Tcells) (Raje, 2019 ). The most common adverse events observed in subjects 
treated with LCAR -B38M CAR T cells w asCRS (100%; Grade 1/2 [n=10]; Grade 3 [n=6]; 
Grade 5 [n=1]) (Chen , 2019). In the UPenn study , CRS Grade 3 and 4 on the Penn grading scale

reversible encephalopathy syndro me (PRES) with severe obtundation, recurrent seizures, and 
mild cerebral edema on MRI that fully reso lved after treatment with high -dose
methylpredniso lone and cyclophosphamide. All 3 subjects with severe neurotoxi city had high 
tumor burden (2 with extramedullary
 disease), had received a dose of 5 × 108CART -BCMA 
cells, and had Grade 3 or 4 CRS (Cohen, 2019 ). Neurotoxicit y was reported for 14 of 33 subjects 
(42%) treated with bb2121 wit h Grade 1 or 2 reported in 13 subjects (39%). One subject (3%) 
with a high tum or burden had a Grade 4 neurotoxicit y starti ng 11 days after the infusio n; this 
effect resol ved wi thin 1 m onth. One subject reported a Grade 3 headache during CRS in the 
absence of other signs of neurotoxicit y (Raje, 2019 ). No Grade3 or 4 neurotoxicit y has been 
reported wit h LCAR- B38M to date (Chen , 2019).

The purpose of the study  is to eval uate the safet y, antitumor activit y, and pharm acokinetics ( PK)
of JCARH125 in subjects with R/R MM .
2.1. JCARH125 Dose Rationale
The starting dose level for JCARH125 is 50 × 106CD3+ CAR+ Tcellswith 4 additional dose 
levels of 150 × 106, 300 × 106, 450 × 106, and 600 × 106CAR+ T cells being explored to date .
The starting dose for thisfirst-in-human Phase 1 trial  with the JCARH125 invest igational agent
was selected based upon theclinical experience of other invest igational CAR T cellagents in 
hematol ogical malignancies of the B -cell lineage, including MM .Subject s with CLL, NHL, 
ALL ,and MM have been treated with doses ranging fro m 107to 109CAR+ Tcells (Maude, 
2014b; Kochenderfer, 2015 ; Abramson, 2017 ; Berdej a, 2017 ).As of May 2017, subject s with 
MM had received doses of bb2121 up to 80 0 × 106 CAR + Tcells on the CRB -401 tri alwithno
DLTs ,and there had been no reports of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicit y.Aspreviously  described in 
Secti on1.3,Grade 3 CRS had been reported for 2 of 21 subjects (10%) in that study  (1each at 
dose l evels o f 450 × 106and800 × 106CAR+ Tcells) (Berdej a, 2017 ) .At a dose of 15 0 × 106 
CAR+ Tcells, CRS had been reported for 2subject s and were Grades 1 and 2 (Berdeja, 2017 ).
At the starting dose inthe CRB -401 tri al(50 × 106CAR+ Tcells ), 1subject was reported to 
experience Grade 1 CRS and dramatically  less ant itumor activit y was observed ; only 1 subjec t 
out of 3 was reported to experience a PR, which l asted less than 8 weeks before the subject ’s 
disease progressed. In contrast, a response of PR or better was reported for all subjec ts who 
received doses of ≥ 150 × 106 CAR Tcells and, as of May  2017, it was reported that none of 
these subject s had progressio
n of their disease (Berdej a, 2017 ).Another BCMA -directed CAR T
cellproduct, LCAR- B38M, has also reported only 2 events of Grade 3 CRS among 35subject s 
treated (5.7%) (Fan, 2017 ).However, dose levels for LCAR -B38M have not been clearly  
described.
In general, the dose of CAR T cells varies by different products, indications and protocols; 
optimal cell doses, number of doses, and infusio ntiming that provide maximal efficacy wit h 
minimal toxicit y are areas of active investigation. Two CAR T cell products have been approved 
so far, Kymriah and YESCARTA, both ant i-CD19 CAR T cell products .Kym riahhas a dose 
range for adult patients of 0.6 to 6 × 108 CAR + T cells. YESCARTA target dose is 2 × 106CAR 
+ T cells per kg body  weight, wi th a maximum  of 2 × 108CAR + T cells. A different anti-
BCMA CAR T cell product, bb2121 ( Raje, 2019 ) explores a dose range from 50 × 106 to 800 × 
106BCMA CAR T cells, while at the Universit y of Pennsylvania ( Cohen, 2019 ), a dose range of 
1 × 108to 5 × 108BCMA CAR T cells given over 3 day s as split-dose intravenous infusio ns 
(10% of dose given on day  0, 30% on day  1, and 60% on day  2) has been explored.  BCMA 
CAR T cells given over 3 day s as split -dose intravenous infusio ns (10% of dose given on day  0, 
30% on day  1, and 60% on day  2) has been e xplored. 
In thi s study , more than one dose l evel of JCARH125 coul d be explored in the Phase 1 anakinra 
cohort ,Phase 2 expansio n and Phase 2a porti onsof study  if there is consistent efficacy  and 
acceptable tolerabilit y at multiple dose levels.

Confidential and Proprietary 36 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 20202.2. Rationale for Lymphodepletion Chemotherapy
It is widely believed that lym phodeplet ing chemotherapy improves engraft ment and activit y of 
CAR T cells. However, the mechanism by which T -cell engraft ment is facilitated by 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy is not fully unders tood. The rati onale for com bining adoptive 
T-cell immunotherapy  with lymphodepl eting therapy is mult ifold. First, lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy may  enhance adopti vely transferred tumor -specific T cells to proliferate in vivo 
through homeostatic proliferat ion (Grossm an, 2004 ; Stachel , 2004 ). Second, chemotherapy  may 
reduce or eliminate CD4+CD25+ regulatory  Tcells, which can suppress the funct ion of 
tumor-targeted adoptively  transferred T cells (Turk, 2004 ). Third, lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy prior to adoptive T -cell therapy may enhance the expressio n of strom al 
cell-derived factor 1 (SDF -1) in the bone marrow, enhancing the homing of modified T cells to 
the primary  tumor site through binding of SDF- 1 with CXCR -4 expressed on the T -cell surface 
(Pinthus, 2004 ). Finally, lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy may further reduce the subject’s tumor 
burden and potentially  lower the ri sk and severit y of CRS.
In thi s study , lymphodepl eting chemotherapy will consist of 30 mg/m2fludara bine and 
300mg/m2cyclophosphamide administered daily for 3 days wit h reduced dose for subjects with 
decreased renal funct ion(Secti on6.2). The combinat ion of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide 
has been used for lymphodeplet ion in other CAR T cell trials wit h demo nstrable CAR T cell 
expansio n, persistence, and antitumor activit y and acceptable safet y (Kochenderfer, 2015; Turtle, 
2016b; Abramso n, 2017).
2.3. Rationale for Prophylactic Treatment with Anakinra
The toxicitycaused by  CAR T cells vary from fever as an onl y CRS symptom  to neurotoxi city, 
macrophage act ivating syndrome ( MAS )and other post-CAR T cells toxicities. The tocilizumab 
(Actem ra) indicat ionwas expanded from 
its original  designat ion of rheumatoid arthrit is (RA) 
treatm ent to treating CRS in patients undergo ing CAR T treatment. Tocilizumab works by 
blocking interleukin -6 (IL -6), an inflammatory  cytokine. Even t hough this inhibitor ha sbeen 
quite effect ive in treatment of CRS in patients receiving CAR T treatment, it doesn’t always 
provi de relief fro m symptom s. CRS m ay respond to IL -6 receptor blockade but can require 
further treatment with high dose corticosteroids to curb potentially lethal severit y (Maude ,
2014a; Park, 2018 ;Barrett , 2014; Brudno , 2016; Neelapu , 2018 ).
The pathophysio logy of CRS and neurotoxicit y suggest that macrophage- produced IL -1 plays a 
major rol e in tri ggering CRS. CRS m ay also be associated with dissemi nated intravascular 
coagul ation and i t may cause a clinical  and pathol ogical picture that is similar to macrophage 
activat ing syndro me (MAS) ( Hay, 2018; Wolf, 2019).
One of the select ive interleukin -1 (IL -1) receptor antagonists (IL -1Ra) is anakinra. Anakinra was 
approved by  the FDA for subjects with moderate to severe act ive rheumatoid arthrit is (RA), in 
patients 18 years of age or older. IL-1 blockade through IL -1Ra candemonstrably prevent severe 
CRS while maintaining intact antitumor efficacy ( Giavridis ,
2018). The benefits of an IL - 1 
blockade through IL -1Ra are especially intriguing given the latter’s abilit y to cross the blood–
brain b arrier and therefore reduce the severit y of CAR T cell related neurotoxicit y (Gutierrez, 
1994), unlike tocilizumab ( Neelapu , 2018). Anakinra has been proposed in a recent publicat ion 
for treatm entof refractory  CRS and also in the setting of MAS/ HLH (Shimabukuro -Vornhagen,

attributable to the use of anakinra in this setti ng. 
The potential benefit of prophylact ic treatment of anakinra on the onset, incidence and severit y 
of CRS will be investigated.
2.4. Rationale for Study Design
The Phase 1dose escalat ionpart of this study will utilize a modified toxi city probabili ty interval  
(mTPI)design (Ji, 2010 ; Guo, 2017 )to determine the safet y and tol erabili ty of various 
JCARH125 dose l evels in subjects wi th R/R MM. The m TPI desi gn uses a Bayesian statist ical 
framework and a beta/bino mial hierarchic model to com pute the posterior probabilit ies of three
intervals that reflect the relat ive distance between the toxicit y rate of each dose l evel to hel p 
ident ify an optimally safe dose range with the l owest number of treated subjects possible. The 
mTPI design ha s been demonstrated to more frequent ly select the true MTD for an 
investigat ional drug than the tradit ional 3+3 design (Ji, 2013 ).
2.5. Justification of Endpoints
The primary  object iveof thePhase 1dose escalat ionportion of  the study  will be to establish the 
safet y and tolerabilit y of one or m ore dose l evels for JCARH125 in subject s with R/R MM. This

4.1. Overall Study Design
This is an open -label, mult icenter, Phase 1/2 study  to determine the safet y, PK, and ant itumor 
activit y of JCARH125 in adult subjects with R/R MM. The Phase 1 dose -escalat ion porti on of  
the study  will evaluate the safet y and tol erabilit y of increasing dose levels o f JCARH125 in orde r 
to ident ify RP2D (s).The Phase 2a porti on of  the study  will evaluate the antitumor activit yof 
JCARH125 at the RP2D (s)in subjects who have been previously treated with BCMA -directed 
therapy . The Phase 1 anakinra cohort will evaluate the safety and tolerabilit y of JCARH125 at 
the dose l evel 3 and/or dose l evel 3a in subjects who receive prophylact ic treatment wi th
anakinra. The Phase 2 expansio n porti on of  the study  will further evaluate the safet y, PK, and 
antitumor act ivity of JCARH125 at the RP2D (s).
A tum or biopsy  sample (bone marrow bi opsy , bone m arrow aspirate ) will be obtained fro m all 
subjects during init ial screening. A plasmacy toma bi opsy sample will  also be obtained at 
screening iffeasible (see the H125001 Central Laboratory  Manual ).
Subjects who meet all eligibilit y criteria will be enrolled and will undergo l eukapheresis to 
enable JCARH125 product generation. Subjects may  receive bridging therapy , excluding 
experimental and biological agents (eg, daratumumab) ,afterleukapheresis and before 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy if deemed nece ssary  by the treating physician for disease control 
during JCARH125 manufacturing (see Section8.4for allowed therapies ).Bridging therapies 
must be discont inued at least 14 days prior to init iation of  lymphodepl etion and subjects m ust 
continue to meet eligibilit y criteria pertaining to adequate organ funct ion, active infections, 
pregnancy, measurable disease, and washout of prior therapy  before ini tiation of 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy .If JCARH125 cannot be made fro m the first leukapheresis 
product, addit ional leukapheresis may  be allowed af ter consul tation wi th the Sponsor.
Following successful JCARH125 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase and 
will receive lymphodepl etion followed by  JCARH125 infusio n.Eligibilit y criteriaand disease 
assessments will be confirmed prior to init iation oflymphodepletion and JCARH125 infusio n
(see Secti on8.5.1 ).A treatment cycle will include lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy with
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide ( see Secti on6.2for regimen), followed by  a single dose of 
JCARH125 administered IV on Day 1.JCARH125 will be administered 2 to 7days after 
completion of l ymphodepleting chemotherapy unless clinical or logistical circumstances require 
modificati on of  this timing. Dose adj ustments or changes to the lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy 
regimen may be indicated due to the subject’s creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) as described in 
Secti on6.2. The sequence of events is depicted in Figure 1.

Subjects will be fo llowed under this protocol for 2years after JCARH125 administrati onfor 
safet y, disease status, addit ional anticancer therapies, and survival. If disease progression occurs 
during thi s 2
-year timeframe, subject should still be fo llowed per the Schedule of Evaluat ions 
outlined in Appendix A. The number of JCARH125 cells in both peripheral blood and bone 
marrow samples will be assessed by quant itative polymerase chain react ion (qPCR )from the 
time of JCARH125 administration until the end of the study .Disease assessments will be 
perform ed prior to study  treatm ent,approximately every 4 weeks fo llowing JCARH125
administration for the first 6months, and then every  3months until 2 years after JCARH125
administration or until disease progression has been confirmed , whichever com es first. Bone 
marrow bi opsy  and aspirate will be performed for all subjects for disease response evaluations, 
PK, and/or research assessments at Day 15, Day 29, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, 
and Month 24for confirmat ion of CR, and in the event of disease progression . Response to
JCARH125 will be assessed according to the 2016 IMWG criteria (Appendix B).In Phase 1and 
Phase 2a, response to JCARH125 will be assessed by  the Invest igator. In Phase 2 and for 
subjects treated in Phase 1 and the Phase 1 anakinra cohort at the RP2D (s), response wil l be 
assessed by  the Invest igator and confirmed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).
Evaluat ion of the primary efficacy endpo intof ORR in Phase 2 will  be based on IRC assessment.
All subjects who receive JCARH125 will be asked to enroll in a separate Celgene -sponsored 
long-term follow-up (LTFU) study at the time of com pletion or discont inuat ion from this study .
Subjects who enroll in the LTFU protocol will sign a separate informed consent form and may be 
followed for up to 15 years after JCARH 125administration as per current FDA guidelines (Food 
and Drug Administration, 2006a )forlong-term JCARH125 -related safet yand efficacy .
4.2. Phase 1 Dose -Escalation
The JCARH125 dose levels to be evaluated in Phase1are provided in Table 2.Dose -
escalat ion/de-escalati on will  follow a m odified toxicit y probabili ty interval  (mTPI-2) algorithm 
(Guo, 2017 )with a target DLT rate of 30% and an equivalence interval o f 25% to 35%. The table 
in Append ixJprovides the dose -escalation and de -escalat ion gui delines based on the number of

bIntroduced with Protocol Amendment 5 ( 31May 2019 ) as a possible intermediate dose level.
Note: Intermediate dose levels may be evaluated based on ongoing safety and efficacy data .
The first 3subjects treated in the Phase 1 dose escalat ion porti on of  the study  will be treated wi th 
JCARH125 at Dose Level 1(50×106CD3+CAR+ cells) .Within the first dose cohort, treatment 
of the first 3 subjects will be staggered by a minimum  of 
14days. At each higher dose level, 
treatm ent of the first 3 subjects within the dose cohort will be staggered by a minimum o f 7days.
Staggering of subjects in a dose cohort may be lift ed after a minimum o f 3subjects have been 
treated in that dose cohort , have completed the 2 1-day DLT evaluat ion peri od, and the dose level 
is determined to be safe according to the mTPI
-2 algorithm .
A maximum of 3 subjects will init ially be treated at a dose l evel. If none of these 3 subjects 
experience a DLT, the dose may be escalated to the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 subjects 
experiences a DLT at a dose level, then addit ional subjects will be enrolled at this dose l evel and 
dose-escalat ion/de-escalat ion decisio ns will be made per the mTPI -2 algorithm after the DLT 
data for these addit ional subjects are available. If 2 of 3 subjects experience a DLT at a dose 
level, then the dose will be de -escalated to the next lower dose l evel. If all 3 subjects experience 
a DLT at a dose level, the dose will be de -escalated and this dose and all higher doses will be 
removed from  further evaluat ion in the trial.The m TPI-2 decisio n table is provided in
Appendix J.
Tobe considered evaluable for DLT, a subject must have received the conforming JCARH125 
cell product at the assigned dose of JCARH125 and completed the 2 1-day evaluati on period or 
experienced a DLT prior to completing the 2 1-day evaluat ion.Subjects who are not evaluable for

JCARH125 infusio n and receive conforming JCARH125 product. The efficacy  analysis set will 
include at least 75subjects who are evaluable for both safet y and efficacy  (as defined in 
Secti on10.2.3.1 ).
4.7. Study Duration and Duration of Subject Participation
The enro llment period is expected to take approximately 36months and the fo llow-up period for 
each subject is approximately  24months after JCARH125 administration .Thus, the total 
durati on of  the study  is expected to be approximately 60months.
The expected duration of participat ion for subjects who complete the study  will be 
approximately  26months.All subjects who receive JCARH125 will be eligible to enroll in a 
separate Celgene -sponsored LTFU protocol after complet ion of this study or earlier 
discontinuat ion,per healt h authorit y regul atory  guidelines, currently up to 15 years after 
JCAR H125 administrati on.

myeloma Therapy Cohort
Further enrollment or treatment of the subjects in any or all appropriate cohorts will be paused 
pending notificat ion of the DSMB and appropriate regulatory  authori ties if any  subject 
experiences any  of the fo llowing events wi thin 30 days of a JCARH125 inf usion:
Life-threatening ( Grade 4) toxicit y attributable to JCARH125 that is unexpected and 
unrelated to chemotherapy
Expected toxicit ies that woul d not l ead to study  interruption include Grade 4 CRS, 
neurotoxi city (eg, confusio n, aphasia, seizures, convuls ions, lethargy , and/or al tered 
mental  status), fever, hypotension, hypoxia, TLS, and disseminated intravascular 
coagul ation.In addit ion, ICU admissio n, the need for dialysis, and/or the need for 
mechanical vent ilation are also expected. Theseexpected tox icities may also result in 
secondary  toxicities of Grade 4 renal toxicit y, hepati c toxi city, or other organ 
involvement , each of which also would not lead to study  interrupti on.A Grade 4 
toxicity that i s not considered to be a DLT (refer to listed excepti ons in Section4.3) 
will not l ead to study  interrupti on.
An unacceptably high incidence, across mult iple dose levels or after at least 
10subjects have been treated at the RP2D (s), of expected Grade 4 toxicit ies, 
including Grade 4 CRS (> 40%), Grade 4 neurotoxicit y (>30%), Grade 4 renal 
toxicity not associ ated wi th disease progressi on (> 30%), and Grade 4 hepatotoxicit y 
(>30%), attributable to JCARH125 or chemotherapy
Death rel ated to JCARH125 therapy
4.9. Criteria for Terminating the Study Prematurely
Further enrollment or treatment of subjects in any or all appropriate cohorts will be terminated 
for any o f the following reasons:
Any subject develops confi rmed replicat ion

4.11.1. Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent DSMB will review cumulat ive study  data approximately  quarterly over the 
course of the study  to eval uate safet y, protocol  conduct, and sci entific validit y and integrit y of 
the trial.In addit ion, in the event of a tox icity that meets the criteria for pausing the study  (see 
Secti on4.8), the DSMB will be convened to evaluate the comprehensive safet y data and to make 
a recommendat ion for study  cont inuat ion, modificati on,or terminat ion.The DSMB has been 
assembled under a de dicated charter specifically developed for safet y oversight of 
Juno -sponsored studies. 
Subject safet y will be evaluated as specified in the DSMB charter. The DSMB will provide 
advice to the Sponsor and study  invest igators as outlined in the DSMB charter. Juno will provide 
a DSMB review summary  to the study  invest igators for submissio n to the site’s IRB/IEC within

pregnancy test result at screening, and wit hin 7 days prior to the first dose of lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy). This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* fro m heterosexual 
contact.
Female subjects with reproductive potential who are not sexually abst inent must agree to use one 
highly  effect ive method of contraception from screening until at least 12 months fo llowing 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy. There are insufficient exposure data to provide any 
recommendat ion concerning the duration of contraception fo llowing treatm ent wi th JCARH125. 
Any decisio n regarding contracep tion after JCARH125 infusion should be discussed with the 
treating physician . 
Male subjects who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use an effect ive barrier 
contraceptive method f rom initiation of  lymphodepl etingchem otherapy  and for at least 12 
months after and should not donate semen or sperm during the ent ire study  periodand for at least

Screen failures are defined as subjects who consen t to parti cipate in the clinical study  but are 
determined not to meet all eligibilit y criteria requi red to parti cipate in the study .A minimal set of 
screen failure informat ion is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to 
meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and 
to respond to queries fro m regul atory  authori ties. Minimal informat ion includes demography, 
reason for screen failure, and, if applicable, any serious AEs (SAEs). Biopsy  samples obtained 
during Screening for subjects who are determined to be screen fail ures may be used by the 
Sponsor for exploratory  research. 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen failures) may be 
rescreened. 
5.4.2. Subject Withdrawal from Study
A subject m ay be withdrawn from  the study  for any  of the f ollowing reasons:

6.1. Therapy for Disease Control during JCARH125 Manufacturing
At the Invest igator’s discret ion, subjects may receive bridging therapy  for di sease control while 
their JCARH125 product is being manufactured (see Secti on8.4for allowed therapies) .
6.2. Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Lymphodepleting chem otherapy will consist of 3 days of fludarabine (30 mg/m2) and 
cyclophosphamide (300 m g/m2)and must be completed between 2 days ( ≥48 hours ) and 7days
prior to the JCARH125 infusio n.The recommended order and timing of administration is as 
follows: 
1.The IV hy dration is 1L of 0.9% NaCl given at 500 mL/h starting 2 hours prior to 
cyclophosphamide 
2.Fludarabine 30 mg/m2IV over 30 minutes or per inst itutional standard
3.Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2IV over 60 minutes 
4.Addit ional 1 L of 0.9% NaCl given at 500 mL/h
Lymphodepleting chem otherapy shoul d be wi thheld if the calculated CrCl (Cockcroft -Gault;
Appendix D)is < 60 mL/min or radi oisotope gl omerular filtrat ion rate (GFR) is <60 
mL/min/1.73 m2.Delay of lymphodepleting chemotherapy  by m ore than 14 days from the Pre -
treatm ent screening start date requires discussi on wi th the Sponsor and may require rescreening.
Iflymphodepl eting chemotherapy had to be delayed for reasons previously discussed with the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor, and if the delay was not longer than 14 day s, please refer to 
Appendix Afor whi chsafet y assessment shave to be repeated . Disease assessments do not need 
to be repeated unless there is clinical evidence of progression. Safety assessments should be 
conducted per the Schedule of Evaluations in Appendix A.
Subjects who cannot receive lymphodeplet ion within 8 weeks after l eukapheresis must be 
rescreened and safet y and efficacy assessments mustberepeated. Disease assessments as part of 
pre-treatm ent screening may be re duced for those subjects fo llowing di scussio n with the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor . 
Subjects with CrCl between 60and 70 mL/min shoul d have a 20% reduction offludarabine .

6.3. Anakinra (for Subjects Treated with Prophylactic Anakinra )
Anakinra is an interleukin -1 receptor antagonist indicated for the reduction in signs and 
symptoms and slowing the progression o f rheumatoi d arthri tis (RA) in pat ients 18 years of age or 
older at the recommended dose of 100 mg/day  administered daily by  SCinject ion. Anakinra is 
also indicated for cryopyrin-associ ated periodic syndro mes (CAPS), with a phenotype of 
neonatal -onset m ultisystem  inflammatory  disease (NOMID).
The potential benefit of prophylact ic treatment withanakinra on the onset, incidence and severit y 
of CRS will be investigated.
Subjects will receive 2dosesof 100 m g anakinra SC, one the night before and one
3 hours 
before JCARH125 infusio n. Subjects will cont inue with anakinra treatment for 5 consecut ive 
days at a dose of 100 mg SC. In the event of CRS onset, 100 mg anakinra SCshoul d be 
administered twice daily unt il CRS resolut ion. Anakinra shoul d be administered at 
approximately  the same t ime every day. In the event of worsening CRS and/or in case of onset of 
neuro logical toxicity, the toxici ty management guidelines from the protocol should be fo llowed
(see Appendix D) . Ifprophylact ic treatm ent wi th anakinra shows a posit ive effect on the onset, 
incidence and severit y of CRS, prophylact ic anakinra may be imple mented in the Phase 2 portion 
of the tri al.
Anakinra has been associated with an increased incidence of serious infect ions (2%) vs. placebo 
(< 1%) in clinical trials in rheumatoid arthrit is. Treatment with anakinra should not be initiated in 
patients wi th severe act ive infect ions. The safet y and efficacy o f anakinra in immunosuppressed 
patients or in patients with chronic infect ions have not been evaluated.
Drugs that affect the immune system by  blocking tum or necrosis factor (TNF) have been 
associ ated wi than increased risk of react ivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that 
taking drugs such as anakinra that blocks IL- 1 increases the risk of TB or other aty pical or 
opportunist ic infect ions. The m ost comm on side effects include mild to moderate swelling, 
redness, or pain at the inject ion site. Rare and/or serious side effects include allergic reaction, 
serious infect ions, and decrease in white blood cell counts. Refer to the package insert for further
details on administration of this agent .

7. MANAGEMENT OFTOXICITIES ASSOCI ATED WITH 
JCARH 125
Cytokine release syndrome and neurol ogictoxicities (NT) are associated with CAR T cell 
therapi es. Celgene has developed specific toxicit y management guidelines (TMG) for CRS and 
NT associated with Celgene cellular products based on curr ent clinical experience across the 
clinical development programs 
adapted for each indicat ion based on disease specific safet y 
observat ions (Appendix D) . These recommendat ions are based on the CRS revised grading 
system  (Lee, 2014) and the Common Toxicit y Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and need to 
be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide management in this trial.
If available and adopted as per sit e standard practice , CRS and NT grading according to the 
Amer ican Societ y for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System  (Lee, 2019) shoul d also be recorded in the electroni c case report form ( eCRF )to inform 
future modificati onsof the m anagement gui delines .
A co mplete discussio n of ident ified and potenti al risks associated wi th JCARH125 is available in 
the current version of the JCARH125 Invest igator’s Brochure ( IB).
7.1. Cytokine Release Syndrome
Administrati on of  CAR Tcells, such as JCARH125, i s associ ated wi th CRS. CRS i s 
characterized by  high fever, fat igue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, rigors, hypotensio n, 
hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and /oranorexia. Clinical symptoms and severit y of CRS are highly  
variable (Lee, 2014 ), and management can be co mplicated by concurrent condi tions.CRS 
symptoms typical ly appear a few hours to a few days fo llowing administrati on of  CAR T cells 
and may  be severe and life- threatening. Refer to Appendix Dfor a detailed descript ion of CRS 
and for grading and treatment recommendat ions.Fever ≥38.5°C or ≥101.3°F is a commo nly 
observed hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infect ion. Hence, infect ion must be 
considered in all subjects present ing with CRS symptoms, and appropriate cultures must be
obtained and empiric antibiot ic therapy init iated per inst itution standard of care.
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t respi ratory  
distress syndrome, renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopathies, disseminated intravascular 
coagul ation, and capillary  leak syndrom e. 
Neurol ogictoxicity has been observed concurrent ly with CRS.
With other CAR T cell products, CRS has been reported to be associated w ith findings o f 
macrophage act ivation syndrome/hemophagocy tic lympho -histiocytosis (MAS/HLH), and the 
physio logy of  the syndromes may  overlap (Secti on7.6). 
7.2. Fever
Subjects who develop a fever (temperature ≥38.5ºC) should be evaluated for infect ion and 
treated with ant ibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as per inst itutional or standard clinical

be evaluated prompt ly (eg, blood cultures obtained, imaging as clinically required for 
ident ificat ion of potential source of infection ) and managed medically per inst itutional or 
standard clinical pract ice. 
Thepossibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects with fever fo llowing JCARH125 
infusio n.Any onset of fever ( ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F ) within the first 2 weeks after JCARH125 
infusio n shoul d be further invest igated and subjects admitted for observation. Febrile subjects 
shoul d be m onitored cl osely for hemodynamic instabilit y and changing neurologic status.
7.3. Cytopenias
Severe ( Grade ≥3) and prolonged cytopenias, including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocy topenia, m ay occur wi th both lymphodepl eting chem otherapy and JCARH125.
Com plete bl ood counts (CBCs) shoul d be m onitored both pri or to and after JCARH125 
infusio ns.Institutional guidelines shoul d be fo llowed in the event of Grade ≥3 cytopeni as.
7.4. Infections
Life-threatening and fatal infect ions associ ated wi th CAR T cell therapy ,including JCARH125
have been observed. Severe infections may include bacterial, fungal (including pneumocyst is 
jirovecii), and viral infect ions(including cyto megalo virus (CMV), HBV, and other respiratory  
viruses ). 
Subjects with prolonged and/or recurrent cytopenias, especially in conjunct ion with 
hypogammaglo bulinemia, CD4 T -cell count of < 200 μL, and/or recent use of corticosteroids are 
at increased risk of viral react ivation and serious opportunist ic infect ions. In these settings, 
prophylact ic, pre -empt ive, or symptomat ic treatment with ant imicrobial, ant ifungal, ant i-
pneumocyst ic, and/or antiviral therapies is reco mmended per local institutional guidelines or 
standard clinical pract ice.
Antiviral therapy  with appropri ate ant iviral agent for HBV is recommended for subjects with 
positive hepat itis B surface antigen, HBcA b, and/or m easurable viral load. 
Subjects with a CD4 T- cell count of < 200 μL should be maintained on pneumocyst is 
prophylaxis with trimethoprim- sulfamet hoxazo le. If subjects cannot tolerate 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazo le, an alternat ive pneumocystis prophylaxis should be used.
7.5. Neurologic Toxicities
CAR T cell therapy is associated with unique neurol ogictoxicities.Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered m ental  status, aphasi a, altered l evel of consciousness, and seizures or seizure- like 
activit y.Neurol ogicsymptom s may begin 2 to 14 days after CAR T cell infusio n and in severe 
cases may require admissio n to the ICU for frequent monitoring, respir atory  support, or 
intubation for airway protecti on (Davila, 2014 ; Maude, 2014a ; Kochenderfer, 2015; Gardner, 
2016; Turtle, 2016a ) .The s ymptoms are variab le and generally occur as CRS is reso lving or 
after CRS resol ution.

Lympho -histiocytosis (HLH)
Macrophage a ctivati on syndrom e (MAS )is a serious disorder potentially associated with 
uncontrolled activation and proliferation of CAR T cells and subsequent activat ion of 
macrophages. Macrophage activat ion syndro me is typically  characterized by high -grade, non -
remit ting fever, cy topeni as, and hepatospleno megaly. Laboratory abnormalit ies found in MAS 
include elevated inflammatory  cytokine levels, serum  ferritin, so luble IL -2 receptor (sCD25), 
triglyceri des, and decreased circulat ing natural  killer ( NK)cells. Other fi ndings may include 
elevated levels o f transaminases, signs o f acute liver failure, coagulopathy , and disseminated 
intravascular coagulopathy . There are no definit ive diagnostic criteria for MAS; it is ty pically 
diagnosed using published criteria for hemoph agocy tic lympho -histiocytosis ( Schulert, 2015 ). 
While there is considerable overlap in clinical manifestations and laboratory  findings between 
MAS and CRS, other distinguishing MAS physical findings such as hepatospleno megaly and 
lymphadenopathy  are not comm on in adult subjects treated with act ivated T -cell therapies. 
Subjects treated with JCARH125 should be monit ored for MAS, and in case of MAS occurrence, 
cytokine -directed therapy withanIL-1receptor antagonist therapy  anakinra ,eg, shoul d be 
considered as clinically indicated. Refer to Appendix Dfor a detailed description of MAS and 
treatm ent recommendat ions.
7.7. Infusion Reactions
Administrati on of  JCARH125 m ay cause infusio n reacti ons, incl uding fever, ri gors, rash, 
urticaria, dy spnea, hypotensio n, and/or nausea. To minimize the risk of infusio n react ions, all 
subjects should be pre -medicated with acetaminophe n and /ordiphenhydramine
(see 
Secti on6.4.2 ).Mild infusio n reactions should be managed expectantly wit h ant ipyretics, 
antihistamines, and anti -emet ics. Corti costeroi ds shoul d be avo ided because of the potential 
impact on efficacy o f infused JCARH125 cells. Rigors m ay be treated wi th meperidine.
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for infusio n reactions:
Grade 1:administer symptomat ic tre atment,continue JCARH125 administration at 
the sam e dose and rate
Grade 2:stop administration of JCARH125 ,administer symptomat ic treatment ,
resum e JCARH125 administration at a reduced rate only  after symptoms resolve
Grade 3:stop administration of JCAR H125, administer symptomat ic treatment, and 
resum e JCARH125 administration at a reduced rate of administration only after 
symptoms resolve. If Grade 3 reaction recurs, discontinue JCARH125; no further 
JCARH125 should be administered
Grade 4:discontinue ad ministrati on of  JCARH125 and administer symptomat ic 
treatm ent as necessary; no further JCARH125 should be administered
7.8. Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Both the lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy emplo yed in this protocol and JCARH125 therapy  may 
cause TLS in subjects with high disease burden. Subjects should be closely mo nitored for

burden and high cell turnover, shoul d receive prophylact ic treatment ,including administration of 
allopurino l and hydrati on,as per standard clinical practice. 
7.9. B-cell Aplasia
This toxicit y may be managed by  monitoring serum  immunogl obulin levels, and infusio n of 
intravenous i mmunoglobulin (IVIG) for hy pogammaglo bulinemic subjects (serum IgG 
< 400 mg/dL) should be considered. 
7.10. Uncontrolled T -cell Proliferation
CAR Tcells, including JCARH125, could theoretically proliferate out of control. If uncontrolled 
JCARH125 T -cell proliferat ion occurs, subjects may  be treated wi th high -dose steroi ds (eg, 
methylpredniso lone 1 to 3 mg/kg/day, tapered over 7 days ) or lymphodepl eting doses of 
cyclophosphamide (1 -3g/m2IV). If an Invest igator suspects uncontrolled JCARH125 
proliferat ion, the Sponsor should be contacted immediately.
7.11. Replication -Competent Lentivirus, Clonality, and Insertional 
Oncogenesis 
Lentiviral vectors used in gene transfer are engineered to be replicat ion-defect ive; however, 
generat ion of replication -competent lent iviruses (RCL) during manufacturing is st ill a 
possibilit y.Modern vector production systems have been improved to reduce the risk of RCL 
generat ion.To date, there have been no reports of RCL generated during lentiviral vector 
manufacturing, which may be due, at l east in part, to the use of self -inact ivating vectors such as 
the lentiviral vector used in the production of JCARH125 (Rothe, 2013 ).
Concerns for possible vect or integration into the host genome have arisen due to preclinical 
studi es that have shown retrovirus -mediated malignant transformat ion in mice (Li, 2002 ; 
Modlich, 2005) and monkeys (Donahue, 1992 ), and a single clinical study  reporting 
development of leukemia in subjects with X- linked severe co mbin ed immunodeficiency (SCID) 
who received retroviral -modified CD34+ hematopoiet ic stem cells (Hacein -Bey-Abina, 2003) , 
including 1subject who died (Couzin, 2005). Of note, no instances of RCL generation during 
producti on or l entivirus -mediated malignant transformation in animals or subjects have been 
reported to date.
Data have recent ly been publish ed on the integration si tes of  retrovi ral and lentiviral vectors used 
for T-cell modificat ion in clinical trials (Wang, 2009; Scho ller, 2012; McGarri ty, 2013 ).No 
clonali ty of integrati on si tes was observed. In additio n, there did not appear to be enrichment of 
integrat ion sites near genes invo lved in clo nal expansio n or persistence.
Per the FDA Rec ombinant DNA Advisory  Committee gui delines (Food and Drug 
Administrati on, 2006b ; Food and Drug Administration, 2006a ), all subjects treated wi th 
JCARH125 will be followed for RCL and vector sequences for up to 15 years following 
JCARH125 administrati on as part of a LTFU protocol. All subjects will be mo nitored for 
evidence of unexpected JCARH125 expansio n and the emergence of a new maligna ncy, 
particularly one of T -cell origin. Invest igators should contact the Sponsor immediately if a new 
malignancy arises.

Confidential and Proprietary 66 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 20207.12. Adverse Reactions to Excipients
Because JCARH125 is a cry opreserved autol ogous cell product con taining DMSO, subjects may  
notice a garlic -like taste and odor and/or experience other side effects associated with DMSO, 
including tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertensio n, hypotension, chest tightness, dyspnea, 
pulmo nary edema, abdominal  cramping, di arrhea, shivering, and rest lessness. 
7.13. Autoimmune Reactions
Because JCARH125 cells are activated immune cells, it is theoretically possible that the 
JCARH125 cells could attack normal cells in the skin, liver, kidney , bone m arrow, and j oints.
Addit ionally , cytokines released from  genet ically modifi ed Tcells coul d trigger other Tcells in 
the body  to attack norm al tissue, result ing in an autoimmune reaction.
7.14. Risks Associated with Anakinra treatment
For subjects who receive prophylact ictreatm ent wi th anakinra, refer to the local package insert 
for specific details regarding the risks of anakinra.
7.15. Risks Associated with Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Subjects will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to treatment with JCARH125 to 
facilitate lymphodeplet ion and CAR T cell engraft ment. Refer to t he local package inserts for 
specific details surrounding the risks of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
A schedule o f evaluations is provi ded in Appendix A.Specific visits are described in Section8.2
through Section 8.5and descript ions of study  assessments are presented in Secti on8.12.
All procedures and clinical laboratory  assessments on days that lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
or JCARH125 is administered must be performed pre -dose unless otherwise specified. With the 
exception of CrCl, which must be measured on the first day  of lymphodepl eting chemotherapy 
(see Secti on6.2), clinical laboratory  assessmen ts may be performed wit hin 1 day prior to start of 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy or JCARH125 administration. Results fro m the clinical 
laboratory  assessments m ust be reviewed pri or to init iation of lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy or 
JCAR H125 administrati on.

1.Prior to leukapheresis following si te’s com pletion of all screening assessments
2.Prior to lymphodepl eting chemotherapy
3.Prior to JCARH125 infusi on
The treatment period includes lymphodepl eting ch emotherapy  (Secti on6.2) and JCARH125 
administration (Secti on6.4), as well as fo llow-up through Day 29.The Post -t reatm ent peri od 
continues through Mon th24unless the subject discontinues early oris lost to follow -up.All 
subjects will be assessed for response
in accordance with the IMWG criteria at the times noted in
Appendix A.
The Post-treatm ent period includes follow-up visit s for eval uation of safet y and di sease status at 
indicated times. The 24- month visit will be the EOS visit , unless a subject di scontinues early .
Subjects who experience disease progression or relapse should complete the PD visit and will be 
encouraged to continue all study  eval uations through the EOS vi sit, as well as part icipate in the 
LTFU study (Secti on8.11).For subjects who withdraw from the study  before the 24 -month visit, 
the EOS visit shoul d be com pleted at the time o f study  withdrawal .
8.2. Screening
The standard screening process begins when the subject signs the IRB/IEC -approved informed 
consent form for parti cipati on in the study and continues until the subject is determined to be 
eligible and i s enrolled or is determined to be a screen failure.
The fo llowing a ssessments will be performed during Screening (may be perform ed up to 4 weeks 
following informed consent):
Assess eligibilit y per inclusio n/exclusio n criteria. All eligibilit ycriteria m ust be m et 
forsubjects to continue in the study .
Obtain clinically  significant medical history , including disease di agnosis and history ,
HSCT history ,andchem otherapy , radiati on,and surgi cal history .May include history  
of toxicities related to prior treatments and allergies
ECOG performance status assessment (see Appendix F)

8.3. Leukapheresis
Following enro llment on the study , a leukapheresis collect ion will be performed on each subject 
to obtain a sufficie nt quant ity of peripheral  blood m ononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the production 
of the JCARH125 invest igational product (see exclusion criteria in Section5.2for timing of 
leukapheresis in relat ionship to previous therapies). If a technical issue arises during the 
procedure or in the immediate processing of the product such that it cannot be used for 
JCARH125 production, the subject may have additio nal leukapheresis procedures performed.
Leukapheresis should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject meets eligibilit y 
requi rements, in coordinat ion with the Sponsor. Venous access is required for leukapheresis and 
shoul d be determined according to institutional practi ce. 
The fo llowing assessments will be conducted on the day  of leukapheresis :
Collect ion of peripheral blood samples for local clinical laboratory  evaluat ions, 
including:
Hem atology (com plete bl ood coun t [CBC] wi th different ial)
Note: Hematology resul tsmust be evaluated prior to leukapheresis; in order to ensure results are 
available, sample may  be collected up to 24 hours prior to leukapheresis .

8.4. Anticancer Treatments between Leukapheresis and JCARH125 
Production
The m anufacturing and qualit y testing of JCARH125 may  take several weeks fo llowing 
leukapheresis. During this t ime, subjects may receive short term  (≤ 4weeks) bridging therapy  
with one of the fo llowing recommended regimens: 
Dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplat in (DCEP) 
Bortezomib, dexamethasone, cisplat in, doxorubicin, cyclophosph amide, and 
etoposide (VD -PACE)
Cyclophosphamide, vincrist ine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (CVAD)
Pulsed dexamethasone
An alternate bridging therapy  regimen that is inst itutional standard m ay be used, following 
discussio n with the Sponsor’s Medical Monit or.Anti-CD38 agents such as daratumumab, or 
other m onocl onal ant ibodies (eg, elotuzumab) are not permitted as bridging therapy. A re-
infusio n of autol ogous peri pheral bl ood s tem cells (stem  cell boost) preceded by  bridging 
chemotherapy is not permitted.  Experimental agents are not permitted. Duration of bridging 
therapy  is limited to a maximum of 4 weeks. All therapies (including steroids) must be
discontinued at least 14 days prior to initiation of lymphodeplet ionandthe time period from 
leukapheresis t o lymphodepl etion cannot exceed 8 weeks. Subjects must have recovered from 
bridging therapy -related toxi cities to Grade ≤2 (except for alopecia) prior to init iation of 
lymphodepl etion.Subjects who cannot receive lymphodeplet ion within 8 weeks after 
leukapheresis must be rescreened and must com plete all  screening assessments .
Palliat ive radiat ionispermitted but must be discussed with the Sponsor ’sMedi cal Monitor in 
advance .
If bridging anticancer therapy is necessary ,appropri ate disease measureme nts (eg, bone marrow 
evaluat ion, serum and urine M -protein, serum  and urine immunofixation, sFLC, q uanti tative 
immunogl obulins, and a PET/CTor DW -MRI )must be re peated pri or to lymphodeplet ionand 
all subjects must have measurable disease prior to ini tiating lymphodeplet ion. Subjects who did
nothave extramedullary disease at screening and who do nothave evidence of disease 
progression do nothave to repeat a PET/CT or DW -MRI af ter bri dging therapy . Subjects who 
respond to bridging chemot herapy and who no longer have measurable disease must wait until 
their disease beco mes measurable to be considered for JCARH125 treatment.
8.5. Study Visits
8.5.1. Pre-treatment Screening and Baseline Evaluations
The subject must continue to meet eligibilit y criteria pertaining to adequate organ funct ion, 
active infect ions, pregnancy, measurable disease, and washout of prior therapy before init iation 
of lymphodepl eting chemotherapy (see Secti on5.1and Section 5.2).Growth factors and

and platel et count requi rements atthe Pre -treatm ent Screening evaluat ion.
Subjects whose disease beco mes non -measurable following bridging chemotherapy  will not 
receive lymphodeplet ingchemotherapy or JCARH125. These subjects may be treated with the 
study  regimen when their disease becomes measurable; rescreening is required.
Pre-treatm ent Screening evaluat ions m ust occur within 14days (+3days) prior to init iation of 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy and must occur after the complet ion of any  bridging 
chemotherapy. For subjects who receive bridging chemotherapy with potenti ally cardi otoxi c 
drugs , a repeat MUGA/ECHO must be performed within 7 days pri or to init iation o f 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy. Evaluat ions will be performed as indicated in the Schedule o f 
Evaluat ions(see Appendix A).
Subjects s hould have a hemoglo bin level o f ≥ 8g/dL and a platelet count of ≥50,000/mm3prior 
to lymphodeplet ion; RBC transfusio ns and other supportive measures may  be used. If 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy had to be delayed for reasons previously discussed wit h the
Sponsor Medical Monitor, and if the delay was not longer than 14 day s, only safet y assessments 
have to be repeated . Disease assessments do not need to be repeated unless there is clinical 
evidence of disease progression.
8.5.2. Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Upon notificat ion from the Sponsor that JCARH125 will be available, lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy should be init iated (see Secti on6.2for details andtiming of the lymphodepl eting 
regimen and criteria for withholding or adjusting treatm entbased on reduced CrCl ; see 
Secti on8.5.3 for criteria forinitiating treatment ).
The fo llowing assessments will be performed on each day of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 
prior to administration of lymphodepleting chemotherapy:
Physical examinat ion, including routine neurol ogicexaminat ion, vital signs, and 
weight
ECOG performance status assessment (first day  of lymphodepl eting chemotherapy 
only) (see Appendix F)
Local  laboratory  assessments , including hematol ogy, coagul ation,and c hemistri es 
Record all AEs and conco mitant m edicati ons
8.5.3. Criteria for JCARH125 Infusion (Day -1)
Subjects should not experience a significant worsening in clinical status compared to init ial 
eligibilit y criteria that woul d, in the opinio n of the treating physician, increase the risk of adverse 
events associated with JCAR H125 infusio n.Subjects who meet at least one of the fo llowing 
criteria wi thin 24 hours prior to the scheduled JCARH125 infusio n shoul d have JCARH125 
administration delayed:
Suspected or active systemic infection 5 days before JCARH125 infusio n

8.6. Unscheduled Evaluations
If the Investigator feels that a subject needs to be evaluated at a time other than a 
protocol -specified visit, the subject may be asked to come in to the clinic for an unscheduled 
evaluat ion. The fo llowing assessments may  be perform edas clinically indicated, and results 
reported into the clinical database :
Physical examinat ion
Vital signs 
ECOG performance status assessment 
Clinical laboratory  evaluat ions(eg, hematol ogy, coagul ation, chemistri es)

samples should also be co llected and submitted to the Sponsor for exploratory 
research.
Bone m arrow or pl asmacy toma biopsy
Note: If bone marrow or plasmacyto ma samples are obtained, samples should also be 
collected and submitted to the Sponsor forexploratory  research.
Other tissu e assessments (eg, CSF, SPM ) 
Note: If tissue or fluid samples are obtained, samples should also be co llected and 
submitted to the Sponsor for exploratory  research.
CNS imaging (CT and/or MRI)
Note: If scans are obtained as part of a neurologic examinat ion, results shoul d be 
reported .
Disease assessments as needed to confirm a response ( eg, SPEP, 24-h our UPEP, 
serum  and urine immuno fixation, sFLC, quant itative immunoglobulins, PET/CT, 
DW-MRI scan or skeletal survey )
If co llected, s amples for SPEP, 24-h our UPEP, serum and urine immuno fixation, and

shoul d be encouraged to continue to be fo llowed as per the Sc hedule of Ev aluati onsTable A -4
through Month 24.
8.9. Assessments to be Performed in the Event of a new Second Primary 
Malignancy
Second primary malignancies (SPMs) will be mo nitored as events of interest and must be 
reported as SAEs regardless of treatment subject is receiving ( see Section9.1.2 ). Events of SPM
are to be reported using the SAE Report Form and must be considered “Important Medical 
Events” if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and subject’s source documents. Documentation on the 
diagnosis of SPM m ust be provi ded at the time of SAE reporting (eg, any  confirmatory  histol ogy 
or cy tology resul ts, x-rays, CT scans).
If subject develops a new malignancy , the sponsor will request a tumor sample (refer to 
laboratory  manual) and blood samples ( Secti on8.12.9.1 and Secti on8.12.10 ).
8.10. Early Withdrawal
If a subject withdraws prematurely fro m the study , an EOS visit will be scheduled as soon as 
possible and all of the assessments listed for the EOS visit will be performed. The reason for 
early  withdrawal will  be captured in the CRF.
8.11. Long- Term Follow -Up
Because this protocol invo lves gene transfer, fo llow up for l entiviral vector safet y, disease status, 
and lo ng-term survival will cont inue on this protocol until 24 months after JCAR H125
administration , regardless o f disease status, and under a separate Celgene -sponsored LTFU 
protocol  for up to 15 years after JCAR H125 administration . 
All subjects treated with JCAR H125 who ei ther complete the primary  follow-up peri od specified 
in this protocol or who prematurely wit hdraw after at least one dose of JCAR H125 will be asked 
to enroll in the Celgene -
sponsored LTFU protocol at the EOS visit or at the time of withdrawal, 
respectively .A separate informed consent form will be provi ded f or the Celgene -sponsored 
LTFU protocol. Subjects who do not consent to participate in the Celgene -sponsored LTFU 
protocol  or who are lost to fo llow-up will be fo llowed for survival through public record.

Response to JCARH125 will be assessed according to the IMWG criteria (Kumar, 2016) ( see
Appendix B).In Phase 2,and for subjects in Phase 1 and the Phase 1 anakinra cohort who 
receive JCARH125 at the RP2D (s), response will be assessed by an I RC
in addit ion to the 
Invest igator assessment, as described in Section4.11.2 .
Some or all  of the fo llowing are requi redfor the assessment of disease status:
SPEP and 24-hour UPEP (central laboratory )
For subjects with disease that is only detectable in the serum, a 24
-hour UPEP is only 
requi red at Screening, for confirmat ion ofCR,as clinically indicated, and at EOS.
Serum /urine i mmuno fixation(central  laboratory )
Quant itative sFLC (central  laboratory )
Quant itative immunoglobulins (central  laboratory )
Bone m arrow asse ssment for plasma cell percentage (central patho logy review )
Bone m arrow eval uations are required for all subjects at Screening, Day 15, Day 29, 
Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24/ EOS, for confirmat ion of CR, and 
in the event of PD. In addition, subjects for whom inadequate or insufficient samples 
were available at Screening and subjects who receive bridging chemotherapy will 
also have bone marrow evaluat ions at Pre -treatment Screening.
Skeletal survey
The skeletal survey  is requi red at Screening and will only be performed as clinically 
indicated thereafter. At the Investigator ’s discret ion, a PET/CT or DW -MRI may be 
perform ed in lieu of the skeletal survey  to eval uate for bone l esionsat Screening, 
provi ded that the same imaging modalit yis used for all future assessments.
Imaging by PET/CT or DW -MRI in subjects with extramedullary disease or if a new 
extram edullary  lesion is suspected . 
MRD assessment by next-generation sequencing and/or flow cytometry evaluat ion of 
bone marrow aspirate samples collected at Screening (clone ident ification), Day 29, 
Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24 /EOS, and if otherwise co llected

8.12.7. CSF Examination and CNS Symptom Assessment
CSF assessments and CNS imaging should be performed after JCARH125 administration as 
clinically indicated (eg, ifnew CNS symptoms occur, or if clinical signs or suspicio n of CNS 
involvement by  MM).If CT and/or MRI scans are obtained as part of a neuro logicexaminat ion, 
resul ts shoul d be reported. If CSF fluid is collected, a sample should be submitted to the central 
laboratory  to evaluate for the presence of JCARH125 (see the H125001 Central  Laborat ory 
Manual  for instructi ons on sending a sample for JCARH125 testing). 
8.12.8. Pharmacokinetics, Vector Sequence Testing, and Exp loratory Research

8.12.9. Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Assessment of JCARH125 expansio n and persistence (PK) in blood  
 will be determined by qPCR to detect th e JCARH125 transgene.
8.12.9.1. Viral Vector Sequence Testing
In accordance with the FDA guideline for evaluating delayed adverse events (Food and Drug 
Administr ation, 2006a ), if more than 1% of cells in test samples co llected at the Month 12 visit 
or later test posi tive for the JCARH125 transgene (as determined using the qPCR PK assay) , the 
pattern of vector integration sites will be analyzed. If a predominant integrati on si te is detected, 
then the subject will be asked to provide another blood draw 3 months later for follow -up testing.
If a subject develops disease recurrence or a new malignancy, the Sponsor will request a tumor 
sample and blood sample at time of new m alignancy  for assessment of viral vector sequence 
testing.

8.12.10. RCL Testing
Details regarding sample collection and processing are provided in the H125001 Central 
Laboratory  Manual .RCL testing will be performed using an analyt ically validated polymerase 
chain react ion (PCR) -based assay to detect viral envelope sequence in peripheral blood. If all 
samples co llected within the first year after the final  dose of JCARH125 are negative, subsequent 
samples will be archived at a central laboratory .However, if any of the samples are posit ive, 
additional testing will  be perf ormed on PBMCs to confirm the result. If the repeat test is also 
positive, further analysis o f the RCL will be underta ken toascertain the nature of the RCL and 
potenti al effects. Any confirmed posit ive result from RCL testing will be reported as an adverse 
experience in the form of an Investigational New Drug (IND) safet y report.
If a subject develops a new or recurrent neoplasm, the Sponsor will request a blood sample for 
assessment of RCL .
8.12.11. Health -Related Quality of Life 
Health-related qualit y of life outcomes will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 andits 
MM- specific m odule QL Q-MY2 0, as well as the EuroQol instrument EQ - 5D-5L . 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 i s a 30 -item scale co mposed of both mult i-item scales and single -item 
measures. All o f the scales and single -item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher scale 
score represents a higher l evel of well -being and better abilit y of daily  functioning. A 10 -point 
change in the scoring is considered to be a meaningful change in HRQoL. Thus, a high score for 
a functional scale represents a high/healt hy level of funct ioning; a high score for the global 
healt h status/HRQoL represents a high HRQoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item 
represents a high level o f symptom atic problem. A copy  of a sample QLQ- C30 quest ionnaire is 
presented in Appendix G.
QLQ -MY2 0is composed of quest ions that address various domains o f HRQoL important in

the questionnaires(s) will be recorded (eg, too sick/unable to complete, administration error, 
subject refusal). If t he subject withdraws fro m the study  prematurely, all attempts should be 
made to obtain final qualit y-of-life quest ionnaires pri or to subject discontinuation.
8.12.12. Health Economics and Outcomes Research
Health utility scores will be m easured by the EuroQol instr ument EQ-5D- 5L. EQ-5D is a 
standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a 
simple, generic measure of healt h for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ -5D- 5L consists of 
the EQ -5D- 5L descript ive system and the EQ visual  a nalogue scale (EQ VAS). The descript ive 
system  com prises dimensio ns (mobilit y, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort, 
anxiet y/depressi on).Each dimensio n has 5 levels. A copy  of a sample EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire 
is presented in Appendix I.
Subjects should complete the questionnaires at the study visit, prior to any procedure or clinical 
evaluat ion.For subjects that do not complete the questionnaire, the reason for not co mpleting the 
questionnaires(s) will be recorded (eg, too sick/unable to complete, administration error, subject 
refusal). If the subject withdraws fro m the study  prem aturely , all attem pts shoul d be made to 
obtain final qualit y-of-life quest ionnaires prior to subject discont inuat ion.
Hospital resource utilization will be assessed based on the numbers of ICU inpat ient days and 
non-ICU inpat ient days.Dates of admission and discharge to the hospital and to the ICU will be 
collected on the appropriate CRF.
9. ASSESSMENT O F SAFETY
9.1. Definitions
9.1.1. Adverse Event
In accordance with the Internat ional Conference onHarm onisat ion (ICH) E2A guideline and 21 
CFR §312.32, an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship 
with this treatm ent.
Abuse, w ithdrawal, sensit ivity, or toxicit y to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE.Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be 
reported on the Study  Drug Administration CRF (see Secti on6.4.4 for the definit ion of 
overdose). Any sequela of an accidental or intent ional overdose of an invest igational product 
shoul d be reported as an AE on the AE C RF.If the sequela o f an overdose is an SAE, then the 
sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in 
the SAE should be ident ified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but 
shoul d not be report ed as an SAE itself.

supportive measures as necessary .There is no known specific ant idote for JCARH125 or 
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide overdose. Actual  treatm ent s hould depend on the severit y of the 
clinical situat ion and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
9.1.2. Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at any  dose, m eets any  of the cri teria 
in Table 5.Speci al considerat ions for SAE reporting , including events that should always be 
reported as SAEs in this study ,are presented in Table 6.
Table 5: Definitions of Serious Adverse Events
Criteria Description
Fatal The AE resulted in death.
Life-threatening The AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death. (This classification 
does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
had been more severe).
Hospitalization/ prolongati
on of hospitalizationThe AE resulted in hos pitalization or prolongation of hospitalization (see
Table 6).
Disability/incapacity The AE resulted in a disability, significant incapacity, or substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions
Congenital anomaly/birth 
defectThe AE was an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed 
to the study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy
Medically important The AE was a medically important event that did not meet any of the 
above criteria, but may have jeopardized the subject and may have 
required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above (examples include allergic bronchospasm that required 
treatment in an emergency room, seizures that do not result in 
hospita lization, or blood dyscrasias)

Criteria Description
Hospitalization/
prolongation of 
hospitalization
Note: Complications 
and/or prolonged 
admissions for 
routine treatment or 
procedure do require 
SAE reporting.This classification does not apply for the following hospitalizations:
Admissions for social or situational reasons (eg, no place to stay, live too 
far away to come for hospital visits) in the absence of any clinical AE
Admissions at the discretion of the Investigator for administration of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or JCARH125
Admissions for elective or pre -planned treatment or procedure for a 
pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the condition under study and has 
not worsened since providing informed consent
Admissions for routine treatment (eg ,platelet transfusion) or monitoring of 
the condition under study that is not associated with any deterioration in 
condition . 
Admissions for routine procedures (eg ,bone marrow aspiration) associat ed 
with the disease under study 
Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in 
admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above
9.2. Grading and Intensity of Adverse Events
Adverse events, with the except ion of CRS, will be graded using the NCI Common Termino logy 
Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), versi on 4.03. 
CRS will be graded according to the grading scale adapted from Lee et al (Lee, 2014 ), which is 
provi ded in Table 8inAppendix D.
The reported verbat im term should be the most descript ive medical diagn osis and does not have 
to be found in CTCAE.
AE severit y and seri ousness will  be assessed independent ly.‘Severit y’ refers to the intensit y of 
an AE, while ‘serious’ is a regulatory  defini tion and serves as a gui de to the Sponsor for defining 
regul atory  reporting obligations.
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug
The assessment of the relationship (related or not related) of an AE to lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy or JCARH125 is a clinical decisio n based on all available informat ion and the 
following considerations:
Related: There i s a reasonable possibilit y and/or evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship 
between study  drug and the AE and no other more likely  alternat ive cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, disease co mplications, etc.) is suspected.
Not related: There is no reasonable possibilit y and/or evi dence to suggest a causal relat ionship 
between study  drug and the AE and another more likely  alternat ive cause 
(concomitant drugs or therapies, disease complicatio ns, etc.) is suspected.

AEs/SAEs are recorded on the CRF in accordance with the reporting criteria for different time 
periods as defined in Section9.5.Each AE/SAE is to be evaluated for:
Durati on (onset and resolut ion dates) 
Severit y, including Grade changes as per the CRF complet ion gui delines (see 
Secti on9.2)
Outcom e 
Seriousness (see Section9.1.2 )
Causal relat ionship wi th protocol -mandated procedures , lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy ,or JCARH125 (see Secti on9.3)
9.4.1. Recording a Diagnosis versus S igns and Symptoms
Whenever possible, a unifying diagnosis should be reported as opposed to a list ing of individual 
symptoms. However, symptoms should be grouped into a diagnosis only if each sign or symptom 
is a medically  confirmed com ponent of that diagnosis as evidenced by current standard medical 
textbooks. If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, 
the individual symptom should be reported as a separate AE.
One except ion to reporting a diagnosis as opp osed to symptoms is the event of CRS. If a subject 
experiences an event of CRS, a diagnosis of CRS and any  Grade changes for the event of CRS 
shoul d be reported as an AE. Individual signs and symptoms of CRS ,and maximum Grade for 
those signs and symptoms ,shoul d be entered as CRS symptoms on a separate CRF.
When manifestations o f neuro logictoxicities appear in the presence of CRS, those 
manifestations shoul d be reported as separate AEs.
9.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments
Any laboratory  abnorm ality (eg, clinical chemistry or hematology ) or other abnormal assessment 
findings (eg, ECG or vital signs) that meets any o f the following cri teria shoul d be recorded as an 
AE or SAE:
Requi res m edical  or surgi cal interventi on 
Leads to pr oduct discont inuat ion, del ay, or interrupti on
Associ ated wi th clinical signs and/or symptoms
Otherwi se clinically  significant as determined by the Invest igator
Whenever possible, the clinical diagnosis, rather than the laboratory  resul t, shoul d be reported by 
the Invest igator (eg, anemia versus low hematocrit). 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory  values occurring during the study  will be fo llowed 
until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.

The fo llowing shoul d be considered when recording SAEs:
Death i s an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in death should be recorded 
in the CRF and reported on the SAE report form.
For hospitalizations or surgical or diagnost ic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgi cal or di agnosti c procedure shoul d be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself. The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in 
response to the illness.
Events related to disea se progressi on m ust be reported as SAEs if they meet serious 
criteria. When reporting an SAE of progression of the disease under invest igation, 
specific manifestations o f the progression (eg, “new bone pain ,” “worsening anemia 
and renal failure ”) shoul d be reported, rather than the general term “disease 
progression.”
9.4.4. Death Reports
Deaths must be reported as an SAE on the Death CRF per the reporting periods described in
Table 7.
Progressive disease is considered a study  endpo int;however, d
eath due to disease progression 
must be reported as an SAE if it occurs from the start of leukapheresis to within 90days of 
JCARH125 administrati on.Deaths that occur more than 90days after JCARH125 infusio n will 
be captured on the Death CRF and reported as an SAE only  if considered rel ated to any  
protocol -mandated procedure or JCARH125.
9.4.5. Pregnancy
To ensure subject safety , each pregnancy  occurring in a female subject or in the female partner 
of a male subject fro m the time of informed consent until the end of study  must be reported to 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. If the pregnancy is discovered 
following initiation o f lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy treatment, the pregnancy should be 
followed to determine outcome. All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring at any t ime 
after recei pt of  JCARH125, in either a female subject of childbearing potential or partner of 
childbearing potential of a male subject, are immediately reportable events .
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by  the 
Invest igator to the Sponsor. Pregnancy fo llow
-up shoul d be recorded on the same form and 
shoul d be submi tted to the Sponsor wi thin 24 hours of awareness. Any SAE experienced during 
pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, 
or spon taneous, shoul d be reported as an SAE. Congenital ano malies or bi rth defects, as defined 
by the “seriousness criteria” in Section9.1.2 , should be reported as SAEs.
All pregnancies should be monitored fo r the full duration, and all perinatal and neonatal 
outcom es shoul d be reported.

10.1. General Considerations
All analyses will be separated by  dose l evel unless otherwise specified. In the Phase 1 dose 
escalat ion porti on of  the tri al, summaries will be prepared by dose level and overall .Data from 
Phase 1 dose escalat ion at the RP2D (s), data from the Phase 1 anakinra cohort at the RP2D(s) ,
and data fro m Phase 2 expansion will be pool ed for analysis .If more than 1 dose level is selected 
as the RP2D, then analyses pooled across the RP2D levels in Phase 1 dose escalat ion, the Phase 
1 anakinra cohort ,and Phase 2 expansio n will be considered as the primary analyses, with 
analyses by  dose level  being considered as supplementary . The Phase 2 efficacy  analysis may  be 
refined in a detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP), fo llowing further di scussio n with regul atory  
authori ties.  Data fro m the Phase 1 anakinra cohort will be summarized separately  butsubjects 
treated in this cohort at the RP2D(s) will also be pooled with subjects treated at the RP2D(s) in 
Phase 1 dose escalat ionand Phase 2 expansio n for the primary analyses.   Data from the Phase 2a 
prior BCMA -directed anti -myeloma therapy cohorts will be analyzed separately  from Phase 1

The overall ty pe 1 error rate will be strongly controlled at the 1 -sided 2.5% l evel.
The stati stical hypotheses planned to be tested are:
1.
H0ORR ≤30%, H aORR > 30% in the Efficacy Analysis Set
2. H 0CR ≤5%, H aCR > 5% in the Efficacy Analysis Set
A gatekeeping approach will be used to control the ty pe1 error rate at the 1 -sided 2.5% 
significance l evel for evaluat ions of the primary  endpoint and the CR endpo int.Hypothesis 2) 
will only be tested at the 1 -sided 0.025 si gnificance l evel if hypothesis 1) i s rejected at the 
1-sided 0.025 si gnificance level.
10.5. Sample Size Considerations
Subjects in Phase 1 who are not evaluable for DLT will be replaced. A sample size of 
approximately  75 treated subjects at the RP2D(s) is planned for the primary  efficacy  eval uation.  
A sample size o f up to 120 subjects is planned for Phase 1 dose escalat ion with up to 
approximately  106 subjects potenti ally evaluated in Phase 1 dose escalat ion at dose levels not at 
the RP2D(s). The Phase 1 anakinra cohort will be comprised of u p to 14 subjects and is planned 
to be included in the primary efficacy evaluat ion.  Phase 2a will be co mprised of up to 42 
subjects (up to 14 subjects per cohort).  Assuming approximately  5% to 10% of subjects may  not 
be evaluable for the primary  endpoint due to reasons such as not being evaluable for DLT 
assessment, receiving non -conforming product, or not having measurable disease after receiving 
bridging chemotherapy, a total sample size of 245 subjects is planned for this Phase 1/2 study .
Upon com pletion of the Phase 1 dose -escalat ion porti on of  the study , addi tional subjects will  be 
enrolled such that at least 75subjects will be included in the Efficacy Analysis Set .The 
appropriate sample size per dose level will be based on discussio ns wi th regulatory  agencies if 
more than 1 dose level is selected as the RP2D (s).

Confidential and Proprietary 97 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 2020Based on the cumulat ive safet y and ant itumor activit y data f rom subjects treated in Phase 1 dose 
escalat ion, one or m ore dose l evels will be selected for further evaluat ion in the Phase 2
expansio nand Phase 2aportionsof the tri al (the RP2D (s)). It is ant icipated that 14-30 subjects 
will be treated at a dose level in Phase 1 dose escalation prior to determinat ion of a RP2D (s). A 
sample size of 14-30 subjects at a dose level will pro vide a high probabilit y of excluding an 
overly  toxic dose l evel from RP2D (s)considerat ion. For example, if the true DLT rate for a dose 
level is 45%, then the probabilit y of excluding this dose level from RP2D (s)considerat ion per 
the mTPI-2 table is ≥
74% f or all  sample sizes in the range of 14-30 subjects. The standard error 
of the ORR point estimate based on 14 or 30 subjects will be <13.4 % or 9.2%, respectively , 
provi ding reasonable precision for decisio n making regarding the determinat ion of the RP2D( s).
For the primary  efficacy endpoint of ORR in the Efficacy  Analysis Set , a sample size of 
75subjects will allow for approximately 90% power or higher based on the null hypothesis of 
ORR ≤30% assuming an effect size of ORR ≥ 49% using a 1 -sided exact test at the 0.025 level.
For the key  secondary  endpoint of CR in the Efficacy  Analysis Set , a sample size of 75subjects 
will allow for approximately 80% power or higher based on the null hypothesis of CR ≤ 5% 
assuming an effect size of CR ≥
15%.
The refe rence ORR o f 30% is based on results from a daratumumab monotherapy  study  
(Lonial, 
2016) evaluated in 106 subjects wi th R/R MM who had received at least 3 prior lines of therapy  
including a proteasome inhibitor and an immuno modulatory  agent or who were 
doubl e
-refractory  to a proteasom e inhibitor and an immuno modulatory agent. The ORR and CR 
rate were 29.2% (95% CI: 20.8, 38.9) and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.6,8.0), respectively, in the 
daratum umab m onotherapy  study .
A sample size o f up to 14 subjects per coh ort as a proof of concept in the Phase 2aprior-BCMA 
directed anti -myelo ma therapy  porti on of  the study allows for approximately 80% power or 
greater using a 1 -sided exact test at the 0.20 level based on the null hypothesis of ORR ≤ 10% 
assuming an effect size of ORR ≥30%. A 2-stage approach is planned for each cohort in the 
Phase 2aportion of  the study with a futility analysis for each cohort planned after 6 subjects have 
been evaluated for response and stopping for fut ility if no responses have been observed.   
A sample size o f 14 subjects is planned for the Phase 1 anakinra cohort .  An object ive of this 
cohort is to invest igate if prophylact ic use of anakinra in subjects treated at the RP2D (s)wit
h 
JCARH125 will reduce the onset, incidence and severit y of CRS rel ative to subjects treated with 
JCARH125 at the RP2D (s)in Phase 1.  The fo llowing hypothesis will be tested in this cohort as 
an evaluat ion of the potential merits of prophylact ic intervent ion with anakinra :  
H0P ≥ P 0, H aP <P0where P denotes the true Grade 2 or higher CRS TEAE incidence rate when 
JCARH125 is administered at the dose l evel 3 and/or dose l evel 3awith prophylact ic use of 
anakinra and P 0denotes the observed Grade 2 or higher TEAE CRS incidence rate for the 
subjects in Phase 1 of th is trial treated at the dose level 3 and/or dose level 3a . A 1-sided test at 
the 0.20 significance level using a norm al approximat ion to the bino mial distribut ion will be 
used for this hypothesis tes t.  A sample size of 14 subjects will provide at l east 80 % power for 
this hypothesis test a ssuming P 0is at least 40% and assuming an effect size of at least a 50% or 
more reducti on in P 0if subjects are treated with JCARH125 at the dose level 3 and/or dose level

10.6.1. Interim Analyses
An interim analysis may be performed after at least 20 subjects have been treated at the RP2D (s)
pooled across Phase 1dose escalat ion, the Phase 1 anakinra cohort and Phase 2 expansio n and 
are evaluable for response (ie, have had at least 1 post-treatm ent disease assessment and all 
objective responses confirmed). The purpose of the interim analysis is to inform the development 
program for JCARH125. There are no intent ions to stop the trial early  for posi tive efficacy ;
therefore ,no ad justment to the al pha level  will be made for the final analysis .
10.6.2. Primary Analyses
The primary analysis forORR is planned after at least 75 subjects in the Efficacy  Analysis Set 
have been evalu ated for response. The exact timing of the analysis will be determined after 
discussio ns wi th regulatory  agencies.
10.6.3. Final Analysis
The final analyses will be carried out after all subjects have completed or discont inued the study  
for any  reason. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed at the final analysis.

Relapse (not 
applicable for this 
study )Clinical relapse requires one or more of the following criteria:
Direct indicators of increasing disease and/or end organ dysfunction (CRAB features) 
related to the underlying clonal plasma -cell proliferative disorder. It is not used in 
calculation of time to progression or progression -free survival but is listed as something 
that can be reported optionally or for use in clinical practice
Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions (osteoporotic fractures 
do not constitute progression)
Definite increase in the size of existing plasmacytomas or bone lesions. A d efinite 
increase is defined as a 50% (and ≥1 cm) increase as measured serially by the SPD dof 
the measurable lesion
Hypercalcaemia (> 11 mg/dL)
Decrease in hemoglobin of ≥2 g/dL not related to therapy or other 
non-my eloma -related conditions;

=sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions ; SUV =standardized uptake value .
aAll categories of response and MRD require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies 
were performed. All response categories require two consecutive assessments (confirmatory measurement); however, 
consecutive assessments of bone marrow for CR and MRD is not required. Confirmatory evaluations can be carried out at any 
time following the initial test provided it is before any new/non -protocol therapy.
bIMWG MRD criteria requires a CR
cPresence/absence of clonal cells on immunohistochemistry is based upon the κ/λ/L ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio by 
immunohistochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an 
abnormal clone is κ/λ of > 4:1 or < 1:2.
dPlasmacytoma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or dedicated CT scans where 
applicable. For subjects with only skin in volvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size 
will be determined by the SPD.
ePositive immunofixation alone in a subject previously classified as achieving a complete response will not be considered 
progression. For purposes of calculating time to progression and progression -free survival, subject s who have achieved a CR 
and are MRD -negative should be evaluated using criteria listed for progressive disease. Criteria for relapse from a CRor 
relapse from MRD should be used only when calculating disease -free survival.
fIn the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (eg, a possible laboratory error), that va lue will 
not be considered when determining the lowest value.
gAll relapse categor ies require two consecutive assessments made at any time before classification as disease progression and/or 
institution of any new therapy .

JCARH125
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicit ies (NT) are associated with chimeric 
antigen receptor ( CAR) T cell therapies. Celgene has developed the toxicit y management 
guidelines (TMG) for CRS and NT associated with Celgene cellular products used in treatment 
of subjects wi th relapsed and/or refractory mult iple myelo ma (R/RMM) , based on current 
clinical experience across several clinical development programs. These recommendat ions are 
based on the CRS revised grading system (Lee, 2014 ), the Common Toxicit y Cri teria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide management 
in this tri al. 
If available and a dopted as per site standard practice, CRS and NT grading according to the 
American Societ y for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System (Lee, 2019 )shoul d also be recorded in the electroni c case report form (eCRF) to inform 
future modificati ons of  the m anagement gui delines.
1. CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME
Administrati on of  cellular products such as CAR -expressing T cells can be associated with 
cytokine -associ ated toxici ty due to systemic production and release of vario us cy tokines into the 
circulat ion. Cy tokine -associ ated toxici ty, also known as CRS, is a toxicit y that occurs as a result 
of immune act ivation (Lee, 2014; Gardner, 2017 ). 
1.1 Pathophysiology of Cytokine Release Syndrome
The h allmark of CRS is immune act ivation result ing in elevated inflammatory cytokines. 
Cytokine release syndrome clinically  manifests when large numbers of lymphocy tes (B -cells, T 
cells, and/or natural killer [NK]cells) and/or myeloid cells (macrophages, dendr itic cells, and 
monocy tes) beco me act ivated and release inflammatory  cytokines. Cy tokine release syndrome 
has cl assically been associated with therapeutic monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) infusio ns, m ost 
notably  anti-CD3 (OKT3), anti -CD52 (al emtuzumab), ant i-CD20 (rituximab), and the CD28 
super -agoni st, TGN1412. Cy tokine release syndrome is also frequent ly observed fo llowing 
administration of bi -specific T cell engaging antibodies for leukemia, and adoptive cellular 
immunotherapies for cancer, most notably CAR T c ells. Incidence, time to onset ,and severit y of 
CRS due to CAR T cells are at least parti ally dependent on the infused cell dose and tumor 
burden/ant igen densit y, presumably  due to m ore rapi d and higher l evels of CAR T cell 
activat ion. Onset of CRS symptom s typically occurs day (s) to occasionally weeks after the CAR 
T cell infusio n, usually preceding maximal in vivo T cell expansion. Cytokine release syndrome 
is associated with elevated interferon gamma (IFN -γ), interleukin (IL) -6, and tum or necrosi s 
factor -alpha (TNF- α) levels, and increases in IL -2, granul ocyte macrophage co lony-stimulating 
factor (GM -CSF), IL -10, IL -8, IL -5, and fractalkine ,although the pattern of elevated cy tokines 
varies amo ng subjects ( Davila, 2014; Hay, 2017). Interl eukin 6 has been ident ified as a central 
mediator of toxicit y in CRS. Interl eukin 6 is a pl eiotropi c cytokine wi th anti
-inflammatory and 
proinflammatory  properti es. Hi gh levels of IL -6, present in the context of CRS, likely  initiates a 
proinfl ammatory  IL-6-mediated si gnaling cascade.

Protocol  H125001 A Celgene Co mpany
Confidential and Proprietary 131 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 20201.2 Clinical Presentation of Cytokine Release Syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome is characterized by high fever, fat igue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, 
tachy cardi a, rigors, hy potensi on, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and/oranorexia. Clinical 
symptoms and severit y of CRS are highly  variable ( Lee, 2014 ), and management can be 
complicated by  concurrent condi tions. In multip le myelo ma (MM) subjects treated with 
JCARH125 , CRS usually  occurs wi thin 10 days after infusio n (Mailankody , 2018 ).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥ 38.5°C or ≥ 101.3°F), is a commo nlyobserved 
hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infect ion must 
be considered in all subjects presenting wit h CRS symptoms, appropriate cultures 
must be obtained, and empiric antibiot ic therapy init iated per inst itution standard of 
care.
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t 
respi ratory  distress syndr ome, renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopathies, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and capillary  leak syndrom e. 
Neurol ogic toxi city has been observed concurrent ly with CRS; refer to Appendix D,
Secti on3.
CRS has been reported in so
me cases to be associated with findings of macrophage 
activat ion syndro me (MAS)/hemophagocyt ic lympho -histiocytosis (HLH), and the 
physio logy of  the syndromes may  overlap; refer to Appendix D,Secti on3.
1.3 Clinical Management of Cytokine Release Syndr ome
Across various CAR T cell products, early manifestations of CRS can predict more severe 
toxicity for both CRS and NT. 
CRS has been described to be more severe in subjects with mult iple myelo ma wit h higher 
disease burden and is associated with increase d serum  cytokines incl uding IL -6, IFN -γ, and other 
cytokines together with elevat ion of inflammatory  markers C- reactive protein (CRP) and ferrit in 
(Cohen , 2019; Brudno , 2016 ;Lee, 2015 ;Davila , 2014 ). 
It should be noted that, although useful for ident ifying subjects at higher risk for developing 
CRS, CRP, ferrit in, and serum cytokine levels should not be used for CRS cl inical  
management/treatment decisio ns in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms o f CRS; for 
example, a subject with an elevated CRP but no conco mitant symptom s may  not requi re 
intervent ion (Park, 2017 ). Thus, close o bservation of these subjects is strongly reco mmended.
A modificat ion of the CTCAE CRS grading scale has been established to better reflect CAR T 
cell-associ ated CRS, as detailed in Table 8(Lee, 2014 ).

Confidential and Proprietary 133 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 2020after the first dose or if rapid deteri oration shoul d occur, a second dose of tocilizumab shouldbe 
administered and a second -line agent , such as a corticosteroid, shoul d also be introduced 
simultaneously . 
Corticosteroids have been successfully used in the treatment of CRS, as both first -and second -
line treatment. Many  times, only  short courses of corti costeroi ds are req uired ( Turtl e, 2016; Lee,
2015; Maude , 2014a; Schuster , 2017 ;Park, 2018). In case of rapid onset of CRS Grade 1 in 
severit yor slow onset of CRS starting as Grade 2 in severit y following tocilizumab, init iation of 
therapy  with dexamethasone should be considered ( Figure 2). 
Other anti -IL-6 agents such as siltuximab , if available, shoul d be considered in the event that 
severe CRS is not responding to tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Siltuximab is another 
monoclonal antibody  that bl ocks IL -6 signaling by binding IL -6 itself and prevent ing it from 
activat ing immune effector cells. Siltuximab has a higher affinit y for IL-6 than to cilizumab has 
for the IL -
6R,making it a very  effect ive tool in managing CRS. If a patient does not respond to 
tocilizumab and corticosteroids, then the use of silt uximab is encouraged. Dosing of any other 
anti-IL-6 agent should be per prescribing informat ion. 
Interl eukin 1 blockade through IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra)could demo nstrably prevent 
severe CRS while maintaining intact antitumor efficacy  (Giavri dis, 2018). The benefits of an 
IL-1 blockade through IL -1Ra are especially intriguing given the latter’s abilit y to cross the 
blood –brain barrier (BBB) (Gutierrez , 1994), unlike tocilizumab ( Neelapu 2018 ). Human 
microglia act ivate
d by IL-1 may produce inducible nitric oxide synthase and proinflammatory  
cytokines ( Liu, 1996; Tarassishin , 2014); therefore ,blocking IL -1 coul d potenti ally not only  
protect from severe CRS but also coul d reduce the severit y of CAR T cell –related neurotoxicit y. 
One of the select ive IL -1Ra is anakinra.  Anakinra shoul d be considered in the event that severe 
CRS is not responding to tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Anakinra should be given unt il 
resolution of CRS with a daily  dose of 100 m g subcutaneous ly(SC) . In m ore severe CRS cases, 
especially  if combined wi th MAS /HLH and/or neurotoxicit y, anakinra 100 mg twice daily  (every  
12 hours) SC shoul d be given unt il reso lution of CRS and other concurrent CAR T cell toxicit ies,
like neurotoxicit y and/or MAS/HLH which could benefit from anakinra treatment. 
In the m ost unresponsive severe cases ,additional treatm ents shoul d be considered. Recent data 
suggest that monocy tes and macrophages contribu te to the development of CRS and 
neurotoxi city after CAR T cell  therapy . Therefore, neutralizat ion of GM -
CSF has been 
investigated as a potential strategy  to manage CAR T cell –associ ated toxici ties. Lenzilumab is a 
humanized mo nocl
onal antibody  that neutra lizes GM -CSF. Pre -clinical and clinical data 
demonstrate that lenzilumab can prevent CRS and significant ly reduce serious neuro logical 
toxicities (Sterner , 2018; Sterner ,2019 ).
Other possible treatments for persistent or worsening CRS include etanercept and infliximab 
(TNF -
αinhibitors), T cell depleting alemtuzumab, ant i-thymo cyte globulin (ATG), 
cyclophosphamide, ruxolit inib, or ibrutinib ( Borrega , 2019) . However, if subject is still rec eiving 
anakinra for management of CAR T cells toxicit y, theuse of anakinra in co mbinat ion with TNF 
blocking agents is not recommended.

Macrophage activation syndro me or HLH i s a rare, potentially fatal immune -mediated disease, 
which is caused by impaired NK and cy totoxi c Tcell funct ion. This syndrome has a wide range 
of causes, symptom s, and outcom es, but all lead to a hy perin ﬂammatory  response wi th som e 
characterist ics that overl ap wi th CRS and organ damage ( Ramos-Casals, 2014). Pathophy siology 
of MAS/HLH is divided into primary  (genet ic) and secondary (reactive) forms. Secondary  
MAS/HLH is subclassi ﬁed as viral, autoimmune, or tumor related. Macrophage activat ion 
syndro me/HLH has both infectious and non -infectious triggers ( Ramos-Casals, 2014). Vi ral 
infect ion is the most frequent tr igger, either due to primary infection or after reactivat ion in 
immunosuppressed patients. Hemophagocyt ic lympho -histiocytosis can be triggered by  viral  
infect ions, m alignancy, autoimmune disease, and acquired immune deficiencies (Usmani , 2013 ), 
whereas MAS i s most of ten associ ated wi th autoimmune and autoinflammatory  diseases 
(Ravelli , 2016). Bacterial and fungal infect ions can also trigger MAS/HLH. Both condit ions are 
characterized by  a dysregul ated immune response result ing in a cytokine storm. Available data 
suggests MAS/ HLH emergence as a possible consequence of CRS with CAR T cells being a 
trigger of MAS/HLH (Neelapu, 2017 ;Borrega ,2019 ). In m any aspects, severe CRS resembles 
MAS/HLH (Borrega, 2019 ). In clinical and laboratory  findings, the cy tokine profile and 
myelo id-driven inflammatory  responses are cl osely  related between MAS/HLH and severe CRS. 
In pati ents wi th CRS -related MAS/HLH -like syndrome (MALS) ,additional cytokines such as 
IL-18, IL8, IP10, MCP1, MIG, and MIP1β are also elevated ( Teachey ,
2016). These cy tokines 
also have been reported to be elevated in classical MAS /HLH . In addi tion, IL -6 may also 
prom ote the development of MAS/HLH in the setting of CRS by inducing dysfunct ion of 
cytotoxi c act ivity in T and NK cells, which is a hallmark of MAS /HLH (Cifaldi
, 2015). 
Consequent ly, CRS -related MAS/HLH i s difficul t to dist inguish fro m primary
 MAS/HLH or 
other condit ions that can mimic MAS/HLH such as sepsis. Table 10summarizes so me of the 
factors that help to dist inguish CRS -related MAS/HLH from other condit ions that present 
similarly .

2.1 Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis of M acrophage Activation 
Syndrome/Hemophagocytic Lympho- histiocytosis
The presentation of secondary MAS/HLH is heterogeneous and characterized by  a panoply of 
clinical signs and symptoms. Cytokine release syndrom e shares many  pathogenetic and clinical 
similarit ies wit h MAS/HLH such as high fever, very  high ferrit in levels, cy tokine profiles, and 
the importance of macrophages in the pathogenesis (Ravelli , 2016). The clinical syndrome can 
be acute or subacute with non -specific symptoms appearing over a few days to 4 weeks (Ramos -
Casals, 2014). The cardinal features are continuous high fever (≥ 38.5°C) and enlarged 
lymphohematopoiet ic organs (spleno/hepatomegaly ), occasi onally  accom panied by adenopathy . 
Pulmo nary, neurol ogic, cutaneous ,and gastrointestinal invo lvement m ay also be present.
Laboratory  markers associated with MAS/HLH include pancy topenia, hyperferri tinemia, 
hypo ﬁbrinogene mia and raised D -dimer levels, hypertriglyceridemia, and abnormalit ies in liver 
funct ion. 
Detection of any ongo ing infect ion acting as a trigger for MAS/HLH is crit ical ( Figure 2). 
Standard tests should be used to screen for infect ions caused by the most commo n viruses such 
as herpes, cy tomegalovirus (CMV) ,and Epstein -Barr vi rus (EBV). Other infect ious agents (eg, 
mycobacteria, parasites, and fungi, parti cularly  Candida and Mucor) shoul d be rul ed out 
according to speci ﬁc clinical or epidemio logical features ( Ramos -Casals, 2014; Lehmberg, 
2015).
Bone m arrow i s the preferred anatomical site for investigation o f suspected MAS/HLH . Bone 
marrow aspirate can be negat ive at the init ial stage of MAS/HLH and should be repeated during 
the clinical course if there is a high suspicio n of MAS/HLH.
The di agnosis of MAS/HLH (according to HLH -2004 consensus criteria, further revised in 2014 
for HLH associ ated wi th malignancies) ( Lehmberg, 2015 ) can be established if either of the 
2criteria below is fulfilled:
1.A molecular diagnosis consistent with MAS/HLH 
2.Diagnostic cri teria for MAS/HLH fulfilled ( 5out of the 8criteria below):
a.high persistent fever ( ≥ 38.5 °C)
b.splenomegaly
c.cytopeni as (affect ing 2 of 3 lineages in the peripheral blood): Hemoglobin < 90 g/L,

Confidential and Proprietary 137 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 20202.2 Clinical Management of M acrophage Activation Syndrome/Hemophagocytic 
Lympho -histiocytosis
Effect ive treatment of MAS/HLH requires mult iple simultaneous approaches ( Ramos-Casals,
2014, Lehmberg, 2015 ).
1.Supportive care is essent ia
l because o f frequent life -threatening ,severe manifestations 
at presentation. 
2.Appropriate broad -spectrum antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal prophylaxis, and 
treatment must be init iated. The eliminat ion of triggers (particularly infect ion) is cruci al 
to rem ove the st imuli that init iate the abnormal immune system act ivation.
3.Suppression o f the inﬂammatory  response and cell proliferat ion by immunosuppressive 
and cy totoxi c drugs, respectively , is necessary . 
a.First -line treatment includes IL -6-bl ockade wi th tocilizumab unless tocilizumab was 
already administered for the management of CRS. Glucocortico ids are also indicated 
for the init ial treatment of MAS/HLH, irrespect ive of the cause (CRS Grade 4 
treatm ent recommendat ions should be fo llowed).
b.Second- line treatment includes interleukin 1 blockade with anakinra. Anakinra 
shoul d be given unt il resolut ion of MAS/HLH as a daily dose of 100 mg SC.
c.In case of rapidly progressing clinical course with ongoing CRS, anakinra shoul d 
be administered as first-line treatment. In more severe MAS/HLH cases, especially if 
combined wit h CRS and/or neurotoxicit y, anakinra 100 m g SCtwice daily  shoul d be 
given until reso lution of MAS/HLH and other concurrent CAR T cell toxicit ies,
which coul d benefit fro m anakinra tre atment.  
d. A nti-IL-6 ant ibody ,siltuximab ,might be considered as second -line therapy. The use 
of cycl osporin, cycl ophosphamide, etoposi de, and/or intrathecal methotrexate is not 
generally indicated in pat ients who develop MAS/HLH after CAR Tcell therapy b ut 
may have to be emplo yed in refractory  cases. 
e.Newer em erging treatm ents include emapalumab ( anti-IFN-γantibody ), which has 
been approved by the FDA for the treatment of primary  refractory  or recurrent 
MAS/HLH ( Benedetti , 2019).
3. Neurologic Toxicities
CAR T cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicit ies. Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activit y. The start of neurol ogic symptoms has been noted with JCARH125 between 3 to 1 2days
with median t ime toonset of 3daysafter CAR T cell infusio n
(Mailankody , 2018 ).With another 
B-cell maturation ant igen (BCMA )CAR T cell ther apy,bb2121 , the start of neuro logic 
symptoms has been noted between 3 to 11 days (median 5 days) after CAR T cell infusio n (Raje, 
2019). S evere neuro logical toxicit ycases may  require admissio n to the intensive care unit (ICU ) 
for frequent m onitoring, respi ratory  support, or intubat ion for airway protecti on. The symptoms 
are variable and generally  occur as CRS i s reso lving or after CRS resolut ion.
3.1. Pathophysiology of Neurologic Toxicities
The pathogenesis o f neurotoxi city is poorly  defined.  The pathophy siology of neurol ogic 
symptoms in CAR T cell  therapy is poorly understood, but the lack of a strict temporal

Confidential and Proprietary 138 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 2020associ ation with CRS indicates that it might be independent from CRS. In addit ion, IL-6 pathway  
blockade does not seem to be beneficial in the treatment of neurologic symptoms, unlike in CRS, 
indicat ing a different pathomechanism. The evaluation of larger patient collect ives showed that a 
high tumor burden and a more severe CRS lead to a more severe neurotoxi city(Gust , 2017;
Santom asso,
2018 ). Neurotoxicit y has been associated with early onset of CRS and rapid 
elevation of inflammatory  cytokines both wi thin the serum  and central  nervous system ( CNS ), 
perhaps leading to BBB disruption ( Gust , 2017 ). Analysis o f subjects wi th R/R MM treated with 
CAR TBCMA cells at the Universit y of Pennsylvania, a peak in serum increases of IL -6, IFN -γ, 
and MIP -1α was i dentified as most associate d with neurotoxi city in this study . Interestingly , 
neurotoxi city was also associ ated wi th peak fo ld-increases in IL-1Ra, an endogenous inhibitor of 
the proinflammatory  effects of IL-1 alpha ( IL-1α) and IL-1 beta ( IL-1β), which have been 
implicated in post -CAR T cell neurotoxicit y (Giavri dis, 2018; Norelli , 2018). Thi s potenti ally 
suggests that augmenting IL -1 blockade wi th the recombinant IL-1Raanakinra in myelo ma 
patients wi th CAR T cell –associ ated neurotoxicit y may have therapeutic benefit, as demonstrated 
in preclinical models (Giavri dis,
2018; Norelli 2018 ).
An analysis showed higher levels for cy tokines which are usually  associ ated wi th a systemic 
inflammat ion (ie, IL -6, IL -10, and interferon -gamma ( IFN-
g)) in pat ients who develop severe 
neurotoxi city indicat ing a correlat ion between systemic inflammat ion and neuro logic events 
(Gust ,
2017; Turtl e , 2017; Santom asso, 2018 ).Peak levels in CRP are also significantly higher in 
subjects who develop any Grade or Grade 3 or higher neurotoxicit y (Turtl e, 2016; Heipel, 2017). 
Other organ dy sfunct ion (hepat ic and renal), as well as hypoxemia and infectio n, might al so 
contribute to encephalopathy ( Neelapu, 2018 ). In another study , it has been reported that 
evidence for cy tokine -mediated endothelial act ivatio n causes coagulopathy , capillary  leak, and 
BBB disrupti on,allowing tr ansit of high concentrations of systemic cytokines into the 
cerebrospinal fluid. (Gust, 2017 ).
3.2 Clinical Management of Neurologic Toxicities
Levet iracetam  or al ternative ant i-seizure medicat ion shoul d be considered for seiz ure 
prophylaxis. The optimal management of CAR T cell -induced neurotoxicit y is unknown at this 
time. These management guidelines below represent the current state of knowledge and 
additional information will  be provi ded to Invest igators as i t becomes available. A thorough 
neuro logic evaluat ion, including electroencephalogram (EEG), magnet ic resonance imaging 
(MRI) ,or com puter tom ography  (CT) scan of the brain ,and di agnost ic lumbar puncture and 
frequent monitoring of cognit ive funct ion (eg, mini menta l status examinat ions or handwrit ing 
tests) should be considered. 
Treatable causes of neurologic dysfunct ion, such as infect ion or hemorrhage should be ruled out. 
Commo n manifestations of neurotoxicit y (eg, confusi on, seizure, and aphasia), can also be se en 
with infect ion, electroly te imbalances, metabolic aci dosis, uremia, concomitant medication use 
(eg, narcotics), and other medical condit ions. Other causes for such symptoms should be 
considered.
Magnet ic resonance imaging and CT scans of the brain are u sually negat ive for any  anatomical 
pathol ogy that woul d account for the neurotoxicit y symptom s observed in subjects treated with 
CAR T cell therapy, alt hough rare cases of reversible T2/fluid attenuated inversio n recovery  
(FLAIR) MRI hyperintensit y involving the thalami, do rsal pons, and medulla, and cerebral 
edem a have been reported ( Neelapu, 2018 ).

Confidential and Proprietary 139 H125001 Amendment 6 Final : 10 Feb 2020For subjects who have neuro logic toxi city in the presence of CRS, the CRS should be managed 
following the gui delines provi ded in Figure 3.
Neurotoxi city management gui delines are provided in Figure 3.
First -line treatment includes corticosteroi ds to be used for severe neurotoxicit y, especially in 
the absence of the classic hemodynamic perturbations of CRS. Tocilizumab does not cross the 
BBB and results in transient elevated IL -
6 levels in the serum , which is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of neurotoxici ty(Nellan, 2018 ). Thus, tocilizumab is not recommended for the 
primary management of isolated neurotoxicity .For the corticosteroids dosing regimen, p lease 
refer to Figure 3.
Second
-line treatment includes siltuximab which effect ively remo ves active IL -6 from 
circulat ionand since the siltuximab IL -6 com plex is unlikely to cross the BBB, siltuximab 
shoul d have a rol e in the management of CAR T cell-induced neurotoxi city (Riegler , 2019) . 
Anakinra should be considered in the event of neurotoxic ityonset wi th ongoi ng CRS as well as 
neurotoxi city. 
Itshould be given as a daily dose of 100 mg SCor 200 m g SC(100 m g every  12 
hours) depending on the severit y of neurotoxi city and other conc urrent CAR T cell -related
toxicities. Anakinra shoul d be give n unt il reso lutionof neurotoxi city and other concurrent CAR 
Tcelltoxicities which could benefit from anakinra treatment.

Significant changes included in this amendment are to explore anakinra as a toxicit y mitigation 
agent and to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  in subjects who have had prior exposure to other 
therapeuti c age nts directed against BCMA, and they  are summarized below:
Updated Introduction
The introduction was updated to include literature references of recent clinical data with B-cell 
maturati on ant igen (BCMA )-targeted chimeric ant igen receptor ( CAR T ) cell therapies and 
BCMA directed Tcell engager ( TCE )and antibody -drug conjugate ( ADC )therapi es that have 
shown promising activit y in multiple myelo ma. The potenti al risks associ ated wi th these 
therapi es were updated to align with recent published data. These references provi de rati onale f or 
explorat ion of the prior BCMA directed therapi es cohort s.
Ongo ing study  data to support BCMA -targeted CAR T cells cohort was updated with data fro m 
current literature or press releases.

Removed clinical data that was used for justifying the addition o f the 300M dose l evel from this 
ongoing trial as it is not in accordance wit h Celgene standards . 
Revised Sect ion:Secti on 2.1
Addition of Phase 1 Anakinra Cohort
Interl eukin 1 (IL-1)blockade through IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra)can demonstrably 
prevent severe cytokine rel ease syndrome ( CRS )while maintaining intact antitumor efficacy. 
The benefits o f an IL -1 blockade through IL -1Ra are especially intriguing given the latter’s 
abilit y to cross the blood- brain barrier, unlike tocilizumab. Human microglia act ivated by IL -1 
may produce inducible nitric oxi de synt hase and proinflammatory  cytokines ;therefore blocking 
IL-1 coul d potenti ally not only protect from severe CRS but also could reduce the severit y of 
CAR T cell –related neurotoxi city. Therefore , anakinra has been included in this trial. 
Furtherm ore, anakinra has been proposed in recent publication for treatment of refractory  CRS 
and in the setting of macrophage act ivation syndrome ( MAS )/hemophagocy tic 
lympho -histiocytosis (HLH ).  
Added the primary , secondary  and expl oratory  objectives and endpo ints of the Phase 1 anakinra 
cohort .

Addition of Phase 2a prior BCMA -directed Anti -myeloma T herapy Cohort
Although BCMA -directed CAR T cell therapies have been demo nstrated to induce rapid and 
deep responses in almo st all subjects, the durability o f response rem ains an issue. Relapse post -
CAR T therapy  may be mediated by  multiple m echanisms: CAR -intrinsic (loss of  functional 
CAR T persi stence) or tum or intrinsic (ant igen loss), or other mechanisms yet to be determined 
(such as lack of CAR infiltrat ion into suppressive TME in plasmacyto mas). Given the potential 
for multiple mechanisms, i t may be possible to treat subjects who have relapsed after prior 
BCMA CAR T therapy  with JCARH125.
Published data of 4 subjects with relapsed and/or refractory  multiple myel oma (R/R MM) treated 
with CT103A, BCMA CAR T cells with human binder, were very  encouraging. Pati ents who 
were previously  treated wi th murine BCMA CAR T cells, after CT103A infusio nachieved
excellent responses of complete response (CR)(3 pati ents) and very good parti al response
(VGPR )(1 patient). 
Cohen et al . described 2 patients who progressed after 1 BCMA -targeted therapy  and then
responded to a subsequent BCMA- targeted therapy . 
A recent publicat ion describes twenty  subjects who were evaluable for BCMA surface 
expressio n on MM cells by flow cyto metry performed on fresh marrow aspirates prior to 
treatment. BCMA intensit y was l owest on resi dual MM cells 1 month after BCMA CAR T cell 
infusio n and increased back toward baseline in mo st. Nei ther progressi on-free nor overall 
survival was significant ly associated with baseline BCMA expressi onin this trial .
These cases demo nstrate that BCMA targeted therapies may be beneficial in patients previously 
exposed to other BCMA -targeted agents and ,therefore ,this popul ation has been added to 
explore safet y and efficacy  in a separate cohort of this trial. BCMA expressio n will be evaluated 
using the same exploratory  methodol ogies current ly in use for the H125001 Phase 1 and pivotal 
cohorts. These assessments will be performed on samples collected at screening to address 
baseline BCMA expressio n prior to JCA RH125 infusio n and also on samples collected after 
infusio n. IHC will be utilized to measure BCMA expressio n on CD138+ plasma cells in bone 
marrow bi opsies. Fl ow cy tometry will also be used to measure BCMA expression on plasma 
cells in bone marrow aspirate s. Results fro m both assays will be used to evaluate the relat ionship 
between baseline BCMA expressio n and JCARH125 activit y (safet y, efficacy , PK and PD). 
These results will also allow us to address whether subjects who have received prior BCMA -
directed t herapies have different ial expressio n of BCMA relat ive to subjects in the Phase 1
cohort.
Added the primary , secondary  and expl oratory  objective sand endpo ints for the Phase 2a porti on.
Added study  design for the Phase 2a portion.

Protocol H125001 Amendment 4 
10 September 2018  
Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential Page 2 of 8 
1. OVERALL SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Amendment 4 of Protocol H125001 was prepared to add an intermediate dose level of 300×106 
CD3+CAR+ T cells to the dose levels selected for evaluation.   The rationale for investigating 
this intermediate dose level is based on adverse events that occurred in the first 2 subjects treated 
at Dose Level 3 (450×106 CD3+CAR+ T cells).   Both subjects treated at this dose level 
experienced rapid onset of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) within 8 hours after JCARH125 
infusion and received treatment with tocilizumab. The first subject experienced Grade 2 
neurotoxicity, which completely resolved after treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids.  
The second subject developed Grade 4 CRS and Grade 4 neurotoxicity unresponsive to 
corticosteroid therapy, Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased,  Grade 4 acute 
kidney injury, and Grade 5 septic shock. The events experienced by the second subject met dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria.  Based on the safety results in subjects treated at the 300×106 
CD3+CAR+ cell dose level, the Sponsor, in collaboration with study investigators, will make an 
assessment as to whether it is appropriate to evaluate additional subjects at the 450×106 
CD3+CAR+ cell dose level. 
Accordingly, the following major changes were made to the protocol in this amendment: 
 A dose level of 300×106 CD3+CAR+ T cells was added as Dose Level 2 a. 
 The rationale for evaluating the intermediate dose level was provided in Section 2.1. 
The following changes were also made: 
 The requirement to treat only one subject per day after staggering of the first 3 subjects by 
7 days was removed. 
 The recommendation to hospitalize subjects in Phase 1 starting at the time of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy was removed. 
 The following treatments were added as treatments that should be recorded during 
hospitalizations:  antibiotics, growth factors, transfusions, and systemic anticoagulants. 
 The temperature threshold above which subjects should have JCARH125 administration 
delayed and be hospitalized following JCARH125 infusion was lowered from 38.5°C to 
38.0°C. 
 The requirement to notify the Sponsor and to collect tissue samples for analysis by the 
central laboratory was removed from the instructions to be followed for unscheduled 
evaluations. 
 A mental status evaluation was added to the list of assessments required to be performed as 
part of the neurological examination. 
 The email address for safety reporting was updated to direct reports to Celgene Drug Safety 
rather than Juno Pharmacovigilance. 
In addition, other minor administrative clarifications and typographical corrections were made.

1. OVERALL SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Amendment 3 of Protocol H125001 was prepared primarily to further refine the study population 
in order to collect and analyze data on a more homogeneous study population.    
The following major changes were made to the protocol in this amendment: 
 The inclusion criterion regarding required prior treatments was revised to clarify that subjects 
must have had an immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor, either in the same 
combination regimen or as separate regimens. 
 The requirement for subjects to be relapsed or refractory was modified to require that 
subjects be refractory to their last prior regimen, defined as disease that is nonresponsive or 
progresses on treatment, or that shows progression within 60 days after the last prior line of 
therapy. 
 Grade 4 lymphopenia lasting more than 14 days will not be considered a dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT). 
 Separate analyses in the BCMA-high population were removed. 
 Reference to the use of the truncated epidermal growth factor (EGFRt) portion of the 
lentiviral vector encoding the BCMA CAR for the purpose of analytical detection of 
transduced T cells and ablation of CAR T cells in the event of CAR T-cell-related toxicity 
was removed. 
 Language in the management of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity sections 
wa
s updated to align with language in the Celgene-approved guidance document; an 
appendix containing an updated algorithm for CRS management and a new algorithm for 
management of neurotoxicity was added. 
 Bone marrow evaluations at Pre-treatment Screening will only be performed in subjects with 
inadequate or insufficient samples at Screening and in subjects who receive bridging 
chemotherapy. 
 Bone marrow evaluations were added at Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24 (end of study 
[EOS] ). 
 Minimum renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] or glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) 
required for initiating lymphodepleting chemotherapy was decreased from 60 mL/min to 
30 mL/min; instr uction to reduce the dose of fludarabine by 40% was added for subjects with 
CrCl between 30 and 49 mL/min.  
 Language in the Safety section (Section 9) was updated to reflect requirements by the 
European Medicines Agency, including defining and requirements for reporting instances of 
overdose, and guidance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for reporting delayed 
adverse events.

 Requirements for clotting time were added to inclusion criteria, and an exclusion criterion 
was added for subjects with a history of ≥ Grade 2 hemorrhage or requirement for ongoing 
treatment with chronic, therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. 
 Clarification was made that subjects are required to have recovered from non-hematological  
toxicities due to prior therapy (hematologic requirements are listed  in definition of adequate 
bone marrow function in Inclusion Criterion 7b). 
 Subjects with non-secretory disease (ie, those with disease only in the bone marrow and 
those with solitary plasmacytoma) will be excluded. 
 Subjects with a history of central nervous system (CNS) malignancies will be excluded in 
addition to those with active CNS malignancy. 
 Subjects with Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal protein, Skin 
changes (POEMS) syndrome and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia will be excluded.

before leukapheresis was modified to also exclude infection at the time of leukapheresis. 
 An exclusion criterion was added for plasmapheresis within 14 days before leukapheresis. 
 Medical conditions or laboratory abnormalities th at, in the judgment of the Investigator, 
could jeopardize subject safety were added to the exclusion criteria. 
 Guidance for recording intravenous ( IV) fluids administered during hospitalization for 
treatment of CRS was added. 
 Evaluations of serum chemistry,  coagulation parameters, and lymphocyte enumeration on the 
day of apheresis were removed. 
 Clarification was made that only subjects who receive bridging chemotherapy with 
potentially cardiotoxic drugs are required to have a repeat echocardiogram or multiple uptake 
gated acquisition (MUGA) at Pre-Treatment Screening. 
 Language regarding criteria for JCARH125 infusion was modified to align with language in 
other Juno/Celgene protocols. 
 Instruction was added to perform biopsies of any new plasmacytomas when feasible.

Protocol H125001 Amendment 1 
16 October 2017  
Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 2 of 14 
1. OVERALL SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment 1 of Protocol H125001 was prepared to remove patient selection in Phase 1 based 
on expression of B- cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in tumor biopsy samples.  Data generated at 
Juno Therapeutics from a recent evaluation of BCMA expression in tumor samples from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) suggest that more than 90% of MM patients express some level of BCMA.  Based on the biological dynamics of BCMA, the heterogeneity of MM, and the potential for epitope spreading, there is reason to believe that patients with low BCMA expression in a single biopsy sample may benefit from BCMA -directed CAR T -cell therapy.  
This modification allows patients to enroll in Phase 1 at any time, regardless of level of BCMA 
expression; clinical benefit relative to BCMA expression will be explored during the study. 
In addition, the analysis for the primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR), as well as the 
secondary endpoint of com plete response (CR) rate, was redefined to include two analysis 
populations:  (1) all subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 who receive treatment with JCARH125 at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) regardless of level of BCMA expression and (2) subjects with BC MA expression on > 90% of plasma cells (ie, the BCMA-high population). 
Accordingly, the following changes were made to the protocol: 
• The Pre-Screening visit in Phase 1 for evaluation of BCMA expression in archival samples 
was removed.  Biopsy samples will be collected  from all subjects  in Phase 1 and Phase 2 
during Screening and Pre- treatment Screening  and analyzed for BCMA expression, but 
BCMA expression level will not be used to determine eligibility in either Phase 1 or Phase 2 
of the study.  Archival samples obtained within 1 year prior to Screening will be requested from all subjects for whom such samples are available and analyzed for BCMA expression.  
• The statistical method for control of the overall type 1 error rate was updated to refle ct that 
analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed in two separate populations, and that these analyses are both considered primary.  
• The primary analysis population for efficacy endpoints other than ORR and CR rate, which were previously based on subjects expressing BCMA above the pre-defined threshold, will 
now include all evaluable subjects treated at the RP2D in either Phase 1 or  Phase 2  of the 
study.   The name of this analysis population was changed from the “primary analysis set” to 
the “efficacy analysis set.” 
• The effect size detectable with 90% power in the BCMA -high population was changed to 
reflect an expectation that 45 subjects determined to be BCMA-high will be included in the analyses for this population. 
• The timing of the primary analys is was changed to occur after all subjects in the efficacy  
analysis  set have been evaluated for response.

The following additional changes were also made in this amendment: 
• The i nclusion criterion for prior autologous stem cell transplant was deleted and r eplaced 
with an exclusion criterion excluding subjects eligible for an autologous stem cell transplant. 
• Minimum hemoglobin at Screening was reduced from 9 g/dL to 8 g/dL. 
• Exceptions to exclusion criterion related to toxicities due to previous therapy were modified 
(skin -limited graft-vs-host disease removed as an exception; anemia, thrombocytoypenia, and 
neutropenia added as exceptions). 
• Infection within 72 hours prior to JCARH125 infusion was removed as an exclusion criterion.  
• A statement was added indicating that the DLT evaluation period may be extended beyond 21 days in the event that adverse events meeting DLT criteria are found to occur beyond the 
DLT window.  
• The sampl e size was increased from approximately 112 subjects to approximately 118 
subjects.  
• Pre-treatment disease assessments  and biops ies, previously required  only for subjects who 
received bridging chemotherapy during JCARH125 production, will be required  for al l 
subjects.  
• PET/CT scans  at Pre- treatment Screening , previously required for all subjects, will only be 
performed on subjects with extramedullary lesions identified on scans at Screening and on subjects with clinical suspicion of new extramedullary lesions. 
• Clarification was made that growth factors and transfusions will be allowed for subjects who do not meet the minimum requirements for absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin, and platelet count requirements at Pre- treatment Screening.  
• Criteri a for hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm
3 were added prior to 
JCARH125 administration; red blood cell transfusions and other supportive measures may be used. 
Other minor clarifications and administrative changes were also made.

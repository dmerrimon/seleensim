Spinal Cord Injury  (Study 1)  VA    Department of Veterans
Affairs
1. P urpose of study and how long it will last:
The
 purpose of this study is to determine the dose of a medication that raises your blood pressure into the
normal range (111-139/70-85 mmHg) . The medication (droxidopa), which has been approved for
experimental use in this study by the FDA, has anti-hypotensive effects and will be given in increasing doses
on successive study visits, depending on your blood pressure responses. You, the investigator and study team
will not be blinded to the dose of medication . Your participation will last for no fewer than 1 and no more
than 7 visits over the course of about six weeks.  Subsequent study visits will be scheduled no less than 2 and
no more than 10 days apart.
You 
are being asked to participate in this research study because you have low blood pressure (hypotension), 
are between the ages of 18 and 85, and have had a spinal cord injury (SCI) for over one (1) year. This study

while the research team applies instrumentation. Three sticky electrodes will be placed on your chest and 
abdomen area.  A blood pressure cuff will be placed around your upper right arm and a small blood pressure 
cuff will be placed on your left middle or ring finger.  Your blood pressure, respiration rate and heart rate will 
be recorded for 5-minutes while you rest quietly (baseline) before we administer the study medication. After 
baseline testing  you will be asked to swallow a small pill(s) with a glass of water. Blood pressure, respiration 
rate and heart rate will be monitored for 5-minutes every 15 minutes after you take the medication. For every 
visit you will receive droxidopa in a dose escalation (increasing doses) manner. The table below displays the 
medication and dose escalation that will be administered on successive study visits, depending on your  blood 
pressure responses. The medication we have chosen has a short duration of action so any bad reaction should 
last for a short period of time. But if at any time you feel uncomfortable, we will immediately stop the study 
medication and all testing and will monitor your heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure very closely 
until you recover.

*Once the target blood pressure is attained ( i.e., males: SBP  111-139; females SBP 101 -139 mmHg ), you will not be administered a 
higher dose of that study medication.  
 
Screening Visit  - You will visit the laboratory at the JJPVAMC (7A-13S) or ISMMS Klingenstein Clinical 
Health Center (KCC) building, Floor 2 to participate in a screening visit to determine your eligibility. If you 
are taking a vasoconstrictor agent, you will be asked to stop these medications 2 days or 5 half-lives prior to 
the screening visit, if medically cleared. If you routinely wear compression garments you will be asked to 
remove these for all testing sessions. The screening vist assessments will include medical intake information, 
medical history, physical examination, American Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale (AIS) classification 
(if not assessed in the prior 6-months), clinical symptoms survey for OH and AD and  brachial BP assessment, 
recorded one time per minute for 10 minutes while in the seated and supine positions. You will be eligible to 
participate in Study 1  if your average seated BP meets the WHO definition of hypotension (i.e., SBP ≤ 110 
mmHg for males or SBP ≤ 100 mmHg for females), there is evidence of OH (i.e., orthostatic fall in BP ≥20/10 
mmHg when you are moved from the supine to the seated position) and if there is no evidence of sustained 
elevation in BP ≥140/100 mmHg in either the supine or seated positions. This visit will take approximately 
1-2 hours.

Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) Symptoms Survey:  Will be collected during the screening visit. Autonomic 
dysreflexia is a condition where blood pressure increases higher than normal, usually because of a painful or 
non-painful stimulus below the level of your spinal cord injury. Some of the most common causes of AD 
relate to bowel or bladder fullness, tight clothing, or pressure from being in a position for too long, but there 
may be other causes that we are not aware of.  You will be asked to complete an AD symptoms survey during 
each study visit, which will be used to determine your experience with AD over the 7-days prior to the study 
visit.  This survey contains questions related to symptoms you may have experienced, information about your 
blood pressure at that time, and possible causes of the AD.  This survey should take approximately 15 minutes 
to complete 
 
Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) Symptoms Survey  - will be collected during the screening visit. OH is a 
condition where your BP falls when you change from supine to upright standing or seated position. Symptoms 
may range from dizziness and light headedness to fatigue and nausea to loss in consciousness. You will be 
asked to complete a 9 question OH symptoms survey at admission, once a week during your weekly testing 
visit, and at discharge, which will be used to determine your experience with OH over the past 7-days. This 
survey contains questions related to symptoms you may have experienced, information about your BP at that 
time, and how frequent these symptoms occur. This survey should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.  
 
The Visual Analog Fatigue Scale Survey  - will be used during the screening visit to determine your self-
report ed history and severity of fatigue.  This survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

 VA    Department of Veterans 
Affairs  
Heart Rate & Respiration Rate  - Three electrodes (small sticky pads) will be placed on your chest and 
abdomen to continuously monitor your respiration and heart rate during each study visit.  Heart and respiratory 
rate will be monitored and recorded for 5-minutes during the baseline period and at 30 -minute intervals after 
administration of the study medication.  
 
Blood Pressure - Blood pressure will be monitored and recorded from your right upper arm using standard 
procedures at 1-minute intervals during baseline and at 15-minute intervals after administration of the study 
medication.  Finger blood pressure will be monitored continuously from your left middle or ring finger on a 
beat- to-beat basis during the baseline period .  Beat- to-beat blood pressure will be recorded for 5-minutes at 
30-minute intervals throughout the 4 -hour observation period after administration of the study medication.  
Blood pressure will be taken every 30-minutes by a trained clinical research coordinator and will be reviewed 
by the study physician Dr. William Bauman and the clinical monitor Dr. Noam Harel.   
  
 
Side-Effects Survey –  The most common side-effects reported with droxidopa are headache (>10 %) dizziness 
(4% to 10%) nausea (9%) hypertension (2% to 7%) and fatigue.   In addition, subjects may report: feeling 
feverish, muscle cramps, confusion and  uncontrolled movements.  Therefore, you will be asked questions 
related to these known side-effects during each study visit. This survey contains questions related to symptoms 
you may have experienced, information about your blood pressure at that time, and possible causes of 
symptoms that may be related to the study medication. This survey should take approximately 10 minutes to 
complete.  
 
3. Description of any Procedures that may Result in Discomfort or Inconvenience: 
You have been told that the study described above may involve the following discomforts:  
 You may experience some discomfort when electrodes are removed from your skin and some skin 
irritation at the site of electrode placement. 
 You may experience some discomfort when the blood pressure cuffs around your upper arm and 
your finger are inflated.  
 Since this research may have unknown effects on an unborn child and should not be done during 
pregnancy, it is necessary for a pregnancy test to be done first.  To your knowledge you are not 
pregnant at the present time. You also agree to avoid becoming pregnant (use contraceptives, take 
precautions against becoming pregnant, etc.) during this study.

 The monitoring of heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure are all non-invasive measurements 
and are not associated with any known risks.  
 Your blood pressure may be elevated above what is considered to be the normal range (>140/90 mm 
Hg) following administration of the study medication (i.e., droxidopa). If this happens, we will take 
action to help reduce your blood  pressure; we will loosen any tight clothing or braces that you may 
be wearing; we will shift your position in your wheelchair, and we will help you check and empty 
your bladder or bowel. If your blood pressure remains high for more than 30 minutes after we take 
these measures, we will provide medication to lower your blood pressure. The medication of choice 
will be sub-lingual (under the tongue) nitroglycerin. You will be asked to remina in the laboratory 
until your blood pressure has returned to baseline levels and the study doctors will monitor you and 
your blood pressure until it is safe for you to go home. 
 If after 4-hours of testing if your BP remains elevated above baseline (SBP +10 mmHg) , but not in 
the hypertensive range (<139/89 mmHg), you will be sent home with a 24-hour BP monitor,  which 
will be programmed to obtain BP readings every 20 minutes during the day and at 30-minute 
intervals during the night. Study coordinator or the PI will follow-up with phone calls to you while 
you are at home to asses any side effects and document BP changes.  
 You will be asked to immediately report any significant adverse event you may feel after leaving 
the laboratory. Symptoms which you should be particularly aware of include: headache, pounding 
in the ears, blurry vision, nausea, goosebumps, chills and spasms; please alert the research staff if 
you experience any of these symptoms in greater frequency or severity during the experiment or 
after you leave the laboratory. 
 In order to lower the possible risks of interaction between the study medications and other 
medications you may be taking, you may be asked to avoid taking prescription medications on the 
day of the study,  which should be approved by your primary physician.  
 There may be interactions between the study medication and prescription medications you my be 
taking. In order to lower the risk to you the research staff will monitor your medications and may 
contact your doctor if needed. Medications prescribed for conditions not mentioned in the exclusion 
criteria, may have minor or moderate risks, (meaning the effects are considered tolerable and in most 
cases there is no need for medical intervention), and may be permitted, but decisions about your 
study participation should be made by study personnel in conjunction with you and your doctor.    
 Symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) may become more frequent or worse while taking the 
study medication droxidopa.  
 Common side effects of  the study medication are dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, headache, 
bladder pain, difficulty, painful, and/or burning urination. Also, an urge to urinate or urine retention.

1. P urpose of study and how long it will last:
The
 purpose of this study is to measure blood pressure and blood flow to the brain while you are lying down
(supine) and during a head-up tilt (HUT) maneuver before and after the administration of  the study
medication, which  increased  your blood pressure in Study 1. You will be asked to visit the laboratory on 2
separate days and the medication (droxidopa ), which has been approved for experimental use in this study by
the FDA for phase 2 clinical trial, will be given to you as a pill on 1 of the study visits.  On the other study
visit you  will be given an identical pill, which will be a placebo (no medication).  This is a randomized
double -blinded, placebo control trial, as such, neither you nor the study investigators will know what the pill
contains on each of the 2 study visits.
You 
are being asked to participate in this research study because you are between the age of 18 and 85, and 
you have had SCI for over one (1) year. This study is sponsored by National Center for the Medical 
Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) and funded by the New York Spinal Cord Injury Board IDEA 
program.

2. Description of the Study Including Procedures to be Used: 
If you consent to participate in this research study, you will schedule your first visit with a study team member. 
If you are a participant consenting at ISMMS, you will be asked to sign both VA and ISMMS consent forms. 
As a subject in this research study, you will be asked to come to the laboratory at the JJPVAMC (7A-13S) or 
ISMMS Klingenstein Clinical Health Center (KCC) building, Floor 2, for 2 visits for about 5 hours each visit.  
 
You will be asked to refrain from caffeine, alcohol, heavy exercise, and smoking for 12 hours prior to arrival 
and you will refrain from taking sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or other similar medications, for 2-days 
prior to each of your study visits.  
 
You will remain  seated in your wheelchair for a minimum of 20 minutes while the research team applies 
instrumentation. Three sticky electrodes will be placed on your chest and abdomen area to monitor your heart 
rate (HR) and respiratory (breathing) rate (RR).  A blood pressure cuff will be placed around your upper right 
arm and a small blood pressure cuff will be placed on your left middle or ring finger. We will place a plastic 
harness on your head, apply gel to your forehead and place an ultrasound probe against your head to monitor 
cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv).  A catheter (small plastic tube) will be placed in a vein in your arm for 
blood draws to measure plasma renin activity, aldosterone and norepinephrine concentrations.  After 
instrumentation you will be transferred to the supine position (on the tilt table) for a 10-minute period of quiet 
rest and baseline supine data collection and a blood draw (20 mL) prior to administration of the study 
medication.  Following the baseline data collection you will be  you will be asked to swallow either droxidopa 
or placebo with a glass of water and will remain in the supine position for 60 minutes.  
 
You will be given the dose of medication that raised your blood pressure into the normal range (i.e., males: 
111-139 mmHg; females: 101 -139 mmHg) in Study 1.  
 
While you are in the supine position your heart rate, respiratory rate, finger blood pressure and blood flow to 
the brain will be monitored continuously for 5 -minutes at 0, 25 and 55 minutes and brachial BP will be 
monitored and recorded at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes.   A second blood sample will be drawn from 
the catheter in your arm (20 mL). 
 
The HUT maneuver will be initiated 60 minutes after drug/placebo administration and you will remain in the 
70° HUT position for 30 minutes or until  you have symptoms including but not limited to: dizziness, 
lightheadedness, nausea, blurred vision. Heart rate, respiratory rate, finger blood pressure and blood flow to 
the brain will be monitored continuously for 5-minutes at 0, 10 and 20 minutes during the HUT and brachial 
BP will be monitored and recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes.  Additionally, you will be asked

questions related to the symptoms of OH at 10 minute intervals du ring the sustained HUT maneuver. A third 
blood sample will be drawn from the catheter in your arm (20 mL). 
 
After completion of the HUT maneuver you  will be transferred to your wheelchair for continued monitoring 
of your seated HR, RR, SBP and CBFv for 3 hours or until your SBP returns to within ±10 mmHg of your 
baseline SBP, which ever comes last. You will be asked questions pertaining to the side-effects of droxidopa , 
symptoms related to autonomic dysreflexia and orthostatic hypotension, and fatigue. 
 
Heart Rate & Respiration Rate  : Three electrodes (small sticky pads) will be placed on your chest and 
abdomen to continuously monitor your heart rate and respiratory rate during each study visit according to the 
study time line.   
 
Blood Pressure:  Blood pressure will be monitored and  recorded from your right upper arm using standard 
procedures and finger blood pressure will be monitored continuously from your left middle or ring finger on 
a beat- to-beat basis according to the study time line.    Bl ood pressure will be taken every 30-minutes by a Study 2: Protocol Timeline

trained clinical research coordinator and will be reviewed by the study physician Dr. William Bauman and 
the clinical monitor Dr. Noam Harel.   
 
Cerebral Blood Flow : CBF will be monitored and recorded using a small transcranial Doppler ultrasound 
probe (a noninvasive test that measures brain blood flow) with ultrasound gel that will be placed over your 
left or right temple to measure blood flow velocity through your middle cerebral artery. The Doppler probe 
will be held in place with a head harness which will be tightened so that the probe dosent move around during 
testing. 
 
Head Up Tilt (HUT): The HUT maneuver will be initiated after the 60 minutes of supine observation and you 
will be held at 70 ° HUT position for 30 minutes or until  you report any symptom of intolerance.  
 
Plasma Blood Draws:  We will draw blood from a vein in your arm 4 times throughout the study to monitor 
changes in plasma concentrations of substances in your body that control blood pressure.  These substances 
include: plasma renin activity, aldosterone and norepinephrine.  
 
Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) Symptoms Survey:  Will be collected during the both study visits. Autonomic 
dysreflexia is a condition where blood pressure increases higher than normal, usually because of a painful or 
non-painful stimulus below the level of your spinal cord injury. Some of the most common causes of AD 
relate to bowel or bladder fullness, tight clothing, or pressure from being in a position for too long, but there 
may be other causes that we are not aware of.  You will be asked to complete an AD symptoms survey during 
each study visit, which will be used to determine your experience with AD over the 7-days prior to the study 
visit.  This survey contains questions related to symptoms you may have experienced, information about your 
blood pressure at that time, and possible causes of the AD. This survey should take approximately 15 minutes 
to complete 
 
Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) Symptoms Survey  - will be collected during both study visits. OH is a 
condition where your BP falls when you change from supine to upright standing or seated position. Symptoms 
may range from dizziness and light headedness to fatigue and nausea to loss in consciousness. You will be 
asked to complete a 9 question OH symptoms survey at admission, once a week during your weekly testing 
visit, and at discharge, which will be used to determine your experience with OH over the past 7-days. This 
survey contains questions related to symptoms you may have experienced, information about your BP at that 
time, and how frequent these symptoms occur. This survey should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

Side-Effects Survey - The most common side-effects reported with droxidopa are headache (> 10 %) dizziness 
(4-10%) nausea (9%) hypertension (2 -7%) and fatigue.  In addition, subjects may report: feeling feverish, 
muscle cramps, confusion and uncontrolled movements.  Therefore, you will be asked questions related to 
these known side-effects during both study visits. This survey contains questions related to symptoms you 
may have experienced, information about your blood pressure at that time, and possible causes of symptoms 
that may be related to the study medication. This survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.  
 
3. Description of any Procedures that may Result in Discomfort or Inconvenience: 
You have been told that the study described above may involve the following discomforts:  
 You may experience some discomfort when electrodes are removed from skin and some skin 
irritation at the site of electrode placement. 
 You may experience some discomfort when the blood pressure cuffs around your upper arm and 
your finger is inflated.  
 You may feel discomfort with the harness around your head that is used to secure the ultrasound 
probe to your head for assessment of brain blood flow. 
 You may experience pain as the intravenous catheter is placed in a vein in your arm.   
 When the tilt table is adjusted to 70° you may feel uncomfortable, lightheaded, dizzy and/or 
nauseous. If any symptom becomes too discomforting we will return the table to the supine position. 
 Since this research may have unknown effects on an unborn child and should not be done during 
pregnancy, it is necessary for a pregnancy test to be done first.  To your knowledge you are not 
pregnant at the present time. You also agree to avoid becoming pregnant (use contraceptives, take 
precautions against becoming pregnant, etc.) during this study. 
 You may experience some discomfort when the needle is being placed in your arm vein during the 
blood draws.  
 
4. Expected Risks of Study: 
 The monitoring of heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure are all non-invasive measurements 
and are not associated with any known risks.  
 There is a riak of a bruise at the site of the blood draw and infection if the site is not kept clean. 
 Your blood pressure may be elevated above what is considered to be the normal range (>140/90 mm 
Hg) following administration of the study medication (i.e., droxidopa). If this happens, we will take 
action to help reduce your blood  pressure; we will loosen any tight clothing or braces that you may 
be wearing; we will shift your position in your wheelchair, and we will help you check and empty 
your bladder or bowel. If your blood pressure remains high for more than 30 minutes after we take 
these measures, we will provide medication to lower your blood pressure. The medication of choice

will be sub-lingual (under the tongue) nitroglycerin. You will be asked to remina in the laboratory 
until your blood pressure has returned to baselin levels and the study doctors will monitor you and 
your blood pressure until it is safe for you to go home. 
 If after 4-hours of testing if your BP remains elevated above baseline (SBP +10 mmHg) , but not in 
the hypertensive range  (<139/89 mmHg), you will be sent home with a 24 -hour BP monitor, 
whichwill be programmed to obtain BP readings every 20 minutes during the day and at 30-minute 
int
ervals during the night. Study coordinator or the PI will follow-up with phone calls to you while 
you are at home to asses any side effects and document BP changes.  
 You will be asked to immediately report any significant adverse event you may feel after leaving 
the laboratory. Symptoms which you should be particularly aware of include: headache, pounding 
in the ears, blurry vision, nausea, goosebumps, chills and spasms; please alert the research staff if 
you experience any of these symptoms in greater frequency or severity during the experiment or 
after you leave the laboratory. 
 In order to lower the possible risks of interaction between the study medications and other 
medications you may be taking, you may be asked to avoid taking prescription medications on the 
day of the study,  which should be approved by your primary physician.  
 There may be interactions between the study medication and prescription medications you my be 
taking. In order to lower the risk to you the research staff will monitor your medications and may 
contact your doctor if needed. Medications prescribed for conditions not mentioned in the exclusion 
criteria, may have minor or moderate risks, (meaning the effects are considered tolerable and in most 
cases there is no need for medical intervention), and may be permitted, but decisions about your 
study participation should be made by study personnel in conjunction with you and your doctor.    
 Symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) may become more frequent or worse while taking the 
study medication droxidopa.  
 Common side effects of  the study medication are dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, headache, 
bladder pain, difficulty, painful, and/or burning urination. Also, an urge to urinate or urine retention.  
 Droxidopa  risks (≤8% likely) include: slow or fast heartbeat, pounding in the ears, low back or side 
pain, and  nervousness. 
 Since this research may have unknown effects on an unborn child and should not be done during 
pregnancy, it is necessary for a pregnancy test to be done first.  To your knowledge you are not 
pregnant at the present time. You also agree to avoid becoming pregnant (use contraceptives, take 
precautions against becoming pregnant, etc.) during this study. 
 
As with any research, there may be unforeseen risks and discomforts.  A medical doctor associated with 
the study will be available to treat any medical emergency that may develop.

A Research Protocol must be submitted with this application.  
 
 
A. LAY RESEARCH SUMMARY  
 
Provide 1- 2 paragraphs explaining the Research in lay terms, including the specific study 
aim, any important background information to explain why the research is important, what will be done, and how results will be analyzed.  
 
The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of the drug Droxidopa (Northera) in 
increasing blood pressure in subject with hypotension, low blood pressure, which is 
classif ied as blood pressure less than 110/70 in males and 100/70 in females. The first 
aim is to determine the proportion of subject with SCI who have a normotensive response to Droxidopa. The second is to determine the proportion of subject with SCHI 
who express a hypertensive response to Droxidopa. A Normal blood pressure ranges from 111- 139 in males and 101- 139 in females and a hypertensive blood pressure is 
anything higher than 140 in males and females.  
The study would take place in James J. Peters VA Medical  Center (JJPVAMC) ,The Icahn 
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) in Manhattan, New York  and The Kessler 
Foundation (KF) at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation  in West Orange, NJ.  
 
  
B. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
A. Provide a brief (200- 250 word) summary of background information for 
physician/scientistsList total # of subjects approved for enrollment by the IRB.  
List total number of subjects enrolled (Signed a consent form) over the life of this study. List total 
number of subjects enrolled(Signed a consent form)  in the current approval period. List total number 
of subjects terminated form study (Lost to follow -up, terminated by PI, withdrew consent, etc.). List 
total number of subjects that have completed all study tasks/procedures and follow -up visits. List total 
number of subjects currently receiving study treatment or participating in study activities. :  
Inter ruption of sympathetic cardiovascular autonomic regulation following spinal cord 
injury (SCI) is associated with significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels, 
hypotension and orthostatic hypotension (OH), particularly in individuals with high cord lesions. [1- 4] Although the incidence of hypotension is reported to be as high as 70% in 
persons with cervical lesions (i.e., tetraplegia), the vast majority of these individuals remains asymptomatic and, therefore, does not raise clinical concern, or p rompt 
intervention [5, 6]. While it is appreciated that clinicians are faced with substantial challenges in managing blood pressure (BP) in persons with SCI, contrary to the prevailing 
belief, asymptomatic hypotension and OH are not benign conditions. Reports suggest that 
asymptomatic hypotensive individuals with SCI may have subclinical cognitive dysfunction affecting memory and attention processing [7- 11] and increased incidence of 
fatigue and depression compared to normotensive individuals with SCI. [7] It must be appreciated that to date, there are no FDA approved pharmaceutical options proven to be 
safe and effective for treatment of hypotension and OH in the SCI population.  Until 2014, 
midodrine hydrochloride was the only agent with FDA approval for treatment of symptomatic neurogenic OH (NOH).  Midodrine, an alpha -agonist, is the most commonly 
prescribed agent used to treat symptomatic hypotension in the SCI population despite a lack of convincing evidence of safety or efficacy. [12]  In 2014 droxidopa (L- threo -3,4-
dihydroxyphenylserine - NORTHERA; Chelsea Therapeutics, Charlotte, NC) was approved 
by the FDA for treatment of symptomatic NOH based on data collected in conditions of autonomic dysfunction.  Droxidopa is a NE precursor that is stored in neuronal and non-
neuronal tissue and has been shown to increase standing BP and reduce symptoms of 
orthostatic intolerance in individuals with symptomatic NOH. [13 -15]  We recently reported 
preliminary evidence of a mean increase in seated BP in individuals with SCI following oral administration of 400 mg of droxidopa; however, this dose was effective in only 5 of the 10 subjects tested and the BP effect waned over a 4 -hour observation. [16] Because of its 
unique pharmokinetic profile, [17] droxidopa is a highly promising agent to treat hypotension in persons with SCI.  As such; there exists a pressing imperative to determine 
the clinical value and safety of droxidopa in hypotensive individuals with SCI.  
 
B. State the purpose of the study:  
Primary Aim 1.1: Dose o ptimization, open- label trial to determine the proportion of 
subjects with SCI with a normotensive response to droxidopa (Efficacy #1). Normotension will be defined as an average systolic BP (SBP) recorded 60- 120 
minutes after dose administration of 111- 139 mmHg in males and 101- 139 mmHg 
in females or a maximum dose of 800 mg is reached without adequate SBP response.  
Primary Aim 1.2: Dose optimization, open- label trial to determine the proportion of 
subjects with SCI with a hypertensive response to droxidopa (Safety #1). Hypertension will be defined as a sustained elevation (≥ 30 consecutive minutes) 
in seated SBP ≥ 140/100 mmHg or intolerable side effects considered related to 
study medication.  
Secondary Aims: To determine the effect of the individualized o ptimal dose of 
droxidopa, compared to placebo, on (1) supine BP (Safety #2), (2) SBP during a head -up tilt (HUT) maneuver to 70° (Efficacy #2) and change in cerebral blood flow 
velocity (CBFv) from supine to HUT (Efficacy #3).   
 
C. Background of Study Popula tion - Clinical Information:  
a. Describe the general population from which you plan to recruit subjects for this study (i.e., Demographics of potential subjects):  
All eligible participants, including women and minorities, will be included in this 
investigation if they demonstrate an understanding of the study procedures, meet 
entrance criteria, and sign the informed consent. Individuals will be recruited from 
prior study participation and referral from primary physicians.  
 
b. Describe the medical condition in this population:  
Subjects have experienced a spinal cord injury, experienced muscle paralysis 
below the level of injury, and have a variety of secondary medical consequences such as cardiovascular disease, pressure ulcers, osteoporosis, and diabet es. In addition, it is not uncommon for them to have received an 
initial dual diagnosis of traumatic brain injury and SCI.  
 
c. How does this condition affect this population (symptoms)? Depending on the level of injury subjects may have blood pressure dysregulation, elevated resting heart rate, reduced blood flow to the brain, and impaired cognitive function in addition to decreased levels of upper and/or lower body sensory and motor function.  
 
d. Does this population have an understanding or knowledge of the medical condition being studied? Many of the subjects who have been injured longer do have an understanding of their injury and the problems associated with it. Subjects who are acutely injured may not have been provided with a vast amount of knowledge  on their injury but they will not be recruited for this 
study.  
 
e. What is the traditional treatment provided for this condition?  
Traditional treatments address the secondary medical consequences of SCI via prevention and specific organ system therapies. Som e individuals undergo 
experimental therapies in an effort to regain function.  
 
f. Explain how special needs that may arise with this population due to this medical condition are addressed (e.g. Additional care provided, supportive therapy, physiotherapy, behavioral therapy):  
We accommodate subjects as best as possible by providing physical assistance for transferring, preparing for the study, and completing study -
related paperwork. In addition, all our resources (i.e., bathroom, desks and doors) are wheelchair  accessible.  
 
g. Describe how research subjects will be referred for appropriate care while they 
are enrolled in the study? If, and when necessary, all participants will be referred to the appropriate clinical personnel given the medical concern presented.  
h. Describe whether providers (all clinical staff) have experience in providing care to 
subjects: There are several physicians at the site that have been board 
certified for a number of years and have excellent experience.  
 i. Does the James J. Peters VAMC have the appropriate medical or psychosocial resources required for any emergency needs for research subjects? 
The 
JJPVAMC is an SCI center and cares for more than 300 veterans with SCI as both 
In-patients and outpatients; medical resources are available if emerg ently 
required.  
 
4. Selection of subjects:  
 
a. Indicate number of subjects to be enrolled at this site ( Total # of subjects approved 
by IRB) :  
A total of 75 subjects will be screened (25 at JJPVAMC; 25 at ISMMS ; 25 at KF). Of 
those 75 screened, 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled for study 1 (20 at JJPVAM; 20 
at ISMMS ; 20 at KF). From those 6 0 who complete study 1, A total of 30 will enrolled 
for study 2 between all sites.  
 
b. Indicate total number of subjects to be enrolled, if multisite study:  
A total of 75 subject will be screened. (25 at JJPVAMC; 25 at ISMMS ; 25 at KF)  
A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled for study 1. (20 at JJPVAM; 20 at ISMMS ; 20 at 
KF) 
A total of 30 subject will be enrolled for study 2. (between KF, ISSMS and JJPVAMC)  
 
c. Are veterans being enrolled at this site?   
YES   X NO  
 
d. Are non- veterans being enrolled at this site?   
YES   X NO  
If no, proceed to question 4.f.  
Justify why non -veterans will be enrolled at this site: Non -veterans are being 
enrolled to meet the study’s enrollment number and to broaden the population pool.  
Of all subjects to be enrolled at this site, what percentage will be non -veterans? This 
number  cannot be determined given the unknown demographics of patients at 
the site. However it is likely that a greater percentage will be non -veterans as 
the ISMMS is not a veteran care institution.  
 e. Describe the setting in which the research will be conducted (e.g., research office, clinic, lab, inpatient unit, outpatient unit):  
The study will take place at James J. Peter VA Medical Center in the Spinal Cord 
Injury Research Department in room 7A -13. All necessary equipment needed for the 
study is present in that department.  
ISMMS: The research will be performed at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in the 
Klingstein Clinical Center (KCC) building on floor KCC2 in the Rehabilitation in -
patient ward. All necessary equipment needed for the study is present in that 
department.  
KF: The research will be performed at  Kessler Foundation at t he Kessler Institute for 
Rehabilitation, 1199 Pleasant Valley Way, West Orange New Jersey in the main 
building, Room L050. All necessary equipment needed for the study is present in that 
department.  
 
f. What is the expected length of time a study subject w ill participate? (i.e., number 
of days, weeks, months, years) Qualified subjects will come in for 10 visits, 
including the screening visit for study 1. They will then come in for an addition 2 visits for study 2 if they qualify. The approximate maximum len gth of time 
they would be participating in the study would be 11 weeks if they come in once a week.

YES    NO X 
Why or why not?  
The subject stipend that is offered is not coercive and should not have any influence 
on the subject’s decision to participate for the following reasons:  
o Payment for participation will not be discussed during the recruitment process unless a question is specifically asked by the participant.  
o The stipend offered is as compensation for participants’ time and travel; and 
is reasonable given the duration of testing.  
 
  
c. What special safety precautions are utilized to minimize risk of coercion to 
protect the rights and welfare of these subjects [e.g., avoid financial incentives, consult with patient advocates or representati ves]? 
Participants will be given 
many opportunities to ask questions and to review the consent with their 
primary care physicians.  
 
10. As PI, do you have access to sufficient population that will allow recruitment of the 
necessary number of subjects?  
YES   X NO  
 11. Indicate how potential subjects will be recruited:  
Potential participants will be recruited via primary care referral from a KF, ISMMS or 
JJP VAMC care provider or from prior enrollment in a research study.  All subjects 
will be recruited in accordance with HIPAA and local IRB guidelines by the co-
investigator by telephone or on the day of their regularly scheduled appointment.  
 
12. Description of the Consent Process:  
a. Describe the enrollment procedures  for participation in the study:  
Participants contact or are referred to a Co- investigator at KF, ISMMS and JJP VAMC 
and will provide information relative to the inclusion criteria. If the participant 
displays interest in participating, the co -investigator will thoroughly review the 
consent documents, and after the consent process is complete a testing  date is 
scheduled.  
 
b. Indicate when and where consent will be obtained:  
The informed consent process will be conducted in the privacy of the research 
laboratory at a time that is convenient for the participant and research staff, prior to 
initiation of study procedures.  
 
c. Who will conduct the consent interview?  
Research staff members associated with the research protocol as listed on the assurance page will conduct the consent interview.  
 d. Will a legally authorized representative provide consent or permission for a subject, as appropriate?       
YES   X NO  
 e. What is the waiting period between informing the prospective subject about the study and obtaining consent?   
There is no defined waiting time between completion of the informed consent process 
and initiating study procedures.  However, the informed consent process will be 
completed prior to initiating study procedures.  
 
Time devoted to consent discussion? The participant will be given adequate time 
to read the consent and ask questions.  As long as necessary.  
Time allowed for a decision? Subjects will b e reminded that they may take the 
consent home and review it with their family and/or primary care physician. As long as necessary.  
 
 
 
f. How will you insure that the language used by those obtaining consent will not include exculpatory language which woul d waive or appear to waive any of the 
subject’s legal rights? 
The IRB approved consent will be read verbatim to the 
participant or translator. Participants will be asked to reiterate the study procedures 
and goals, any uncertainty will be clarified by study team members.  
 
g. How will you insure that the information being communicated to the subject or the representative during the consent process will not include exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence?  
The consent form has information on the rights of the participant and the responsibilities of the investigator, the institution and/or its  agents toward 
the participant as a consequence of his/her participation in the study. This consent form will be discussed with the participant in detail, and will clearly state the above- mentioned participant’s rights and the 
investigator’s/institution’s or its agent’s responsibilities in non- exculpatory 
language. Investigators and coordinators will have completed all mandatory training.  
 
h. How will you know that the language is understandable to the prospective subject 
or the legally authorized represent ative?  
Eligible participants will be given a copy of the consent to read through at home at their 
own leisure.  After about one (1) week the investigator, or a representative, will call the 
participant to go over the details of the consent and ask if ther e are any questions prior 
to scheduling a study visit.  Before signing the consent, potential participants or their 
surrogate will be asked to concisely reiterate what they understand about the study, its 
objectives, and the consent form in their own words  in a clear, concise and accurate 
manner. Only after the investigator/representative has received signed informed 
consent, will studies be performed with any subject.  
 
i. Indicate how you will determine whether the subjects (or their surrogates) understand the content of the information that is provided in the consent 
document:  
Through open dialog with the study participant or his/her surrogate the 
investigator/representative will gain an understanding of the potential participant’s 
ability to objectively d iscern the study procedures and his/her role in participating. 
The coordinator will emphasize the voluntary nature of participation in the study. 
Participants or their surrogate will be asked to reiterate what they understand the 
implications of their deci sion to, or not to, participate in the study are. If the 
participants or their surrogate demonstrate inability to communicate a decision, they will not be enrolled in the study and the consent process will cease.  
 
j. How will you insure that the consent process will minimize the possibility of 
coercion or undue influence?  
The relationship between study investigators and study participants is and will 
remain exclusively for the purposes of research. We maintain open dialog with the 
study participant or his/her surrogate at all times and as such we have an 
understanding of the potential subject’s ability to objectively discern the study 
procedures and his/her role in participating. Reimbursement is allocated for the 
time investment in the research pr ocess for study participants and is not excessive. 
Participants will be afforded the opportunity to ask as many questions as they 
desire, speak to other individuals regarding their participation and schedule testing 
at their leisure.  
 
13. Summarize what actually will be done to the subjects during their participation in the 
study:  
 
a. Provide a  clear description of what is being done for research purposes and 
what is being done as part of “usual care”:  
 All procedures are being performed for research purposes.  
 
b. Provide a detailed list of tests and procedures  that will be performed for 
research purposes (e.g., blood tests, urine tests, cultures, interviews, questionnaires, surgical  procedures, cardiac catheterization, pulmonary function tests, X -rays, scans, etc) during the course of the study.  List must indicate tests 
and procedures only for subjects who sign a VA consent form, regardless of where tests and procedures take place:

e. Risks for Investigational Drugs/Device:  
For investigational drugs, what are the possible risks associated with the study 
drug relative to possible interactions with medications likely to be used by subjects? 
Following droxidopa, administration BP may elevate above the normal 
range (>140/90 mmHg) . In addition, symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) may 
become frequent or worsen while taking the study medication. Clinical staff will 
assist the subject to an upright seated position, loosen any tight clothing or 
braces that the subject is wearing and may check and empty your bladder and 
bowel. If BP remains high for more than 30 minutes the subject will be provided 
with a medication to lower their pressure. The medication of choice will be a 
nitropaste (Nitroglycerin Ointment, 2%) that will be placed one inch on the 
subjects forehead.  
Droxidopa risks (≤8% likely) include: slow or fast heartbeat, pounding in the ears, 
low back or side pain, and nervousness.  
Since this research may have unknown effects on an unborn child and should not 
be done during pregnancy, it is necessary for a pregnancy test to be done first.  
To your knowledge you are not pregnant at the present time. You also agree to 
avoid becoming pregnant (use contraceptives, take precautions against becoming 
pregnant, etc.) during this study.  
As with any research, there may be unforeseen risks and discomforts.  A medical 
doctor associated with the study will be available to treat any medical emergency 
that may develop.  
What will your approach be to such risks?  Study personnel and clinical 
staff will monitor BP daily during the study participation period.  
Will such subjects be excluded from the study? No.  
 
Have you reviewed scientific literature or relevant FDA and Sponsor Advisories 
alerts or warnings relevant to this medication/device?  
YES   X NO  
If there was any new information, what were the possible risks to subjects 
based on this information? Not that we are aware of.  
If there was any new information, how were potential benefits for subjects affected by this information? Not that we are aware of.  
 
If new information is received from the FDA or Sponsor that may affect the conduct of this study , would you be willing to c hange the study design or study procedures?  
YES   X NO  
How will you inform subjects of any relevant information from the FDA or Sponsor Advisories? If relevant information regarding droxidopa, is published, all participants enrolled in the study will be notified, in person, by either the PI or study coordinator.  
 What advice will you provide to subjects if there are questions on continuing participation in the study? The study team will provide participants with the 
necessary information in order to make an informed decision, should more risk arise through FDA information. Participants can speak with the study team about any questions they may have on continuing involvement in the study.

17. Data Analysis and Sample Size:  
a. Describe the analysis that will be performed on the data:  
 Primary Aim 1.1:  Dose optimization, open -label trial to determine the 
proportion of subjects with SCI with a normotensive response to droxidopa (Efficacy #1).   Normotension will be defined as an average systolic BP (SBP) recorded 60- 120 minutes after dose administration of between 111-
139 mmHg in males and 101- 139 mmHg in females.  
•Hypothesis 1.1 – Seated SBP will be normalized in 60% of the study 
sample following administration of droxidopa.   
- This hypothesis will be tested by constructing a 95% confidence interval about  the sample proportion of cases in which BP is normalized with 
droxidopa. The inclusion of the 60% value in the confidence interval will 
be taken as evidence in support of the hypothesis. Further, the point estimate and confidence interval will provide the first reported estimate 
of the BP normalizing effect of droxidopa in the population with SCI.  
 Primary Aim 1.2: Dose optimization, open- label trial to determine the 
proportion of subjects with SCI with a hypertensive response to droxidopa (Safety #1).  H ypertension will be defined as a sustained elevation in seated 
SBP ≥ 140/100 mmHg or intolerable side effects considered related to study medication  
•Hypothesis 1.2 –  Less than 10% of the study sample will exhibit 
hypertension or intolerable side effects related to administration of 
droxidopa.  
- This hypothesis will be tested by constructing a 95% confidence interval about the proportion of cases in which either seated BP ≥ 140/100 or intolerable side effects occur. If the 95% CI excludes values ≥ 10%, this will be taken as evidence in support of the hypothesis. Further, the point estimate and confidence interval will provide the first reported estimate of the expected side effects of droxidopa treatment in the population with SCI.  
 Secondary Aims: To determi ne the effect of the individualized optimal dose 
of droxidopa, compared to placebo, on (1) supine BP (Safety #2), (2) SBP during a head- up tilt (HUT) maneuver to 70° (Efficacy #2) and change in 
cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) from supine to HUT (Effica cy #3).  The 
following hypotheses will be tested in hypotensive individuals with SCI:  
•Hypothesis 2.1A – Average supine SBP will be significantly increased 
following droxidopa administration compared to placebo.  
- This hypothesis will be tested using a repe ated measures analysis of 
covariance where the pre- droxidopa or placebo SBP will be used as the 
covariate and the adjusted post -test scores will serve as the dependent 
variable. In addition, the covariate adjusted point estimate and 95% confidence interval  of the difference between drug conditions will 
provide the first reported estimate of the supine SBP response to droxidopa versus placebo in the SCI population.  
•Hypothesis 2.1B – The proportion of supine BP observations ≥140/100 
mmHg following droxidopa  administration will not differ significantly from 
the proportion observed during the placebo trial.  
- This hypothesis will be tested by performing separate (one each for systolic and diastolic pressure) tests of the differences between dependent proportions, from which the 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated. The presence of zero in a confidence interval will indicate a 
lack of statistical difference in incidence of hypertensive events 
between the droxidopa and placebo conditions.  
•Hypothesis 2.2 –  Average SBP during 70° HUT will be significantly 
increased following droxidopa administration compared to placebo.  
- This hypothesis will be tested by performing a dependent t -test between 
the mean SBP during 70° HUT comparing droxidopa to placebo. Further , 
the point estimate and resulting 95% confidence interval will provide an 
estimate of the SBP response to HUT of droxidopa versus placebo in the SCI population.  
Hypothesis 2.3 – The change in CBFv from supine to HUT will be 
significantly attenuated follo wing droxidopa administration compared to 
placebo.  
- This hypothesis will be tested using a repeated measures analysis of covariance where the pre- HUT CBFv will be used as the covariate and 
the adjusted post -HUT CBFv scores will serve as the dependent 
variable. In addition, the covariate adjusted point estimate and 95% confidence interval of the differences between drug conditions (droxidopa vs. placebo) will provide the first reported estimate describing the effect of droxidopa on the CBFv response to HUT.  
Hypothesis 2.4 – Plasma renin and serum aldosterone concentrations will 
be reduced and plasma norepinephrine concentrations will be increased during HUT following administration of droxidopa compared to placebo.  
- These hypotheses will be tested using a repeated measures analysis of covariance where the pre- HUT concentrations will be used as the 
covariate and the adjusted post -HUT concentrations will serve as the 
dependent variable. In addition, the covariate adjusted point estimate and 95% confidence interv al of the differences between drug conditions 
(droxidopa vs. placebo) will provide the first reported estimate describing the effect of droxidopa on these vasoactive substances in response to HUT.  
 
b. Provide power analysis or describe how sample size was determined:  
This is a pilot trial to determine the dose efficacy and safety of droxidopa to increase systemic BP and improve orthostatic BP and CBFv responses compared to placebo in hypotensive individuals with SCI.   
Because this is a pilot trial, the following statistical analyses are not powered for a specific effect size; however, the results will be used to power a subsequent large scale clinical trial to identify the utility and safety of droxidopa for treatment of asymptomatic hypotension in persons with SCI.

ABSTRACT  
Outcomes for children with relapsed AML remain poor and have not significantly improved over the past 
decade.  For patients who do experience relapse, effective combination therapies that achieve complete 
remission so that patients can proceed to s tem cell transplant remain the only chance for long -term survival. 
Thus, new therapies are urgently needed and as single agents are inadequate in patients with relapsed or 
refractory AML, optimal combination strategies are an important area of investigatio n.  MLN4924 
(pevonedistat ) is a novel small molecul e inhibitor of NEDD8 -activating enzyme (NAE), which is involved 
in the ubiquitin -proteasome system and responsible for protein turnover within cells and has significant 
impact on cell growth and survival. Preclinical studies in AML have shown that exposure t o MLN4924 
(pevonedistat ), especially when combined with AML chemotherapies including cytarabine or azacitidine, 
results in potent cell death. Further, a phase I study of MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ) combined with azacitidine 
in adults with AML demonstrated that the regimen was well tolerated, and that the combination of the two 
drugs resulted in higher complete remission rates compared to rates previously observed with either of the 
drugs alone. This is a phase I feasibility study of MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ) in com bination with azacitidine 
followed by fludarabine and cytarabine for children with refractory or recurrent AML. MLN4924 
(pevonedistat ) will be administered in combination with azacitidine, fludarabine, and cytarabine in a 35 -
day cycle. A total of 2 cycles will be allowed. Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)  is determined, 
a dose -expansion cohort will further assess the safety of this combination.  This clinical trial is critical to 
evaluati ng this novel agent in AML and determining the safety of this c ombination strategy in relapsed 
AML in efforts to improve outcomes for this group of patients.

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)
1.1 Primary Aims
To evaluate the tolerability and feasibility of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) added to 
the 3-drug backbone of azacitidine (aza) , fludarabine, and cytarabine re-induction 
for pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory AML and MDS.
To define and describe the toxicities of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) when given in 
combination with azacitidine, fludarabine, and cytarabine to pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory AML and MDS.
To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MLN4924 (pevonedist at) in children 
with recurrent or refractory AML and MDS.
1.2 Secondary Aim
To describe the antitumor activity of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with azacitidine, fludarabine, and cytarabine within the confines of a feasibility
study.
1.3 Exploratory Aims
To describe the effect of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administered on this schedule 
on mRNA transcript levels of genes known to be induced by MLN4924 (pevonedistat) mediated NAE inhibition.
To describe the effect of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) on NEDDylation of proteins in the NEDD8 pathway that are likely to be affected by NAE inhibition with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). 
2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating 
enzyme (NAE) that is currently under development for patients with hematologic and solid malignancies. The NEDD8 conjugation pathway is involved in the ubiquitin-
proteasome system (UPS), which is responsible for protein turnover within cells.  The 
NAE is an essential component of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, controlling the activity of a subset of UPS E3 ligases that regulate the timely ubiquitination of proteins with key roles in cell cycle progression and a number of cellular processes integral to cell growth, proliferation, and survival.  In preclinical studies in both solid and hematologic 
cancer cell lines, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) resulted in NAE inhibition, decreased 
NEDD8-cullin levels, and an increase in ubiquitin ligases that require NEDD8 for activation.
1,2  In most cases, exposure to MLN4924 (pevonedistat) resulted in DNA 
damage and cell death through apoptosis.3  AML samples with cycling cells were more 
sensitive to NAE inhibition than non-cycling cells. Phase 1 studies of MLN4924 
(pevonedistat) in adults with hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies have 
suggested promising activity with minimal adverse effects when administered on specific

dosing schedules.1,4  In vitro and in vivo  evalua tion by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing 
Program (PPTP) in cell lines and xenograft models demonstrated inhibition of tumor 
growth in some malignancies.5 Clinical development with MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ) in 
adults is currently focused on patients with AML  and MDS  due to the encouraging 
activity and safety in combination with azacitidine , as well as additional therapies in this 
patient population in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.6,7 
The chemotherapy backbone of fludarabine  (Flu) and cytarabine  (AraC) has become a 
standard re -induction regi men among pediatric patients with relapsed AML.  The 
International BFM group conducted a randomized trial that compared Flu/AraC + 
filgrastim vs. Flu/AraC + filgrastim + daunoXome that randomized 394 patients, providing 
the largest amount of statistically  significant data evaluating cytarabine based regimens. 
Following 2 courses of therapy with Flu/AraC vs Flu/AraC+daunoXome, the CR was 59% 
vs 69% respectively (p=0.07), with no differences in overall survival at 36% vs. 40% 
respectively (p=0.54).8 However, among patients with core binding factor AML there was 
improvement in survival observed among patients receiving daunoXome.  Many patients 
are at risk for treatment -related cardiotoxic ity due to  the cumulative anthracycline exposure 
during initial therapy, as well as the total body irradiation for patients who have undergone 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Thus, the development of effective non -anthracycline 
regimens is critical for patients  with relapsed AML. For these reasons, the Flu/AraC 
regimen has now become the standard salvage backbone for which novel agents are 
evaluated within COG as well as other cooperative groups. Single agent MLN4924 
(pevonedistat ) resulted in a 9% CR/CRi rate c ompared to 39% for azacitidine + MLN4924 
(pevonedistat ), and 44% among patients who were evaluable for disease .6,7 Given the 
encouraging data from early phase clinical trials with the combination of azacitidine + 
MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ), there is compelling rationale to move this combination forward 
in AML.  
 
 
Aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with disease progression and drug 
resistance, thus providing rationale for the potential of a DNA hypomethylating agent such 
as azacitidine  to be added  into chemotherapy regimens.9,10 Hypomethylating agents such 
as azacitidine have been fo und to act through a variety of mechanisms with anti -leukemic 
potential, including but not limited to induction of global hypomethylation, downregulation 
of oncogenes, reactivation of tumor suppressors,  and increasing sensitivity to cytotoxic 
agents.11-13 There is also preclinical and clinical data to support the safety and potential 
increase in efficacy of azacitidine in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine in AML. 
In vivo  studies have demonstrated that azacitidine administered prior to high  dose AraC 
can result in hypomethylation and increased expression of certain genes, including 
deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which results in increased cellular ara -CTP concentrations 
and sensitivity to AraC.8,14 A phase 1 trial evaluating azacitidine in combination with 
fludarabine and cytarabine  in pediatric AML found this regimen to be safe and well 
tolerated with no excess toxicity compared to what is seen with standard AML salvage 
regimens, particularly  Flu/A raC alone .15 Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated a 
decrease in methylation following azacitidine exposure in the peripheral blood of all 
patients treated with this regimen.15 Taken together, this pre-clinical data as wel l as phase 
1 adult and pediatric studies demonstrate the biologic rational for azacitidine given with 
MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ), and demonstrate  the safety of this regimen.  The azacitidine 
prime prior to standard chemotherapy is also being evaluated in the up front setting of the 
St. Jude’s trial AML16 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Given the importance of the epigenome in AML  
and the global hypermethylation that is often seen in AML , there is significant interest in 
                    ADVL1 712

the use of epigenetic modulation in combination with chemotherapy. This trial will further 
the COG’s investigation in the safety and potential efficacy of this strategy.  Based on results of this study, the cassette of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) + azacitidine in combination with flu/AraC could move into the phase II setting where it is evaluated against the 
combination of azacitidine + Flu/AraC to determine the efficacy signal attributable to the 
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) + azacitidine combination. 
Regimens used in relapsed AML are very intensive with known toxicities, especially 
myelosuppression. Given the intensity of myelosuppression for many relapsed AML regimens, there is no consensus measure of what duration is excessively toxic. Recent review of the COG trial AAML0531 is in line with TACL’s findings, as on this study the 
median time to platelet > 50,000 and ANC > 500 was 38 and 37 days, respectively, and 
evaluation of approximately 2 standard deviations of this is approximately 50 days.  Mor e 
recent COG trials for relapsed AML, including the current first line relapse trial, have set a duration of greater than 50 days from the start of therapeutic cycle as excessively myelosuppresive and a DLT based on the recovery times for multi-agent intensive 
regimens. Fludarabine and cytarabine is comparable in intensity to this regimen, therefore 
for this trial a time of 50 days from the start of therapy without hematologic recovery (ANC>500 and a non-transfusion platelet count > 20,000) as a hematologic DLT. 
2.2 Preclinical Studies
Antitumor Activity
There is strong biologic rationale to utilize MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in AML.  In-
vitro studies of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) as a single agent demonstrate its ability 
to induce death of AML cells through multiple pathways, including NF-ĸB inhibition, reactive oxygen species generation, and DNA damage.
16,17There exists 
biologic rationale to combine MLN4924 (pevonedistat) with cytarabine, as MLN4924 (pevonedistat) disrupts nucleotide metabolism and promotes increased 
incorporation of cytarabine into the DNA of AML cells, and the combination led to observed synergy in vitro and increased survival for AML xenograft models.
16,18
Among 4 AML cell lines tested, all showed increased cell death when treated with the drug combination, as well as patient samples (n=10) with combination indexes 
(CI) ranging from 0.5-0.8 across all combinations tested, all demonstrating 
synergy (CI < 1).
18Importantly, there was no difference seen between primary 
patient samples with prior exposure to chemotherapy (n=6) compared to treatment naive samples (n=4).  Preclinical data from in vitro studies demonstrates
synergistic activity of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administered in combination with 
cytarabine.
16,18The combination of azacitidine and MLN4924 (pevonedistat) was 
evaluated in an AML xenograft model and the combination demonstrated synergy when compared to monotherapy with a significant decrease in tumor burden (p<0.05).
19
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administration in tumor-bearing immunocompromised 
mice has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in AML xenografts, as demonstrated by stable disease regression and inhibition of NEDDylated cullins.
17Treatment with 
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) resulted in dose dependent inhibition of the neddylation 
of cullins, as well as the stabilization of cullin-dependent ligase substrates Nrf- 2 
and Cdt1, and a DNA damage response.2

Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated that MLN4924 (pevonedistat)
exposure results in increased levels of the protein ribonucleotide reductase 
(RRM2), which can be antagonized by azacitidine, which may result in increased 
sensitivity to MLN4924 (pevonedistat). In vitro studies in AML cell lines 
demonstrated the ability of azacitidine to counter the normally seen increase in 
RRM2 following MLN4924 (pevonedistat).19The combination was evaluated in 7 
AML cell lines and resulted in synergy (CI < 1) when evaluating cell viability.19
Animal Toxicology 
The non-clinical safety profile of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has been characterized 
when given by SubQ injection or 30 minute IV infusion in Sprague Dawley rats 
and by 30 minute IV infusion in beagle dogs. The lethal dose in rats in a SubQ repeat dose 5 day study was 200 mg/kg (1200 mg/m
2) within 24 hours after a single 
dose. Additionally moribundity requiring euthanasia within 24 hours after a dose was observed in dogs dosed at 40 mg/kg (800 mg/m
2).20
The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) when 
administered cyclically (2 cycles of 5 days of dosing followed by a 14 day rest period or 5 cycles of 4 doses given every other day followed by a 14 day rest period) was 15 mg/kg (300 mg/m
2) in dogs and 60 mg/kg (360 mg/m2) in rats. The 
primary dose limiting toxicity of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in rats and beagle dogs 
was GI toxicity leading to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration and 
complications associated with bone marrow suppression. An acute phase-like response was also observed presenting with alterations in body temperature, increased fibrinogen, decreased albumin, alterations in circulating neutrophils, and 
increased neutrophil infiltration in multiple tissues (dogs only). Decreased blood 
pressure, increased heart rate, and shortened PR and QT intervals followed by an 
increased diastolic blood pressure were also noted. Myocardial, renal, and hepatotoxicity seen at doses above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in rats were correlated with sepsis. Other adverse effects observed were injection sitenecrosis of skin and soft tissues with SubQ administration, changes in trabecular bone formation and changes in serum chemistry. Most MLN4924 (pevonedistat ) 
related adverse effects resolved during the 14 day rest period or were resolving at the completion of the 14 days and are considered reversible.
20
Microscopic changes noted in male and female reproductive organs in rats and dogs indicate MLN4924 (pevonedistat) represents a significant reproductive and 
developmental hazard. MLN4924 (pevonedistat) was not mutagenic in a bacterial 
reverse mutation (Ames) test.
20Please refer to the Investigator’s brochure for full 
details of preclinical toxicology studies. 
Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies
In vitro , MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, with 
small contribution from the CYP2D6.  Drug-drug interaction studies indicated 
CYP3A4 inhibitors had no clinically meaningful effects on MLN4924 (pevonedistat) pharmacokinetics, however, there is potential for drug-drug interactions if MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is coadmin istered with drugs that are 
CYP3A4 inducers.  MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is a weak and reversible inhibitor of 
CYP2B6 and 2C8.  The major elimination pathway of MLN4924 (pevonedistat)

in animals was through the hepatic route. Animal studies have demonstrated that 
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has been shown to be primarily excreted in the feces and excretion is almost complete by 24 hours postdose.  MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has 
been shown to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2).

2.3 Adult Studies
Phase 1 Studies
To date, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has been evaluated in multiple phase 1 studies 
as a single agent and with combination therapy in adults with both hematologic 
and non-hematologic malignancies.  Results have demonstrated that MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is tolerated on an intermittent dosing schedule and has promising results for potential efficacy.
Two single agent studies in hematologic malignancies, including one for patients 
with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), have evaluated MLN4924 (pevonedistat) across a range of dosing schedules as well as doses, ranging from 25mg/m
2– 147 mg/m2.  When MLN4924 (pevonedistat) was administered on days 
1, 3, and 5 every 21 days in 27 patients, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 59 mg/m
2.7The most common adverse events (AE) on this 
schedule were diarrhea (52%), pyrexia (44%), febrile neutropenia (41%), decreased appetite (41%), fatigue (33%), myalgia (30%), increased AST (30%), and increased ALT (33%).
7  A variety of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred, 
including hepatic toxicity, hypotension, cardiac failure, GI necrosis, lactic 
acidosis, myocardial ischemia, acute renal failure, and morbiliform rash.  For the 
23 patients treated at or below the MTD for the schedule above, there were 2 
complete remissions (CR, 9%) and additional 2 partial remissions (PR 8%), for a combined CR/PR rate of 17%.
7An additional 26 patients were treated on alternate 
dosing regimen that administered MLN4924 (pevonedistat) on days 1, 4,8, and 11 
and the MTD was determined to be 83 mg/m2and there were 2 PRs observed 
(10%). 
An additional trial evaluating MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with 
azacitidine in older adult patients (> 60 years of age) with de novo AML has 
demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile.  This study administered azacitidine IV or subcutaneously for a total of 7 days on days 1-5, 8-9 (5 on/2 weekend off/2 
on) at a dose of 75 mg/m
2with MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administered on days 1, 
3, and 5 in 28-day treatment cycles.  MLN4924 (pevonedistat) doses of 20 mg/m2
(n=55) and 30 mg/m2(n=6) dosing were evaluated and the MTD was determined 
to be 20 mg/m2.  A total of 61 patients have been treated on this study, receiving a 
median of 4 cycles of therapy (range of 1-33).  The most common AEs were 
constipation (48%), nausea (42%) fatigue (42%), and anemia (39%).  A majority 
of patients (n=53, 83%) experienced a > grade 3 AE, with most common being 
anemia and febrile neutropenia ( 30% each), thrombocytopenia (23%), neutropenia 
(20%), and pneumonia (17%). There were DLTs observed in four patients (n=2 at 
20 mg/m2 and n=2 at 30 mg/m2).  One patient had elevated bilirubin, and the other 
3 patients had elevated AST and ALT (maximum grade 3-4).  For the 2 patients
with transaminase elevation treated at the 20 mg/m2dose, this was a transient effect

that resolved spontaneously and the patients were successfully re-challenged at a 
lower dose and remained on study. The most common SAEs detected were febrile 
neutropenia (25%) and pneumonia (14%).  These infectious events and 
myelosuppression are commonly observed in AML regimens. None of the on-
study deaths (n=11) were attributed to MLN4924 (pevonedistat).  A total of 64 
patients were treated and included in the intent to treat (ITT) cohort, with a total of 
52 patients evaluable for response. Among the ITT cohort, the CR/CRi rate was 
39% (20 CR, 5 CRi) with 7 PRs for an overall response rate (ORR) of 50%. Among the patients evaluable for response, a CR/CRi rate of 48% was observed.

Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies
Pharmacokinetic studies with single agent MLN4924 (pevonedistat) have demonstrated that C
maxand AUC 24do increase in a dose proportional manner 
when evaluated from 25-147 mg/m2. However plasma concentrations are similar 
across a range of doses (25 -78 mg/m2) after 12 hours of exposure and were 
detectable at 24 hours post-dose.21Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies with single 
agent MLN4924 (pevonedistat) have demonstrated induction of multiple target genes induced by MLN4924 (pevonedistat) mediated NAE inhibition across all dose levels tested.
1,7Pharmacodynamic data across the various single-agent 
phase 1 MLN4924 (pevonedistat) trials provide evidence of pathway inhibition downstream of NAE and biological activity is seen across all doses tested (range 
25-261 mg/m
2) in pharmacodynamics assays. Additional data of PK and PD 
studies of single agent MLN4924 (pevonedistat), including in the presence of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor also demonstrated activity of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) at 8, 15, and 20 mg/m
2doses.  Pharmacodynamic evaluation of 8 
genes of interest that are induced by NAE inhibition demonstrated an increase in 
gene expression relative to baseline in all genes. Importantly, positive increases 
in gene expression were most notable at the higher doses of 15 and 20 mg/m2as 
compared to the 8 mg/m2dose, where more variability was observed.  Further, 
the time interval of maximal effect was seen at 4-8 hours following MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administration with a similar pattern between the 15 and 20 mg/m
2
doses.22
Preliminary PK studies of MLN 4924 (pevonedistat) demonstrate no alterations in 
PK profiles in the presence of azacitidine compared to single agent MLN4924 (pevonedistat) as well as in the presence of other conventional chemotherapy agents.

2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
 
This is a feasibility study of  MLN4924  (pevonedistat ) in combination with azacitidine, 
fludarabine, an d cytarabine for patients with  recurrent or refractory AML  or MDS . 
MLN4924 (p evonedistat ) will be administered IV over 1 hour on days  1, 3, and 5 of a 35 -
day cycle  at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 for patients > 1 year of age. For patients < 1 year 
of age, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) will be administered IV over 1 hour on days 1, 3, and 5 
of a 35 -day cycle at a starting dose of 15 mg/m2. For all patients,  MLN4924 (p evonedi stat) 
will be administered in combination with azacitidine  (75 mg/m2/dose for patients > 1 year 
of age and 2.5 mg/kg/dose for patients < 1 year of age) daily x 5 days  administered  on days 
1-5. Following completion of azacitidine and MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ), IV fludarabine (30 
mg/m2/dose for patients > 1 year of age and 1 mg/kg/dose for patients < 1 year of age) 
infused  over 30 minutes, and IV cytarabine (2000 mg/m2/dose for patients  > 1 year of age 
and 67 mg/kg/dose for patients < 1 year of age) infused  over 1-3 hours will be administered  
daily x 5  days,  with cytarabine infusion to begin 4 hours after the start of fludarabine.   A 
total of 2 cycles will be allowed. Once the RP2D is determined, a dose -expansion cohort 
will further assess the safety of this combination.  Pharmacokinetics will be obtained in all 
patients while  correlative studies will be obtained in consenting patients . Based on the 
results of this study , the efficac y of this combination will be further evaluated in a phase 2 
trial for relapsed AML.

evaluations must be re -checked within 48 hours prior to initiating therapy: CBC with differential, 
bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum  creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the 
patient may not receive protocol therapy and will be considered off pro tocol therapy. Bone marrow 
biopsy  and/or aspirate  must be obtained within 14 days  prior to start of protocol therapy .  
 
 
Clarification in timing when counting days : As an example, please note that if the patient’s last day 
of prior therapy is September 1st, and the protocol requires waiting at least  7 days for that type of 
prior therapy, then that patient cannot be enrolled until September 8th.   
 
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be 
waiv ed (per COG policy posted 5/11/01).  All clinical and laboratory data required for 
determining eligibility of a patient enrolled on this trial must be available in the patient’s 
medical or research record which will serve as the source document for verific ation at the 
time of audit.

5.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM
5.1 Overview of Treatment Plan
The primary purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and toxicity profile 
of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with azacitidine, fludarabine, and cytarabine in children with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS and to recommend a phase 2 dose for use in further studies.  A rolling 6 design will be utilized. Patients will receive 1 dose of 
intrathecal cytarabine with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to be performed prior to the start of each cycle of therapy. 
For patients > 1 year of age, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) will be administered at 20 
mg/m2/dose intravenously (IV) on days 1, 3 and 5. Azacitidine will be administered at 75 
mg/m2/dose IV once daily on days 1-5. On days 1, 3, and 5 when both drugs are 
administered, azacitidine will be administered first followed by MLN4924 (pevonedistat) 
infusion. The infusion of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) will begin between 30-60 minutes after 
completion of IV azacitidine. Following completion of azacitidine and MLN4924 
(pevonedistat), fludarabine 30 mg/m2/dose IV once daily and cytarabine 2000 mg/m2/dose 
IV once daily will be administered on days 6-10. Cytarabine infusion will begin 4 hours after the start of fludarabine.
For patients < 1 year of age, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) will be administered at 15 
mg/m
2/dose intravenously (IV) on days 1, 3, and 5. Azacitidine will be administered at 2.5 
mg/kg/dose IV once daily on days 1-5. On days 1, 3, and 5 when both drugs are 
administered, azacitidine will be administered first followed by MLN4924 ( pevonedistat)
infusion. The infusion of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) will begin between 30-60 minutes after 
completion of IV azacitidine. Following completion of azacitidine and MLN4924 
(pevonedistat), fludarabine 1 mg/ kg/dose IV once daily and cytarabine 67mg/kg/dose IV
once daily will be administered on days 6-10. Cytarabine infusion will begin 4 hours after 
the start of fludarabine.
Patients without additional evidence of CNS disease (CNS1) do not require additional 
CNS-directed therapy during the cycles. Patients with blasts detected in the CNS (CNS2/3) will receive additional intrathecal chemotherapy with IT cytarabine orIT triple therapy 
(cytarabine, hydrocortisone, methotrexate) per institutional standards at a schedule of 
2x/weekly until the CNS is clear of blasts on 2 consecutive LPs, with a minimum of 4 IT 
cytarabi neor IT triple (ITT) doses administered.

NOTE : Central venous access in the form of a double lumen Broviac or Hickman is highly 
recommended.  
 
*For patients with CNS 2/3 status, IT cytarabine or ITT should be administered 2x/weekly until the CNS is clear of blasts on 2 
consecutive LPs, with a minimum of 4 IT cytarabine /IT triple doses administered.  This should begin on Day 8 and should be 
repeated  2x/weekly with not less than 3 days between doses , thus any necessary subsequent doses should be given starting on 
Day 11 . Days of therapy may vary depending on scheduling.  
 
 
A cycle of therapy is considered to be 35 days.  A cycle may be repeated for a total of 2 
cycles , up to a total duration of therapy of approximately 4 months.  
 
Drug doses of MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ), azacitidine, fludarabine, and cytarabine should be 
adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and weight measured within 7 days prior 
to the beginning of each cycle.  Drug doses of intrathecal cytarabine and intrathecal triples 
should be based on the age at the time of administration.   
 
See Appendix VII I for Therapy Delivery Maps for each cycle.

5.3 Criteria for Starting Cycle 2Patients may proceed to cycle 2 following completion of cycle 1 disease assessment if 
stable or greater response and if non-he matologic toxicities probably or definitely related 
to MLN4924 (pevonedistat) recover to < grade 2. Bilirubin, ALT, and AST must be 
< Grade 1 or at the patient’s baseline values prior to starting Cycle 2.
NOTE: See Appendix III for Toxicity Specific Grading.
•Patients will have disease assessment on Day 36-39 of Cycle 1.  If a bone marrow aspirate cannot be evaluated (dry tap, no spicules), a follow-up bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed within 2 weeks to assess cellularity and response. 
•If aspirate and/or biopsy results indicate hypocellular marrow (<10% cellularity on biopsy), then continue to repeat bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy not less than 
once every 14 days until response can be assessed.
•If count recovery is noted within 14 days of an unevaluable marrow, there is no 
need to repeat the marrow to confirm response. 
•If the patient meets criteria for CR, CRp, or CRi after Cycle 1 then the patient can proceed to Cycle 2 (See Section 12.2 for definitions of response)
•If the bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy performed after Cycle 1 reveals > 5% 
but < 25% blasts, then the patient should proceed to Cycle 2 of chemotherapy
5.4 DosingSchema
Dose Confirmation Schema
The starting dose will be 20 mg/m2for patients > 1 year of age (Dose Level 1) 
with dose levels for subsequent groups of patients as follows:
                    ADVL1 712
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY ,SEE PAGE 1FOR USAGE POLICY
Version Date: 08 /27/2020 27
Dose Level MLN 4924 ( Pevonedistat )Dose (mg/m2)
-1 15 mg/m2
1* 20 mg/m2
* Starting Dose Level
The starting dose will be 15 mg/m2for patients < 1 year of age (Dose Level 1) with 
dose levels for subsequent groups of patients as follows: 
Dose Level MLN4924 (Pevonedistat) Dose (mg/m2)
-1 10 mg/m2
1* 15 mg/m2
* Starting Dose Level
There will be no escalations beyond Dose Level 1 ( 20 mg/m2), as adult studies 
examining doses higher than 20 mg/m2observed excess toxicity without any 
apparent disease benefit and no significant differences in pharmacokinetic 
parameters to suggest significant increase in efficacy.24
If the maximally tolerated dose ( MTD ) has been exceeded at the first dose level, 
then the subsequent cohort of patients will be treated at Dose Level -1. If Dose 
Level -1 is not well tolerated, further de-escalation will not occur. The study will be closed to accrual.
Intra-Patient Escalation
Intra-patient dose escalation is not allowed. 
5.5 Grading of Adverse Events
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can 
be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). Any 
suspected or confirmed dose-limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Study Chair.
5.6 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely attributable to protocol therapy.  The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose-confirmation will be the first cycle of therapy.
Dose limiting hematological and non-hematological toxicities are defined differently.  
Non-hematological dose-limiting toxicity:
5.6.1.1 All Grade 3 or greater non-hematological toxicity not clearly related to the 
underlying disease and attributable to protocol therapy will be considered 
a DLT except :
•Grade 3 or 4 elevation of ALT/AST that returns to Grade < 1 within 
14 days. NOTE: For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT is 
defined as 45 U/L regardless of baseline and for AST is defined as 50 
U/L regardless of baseline. See Appendix III for values that represent 
thresholds between CTCAE grades.

Version Date: 08 /27/2020 28
•Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities that resolve, with or without 
supplementation intervention, to < Grade 2 within 72 hours. 
Electrolyte supplementation is encouraged. 
•Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgia that returns to Grade ≤ 2 within 5 days on 
analgesics
•Grade 3 or 4 fever, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without 
hospitalization
•Grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome
•Alopecia
•Grade 3 maculo-papular or morbiliform rash that resolves to < Grade 
2 within 7 days
•Grade 3 mucositis that resolves (with or without supportive care) to <
Grade 2 within 14 days
•Grade 3 fatigue oranorexia responsive to supportive care within 7 
days
•Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea responsive to supportive care within 72 hours
•Early intervention with TPN or enteral tube feeding for anorexia, nausea, or concern for poor nutritional status
Hematological dose-limiting toxicity:
Hematological dose limiting toxicity attributable to protocol therapy is defined as failure to recover to a peripheral ANC > 500/m
3and platelets > 20,000/mm2by 50 
days from the start of fludarabine and cytarabine administration, not due to presence of leukemia or severe infection (defined as Grade > 3).
oNOTE: Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia will not be considered a dose-
limiting toxicity
6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS
The Study Chair must be notified of any dosage modification. Patients may receive up to 2 
cycles of chemotherapy.
6.1 Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity
Patients who experience a hematologic dose limiting toxicity (see Section 5.6.2 ), 
defined as failure to recover peripheral ANC > 500/uL and non-transfusion 
dependent platelet count > 20,000/uL due to documented bone marrow 
aplasia/hypoplasia (not due to malignant infiltration or Grade 3 infection) for greater than or equal to 50 days from the start of fludarabine and cytarabine 
administration, will be allowed to proceed at the discretion of the treating 
physician and study chair with cycle 2 at MLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose level -1.The patient’s dose for azacitidine, fludarabine, and cytarabine will remain unchanged. 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Non-Hematological Toxicity
Patients will have ALT/AST/bilirubin evaluated prior to each planned dose of 
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in order to determine whether the scheduled dose

approximately 48 hours following the end of the 1stMLN4924 (pevonedistat)
infusion. NOTE: See Appendix III for toxicity grading table.
If a patient experiences > Grade 3 elevation of ALT/AST on or after Cycle 1, Day 1 then the Cycle 1, Day 3 MLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose should not be given. If 
ALT/AST returns to < Grade 1 or baseline values by Day 5 then the patient should 
receive their Day 5 MLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose and this will not be considered 
a DLT. If ALT/AST does not return to < Grade 1 or baseline values by Day 5 then
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) should be held and this will be considered a DLT. 
Persistent elevations of ALT/AST > Grade 2 beyond 2 days between any other 
doses after Cycle 1, Day 1 will be considered a DLT.     
Patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity during cycle 1 that resolves to baseline or < Grade 1 at the time of next cycle can proceed with the next cycle at 
dose level -1.
6.3 Modifications and Supportive Care Recommendations for Toxicity Related to Protocol Therapy (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2) 
Neurological Toxicity
The most common neurotoxicity related to fludarabine or cytarabine administration is an acute cerebellar syndrome that may manifest itself as ataxia, nystagmus, or dysarthria. However, seizures and encephalopathy have also occurred following therapy with high dose cytarabine. Patients experiencing Grade 
3 or 4 cerebellar toxicity should be removed from protocol therapy.
Ara-C Syndrome including Fever, Rash, or Conjunctivitis
Do not withhold cytarabine for fever if it is likely to have been caused by the 
cytarabine. However, blood cultures should be obtained even if fever is thought to be likely due to cytarabine. Institution of antibiotics for fever associated with cytarabine infusion is at the discretion of the treating physician (see fever 
management recommendations in the COG Supportive Care Guidelines).
For rash or conjunctivitis, withhold cytarabine for Grade 3-4 toxicity until resolved 
to ≤ Grade 1. Make up missed doses and consider concurrent treatment with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone, and/or with dexamethasone ophthalmic drops 
for conjunctivitis only.
Renal Toxicity
6.3.3.1 Cytarabine 
Patients with nephrotoxicity secondary to antibiotics, or antifungals, may 
have prolonged excretion of cytarabine leading to more severe marrow and 
extramedullary toxicity. 
•Patients with a serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL or > 2x normal for age 
should be hydrated orally or intravenously. Following hydration, the patient must have a creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m² as 
measured preferably by a nuclear GFR scan, timed urine collection for 
                    ADVL1 712
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY ,SEE PAGE 1FOR USAGE POLICY
Version Date: 08 /27/2020 30
creatinine clearance, or calculated by the Schwartz formula before 
proceeding with cytarabine therapy.
•If the creatinine clearance is abnormal (< 60mL/min/1.73m2) then 
Cycle 2 high dose cytarabine should be reduced by 50% for each daily 
dose. With this approach, previous research has shown the prevention 
of subsequent neurotoxicity in recipients of high dose cytarabine in 
the face of renal insufficiency.25
6.3.3.2 Fludarabine 
Renal clearance accounts for about 40% of the total body clearance of fludarabine and clearance of the primary active metabolite is decreased in patients with renal impairment. Renal elimination appears to become more 
important at high dosages of the drug. The dose of fludarabine needs to be 
adjusted in patients with moderate renal impairment. The following are suggested guidelines for dose adjustment of fludarabine in renal impairment :
GFR > 50 mL/minute/1.73m
2: no adjustment required
GFR 30-50 mL/minute/1.73m2: administer 80% of the dose
GFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73m2: not recommended
Hemodialysis: administer 25% of the dose
Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD): not recommendedContinuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): Administer 80% of dose
26
Hand-Foot Syndrome 
Hand-foot syndrome has been reported in patients treated with high-dose 
cytarabine. Patients who develop hand-foot syndrome may receive topical 
emollients (such as Aquaphor) as well as topical or systemic steroids or antihistamines if appropriate. Oral administration of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can 
also be used for these patients- BSA < 0.5 m
2: 50 mg per day; BSA 0.5-1.0 m2: 
100 mg per day; BSA 1.1-1.5 m2: 200 mg per day, and BSA > 1.5 m2: 300 mg per 
day.
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose modification for hepatic toxicity:
AST, ALT, and bilirubin should be checked and read prior to each dose of 
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and then weekly.
If a patient experiences > Grade 3 elevation of ALT/AST/bilirubin that does not 
return to < Grade 1 or baseline prior to the next dose of MLN4924 (pevonedistat), 
the dose will be held and this will be considered a DLT. However, patients can still receive azacitidine as scheduled and can receive subsequent fludarabine and 
cytarabine if ALT > Grade 3 after discussion with study chair. NOTE: See 
Appendix III for values that represent thresholds between CTCAE grades.
Patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity during cycle 1 that resolves to 
baseline or < Grade 1 at the time of next cycle can proceed with the next cycle at 
dose level -1.

Version Date: 08/27/2020    31 
7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT  THERAPY  
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunother apy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these 
treatments are administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
7.2 Investigational Agents  
No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary . See Section 7.5 for drugs that should not be used 
concomitantly due to potential interactions with  MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ). For COG 
Supportive Care Guidelines see: https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/cog -
supportive -care-guidelines  under Standard Sections for Protocols.  
 
The use of GCSF is not required on this protocol, however filgrastim or biosimilar  can be 
initiated per  discretion of the treating physician  in the setting of serious confirmed ( culture 
proven ) or suspicious infection . The use of filgrastim (G -CSF) or biosimilar is allowed at 
the treating physician’s discretion to enhance neutrophil recovery when clinically  
indicated. If the treating physician determines that filgrastim use is indicated in Cycle 1, 
the pegylated formulation (pegfilgrastim) should not be used.  
 
Pneumocystis Jirovecii  pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis:  Patients should  receive PJP 
prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 5 mg/kg/day divided BID (max: 160 mg 
PO BID)  for 2-3 consecutive days a week, or per institutional practice, until the end of 
protocol therapy.  
 
Antifungal prophylaxis  
Antifungal agents per institutional gui delines should be administered when ANC falls 
below 200/µL and continued until count recovery.  See Section 7.4.2  on CYP3A4 inducers 
and inhibitor s for guidelines regarding concurrent administration with MLN4924 
(pevo nedistat ).  
 
Hospitalization/Hospital Environment  
Hospitalization following each cycle of chemotherapy is strongly recommended  until the 
absolute phagocyte count (sum of the neutrophils, bands and monocytes) rises for 2 
successive days, and the patient is afebrile and clinically stable. An additional discharge 
criterion of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 200/µL is also suggested.  
 
It is recommended that patients should be assigned to rooms with special air filtration 
systems such as high effi ciency particulate air filters (HEPA) or clean -air rooms with 
constant positive pressure airflow if at all possible.  
 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) should be considered for patients at risk of 
developing rapid tumor lysis (e.g., patients with a high tumor burden or a higher number 
of circulating malignant cells). These patients should be followed closely and appropriate 
laboratory monitoring performed. Appropriate medical therapy should be provided for 
                    ADVL1 712
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY ,SEE PAGE 1FOR USAGE POLICY
Version Date: 08 /27/2020 32
patients who develop signs and symptoms consistent with rapid tumor lysis. 
7.4 Concomitant Medications
Corticosteroids should not be used as anti-emetic therapy. Corticosteroid 
therapy is not permissible except for the following indications: 
• As treatment or prophylaxis for anaphylactic reactions
• Asa treatment for symptoms of ARA-C syndrome including fever, rash, 
or conjunctivitis (see Section 6.3.2 )
• Suspected or confirmed adrenal insufficiency
In vitro, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 
with a small contribution from CYP2D6. Based on drug-drug interaction study 
results, administration of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors is permitted, while use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be discontinued 
within 14 days prior to the first dose of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and are 
prohibited for the duration of the study (see Appendix IX ).
Concomitant administration of BCRP inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, eltrombopag) should be avoided, however, limited use is permitted if clinically necessary and no suitable alternative exists. In this case, a patient may receive the BCRP 
inhibitor from 24 hours after the last MLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose until 72 
hours before the next MLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose. 
Acetaminophen and acetaminophen-containing products may be used judiciously 
but should not exceed a dose of 37 mg/kg/day (maximum 2 g in 24 hours) on days MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is administered. 
8.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED
8.1 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluation
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days 
prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated. Laboratory values used to assess eligibility 
(see Section 4.0 ) must be no older than seven (7) days at the start of therapy.  Laboratory 
tests need notbe repeated if therapy starts within seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess 
eligibility.  If a post-enrollment lab value is outside the limits of eligibility, or laboratory
values are older than 7 days, then the following laboratory evaluations must be re-checked 
within 48 hours prior to initiating therapy: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) 
and serum  creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not 
receive protocol therapy and will be considered off protocol therapy. Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy, must beobtained within 14 days prior to start of protocol therapy. See 
Appendix VIII for Therapy Delivery Maps for each cycle.

Structure and molecular weight
Molecular formula: C 21H26ClN5O4S
Molecular weight: 443.52 (free base)
479.98 (hydrochloride salt)
Mode of Action:  MLN4924 (p evonedistat )is an inhibitor of neural precursor cell 
expressed development down -regulated 8 (NEDD8) -activating enzyme or NAE.  
NAE is essential in the NEDD8 -conjugation pathway to control the activity of a 
subset of multiprotein complexes that transfer NEDD8 molecules to protein substrates by E3 ligases.  NAE inhibitors stop the degradation of a subset of proteins thatareregulated by the proteasomes.
Supplied by:
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is supplied by Takeda Pharmaceuticals and distributed

by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI.
Formulation
The agent is supplied as a single-use 50 mg or 44 mg vial containing 10 mg/mL
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) (free base , equivalent t o 10.8 mg/mL MLN4924 
[pevonedistat HCl] )in an aqueous solution of citric acid (anhydrous), trisodium 
citrate dihydrate, and Betadex Sulfobutyl Ether Sodium (Captisol ) at pH 3.3. 
Each USP Type I glass vial nominally contains 5 mL or 4. 4 mL of compounded 
sterile solution, sealed with a fluoropolymer -coated butyl rubber stopper and 
oversealed with an aluminum seal and a plastic cap.
Storage
Vials of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) are to be kept dry and refrigerated at 2 °-8°C 
(36°–46°F) until dilution and use. Pevonedistat vials should be kept in their 
original carton until time of use. If original carton is not available, wrap vials in 
aluminum foil or similar light protective cover to protect from light. MLN4924 (pevonedistat) injection is stable at ambient temperature for 6 hours before dilution. Return vials to refrigerator if vial (s)arenot to be used within 6 hours after 
removing from the refrigerator. All investigational supplies are to be kept in a secure 
area with controlled access.
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return MLN4924 
(pevonedistat) to 2 °-8°C (36°–46°F) and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a 
detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature 
monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov for 
determination of suitability.
Solution Preparation
To prepare the agent for administration dilute MLN4924 (pevonedistat) injection
in 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride . The vial must not be shaken at any time 
during dose preparation. Before use, bring MLN4924 ( pevonedistat )vials to ambient 
room temperature (15 °–30°C / 59 °–86°F).  Do not use a water bath to warm up 
the vials. 
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is a cytotoxic anticancer drug. As with other potentially 
toxic compounds, caution should be exercised when handling MLN4924 
(pevonedistat) injection. Refer to institutional guidelines regarding the proper 
handling and disposal of cytotoxic agents.
•The specified number of MLN4924 ( pevonedistat) vials should be 
removed and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to dilution. The vial must not be shaken at any time during dose preparation.For the pevonedistat packaged 10 vials per carton, two recommendations to protect the vial(s) from light (1 or 2 dispensed per cycle day) are: 
oUse a spare carton in the pharmacy and put the vial(s) in it 
oWrap vial(s) in aluminum foil
•Using aseptic technique, the appropriate volume of drug should be withdrawn from vial(s), then injected into a nIV bag containing 5% 
dextrose solution or 0.9% sodium chloride (QS to a final volume of 100 
mL), and then gently inverted repeatedly to mix.

•For volume-restricted infants, a 20-fold dilution in 5% dextrose or 0.9% 
sodium chloride can be used to achieve the smallest possible volume. For 
example, to deliver 20 mg/m2dose of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) to an 
infant with a BSA of 0.5 m2, withdraw 1 mL (10 mg) of MLN4924 
(pevonedistat) solution from the vial and further dilute in 20 mL of 5%dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride for administration.
•Inspect the prepared solution to ensure it is clear and free of visible 
particles. 
•The MLN4924 ( pevonedistat) prepared IV bag must be used within 6 
hours (time to the end of an infusion) if stored at ambient temperature. 
•The bag, needle, and syringe must be disposed of in a proper biohazard 
container.
•Use of non-DEHP IV bags, non-DEHP tubing with Teflon or polyurethane catheter and stainless steel needle, and non-DEHP solution set is preferred.
Stability
Stability studies are ongoing. 
•The prepared IV solution is stable when stored at ambient room temperature up to 6 hours and must be administered within that time frame. Discard the IV bag if > 6 hours from the time of preparation.
•The prepared IV solution is stable when stored at 2
0–80C (360–460F) 
up to 18 hours. The IV solution can be brought to ambient room 
temperature before administering to patient, but must be used within 3 
hours from the time it is removed from the refrigerator to completion of the IV infusion. Discard the IV bag if > 3 hours. 
Administration
See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol.
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) will be administered intravenously over 60 minutes. MLN4924 (pevonedistat) should be administered through central or peripheral venous access. The use of in-line filter is NOT necessary for administration. Protecting IV bag from light during infusion is not required. The infusion may be 
slowed or stopped for any associated infusion-related reactions per institutional 
standards. All infusion times must be recorded. The total time from drug reconstitution to end of infusion must not exceed 6 hours. Doses of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) must be separated by at least 1 full calendar day. Infusion line should be flushed with 5% Dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride immediately after 
IV administration is complete.
Potential drug interactions
Acetaminophen may be used judiciously but should not exceed a dose of 37 mg/kg/day (maximum 2 gin 24 hours) on days MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is 
administered.
In vitro, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is metabolized via hydroxylation and 
oxidation, predominantly by CYP3A4 with a small contribution from CYP2D6 (approximately 3%). Based on drug-drug interaction study results, the 
administration of MLN4924 ( pevonedistat) with moderate and strong CYP3A 
inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors is permitted, while the use of strong CYP3A

inducers should be avoided .
In vitro, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) does not inhibit the activities of CYP1A2, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5, but weakly and reversibly inhibits both CYP2B6 
and 2C8; it does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4/5. Thus, MLN4924 
(pevonedistat) is unlikely to affect the PK of drugs that are metabolized by these CYP450 isoforms.
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is also a substrate for the drug efflux transporters, P-gp 
and BCRP, and a weak inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP-mediated transport. Additional in vitro transport studies showed that MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is not a substrate of the hepatic OATP, but it can inhibit OATP-mediated uptake of E3S and simvastatin and lovastatin. On the basis of these data and the recommended clinical 
dose range, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is unlikely to affect the PK of other drugs 
that are known P-gp, BCRP, or OATP substrates, while the potential exists, albeit low, for drug interactions with BCRP inhibitors. Exclusion of P-gp inhibitors is 
not deemed warranted in clinical studies of MLN4924 (pevonedistat). However, the concomitant administration of BCRP inhibitors ( e.g., cyclosporine, eltrombopag) 
should be avoided, however, limited use is permitted if clinically necessary and no suitable alternative exists. In this case, a patient may receive the BCRP inhibitor from 24 hours after the lastMLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose until 72 hours before the next 
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) dose. 
Patient Care Considerations
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2or 
higher) based on the results of a population PK analysis. The effect of severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) on MLN4924 
(pevonedistat) PK has not been studied. Avoid use of MLN4924 (pevonedistat)in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. 
The effect of hepatic impairment on MLN4924 (pevonedistat) PK has not been 
studied.

9.2 Azacitidine – Injection
(Vidaza®, 5 -azacitidine) NSC# 102816
(09/09/19)
Source and Pharmacology
Azacitidine (4-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-s-triazin-2(1H)-one) is an analog of the 
naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, cytidine. It differs from cytidine in 
having nitrogen in the 5-position of the heterocyclic ring. This substitution renders 
the ring chemically unstable and leads to rapid decomposition of the compound in 
                    ADVL1 712

Version Date: 08 /27/2020 45
neutral or alkaline solution. Therefore, for SC or IV administration, the drug is
supplied as a lyophilized powder to be reconstituted immediately prior to use.
Azacitidine was developed based on its strong in vitro and in vivo antileukemic 
activity at cytotoxic concentrations, and its differentiation-inducing potential at 
lower concentrations in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines. The 
cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may be due to inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of DNA damage pathways, through incorporation into ribonucleic acid (RNA) and DNA, respectively. The ability of azacitidine to cause differentiation is attributed to its activity as a hypomethylating agent. Similar to cancer cells, the disturbed maturation of morphologically dysplastic hematopoietic cells in MDS is 
thought to reflect a block in their differentiation, resulting in accumulation of these 
precursors in the bone marrow in spite of low peripheral blood counts. This block in maturation (differentiation), with proliferation of preleukemic myeloblasts, provides a rationale for clinical trials of DNA methylation inhibitors (eg, azacitidine) in the treatment of MDS.
Pharmacokinetic studies using 14C-radiolabeled azacitidine to evaluate drug 
disposition demonstrated that azacitidine undergoes rapid and complete absorption following SC administration, with SC bioavailability greater than 70% and maximum concentration (Cmax) achieved 0.5 to 2 hours after dosing. The volume of distribution of azacitidine is 76 ± 26 L following IV administration. Its protein 
binding in human serum is low (< 10% bound). Azacitidine and/or its metabolites 
are cleared by the kidneys. The plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) is 3.4 to 6.2 hours and amount of radioactivity recovered in urine (50% to 98% of administered dose) were similar after IV and SC dosing.
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that spontaneous hydrolysis of 
azacitidine is the major pathway in different species, regardless of the route of administration. Azacitidine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYPs) and it will not produce clinically relevant PK drug-drug interactions due to CYP enzyme inhibition or induction when coadministered with CYP substrates, inducers, or inhibitors. Azacitidine is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
is unlikely to produce any clinically relevant interactions as a P-gp substrate or an 
inhibitor.

associated.
Formulation and Stability
Azacitidine is supplied as lyophilized powder in 100 mg single-use vials without antibacterial preservatives. Store unreconstituted vials at 25° C (77° F); excursions 
permitted to 15°-30° C (59°-86° F).
For IV administration: Reconstitute vial with 10 mL SWFI to form a 10 mg/mL 
solution; vigorously shake or roll vial until solution is dissolved and clear. Mix in 
50 to 100 mL of NS or lactated Ringer's injection for infusion. For infants and 
small children, azacitidine can be diluted in volumes less than 50 mL to a final 
concentration between 0.9 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL. The reconstituted product may be stored at 25° C (77° F), but the administration of the intravenous solution must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Solutions for IV administration 
have very limited stability and must be prepared immediately prior to each 
dose.
Azacitidine is incompatible with 5% Dextrose solutions, Hespan, or solutions that 
contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine and should therefore be avoided.

9.3 Cytarabine
(07/13/1 5)
(Cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C, Cytosar®) NSC #63878
Source and Pharmacology 
Cytarabine appears to act through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been 
reported. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA 
synthesis (S-phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S-phase. Cytarabine is metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to the nucleotide triphosphate (Ara-CTP), an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Ara-CTP is inactivated by a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which converts it to the nontoxic uracil derivative (Ara-U). 
It appears that the balance of kinase and deaminase levels may be an important 
factor in determining sensitivity or resistance of the cell to cytarabine. It has an initial distributive phase t½ of about 10 minutes, with a secondary elimination phase t½ of about 1 to 3 hours. Peak levels after intramuscular or subcutaneous 
administration of cytarabine occur about 20 to 60 minutes after injection and are 
lower than IV administration. Intrathecally administered doses are metabolized 
and eliminated more slowly with a t½ of about 2 hours.

9.4 Fludarabine 
(01/10/18)
(Fludara®, fludarabine phosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-AMP) NSC# 312887
Source and Pharmacology: 
Fludarabine phosphate is a synthetic purine nucleoside. It differs from the physiologic nucleosides, adenosine, in that the sugar moiety is arabinose instead of ribose, and by the addition of a fluorine atom to the purine base adenine. Fludarabine is also a fluorinated nucleotide analog the antiviral agent vidarabine, (ara-A) . The addition of fluorine results in increased aqueous solubility and 
resistance to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase. Fludarabine 
                     ADVL1 712 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY   
 
Version Date: 08/27/2020    53 
(2-fluoro -ara-A) is commercially available as the monophosphate salt (2 -fluoro -
ara-AMP). The monophosphorylation increases the drug's aqueous solubility while 
maintaining pharmacologic activity. The chemical name for fludarabine phosphate 
is 9H -Purin -6-amine, 2 -fluoro -9-(5-0-phosphono β -D-arabino -furanosyl) (2 -
fluoro -ara-AMP) and the molecular weight is 365.2.  
 
Fluda rabine is a purine antagonist antimetabolite. In vivo , fludarabine phosphate is 
rapidly dephosphorylated  to 2 -fluoro -ara-A and then it is phosphorylated 
intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2 -fluoro -ara-
ATP. This metabolite appears to act by inhibiting DNA polymerase alpha, 
ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thus inhibit ing DNA synthesis. The 
mechanism of action of this antimetabolite is not completely characterized and 
may be multi -faceted.  
 
Phase I studies in humans have demonstrated that within several minutes after 
intravenous infusion, fludarabine phosphate is conver ted to the active metabolite, 
2-fluoro -ara-A and becomes undetectable. Therefore, pharmacokinetics studies 
have focused on 2 -fluoro -ara-A. Fludarabine phosphate 25  mg/m2 
infused 
intravenously over 30  minutes to adult cancer patients, showed a moderate 
accumulation of 2 -fluoro -ara-A. During a 5 -day treatment schedule, 2 -fluoro -ara-
A plasma trough levels increased by a factor of about 2.  
 
Fludarabine is widely distributed. The volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) 
reported after daily administration of 25  mg/m2 for 5  days to adults averaged at 96 -
98 L/m2. Tissue distribution studies in animals indicate that the highest 
concentrations of the drug are in liver, kidney, and spleen. Although the extent to 
which fludarabine and/or its metabo lites distribute into the CNS in humans has not 
been determined to date, severe neurologic toxicity (e.g., blindness, coma) has 
been reported in patients receiving the drug, particularly in high dosages. There is 
evidence from animal studies that fludarabi ne distributes into the CNS and that a 
toxic metabolite (2 -fluoroadenine, possibly formed by bacteria in the GI tract), can 
be absorbed systematically via enterohepatic circulation and distributed into CSF. 
According to in vitro  data, about 19 -29% of fludarabine is bound to plasma 
proteins.  
 
Following IV administration, fludarabine phosphate is dephosphorylated rapidly 
to fludarabine. Plasma concentrations of fludarabine decline in a linear, dose -
independent manner. The eliminati on profile of fludarabine also has been reported 
to be either biphasic or triphasic; however, reported terminal elimination half -lives 
have been similar. In adult cancer patients receiving fludarabine 25  mg/m2 as a 
30-minute IV infusion daily for 5  days, a  terminal half -life of about 20  hours was 
reported. In a limited number of pediatric patients, the plasma concentration profile 
of fludarabine exhibited both monoexponential and biexponential decay, with a 
mean t 1/2 of 10.5 hours in patients with monoexpon ential elimination and a t 1/2 of 
1.2-1.4 and 12.4 -19 hours, respectively, in patients with biexponential elimination.  
 
Renal clearance accounts for about 40% of the total body clearance of fludarabine. 
Renal elimination appears to become more important at high dosages of the drug. 
The dose of fludarabine needs to be adjusted in patients with moderate renal 
impairment.

Source and Pharmacology
The intrathecal route of administration of a drug produces more consistent CSF 
drug concentrations at relatively smaller doses because of the volume difference between the CSF and blood compartments (140 mL vs. 3500 mL in an adult). (The 
CSF volume of children after the first 3 years is equivalent to that of an adult). 
Drug half-lives are longer as well because clearance is related to flow rather than metabolism or protein binding. Intrathecal methotrexate has a biphasic elimination curve from the CSF with a t
½of 4.5 and 14 hours respectively. Following I T 
injection of cytarabine the elimination of the drug from the CSF is biphasic with a 
t½of 1 and 3.4 hours respectively which is 8-fold longer than the clearance from 
plasma. The elimination of hydrocortisone is similarly prolonged.

Patients who are removed from  protocol therapy during Cycle 1 should continue  to 
have  the required observations in Section 8.1  until the originally planned end of the 
cycle or until all adverse events have resolved per Section 13.4.4 , whichever happens 
LATER. The only exception  is with documentation of the patient’s withdrawal of 
consent . Patients who are removed from protocol therapy in subsequent cycles should 
have the necessary observations to ensure adequate clinical care.  
 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be fo llowed until they meet the criteria for Off 
Study (see below). Ongoing adverse events, or adverse events that emerge after the patient 
is removed from protocol therapy, but within 30 days of the last dose of investigational 
agent, must be followed and repo rted via RAVE and CTEP -AERS  (if applicable).  Follow -
up data will be required unless consent is withdrawn.  
 
10.2 Off Study Criteria  
 
a) Thirty days after the last dose of the investigational agent.  
b) The patient does not receive protocol treatment after study enrollment.  
c) Death  
d) Lost to follow -up 
e) Withdrawal of consent for any required observations or data submission.  
f) Enrollment onto another COG therapeutic (anti -cancer) study  
 
 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
A minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 evaluable patients will be  required to complete the 
dose confirmation part of the study using a rolling 6 design. Once the MTD or 
recommended Phase 2 dose has been defined, up to 6 additional patients  may be enrolled 
to acquire PK data in a representative number of young patients (i.e. patients < 12 years 
old).  Therefore, a maximum of 23 patients are anticipated to be enrolled in this study 
allowing for two dose levels, PK expansion, and 20% inevaluabi lity. Review of the 
enrollment rate into previous COG new agent studies indicates that 1 -2 patients per month 
are available, which will permit completion of the study within 12 -23 months.   
 
In the unlikely event that two DLTs of different classes occur, t hen expansion to 12 patients 
at that dose level may be consider ed if ALL of the following conditions are met: 1) one of 
the DLTs does not appear to be dose and/or drug -related, 2) the Adverse Effects are readily 
reversible, 3) the study chair, DVL statisti cian, DVL committee chair or vice chair, and 
IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  (see Section 11.2.2 ). In 
this case, the absolute maximum number of patients would be 38 patients allowing for 12 
patients at each of two dose levels, 6 patients for PK expansion, and 20% inevaluability. 
This would be completed within 19 -38 months.  
 
Given the novelty of this regimen, enhanced monitoring for DLTs will be performed in the 
first 3 patients. If 2 DLTs ar e observed then the dose will be de -escalated to DL -1. If 1 
DLT is observed in the first 2 patients then a period of 30 days must have elapsed between 
the first dose of MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ) in the 3rd patient prior to enrolling the 4th patient.

11.2 Definitions
Evaluable For Adverse Events
Any patient who receives at least 2/3 doses of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) during 
Cycle 1 or who experiences a dose-limiting toxicity is considered evaluable for 
Adverse Events. In addition, for the dose-confirmation portion during Cycle 1, 
patients must receive at least 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines and must have the appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed to be considered evaluable for dose limiting toxicity. Patients who do not have DLT and are not considered evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.
Maximum Tolerated Dose
•The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience DLT (See Section 5.6 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy. 
• In the unlikely event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), AND all of the following conditions are met, expansion of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered: 
•    One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose and/or drug-related
• The Adverse Effects are readily reversible
• The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, 
and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable
•The DLTs observed in the pharmacokinetic (PK) expansion cohort will be counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the RP2D/MTD 
during the dose confirmation portion of the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort of 
patients at the RP2D/MTD (during the dose confirmation plus the PK 
expansion) experience DLT then the MTD will be exceeded. 
11.3 Dose Confirmation and Determination of MTD/RP2D
The rolling six phase 1 trial design will be used for the conduct of this study.
32There is no 
dose escalation beyond DL1 (20 mg/m2); but the R6 logic will be used to determine the 
MTD/RP2D. DL1 will be defined as the RP2D if there are less than or equal to 1 patient(s) with a DLT among up to sixevaluable patients. Otherwise, DL-1 will open to accrual of 
up to six evaluable patients. DL-1 will be defined as the MTD/RP2D if there are less than or equal to 1 patient(s) with a DLT among six evaluable patients. Otherwise, DL-1 will have exceeded the MTD and the study will close to accrual without having defined an 
MTD/RP2D. 
In addition to determination of the RP2D/MTD, a descriptive summary of all toxicities will be reported.

The study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity.  Review of accrual 
to past COG studies of new agents demonstrates the accrual of both genders and all NIH -
identified ethnicities to such studies.  Efforts will be made to extend the accrual to a 
representative population, but in a Phase 1 trial which will accrue a limited number of 
patients, a balance must b e struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on 
the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one 
hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the 
other.  If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are noted, 
accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those 
differences more fully.  
 
11.5 Pharmacokinetic and Response Analysis  
 
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of  MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ) 
will be performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic 
parameters. The PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, 
including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution 
permit).   
 
While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of MLN4924 ( pevonedistat ), 
patients will have disease evaluations performed as indicated in Section 8.1 .  Disease 
response will be assessed according to criteria for patients with AML , and will be reported 
descriptively.  
 
All these analyses  will be descriptive and exploratory  and hypotheses generating in nature .

12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA
12.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ).
12.2 Response Criteria for Patients with Leukemia
Complete Remission (CR)
Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts and adequate marrow cellularity) 
with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery 
of peripheral blood counts (ANC > 1000/uL and platelet count > 100,000/uL). 
Flow cytometry may be useful to distinguish between leukemia and a regenerating bone marrow. There is no requirement for bone marrow cellularity. 
Complete Remission with Partial Recovery of Platelet Count (CRp)
Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts) and no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of ANC > 1000/uL and platelet 
transfusion independence (defined as no platelet transfusions x 1 week).  
Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi): 
Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (<5% blasts) and no evidence of circulating 
blasts or extramedullary disease and with ANC < 1000/uL or platelet count < 
100,000/uL without platelet transfusion independence (defined as no platelet 
transfusions x 1 week). 
Partial Response
Attainment of M2 marrow status (> 5% or < 25% blasts cells and adequate 
cellularity) and at least 50% decrease in bone marrow blast percent from baseline. 
Bone marrow must have adequate cellularity (e.g. > 10% if a biopsy is performed) 
to determine response. PR status will not be included in the calculation of response 
to the regimen. A repeat bone marrow aspiration within 14 days may be required to distinguish between a PR and increased blasts caused by bone marrow regeneration, and is left tothe discretion of the investigator. 
Treatment Failure 
The definition of treatment failure includes: A. An increase in the extent of bone marrow infiltration by leukemic cells (absolute increase of > 20% blasts) OR
B. Development of extramedullary disease (EMD) ORC. M2 marrow that does not qualify for PR status ORD. An M1 marrow with circulating blasts OR
E. > 25% blasts in the bone marrow after Cycle 1 of therapy 
F. Subjects who have persistent CNS disease despite 6 doses of IT cytarabine 
or IT triples

Version Date: 08 /27/2020 62
Relapse 
Morphologic relapse after CR/CRp/CRi is defined as a reappearance of leukemic 
blasts in the peripheral blood or > 5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to 
any other cause (e.g. bone marrow regeneration after therapy). In the setting of 
recent treatment, if there are no circulating blasts and the bone marrow contains 5-
20% blasts, a repeat bone marrow performed at least a week later is necessary to 
distinguish relapse from bone marrow regeneration. Should flow cytometric or molecular analyses suggest relapse (by reappearance of similar immunophenotype or mutation to the original leukemia) in the presence of < 5% blasts or > 5% blasts 
in a regenerating marrow, a repeat bone marrow performed at least a week later is necessary to confirm relapse by morphologic methods. In such instances, the date 
of recurrence is defined as the first date that more than 5% blasts were observed in 
the bone marrow. The reappearance or development of cytogenetically proven extramedullary disease also indicates relapse. Molecular and/or genetic relapse is characterized by reappearance of a cytogenetic or molecular abnormality. 
Unevaluable: 
Aplastic or severely hypocellular marrow. In this instance, marrow evaluation should be repeated weekly until response determination can be made through at least Day 60. 
Bone Marrow Classification: 
M1 is < 5% blastsM2 is 5-25% blastsM3 is > 25% blasts 
12.3 CNS Leukemia at Diagnosis 
CNS 1: In cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), absence of blasts on cytospin 
preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs.
CNS 2: In CSF, presence < 5/ L WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts, or 
≥ 5/L WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm:
CNS 2a: < 10/L RBCs; < 5/ L WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;
CNS 2b: ≥ 10/L RBCs; < 5/ L WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;
CNS 2c: ≥ 10/L RBCs; ≥ 5/ L WBCs and cytospin positive for b lasts but 
negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm (see below).
CNS 3: In CSF, presence of ≥ 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts 
and/or clinical signs of CNS leukemia:
CNS 3a: < 10/L RBCs; ≥ 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;
CNS 3b: ≥ 10/µL RBCs, ≥ 5/µL WBCs and positive by Steinherz/Bleyer 
algorithm (see below);
CNS 3c: Clinical signs of CNS leukemia (such as facial nerve palsy, brain/eye 
involvement or hypothalamic syndrome).
Method of Evaluating Initial Traumatic Lumbar Punctures:
If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is 
traumatic and contains 5 WBC/ L and blasts, the following algorithm should be used to 
distinguish between CNS 2 and CNS 3 disease:

CSF WBC    > 2X   Blood WBC  
CSF RBC               Blood RBC  
A patient with CSF WBC  5/L blasts, whose CSF WBC/RBC is 2X greater than the blood 
WBC/RBC ratio, has CNS disease at diagnosis. Example: CSF WBC = 60/ L; CSF RBC = 
1500/L; blood WBC = 46000/ L; blood RBC = 3.0 X 106/L: 
  60    = 0.04  >  2X     46,000      = 0.015  
1,500                          3.0 X 106 
 
  
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety o f patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the  Case Report Forms  
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade  (severity); and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was 
associated with the event.  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Com mercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event  Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0.  The  
description s and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 5.0 will be 
used for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment area s should have access to a copy 
of the CTCAE version 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov /protocolDev elopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3:  Review Table A in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
                     ADVL1 712 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY   
 
Version Date: 08/27/2020    64 
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements.   
 
NOTE : This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of 
protocol treatment.  Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the 
last dose of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) 
to the agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions  in the 
table  below . Attribution categories are as  follows:  Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Definite.  
 
Table A:  Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events 
that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Administration of the 
Inves tigational Agent/Intervention 1, 2 
 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigat ional agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exist ing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported via CTEP -AERS  within 
the timeframes detailed in the table below.  
Hospitalization Grade 1 and Grade 2 Timeframes  Grade 3 -5 
Timeframes  
Resulting in 
Hospitalization       
≥ 24 hrs  7 Calendar Days  
24-Hour 5 Calendar 
Days  Not resulting in 
Hospitalization       
≥ 24 hrs  Not required  
NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR.  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP -AERS  within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -
hour report.  
o “7 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on th e AE must be submitted  within 7  calendar 
days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by com plete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 7  calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2 For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is  limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
                     ADVL1 712 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY   
 
Version Date: 08/27/2020    65 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates hospitalization (or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be rep orted regardless of attribution and design ation 
as expected or unexpected with t he exception of any events identified as proto col-specific 
expedited  adverse  event  reporting  exclusions.  
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or 
birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs following treatment with an 
agent under a CTEP IND.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial registration 
on all reports.  
 
Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP -AERS  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 1 
Trials Utilizing an Agent under a CTEP -IND or Non -CTEP IND:  
 
• Any death that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment with an investigational 
agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, o r definitely) to the agent and is not clearly due 
to progres sive disease  must be reported via CTEP -AERS  for an agent under a CTEP or non -CTEP 
IND agent per the timelines outlined in the table above.  
• See also the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Re porting (SPEER) in Section 9.1.9  of the 
protocol.   
• Grade 1 -4 mye losuppression (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) do not require expedited 
reporting  
• Grade 1 -2 AST/ALT elevations do not require expedited reporting  
 
As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS  reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospitalization is associated with the recurring AE.  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI via 
the web at  http://ctep.cancer.gov (telephone CTEP  at: 301-897-7497  within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS  24-Hour Notification web -based 
application is unavailable) and by telephone call to the Study Chair . Once internet 
connectivity is restored, a 24 -hour notification phoned in must be entered e lectronically 
into CTEP -AERS  by the original submitter at the site.  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event  (refer to Table A) . 
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must  only use CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers .

Version Date: 08 /27/2020 66
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods 
CTEP-AERS Reporting
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the NCI’s Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System (CTEP-AERS) that can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov .
A CTEP-AERS report must be submitted electronically via the CTEP-AERS Web-
based application located at https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/ . If prompted 
to enter a sponsor email address, please type in: 
PEPCTNAERS@childrensoncologygroup.org .
Send supporting documentation to the NCI by fax (fax # 301- 897-7404) and by 
email to t heADVL1712 COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator .  ALWAYS 
include the ticket number on all faxed and emailed documents .
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events
Note: These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG case report
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP-AERS reporting.
If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported.
If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one course of 
therapy, only the most severe grade should be reported.
The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) grade of the Adverse Effects. 
The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to baseline or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the 
AE decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."  
An adverse event that persists from one course to another should only be reported once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. An adverse 
event which resolves and then recurs during a different course, must be reported 
each course it recurs. 
13.5 Other Recipients of Adverse Event Reports
Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP-AERS reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the CRF
packet (See Section 14.1 ).
COG will forward reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to 
the FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for 
industry sponsored trials).
                    ADVL1 712
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY ,SEE PAGE 1FOR USAGE POLICY
Version Date: 08 /27/2020 67
Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to 
the local policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for oversight of the patient.
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDSAll cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that occur in patients following their chemotherapy for cancer must be reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) via CTEP-AE RS and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm reporting 
requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the completed CTEP-
AERS report within 14 days of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after protocol treatment 
for cancer.
Secondary Malignancy : 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to 
describe the event: 
1)Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])
2)Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
3)Treatment-related secondary malignancy.
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.
Second Malignancy : 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.
13.7 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
Data and safety is ensured by several integrated components including the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. In brief, the role of the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is to protect the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one 
consumer representative; the lead statistician of the developmental therapy 
scientific committee; and a member from the NCI. The DSMC meets at least every 6 months to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC 
from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the 
Phase 1 and 2 DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for working with the study 
                    ADVL1 712
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY ,SEE PAGE 1FOR USAGE POLICY
Version Date: 08 /27/2020 68
statistician to prepare study reports for review by the DSMC. The DSMC will 
provide recommendations to the COG Developmental Therapeutics Chair and the Group Chair for each study reviewed to change the study or to continue the study unchanged. Data and Safety Committee reports for institutional review boards can 
be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web 
site.
Monitoring by the Study Chair and Developmental Therapeutics Leadership 
The study chair will monitor the study regularly and enter evaluations of patients’ 
eligibility, evaluability, and dose limiting toxicities into the study database. In addition, study data and the study chair’s evaluations will be reviewed by the 
Developmental Therapeutics Chair, Vice Chair and Statistician on a weekly 
conference call.
13.8 Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss, and Death Neonatal
When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and emailed to the ADVL1712 COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator along with any additional medical 
information along with any additional medical information. The potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP-AERS report.
Pregnancy
•Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy occurring on study or within 6 months following the last dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP-AERS as
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(Pregnancy)” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions” SOC.
•Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known. If the baby is 
born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP-AERS report is 
required. 
Pregnancy Loss (Fetal Death)
•Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.”
• Any pregnancy loss should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4
“Pregnancy loss” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions” SOC. Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP-AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death. 
Death Neonatal
•Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn deaths occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth” that is felt by the investigator to be at least 
possibly due to the investigational agent/intervention, should be reported expeditiously.
                     ADVL1 712 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY   
 
Version Date: 08/27/2020    69 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “ Death 
neonatal ” under the General disorders and administration SOC  when the 
death is the result of a pat ient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of 
men on study.  
 
• Do NOT report a  neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS 
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is known at interval s 
deemed appropriate by her physicians. The “Pregnancy Information Form” should be used 
for all  necessary  follow -ups. This form is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyRepo
rtForm.pdf . If the baby is born with a birth defect or other anomaly, then a second CTEP -
AERS  report is required.  
 
 
14.0 RECORDS, REPORTING, AND D ATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
14.1 Categories of Research Records  
Research records for this study can be divided into three categories  
 
1. Non-computerized Information:  Therapy Delivery Maps , Pathology Reports, 
Surgical Reports. These forms are uploaded into RAVE .

14.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
Data and safety is ensured by several integrated components including the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. In brief, the role of the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is to protect the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one consumer representative; the lead statistician of the PEP-CTN scientific 
committee; and a member from the NCI. The DSMC meets at least every 6 months to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the Phase 1 and 2 DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for working with the study statistician to prepare study reports for review by the DSMC. The DSMC will provide 
recommendations to the COG PEP-CTN Chair and the Group Chair for each study 
reviewed to change the study or to continue the study unchanged. Data and Safety 
Committee reports for institutional review boards can be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web site.

APPENDIX VI -A: PHARMACO DYNAM ICS (NEDDYLATED PROTEIN ANALYSIS ) STUDY 
BLOOD SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS  
 
Eligible samples:  
 
Sample s should be sent to the Horton lab only if the patient samples meet the following criteria:  
 
1) Eligible patients must have an initial absolute blast count of at least 1000 blasts/µL. To  
 calculate the absolute blast percentage, multiply the total WBC by t he % peripheral blasts:  
 
(WBC)(% blast)(1000) = absolute blast count/µL  
 
As an example, if the patient has a WBC of 10 and 50% blasts, the absolute blast count is:  
    
     (10)(.5)(1000) = 5000/µL  
 
If the initial % blasts is unknown, send samples only if the total WBC is more than 10 and notify the Horton 
lab of the % blast as soon as available (contact info provided below). Sample can be batched, but must be 
received by the Horton lab no later than 72h after collection.   
 
Note: Do not collect NEDD ylated  Protein Analysis samples if minimal residual disease is < 1%.

*Sample Collection: Collect sample in syringe and send samples in Cell  Save tubes (3 mL) and heparin 
tubes (2 mL).  Either lithium heparin or sodium heparin is acceptable. Do NOT use lithium PST (plasma 
separator tubes).  Cell Save tubes should have been received upon study activation by the lead CRA at 
your site. If Cell  Save tubes are not available, the 5  mL can be se nt in Heparin collection tubes. Do NOT 
send only Cell  Save tubes as the proteasome and NF -kB analyses can b e done only in heparin tubes .   
**It is permissible to collect the Day 1, Hour 0 sample after the intrathecal  cytarabine dose.  
 
Shipping Note : Sampl es collected on Friday, Saturday and Sunday can be shipped Monday for Tuesday 
arrival.

• To obt ain more Cell  Save tubes, contact the Horton lab at the numbers provided below.  
• If the Cell  Save tubes are not available, submit entire 5 mL sample in heparin tubes. Note that the 
sample integrity is greatly enhanced by the use of Cell  Save tubes for 3  mL of the 5  mL 
material collected.   
• Each sample should be clearly labeled to include the study number (ADVL1712) as well as the 
treatment ID number and the accession number; along with date and time sample was drawn.  
• Please note the WBC and % blasts on the s pecimen transmittal form below.  
• The institutional immunophenotype report should be FAXed to 832 -825-1206 (or e -mailed) and 
sent attn.: Gaye Jenkins c/o Horton laboratory.  This is a secure FAX and is used only by laboratory 
personnel.  NOTE:  it is acceptable for blood to be collected from a central line.  
 
Shipping Requirements:  
Prior to sample collection, please contact Dr. Horton at (832) 824 -4269 or Gaye Jenkins/Horton lab at (832) 
824-4676 for instructions on shipping. Samples should be shipped in a box with a thick styrofoam container 
(NO clinic -packs).  These containers can be found in your pathology department and are frequently received 
when your department receives antibody shipments.  If you do not have access to these sto rage containers, 
a Thermo -safe box can be mailed to your site by regular mail.  Please contact us before a patient is ready 
to enroll if you require a box for sample shipment. Shipment of boxes/tubes  takes 5 -7 business days and 
will be  sent by USPS.     
 
If Thermo -Safe shipping container is not available:  
• Place collection tubes in a primary container. Wrap each collection tube separately to protect from 
breakage during shipment. Place the container in a thick Styrofoam box.  
• Please place an ice pack around the primary container. During the non -winter months (year round 
except Christmas Day in Texas) (other parts of the country: April -October) add additional ice 
packs  to the Styrofoam box to assure the samples stays cold during shipment.  
• Package sample as ap propriate for biologic material.  
 
For all samples, including those in ThermoSafe containers:  
• Include ice packs in the ThermoSafe container in the space provided.  
• Include a copy of the Specimen Transmittal Form with each shipment.  
• If possible, please FAX th e bone marrow immunophenotype report with the first peripheral 
blood sample.  If this is not possible, please send the report that day via fax (832 825 -1206) or 
email to Dr. Horton at tmhorton@txch.org and Gaye Jenkins at gnjenkin@txch.org (Please strip 
HPI identifiers)  
• Ship the sample by Federal Express Priority Overnight delivery to:

Drug(s):  MLN4924  
(Pevonedistat)  
 
Please show this paper to all your healthcare providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, 
pharmacists), and tell them you are taking part in a clinical trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.  
 
These are the things that your healthcare providers need to know:  
MLN4924 (pevonedistat) interacts with certain specific enzyme in your liver or other tissue like the gut and 
certain transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of cell.  
 
 Explanation  
CYP 
isoenzymes  The enzymes in question are CYP3A4/5.  MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is broken down by 
CYP3A4/5 and may be affected by drugs that are moderate or strong inducers of 
CYP3A4/5.  Use of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., St. Jo hn’s Wort, rifampin, phenytoin) is 
not allowed while ta king MLN4924.  
 
Transport 
proteins  The transporter enzymes and proteins in question are P -glycoprotein (P -gp), OATP and 
BCRP.  MLN4924 is moved in and out of cells/organs by P -gp and BCRP.  Use caution 
with concomitant drugs that are inhibitors of P -gp.  C oncurrent use of drugs that are 
BCRP inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) is not allowed.   MLN4924 may affect the ability 
of other drugs to be moved in and out of cells by inhibiting P -gp, OATP and BCRP.  
Use substrates of these transport proteins with caution . 
 
These are the things that you need to know:  
The study drug  MLN4924 (pevonedistat) , may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. For 
this reason, it is very important to tell your doctors about all your medicines, including: (a) medicines you 
are taking before  this clinical trial, (b) medicines you start or stop taking during this study , (c) medicines 
you buy without a prescription (over -the-counter remedy) , (d) herbals or supplements (e.g. St. John’s Wort) . 
It is helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you.  
 
Before you enroll onto the clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health care providers 
to review any medicines and herbal supplements that are considered moderate or strong inhibitors or 
inducers of CYP3A4/5, P -gp, OATP and BCRP.  
 
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may contain 
ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctors or pharmacist to 
determine if there could be any side  effects. Avoid ingesting grapefruit and grapefruit juice.  
• Make sure your doctor knows to avoid certain prescription medications.  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or call your 
study doctor before prescr ibing any new medicine or discontinuing any medicine.

including but not limited to the following:  
• An active Federal Wide Assuranc e (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization  
• A valid IRB approval  
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements . 
 
In addition, the site -protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572  
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by t he CIRB for this study are not required 
to submit IRB approval documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office. For sites using the CIRB, IRB 
approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process. Signatory 
Institutions  must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager 
to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated 
to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for the SSW approval  to be processed, the Signatory Institution 
must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are 
participating in the study.  
 
Requirements F or ADVL1 712 Site Registration:  
 
• IRB approval (For sites not participatin g via the NCI CIRB; local IRB documentation, an IRB -signed 
CTSU IRB Certification Form, Protocol of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB 
Certification/Declaration of Exemption Form, or combination is accepted )  
• For applicable studies with a radiatio n and/or imaging (RTI) component, the enrolling site must be 
aligned to a RTI provider.  To manage provider associations access the Provider Association tab on 
the CTSU website at https://www. ctsu.org/RSS/RTFProviderAssociation , to add or remove 
associated providers.  Sites must be linked to at least one IROC credentialed provider to participate on 
trials with an RT component. Enrolling sites are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate 
agreements are in place with their RTI provider, and that appropriate IRB approvals are in place.   
 
Submitting Regulatory Documents:  
Submit required forms and documents  to the CTSU Regulatory Office, where they will be entered and 
tracked in the CTSU RSS.

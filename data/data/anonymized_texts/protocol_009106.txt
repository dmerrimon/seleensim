HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?  
 
Approximately 50 people will take part in this study . Of this number, 40 veterans will be enrolled in the study . An 
additional 5-10 Veterans Affairs clinicians  will take part in a n interview  about their own participation in this  
research study.  
HOW LONG WLL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
It may take up to 3 weeks to know if you qualify for this study . This includes time to schedule your first 
chiropractic visit. If you qualify and agree to take part in this study, your involvement will last for 10 weeks from 
this first  chiropractic visit.  
 
Your total time to complete study activities will be between 7 and 10 hours. This does not include the time for 
travel, chiropractic or other provider visits.  
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
You will complete some or all of the following activities  if you join this study . The time you will spend on each 
activity varies.  
• Baseline Visit  (2 to 3 hours)  
• Chiropractic visits (1 hour initial visit, 30 minute follow -up visits)  
• Brief online questionnaires  at week 3, 7, after the first chiropractic visit and before final chiropractic 
visit (10 minutes ) 
• Full online questionnaires at Week 5 and 10 (1 to 2 hours)  
• Audio  recorded exit interview  completed in person or by phone  (20 minutes)  
• Researchers also will review and collect data from your VA electronic health record  
 
Baseline Visit  
The Baseline Visit includes this informed consent process, an interview, and questionnaires to determine if you 
are eligible for this study. Because this is  a small pilot study, it is possible that we will go through the baseline visit 
and not have you complete the study if we have met our goal. You would still be able to see any provider, 
including the chiropractor, if this should happen and would not be den ied any benefits you would have received.

• Interview: You will answer some short questions about your current health and health care.  
• Questionnaires  (research data collection forms ): Using a computer during your baseline visit, you will 
answer research questions about your:  
o Current health,  
o Back pain,  
o Mental health (including post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and 
alcohol use),  
o Thoughts and expectations about your back pain care, and  
o Activities of daily living  
 
If you choose to be in this study, you will complete some of these questionnaires today. You will then have the 
option to finish the rest online at home or elsewhere after your Baseline Visit. All Baseline Visit questionnaires 
must be completed before your  first chiropractic visit. It is after that first chiropractic visit that, if eligible, you 
would be enrolled in the study if you agreed.  
 
VA Electronic Health Record Review  
If you consent to this study, a research team member will review your VA electroni c health record (EHR) for your 
medical diagnosis, past, and current treatments. This will help the researchers know if you are eligible. A VA 
chiropractor will review your record to make sure you can receive chiropractic care. The project manager also will  
access your electronic record for study -related scheduling and messages with your providers. This will not affect 
your VA provider’s use of your health records per standard procedure in your care. We will also be monitoring all 
health care you received du ring the study period.  
 
Chiropractic visits  
Chiropractic visits will use the VA standard of care. The chiropractic treatment in this study is not experimental. 
The experimental part of the study is your answers to questionnaires and how your doctors talk to each other 
about your care plan.

 Chiropractic Visit Schedule  
• At the first chiropractic visit, we will determine if you can enroll in this study. If you are not eligible for 
the study, you still may be able to receive chiropractic care through the VA. That decision is made with 
your chiropractor.  
• If you are eligible for the stu dy, your chiropractor and you will schedule your chiropractic visits, as 
needed, for up to 10 weeks.  
• Visits may occur 1 to 2 times per week. Some weeks you may have no chiropractic visit scheduled.  
• Your first chiropractic visit is scheduled for 1 hour . The visit will include an exam and possibly 
treatment. Follow -up chiropractic visits are scheduled for 30 minutes each.  
 
What to Expect During a Chiropractic Visit  
• Chiropractic visits may include  a health history, exams and treat ment to  your  lower back,  neck, upper 
back, arms or legs.  
• Recommended treatments will be explained to you. You may ask the chiropractor any questions you 
have about possible treatments.  
• During your chiropractic visits , you may  sit or lie in different positions on a treatment table. The 
chiropractor may move (lift or lower) the table during treatment. Some treatments include a quick, 
downward motion or “drop” of the table that sometimes comes with a loud sound.  
• Your body  will be moved by the chiropractor . The chi ropractor may touch, support or move your back, 
head, neck, hips , arms or legs with their hands  or other part of their body during treatment or exams . 
• The type of chiropractic treatment you receive may vary. The chiropractor may make a quick and 
controll ed motion  with the hands to move some of your joints.  Other treatments might involve 
slower, stretching type movements. Handheld devices that make a clicking sound might be used for 
treatment. The chiropractor may also use a technique called Gua sha , which  is a type of massage to a 
specific area using a handheld device.  
• The chiropractor may suggest exercises, such as back exercises. You also may get advice on actions 
you can take at home to care for your back.

Other Considerations for Chiropractic Visits  
• If enrolled, we ask you to avoid acupuncture treatments while you are in the study.  
• As part of the research model, the chiropract or will monitor your health during the study. You may 
have a change in your health that needs assessment or treatment. If needed, the chiropractor will 
refer you to other VA health care providers. This may include your primary care provider, mental 
health provider, or emergency services.  
 
Online Questionnaires  
Completion of some online questionnaires may take a few minutes and others may take up to 2 hours. You may 
skip any questions you prefer not to answer. The day you receive your first chiropractic trea tment start s the 
online questionnaire schedule (6 times  total) : 
• After your first chiropractic treatment  – 10 minutes  
• 3 Weeks after your first chiropractic treatment (Week 3)  – 10 minutes  
• 5 Weeks after your first chiropractic treatment (Week 5)  – 1-2 hours  
• 7 Weeks after your first chiropractic treatment (Week 7)  – 10 minutes  
• Before your last scheduled chiropractic treatment*  - 10 minutes  
• 10 Weeks after your first chiropractic treatmen t (Week 10)  – 1-2hours  
 
*Note: You may not receive 10 weeks of chiropractic treatment, so your last scheduled chiropractic treatment 
will be decided by you and the chiropractor. Regardless of your last scheduled treatment, we will still ask you to 
complete  research forms at weeks 3, 5, 7, and 10.  
 
If you do not have access to a computer with internet and are unable to complete the questionnaires online, you 
have the option of completing them over the phone.  If you will need to complete the questionnaires ov er the 
phone, the project manager will call you at the beginning of the week they are to be completed.  
 
Audio  Recorded Exit Interview  
You will be asked to complete a one -time exit interview in person at weeks 8-10 , or up to two months after your 
completion in the study. This exit interview can be completed by phone if you are no longer seeing the

Risks from Research Data Collection  
• You may feel fatigued or tired after completing questionnaires.    
• You may feel uncomfortable answering personal questions about yourself or your health . 
• You may experience emotional distress after reading or answering some questions . You may skip any 
questions you do not feel comfortable answerin g. We encourage you to talk with your mental health 
provider if any distress continues.  
• There is a very small risk of the confidentiality of your personal health records , personal data or social 
security number  to be compromised . However, the research team has a number of measures in place 
to prevent this from occu rring.  
 
Risks from Chiropra ctic Visits  
Participating in chiropractic care has risks associated with the specific treatments which can vary depending on 
your level of pain, condition , and prior treatment history.  Participating in this research is not anticipated to alter 
that risk. Some possible side effects from chiropractic treatment include light ‐headedness or dizziness, sweating 
and a flushed feeling. These symptoms may  occur right after a treatment and usually last only a few minutes. 
Sometimes, you might feel muscle or joint pain, fatigue, muscle stiffness or soreness , mild to moderate surface 
bruising under the skin of the area treated, or headache  for a short time af ter a treatment. These symptoms 
often last less than 24 hours. They may last up to 48 hours. While rare, some chiropractic patients may 
experience bone fractures or muscle and ligament strains or sprains. If the chiropractor believe s you are at  a high 
risk for these rare but more serious side ‐effects and he/she is  unable to treat you in a manner that reduces your 
risk, you will not be included in our study.   
 
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY?  
You may not  benefit from being in this study. However, you may  experience a  change  in your back pain  as a 
result of receiving care from your chiropractor  per usual practice . In either case, the research community and the 
general public may benefit from the knowledge gained from this study.  
 
WHAT OTHER TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE THERE?  
Before  you decide whether or not to be in this study, feel free to contact and consult with a tr usted healthcare 
provider or other person, such as a family member . You may consider seeking care for your low back pain from

• A $25 Wal -Mart gift card will be given after completion of Week 10 questionnaires.   
 
If all 3 of the above questionnaires  are completed within the designated time frame, an extra  $25 Wal -Mart gift 
card will be given after completion of Week 10 questionnaires . 
 
When you complete the online questionnaires at each of the above times we will mail you the gift card. For 
example, when you finish your Week 5 questionnaires online, you will see a screen that says “You have 
completed this set of study questionnaires”. We  will get a message saying it was completed and send your  gift 
card through  the US mail. If you complete the information over the phone, we will let you know you finished that 
week’s questionnaires and that we will be mailing your card.  
The research team will try to arrange your Baseline Visit and Exit Interview when you will already be at the VA for 
another appointment. If this is not possible, we will pay you $0.56/mile for distances over 20 miles for either or 
both visits. This will be paid directly to you in the form of a check mailed to your preferred address. We will need 
your social security number and preferred address on file to process this check. Any travel over 20 miles for 
regular visits such as chiropractic visits or regularly scheduled visits  would be paid through the regular process at 
the VA.

Test Product, Dose, and 
Administration  Pimavanserin 34 mg (provided as 2×17 mg tablets) or matching 
placebo (2×placebo tablets [size- and color -matched to 
pimavan serin])  
Planned Duration of 
Treatment  The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be 
up to 16 weeks, consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, 
an 8-week double-blind treatment period, and a safety follow-up 
period of 30 (+ 4) days (for those subjects who discontinue 
prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the open- label 
extension study) ( Figure S –1). The end of the cl inical study will be 
when the last subject completes the la st scheduled assessment. If 
the study is terminated for any reason, subjects remaining in the study will return to standard of care. 
Study Design  This study will be conducted as a multicenter, ran domized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group study in adult and 
elderly  subjects with neuropsychiatric symptoms related to

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 13 of 92 neurodegenerative disease.  
The study will have 3 periods: 
• Screening period (3-28 days) 
• Double-blind treatment period (8 weeks)  
• Safety follow-up period (30 [+ 4] days) 
Screening Period (3 -28 Days) 
During the screening period, adult and elderly subjects will be 
assessed for study eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued. Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of enrolling them into the study. Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
Double -blind Period (8 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit (Visit 2) may occur as soon as screening procedures are completed and subject eligibility has been confirmed. At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to 
pimavanserin 34 mg once daily (QD) or matching placebo. It is 
recommended that the subject take the study drug at approximately 
the same time each day. Assessments will be conducted at Week 0 (Basel ine), 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/ early termination ( ET). 
Safety Follow- up Period ( 30 Days) 
Eligible subjects who successfully complete the 8- week 
double-blind period will be eligible to enroll in an open- label 
extension study. For subjects who discontinue premature ly from 
the study or who do not enroll in the open-label extension study, a follow-up safety assessment visit should be conducted 30 (+ 4) 
days after the last dose of study drug. 
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table S –1. 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review 
safety information on a regular basis throughout the study. 
Sample Size 
Calculations A sample size  of 375 adult and elderly  subjects in each treatment 
group ensures that within each treatment group, the probability of observing at least 1 adverse event ( AE) with a true incidence of 
1.0% is 0.977; the probability of observing at least 1 AE with a true i ncidence of 1.5% is 0.997; and the probability of observing at 
least 1  AE with a true incidence of 2.0 % is 0.999.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 14 of 92 Statistical Methods  Analysis Sets  
The primary analyses will be based on the Safety Analysis Set. 
The Safety Analysis Set is defined as all su bjects who take at least 
1 dose of study drug. 
Primary  Analyses 
Safety results will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Adverse events will be classified into standard terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activ ities. All AEs  will be listed and treatment- emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that started after the first dose of study drug and no later than 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Summaries by maximum severity and by relationship will also be provided. Serious TEAEs, fatal TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation will also be summarized.  
Secondary  Analyses 
MMSE and ESRS -A observed values and change from Baseline 
will be summarized by treatment group and visit. T he change fro m 
Baseline in the MMSE and ESRS -A scores will be summarized  
using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM). T he model will 
include effects for region, treatment group, visit, treatment-by- visit 
interaction, Baseline score, and Baseline score-by- visit interaction. 
No formal comparisons between treatment groups are planned. The MMRM results for the pimavanserin and placebo groups will be tabulated by visit. 
Exploratory Analyses  
For the C- SSRS, the number and percentage of subjects with 
suicidal ideation or suicid al behavior during the study will be 
tabulated.  For the GCAS, the number and percentage of subjects 
with a score of 3 or 4 during the study will be tabulated. 
The CGI -I scores and the change f rom Baseline in the CGI -S and 
SDI scores will be summarized  using MMRM. The model will 
include effects for region, treatment group, visit, treatment-by- visit 
interaction, Baseline score, and Baseline score-by- visit interaction. 
For CGI- I, the Baseline CGI -S score will be used as the Baseline 
covariate in the model. The change from Baseline in the 
EQ-5D- 5L will be summarized using an ANCOVA model with  
effects for region, treatment group, and Baseline score. No formal 
comparisons between treatment groups are planned. The MMRM

by visit. 
Other Safety Analyses  
The serum clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis results at 
each time point will be summarized by treatment group. Change from Baseline values will also be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important (PCI) post- Baseline laboratory values will be 
summarized by treatment group at each post- Baseline visit and 
overall post- Baseline for selected p arameters. The PCI criteria will 
be specified in the statistical analysis plan . 
Vital signs and body weight at Baseline and each post- Baseline 
visit will be summarized by treatment group. Change from Baseline values will also be summarized.  
The results of the physical examinations at each vi sit will be 
tabulated by treatment group. 
Electrocardiogram parameters at study visits will be summarized 
by treatment group. Change from Baseline values will also be summarized. Categorical analyses will be conducted on  the 
incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with ICH guidelines.

a This visit is a safety follow -up telephone call visit for subjects who discontinue prematurely from the study or who do not participate in the long -term 
extension study.  This visit will occur 30  (+4) days after the last dose of study drug.  
b At Visit 1, ECG should be completed in triplicate. At all other visits, a single 12 -lead ECG should be completed. These should occur before blood sampling 
or at least 3 0 minutes after blood sa mpling.  
c To include hematology, serum chemistry, prolactin levels, and urinalysis. Urinalysis requirement is not applicable to subjects who are unable to provide 
urine sample (e.g., incontinent subjects).  Where collection of a urine sample proves impracti cal or impossible, fa ilure to collect a urine sample should be 
recorded in the subject’s CRF, and will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
d A pregnancy test is only required for women of childbearing potential. Serum pregnancy should only be performed at Visit 1 ; a urine pregnancy test should 
be performed at all subsequent visits.  If urine cannot be obtained in women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test should be done in its place.   
e Suicidal assessment is required. For subjects who are a ble to complete the a ssessment, the Baseline/Screening version of the C -SSRS will be administered at 
Screening, and the Since Last Visit version of the C -SSRS will be administered at all subsequent visits. The C -SSRS is preferred. If the subject is not abl e to 
complete the C -SSRS in the Investigator’s judgment, the GCAS should be administered and used thereafter in the study.  
f A CT  or MRI  should only be completed if a CT or MRI scan has not been performed in the last 3 years prior to screening.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol and the International Council for Harmonis ation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP)  Guideline.  
1.1 Background Information 
Neuropsychiatric symptoms,  including behavioral symptoms, such as hallucinations, 
delusions, irri tability, apathy and agitation , are common in patients with neurodegenerative 
disease. Almost all individuals with dementia  exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms over the 
course of the disease ( Steinberg et al. 2008; Lanctot et al. 2017), causing distress for the 
patient and their caregivers , as they are “ associated with impairment in activities of daily 
living, poor quality of li fe, earlier institutionalization, accelerated  disease progression, 
increased mortality, caregiver stress, and increased cost of care” (Lanctot  et al.  2017). 
Psychosis, apathy, agitation, depression and sleep disturbances are common neuropsychiatric 
symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The emergence of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms typically occurs in three phases: “(1) irritability, depression, and nightt ime 
behavior changes; (2) anxiety, appetite changes, agitation, and apathy; and (3) elation, motor disturbances, hallucinations, delusions, and disinhibition ” (Masters  et al.  2015).  
Psychosis is a common neuropsychiatric symptom, particularly in patients with dementia 
associated with neurodegenerative disease. Psychotic symptoms are typical of dementia with 
Lewy bodies  (DLB ), very common in Alzheim er’s disease ( AD) and occur, although to a 
lesser degree, in vascular dementia (VaD)  and frontotemporal dementi a (FTD)  (Table 1 –1). 
In one study, 67% of patients with dementia  had psychotic symptoms ( Ballard  et al.  1995). It 
is also a frequent complication  of Parkinson’s disease patients, with or without dementia. The 
psychosis in neurodegenerative diseases is typically dominated by visual hallucinations, with delusions often consisting of the reactions or rationalizations that follow. However , delusions 
do occur as distinct phenomena, often taking the form of misinterpretations of real or imaginary objects, delusions of infidelity or abandonment, or beliefs such as thinking that spouses or relatives are duplicates of the original person. Among AD patients, delusions are 
more common than hallucinations ( Fischer et al. 2016 ; Ballard  et al. 1995) while 
hallucinatio ns are more common in patients with DLB  and Parkinson’s disease dementia. 
Patients with psychosis who had a clinical diagnosis of AD are often found on autopsy to have Lewy bodies or vascular lesions (Fischer et al. 2016; Kim  et al. 2017).

Source: Adapted from Jellinger (2012)  
There is evidence that psychotic features in Parkinson’s disease, AD, and DLB are associated 
with polymorphisms in the serotonergic pathway genes, in particular the 5HTTLPR 
polymorphism in SLA6A4, which codes for the serotonin transporter ( Sweet et al. 2001 ; 
Quaranta et al. 2009 ; DeMichele-Sweet et al. 2010 ; Creese et al. 2014 ). This observation 
raises the possibility that there is a common biological link among those dementia patients 
who have psychotic features, regardless of subtype, and provides mechanistic support for the 
finding that pimavanserin, a compound with serotonergic but not dopaminergic activity, can 
have an effect on delusions and hallucinations. 
Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disease 
represents an area of high unmet need. There are no approved therapies for psychosis 
associated with DLB or AD. A substantial number of these patients receive off-label 
antipsychotic drug treatment to control their symptoms. However, many of these drugs have 
not demonstrated efficacy in controlled trials, worsen patients’ motor symptoms, require 
extensive monitoring, or have other safety concerns. The lack of target engagement in a 
degenerating brain may limit the effectiveness of currently approved treatments, such as 
antidepressants and antipsychotics, for mood and psychotic symptoms ( Lanctot et al. 2017 ). 
The CATIE-AD study concluded that the adverse effects of risperidone, olanzapine, and 
quetiapine limited their overall effectiveness ( Schneider et al. 2006 ). 
Limited options are available for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
neurodegenerative disease. While atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used in clinical 
practice, none are approved in the United States (US) for this use, with the exception of 
pimavanserin which is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 28 of 92 with Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP) . In Europe, atypical antipsychotics are generally 
not approved in this population based on their equivocal efficacy and poor benefit- risk 
assessment, particularly in elderly patients with dementia. In severe cases, limited indications 
exist for some antipsychotics; however, they are restricted to short- term treatment in patients 
with severe and persistent symptoms when non- pharmacological treatments have failed, and 
when there is risk of harm to self or others. For example, risperidone is approved in Canada 
and Europe for short- term treatment of persistent aggression in moderate to severe 
Alzheimer’s disease unresponsive to non-pharmacological approaches and when there is a 
risk of harm to self or others .  
Robust efficacy with pimavanserin was demonstrated with out worsening the motor 
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. In addition, a recently completed Phase 2 study (ACP -103-019) in AD psychosis (ADP) report ed statistical superiority of pimavanserin over 
placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint of improvement in psychotic symptoms at Week 6 of treatment  (Ballard et al. 2018). With its highly targeted and selective receptor binding 
profile, pimavanserin represents a new pharmacologic paradigm to treat psychotic symptoms across neurodegenerative diseases.  
1.2 Investigational Product  
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is present in the investigational product as  
pimavanserin tartrate salt with  the chemical name, urea, N -[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]- N-(1-
methyl-4-piperidinyl)- N’-[[4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]methyl]-,(2R ,3R)-2,3-
dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1). In April 2016, pimavanserin was approved in the US  for the 
treatm ent of hallucinations and delusions associated PDP . 
Pimavanserin is a novel small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic neurotransmiss ion mediate d by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT [serotonin]) 2A (5- HT
2A) 
receptor . At higher doses pimavanserin may block 5HT 2C receptors ( Vanover et al. 2006).  
Pimavanserin  shows no appreciable activity at dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic receptors . Activity at these receptors has been implicated in a range of 
dose- limiting side effects as sociated with existing antipsychotic drugs including cognitive 
dulling ( Saeedi et al. 2006 ; Mehta et al. 2004; Peretti et  al. 1997) and an increased ri sk of 
mortality in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et al. 2005). On the basis of its novel 
receptor binding profile, pimavanserin may have benefits with  regard to overall tolerability 
relative to other antipsychotic agents. 
1.3 Previous Clinical Experience 
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations 
and delusions associated with PDP. Studies have also been conducted in ADP  and 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 29 of 92 schizophrenia . The PDP program and Phase 2 ADP studies are reviewed below. A mor e 
complete discussion of these studies, as well as the schizophrenia p rogram , is available in the 
Investigator ’s brochure. 
1.3.1 Parkinson’s D isease P sychosis Program 
The scope of the development program for pimavanserin is the largest ever conducted in 
PDP. At the time of approval, 616 mostly older, late-stage PDP subjects had be en evaluated in 
16 countries over a span of >10 years. Clinically meaningful efficacy was established in Study ACP -103-020, a 6- week, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study ( Cummings et al. 20 14). 
This efficacy was supported by data from additional short- term Ph ase 2b /3 studies. In Study 
ACP -103-020, pimavanserin 34 mg consistently demonstrated statistically significant 
efficacy across multiple and independent endpoints, subject  subgroups, and sensitivity 
analyses. Improvements in sleep and daytime wakefulness were also observed . These clinical 
benefits were achieved without worsening of Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms and without a number of other safety concerns associated with atypical antipsychotics. 
Pimavanserin is considered to be generally safe and well tolerated . Across all clinical studies 
of pimavanserin, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) 
were in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and psychiatric systems. Most 
events  were mild to moderate in intensity . The most common CNS TEAEs included dizziness 
(including postural), headache, and somnolence (drowsiness). Common gastrointestinal disturbances included dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, and vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting were dose li miting in a few cases . Reported psychiatric conditions included 
agitation, insomnia, and confusional state. 
Clinical and nonclinical safety pharmacology studies of pimavanserin suggest a potential risk 
for QT prolongation. The magnitude of effect in humans has been assessed in a thorough QT study with doses of pimavanserin ranging from 17 to 68 mg. In the Phase 3 PDP 
program, an average prolongation of approximately 5 to 8 ms  was observed  with 
pimavanserin 34 mg. 
The US package insert for pimavanserin  has a boxed warning that elderly patients with 
dementia -related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. 
Pimavanserin  is not approved in the treatment of patients with dementia -related psychosis 
unrelated to the hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis. Additional information is provided in the pimavanserin Investigator’s brochure and in the 
NUPLAZID
® (pimavanserin) US package insert.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 30 of 92 1.3.2 Alzheimer’s Disease Psychosis  
Evidence from the recently completed Phase 2 study (ACP-103-019) suggests that 
pimavanserin is effective in reducing hallucinations and delusions in patients with psychosis 
in Alzheimer’s disease ( Ballard et al. 2018). 
Study ACP -103-019 was a Phase 2, 12- week , randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
single-center study to assess the safety and efficacy of pimavanserin 34 mg once daily in 
nursing home subjects with ADP . Eligible subjects were required to have a score of 4 or  
greater on either the hallucinations or delusions scale of the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI- NH) or a total combined Hallucinations and 
Delusions score of 6 or greater . The primary efficacy endpoint was change from Baseline to 
Day 4 3 in the NPI-NH psychosis score (Delusions+Hallucinations domains). 
A total of 181 subjects were randomized (n=90 pimavanserin and n=91 placebo) with 178 subjects included in the F ull Analysis Set (FAS; n=87 pimavanserin and n=91 placebo). 
The mean (standard error [SE]) age of subjects w as 85.9 (0.48) years . The mean (SE) 
Baseline NPI -NH psychosis score for all FAS subjects was 9.8 (0.39) with comparable mean 
scores in the pimavanserin (9.5) and placebo (10.0) groups. The mean (SE) Mini-M ental 
State Examina tion (MMSE) score for all FAS subjects was 10.1  (0.40). 
Efficacy results for the primary endpoint (NPI-NH psychosis score afte r 6 weeks of treatment 
[Day 43] demonstrated a significant (p=0.0451; effect size [Cohen’s d] = -0.320) treatment 
effect for pimavanserin compared with placebo . Prespecified subgroup analyses supported a 
clinically relevant treatment effect in the pimavanserin group, as a larger effect size was 
generally observed in subjects with more severe psychosis. Similarly, the proportion of 
responders ( subjects with 30% and 50% reductions from Baseline) was  statistically 
significantly greater in the pimavanserin group compared to placebo  (Table 1–2). On the 
endpoint of mean change in NPI- NH psychosis sco re at Week  12, pimavanserin achieved 
improvement to Week 12 but the difference from placebo was not maintained due to an 
observed improvement in the mean score in the placebo group between Weeks 6 and 12.

With respect to secondary and exploratory endpoints, changes in individual domains of the 
NPI-NH were explored. A greater improvement in the NPI -NH Irritability/Lability 
(Domain  I) score was observed on D ay 43 in the pimavanserin group compared with placebo. 
No statistical separation was observed between treatment groups wit h respect to any of the 
other NPI-NH individual domain endpoints. However, individual domain score improvements were generally greater  in the pimavanserin group than the placebo group, with 
the exception of NPI-NH Elation/Euphoria (Domain F) and NPI- NH App etite and Eating 
Changes (Domain L). 
With respect to safety, pimavanserin  once- daily  appeared to be well -tolerated with no new 
safety observations in this elderly and frail patient population compared to the pimavanserin 
PDP safety database. An equal number of post-randomization deaths were reported: 4 deaths 
in the pimavanserin group and 4 in the placebo group. 
There were more serious a dverse events ( SAEs ) reported in pimavanserin group (16.7%) than 
in the placebo group (11.0%). A review of the reported SAEs, both in the placebo and 
pimavanserin groups, did not reveal the presence of any common, underlying pathophysiologic mechanism or c ause. However, there were fewer discontinuations due to 
TEAEs  in the pimavanserin group (8.9%) compared with the placebo group (12.1%). 
The most common TEAEs  in the pimavanserin group were fall (23.3%), urinary tract 
infection (22.2%), and agitation (21.1%) , which have been described as associated with this 
elderly frail patient population. Of these, a gitation was reported mo re often in the 
pimavanserin group than in the placebo group. 
The mean change from B aseline in the QTc interval in subjects treated with pimavanserin 
was 9.4 ms at 12 weeks (Day 85) with no significant outliers reported at Day 85 (>500 ms or 
delta ≥60 ms). One subject in the pimavanserin group and one subject in the placebo group had a delta ≥60 ms at Day 15. Each subject continued in the study.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 32 of 92 Weight data was available for about half of the study participants at Day 85. Mean body 
weight and body mass index (BMI) remained relatively unchanged from Baseline to Day 85 
in both treatment groups. Overall, 1 (1.8%) subject in the placebo group and 7 (14.6%) 
subjects in the pimavanserin group experienced weight decrease of ≥7% and 5 (8.8%) subjects in the placebo group and 4 (8.3%) subjects in the pimavanserin group experienced weight increase of ≥7%.  
Changes from baseline in MMSE were similar i n placebo and pimavanserin group indicating 
that pimavanserin did not affect cognitive function in these patients. Similarly, treatment with pimavanserin had no negative effect on motor function as measured by UPDRS Part III scores.  
1.4 Study Rationale 
Pimavan serin is the only atypical antipsychotic approved in the US for the treatment of 
hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. The safety database supporting the PDP development program consisted of >1200 patients and healthy subjects, including >600 P DP 
patients, representing the largest development program in PDP ever conducted. Pimavanserin has demonstrated a substantial improvement on measures of psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia -related psychosis in two clinical studies. In addition, pim avanserin has a 
selective pharmacology and distinct safety profile compared with  other antipsychotics, 
including no detrimental effects on cognitive and motor symptoms and lack of off- target 
toxicities. This safety profile offers the potentially unique and significant advantages over currently used antipsychotics in patients with neuropsyc hiatric symptoms associated with 
neurodegenerative disease.  
This placebo -controlled study is a US FDA post- approval commitment that will substantially 
expand the safety da tabase in adult and frail, elderly patients. It will enroll patients with 
prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucination, depression/dysphoria, 
apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, sleep disorder ) associated with 
Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, for whom there are no approved 
antipsychotic therapies. Subjects who complete this study will be eligible to enroll in  an 
open- label  extension study to further evaluate the safety of pimavanserin.

3.1 Overview of Study Design 
This study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel -group study in adult and elderly subjects with neuropsychiatric symptoms related to 
neurodegenerative dise ase. The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be 
up to 16 weeks . The end of the clinical study will be when the last subject completes the last 
scheduled assessment.  Approximately 100 global sites w ill participate  in this study. 
The study will have 3 periods ( Figure S–1): 
• Screening  period (3-28 days) 
• Double-blind treatment period (8 weeks) 
• Safety follow-up period (30 [+ 4] days) 
If the study is terminated for any reason, subjects remaining in the study will return to standard of care.  
3.2 Screening  Period  (3-28 D ays) 
During the S creening  period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited 
medications will be discontinued. 
Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study. Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed 
clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
3.3 Double -blind Period  (8 We eks) 
The Baseline visit (Visit 2 ) may occur as soon as screening  procedures are completed and 
subject eligibility has been confirmed . At Visit 2, s ubjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
pimavanserin 34 mg daily (QD) or matching placebo . It is recomme nded that the subject take 
the study drug at approximately the same time each day. Assessments will be conducted at 
Week 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/ early termination ( ET). 
3.4 Safety Follow- up Peri od (30 Days) 
Eligible subjects who successfully complete t he 8-week double- blind period will be eligible 
to enroll in an open-label extension study. For subjects who discontinue prematurely from the 
study or who do not enroll in the open-label extension study, a safety follow-up telephone 
call visit should
 be conducted  30 (+ 4) days after the last dose of study drug.

4.4 Subject Withdrawal or Termination 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other applicable regulations, a subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, and for any reason, without prejudice to his or her future medical care.  
If consent has been given by a legally acceptable representative ( LAR ) because the subject i s 
not competent to provide informed consent, the LAR has the right to withdraw the subject from the study at any time, and for any reason, without prejudice to the subject’s future medical care or any penalty or loss of benefits to the LAR. 
Subjects may be discontinued or withdrawn from the study for a number of reasons, 
including, but not limited to , those listed below: 
• Adverse event  
• Death  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Non-compliance with study drug 
• Use of prohibited medication 
• Physician decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation 
• Study terminated by Sponsor 
• Subject or LAR withdraws consent 
• Other  
If at any time the C -SSRS or GCAS results for a given subject reveal potential suicidality, 
then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a clinically 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 41 of 92 significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the  Investigator should 
discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Sections 6.3.5 and  6.3.6).  
Every  reasonable effort should be made to complete Visit 7/ET  and the safety follow-up 
period if  a subject discontinues from the study for any reason. 
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort should be made to phone the subject 
approximately 4 weeks after last known contact with the subject in orde r to assess the 
subject’s current status . All phone contact with the subject should be documented. 
For subjects who continue to be followed for safety, SAEs  should continue to be reported as 
described in Section 7.4.2. 
If a subject is discontinued from the study because of an AE, every reasonable attempt should 
be made to follow the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to 
be chronic or stable.  
All SAEs will continue to be followed until such events have resolved or the Investigator deems them to be chronic or stable. 
Should a subject request or decide to withdraw, every reasonable effort will be made to 
complete and report observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal, including t he evaluations specified at the ET  visit outlined in Table S –1. Unless t he subject 
has withdrawn consent to be contacted for this study, every reasonable effort  will be made to 
complete the  30-day  safety follow-up telephone call  for all subjects  who withdraw 
prematurely . All information will be reported on the applicable pages of the electronic case 
report f orm (eCRF) . 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any re ason. Such 
reasons may be any of, but not limited to, the following: 
• Occurrenc e of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, severity, and duration 
or the unexpected incidence of known AEs 
• Medical , ethical , or business reasons affecting the continued performance of the study 
Regulatory a uthorities also have the right to terminate the conduct of the study in their region 
for any reason. 
4.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
4.5.1 Prior Medications  
Prior medications are defined as any medication taken before the date of the first dose of 
study drug. 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 42 of 92 4.5.2 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications are defined as any medication taken on or after the date of the first 
dose of study drug. 
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior cons ultation with the 
Investigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency). 
4.5.2.1 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medications  
Prohibitions and r estriction s for concomitant medications should be followed between the 
initial screening  visit and Visit 7/ET as specified in  Appendix H  and Appendix I . These 
appendices do not constitute an exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and 
restricted medications should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee. 
Use of medications that could interfere with study conduct or any questions regarding 
prohibited and restricted concomitant medications should be reviewed and/or discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee. 
Medications that can prolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by the 
Medical Monitor, or appropriate designee ) as specified in  Appendix H. 
If a subject is on a medication restricted by the protocol, the medication should be adjusted only if it is determined by the Investigator to be clinically appropriate (e.g., if the subject's 
symptoms are not well-controlled or if the subject cannot tolerate the current medi cation)  in 
consultation with the treating physician. 
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or discontinue appropriate medication to treat or 
manage AEs. Subjects who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless: 
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The ju stification to allow the subject to continue in the trial will be made by the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. 
If a subject is allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protoc ol 
deviation and not a waiver.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 44 of 92 5.1.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
At Week 0 (Visit 2), eli gible subjects who meet inclusion and do not meet exclusion criteria 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 34 mg pimavanserin or placebo. The 
randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America, Europe , or rest of 
world).  
5.1.5 Blinding  
Treatment assignments will be blinded to all study subjects, study partners/caregivers, 
Investigators, raters, site personnel, and Sponsor personnel who oversee the study. Details regarding medical emergency unblinding procedures are provided in Sect ion 9.8. 
5.1.6 Study Drug Compliance  
If a subject misses one dose of study drug, he or she should not t ake an extra dose the next 
day. 
If a subject shows significant undercompliance (<80% compliance) between any two scheduled visits, the Medical Monitor should be notified to determine if the subject remains 
eligible for the study. 
In the event that a subject is permanently unable to return study drug to the site (i.e., drug is 
lost, destroyed, or discarded), the subjec t/caregiver testimony is to be used in determining 
compliance.  
5.1.7 Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported, irrespective of outcome, 
even if toxic effects were not observed ( Section 7.4.4). All events of overdose are to be 
captured as protocol deviations. 
5.2 Investigational Product Accountability Procedures  
The Investigator or designee will keep  current and accurate records of the study drug 
dispensed, used, and returned for each subject to as sure the regulatory authority and the 
Sponsor that the study drug is being handled appropriately. Subjects should be instructed to 
return all treatment kits , blister cards, and unused tablets to the Investigator at regularly 
scheduled clinic visits and any ET visits.  Any study drug supplied is for use in this study only 
and should not be used for any other purpose. 
At appropriate intervals during the study, study drug reconciliation will be performed by the 
Sponsor (or designee) who may return appropriate unused study drug and used and unused packaging to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 45 of 92 At the conclusion of the study, final study drug reconciliation will be conducted at the site. 
Final study drug accountability documentation will be maintained at bot h the site and at the 
Sponsor. Any remaining unused study drug and all used and unused packaging will be sent back to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction, as allowed by country specific regulations. Documentation of study drug destruction will be recorded and maintained by both the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s designee. 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study specific procedures are detailed below. All assessments will be completed according to 
the schedule described in  Table S –1. Every effort should be made to complete the required 
procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times. 6.1 Screening  Assessments 
6.1.1 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  
The NPI  was developed to assess psych opathology in dementia patients 
(Cummings et  al. 1994). The original NPI evaluated 10 neuropsychiatric disturbances 
common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, 
irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior. Two other domains, nighttime behavior disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities, were subsequently added to the NPI ( Cummings 1997). At Screening , the degree of the patient’s 
neuropsychiatric symptoms wil l be evaluated using several of the domains of the NPI , as 
described in Section 4.2 Inclu sion Criteria; patients with at least one  individual domain score 
(frequency  × severity ) greater than or equal to 4  at Scr eening and Baseline (the domains at 
Screening and Baseline can be different)  will be eligible for the study . 
6.1.2 Mini -Mental State Examination  
The MMSE is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas : the time and place of testing, repeating lists of words, arithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for cognitive imp airment  and as a safety measure. 
The MMSE will be assessed at all scheduled visits.  
6.1.3 Medical History  and Demographics 
A comple te medical history will be obtained from each potential subject. Demographic 
information, including date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as well . Any 
new medical condition beginning after the informed consent form (ICF) has been signed will 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 46 of 92 be captured as an AE . Subjects may be asked to provide pharmacy or medical records to 
substantiate the medication history.  
6.1.4 Psychiatric History  
Details of the subject’s psychiatric history and treatment will be collected.  
6.1.5 Dementia History  
Details of  the subject’s dementia diagnosis and treatment will be collected , including the date 
that dementia was determined.  
6.1.6 Neurological History  
Details of the subject’s neurological diagnosis and treatment will be collected, including the 
date that any neurologic al disease was determined . 
6.1.7 Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
A CT  or MRI head  scan will be completed if the subject ha s not had brain imaging with a 
CT or MRI scan completed with in the l ast 3 year s (Section 4.2). The purpose of the scan is to 
evaluate criteria excluding a clinically significant  CNS abnormality ( Section 4.3).  
6.2 Exploratory E fficacy  Assessments 
6.2.1 Clinical Global Impression  – Severity and Improvement Scales 
The CGI –S scale is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the severity of the 
subject’s neuropsychia tric symptoms at the time of assessment using the Investigator’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects who have the same disorder ( Guy 1976). The 
CGI-S will be assessed at Screening and at all scheduled and unscheduled visits and will be 
used for expl oratory efficacy analyses.  
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the improvement in the 
subject’s neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of assessment, relative to the symptoms at Baseline . The CGI -I will be assessed at Week s 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/EOT and will be used for 
exploratory efficacy analyses. 
6.2.2 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996). It measures 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression) each of which has 5 potential responses. The responses record 5 levels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ -5D-5L Proxy version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate the subject’s health -related 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 47 of 92 quality of life in their (the proxy’s) opinion. The EQ -5D-5L will be assessed at Weeks 0 and 
8/EOT and will be used for exploratory efficacy analyses. 
6.2.3 Sleep Disorders Inventory  
The SDI is an expanded version of one item of the NPI ( Tractenberg et al. 2003). It consists 
of the 7 subquestions from the NPI sleep disturbance item. Each of the subquestions was 
made into a separate question with frequency, severity, and caregiver distress rated by the 
caregiver with respect to the patient -participant for the 2 weeks prior to the visit. Thus, in 
contrast to a single rating for frequency and severity for all sleep disturbance- related 
behaviors, which would be incorporat ed into an overall NPI score, the SDI score is derived 
after the caregiver rates the frequency and severity of each of the 7  separate sleep disturbance 
symptoms. Caregiver distress ratings are not part of the SDI total score, but distress is 
measured.  The SDI total score is calculated  as the average of seven frequency 
ratings × average of seven severity ratings, with a range of 0-12. The SDI will be assessed at 
Weeks 0, 4, and 8/EOT and will be used for exploratory efficacy analyses. 
6.3 Safety Assessments 
6.3.1 Phys ical Examinations 
A physical examination will be conducted. 
6.3.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include resting respiration rate, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
pulse rate, and temperature. The sitting blood pressure should be measured after the subject has been sitting for ≥ 3 minutes.  
6.3.3 Height , Weight, and Body Mass Index  
Height will be reported  in centimeters.  
Weight will be reported  in kilograms. 
Body m ass index will be calculated using the following formula: 
Weight (kg) / [height (m)]
2. 
6.3.4 Electroca rdiograms 
All 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings. Triplicate 
ECGs will be completed at Visit 1 ( Screening) and a single recording will be completed at all 
other times . All ECGs will be centrally read; the interpretation by the central cardiologist is 
considered the official interpretation.  
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 48 of 92 At Visit 1 (Screening) the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the tracings of adequate quality will 
be used to determine eligibility.  If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the set of triplicate 
ECGs prescribed at Screening or the single ECG prescribed at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS values of all t he tracings of adequate quality will be used to determine eligibility.  
• At Screening, if the set of triplicate ECGs has a prolonged QTcF due to an identifiable 
cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat set of triplicate 
ECGs may  be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor 
• At Baseline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of t he locally 
completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by the central cardiologist indicates QTcF outside of the allowable range, the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
The subject must rest in a supine position before the ECG is obtained. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpr eted by a qualified clinician. ECG tracings and results 
(heart  rate, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QTcB interval  duration) will be included  and 
summarized in the subject's study records. 
6.3.5 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the seve rity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality. The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicidal id eations and behaviors in subjects who are able 
to complete the assessment (subjects without dementia, defined as an MMSE ≥25, and 
subjects wi th dementia who the Investigator has determined can complete the C- SSRS). 
Whether or not the subject can complete the C -SSRS should be documented for each subject. 
For subjects who are able to complete the assessment, the Baseline/ Screening version will be 
administered at Visit 1 ( Screening), and the Since Last Visit version will be administered at 
subsequent visits. T he C-SSRS results for each subject should be reviewed by the 
Investigator at each visit. If at any time the C -SSRS results for a given subject reveal 
potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a  clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the 
Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment 
(Section  4.4).  
6.3.6 Global Clinician Assessment of Suicidality  
The GCA S is a clinician -rated, 5 -point scale that is designed to rate the subject’s suicidality 
based on the report of the subject, the report of the study partner/caregiver, and the clinician’s 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 49 of 92 global assessment. Ratings can be 0 (“Absent”), 1 (“Feels life is no t worth living”), 
2 (“Wishes he/she were dead or any thoughts of possible death to self”), 3 (“Suicidal ideas or 
gesture”), or 4 (“Attempt at suicide”). The Investigator will record a subject rating, a study 
partner/caregiver rating, and a clinician rating . 
If the subject is not able to reliably complete the C -SSRS in the Investigator’s judgment, the 
GCAS will be administered  and used thereafter in the study . If the GCAS is administered, at 
Visit 1 (Screening) lifetime suicidality and suicidality for the pa st 3 months will be assessed 
and at all other visits, suicidality since the previous visit will be assessed.  
As with the C -SSRS, if at any time the GCAS results for a given subject reveal potential 
suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clini cal significance of such results. If a 
clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigator should  
discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Section 4.4).  
6.3.7 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale- Abbreviated  
The ESRS ( Chouinard and Margolese 2005 ) was developed to assess drug induced 
movement disorders such as parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and tardive dyskinesia with established reliability, validity , and  sensitivity. It consists of a questionnaire of parkinsonian 
symptoms, physician examination of parkinsonism, dyskinetic movements, and global impression of tardive dyskinesia. The ESRS-A, an accepted modified form of the original 
ESRS,  will be used during the study to monitor for any worsening in extrapyramidal  
symptoms or signs at scheduled and unscheduled visits.  
6.3.8 Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical labs (including HbA1c at screening  only) are encouraged, but not required to be 
completed under fasting conditions. The laboratory evaluations will include, but are not be 
limited to, the following:  
• Clinical chemistry serum tests

generally sh ould be recorded at each uns cheduled visit : assessment of AEs, assessment of 
concomitant medications/treatments, measurement of vital signs, CGI -S, ESRS- A, and 
completion of the C- SSRS (Since Last Visit version)  or the GCAS if the C-SSRS cannot be 
complete d. The I nvestigator may perform any additional safety evaluations deemed by the 
Investigator to be clinically indicated. 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence asso ciated w ith the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related” ( US FDA  2012). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, wit hout any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE . 
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that 
are present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at Baseline 
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms  unless the 
subject is hospitalized for observation 
• Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 53 of 92 • Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
Adverse events will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained through the duration of the study. 
All AEs must be either resolved or stable at end of study. If ongoing at the end of the study 
the subject should be referr ed for appropriate treatment.  
For subjects who enroll into an open-label extension study, AEs will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained in the present study until the first dose of study drug in the open-label study. 
For subjects who discontinue from the study or do not enroll into the open-label extension, 
AEs will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained until 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug. 
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Investigator as “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or more of the following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospitalization  
• Prolongs existing hospitalization 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitalizatio n is defined as a full admission to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. 
This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient hospitalization.  
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 54 of 92 Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not meet the serious criteria for hospitalization 
inclu de: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospital admission) 
• Outpatient surgery 
• Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospitalization, defined as admission to the hospital as a result of inadequate family support or ca re at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Definition of Medically Significa nt 
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may requ ire medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in  hospitalization or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3- point scale and reported in detail as indicated on 
the eCRF:  
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 55 of 92 may have been caused by the product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider the following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event  
• Response to cessation (de- challenge) or re-challenge 
• Compatibility with known class effect 
• Known effects of co ncomitant medications  
• Pre-existing risk factors 
• A plausible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
7.2.2.1 Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first episode of the AE or date of significant sustained worsening in 
severity  
• Stop : Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity

• Fatal: Death related to AE  
• Unknown: Unknown 
7.2.2.6 Seriousness  
• Not serious 
• Serious 
7.2.3 Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the information provided in the 
Reference Safety Information secti on of the current pimavans erin Investigator’s brochure. 
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subject should be followed and treated by the Investigator until the AE has resolved, s tabilized, or a new 
chronic baseline has been established. 
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
7.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator must record all obs erved AEs and all reported AEs. At each visit, the 
Investigator should ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs  will be coded by Data Management  using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedD RA).  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms 
(e.g., “cold” or “s easonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 57 of 92 7.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Report ing 
The reporting of SAEs by the Sponsor or designee to the regulatory authorities is a regulatory 
requirement. Each regulatory authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs based 
upon established criteria. 
Serious AEs must be reported within 24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee ; 
use the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting. 
At a minimum, events identified by the Sponsor to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible IRB/EC, as per applicable regulations . These wi ll be provided by the Sponsor after their 
assessment. For European Union member states, the Sponsor or its designee will provide 
reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) directly to the ECs, as 
required by local legislation. In all other countries, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/EC. It is also the Investigator’s responsibility to  notify the responsible IRB/EC regarding any new and significant safety 
information.  
For this study, sites will complete the paper SAE  form (for initial and/or follow-up 
information) including available supporting documentation relevant to the event and fax or 
email (within 24 hours of discovery) to the contact information provided on the SAE form.  
Subjects will be followed until EO T/ET for any SAEs and/or other reportable information or 
until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction w ith the Sponsor , deems 
them to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact the Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Investigator or designee as soon as is feasible following the report of the SAE. 
Serious AEs occurring after the study Follow-up Period should be reported if in the judgment 
of the Investigator there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by the product.   
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB/EC according to local regulations. 
7.4.3 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be reported on the P regnancy form within 
24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee. Any female subject who becomes 
pregnant during the study will be followed through the first well-baby visit.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 58 of 92 Any AEs  that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria f or serious 
should also be reported via the SAE forms. 
7.4.4 Reporting of Overdose 
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported to the Sponsor or its 
designee on the Overdose form within 24 hours of discovery. 
8 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Routine monitoring of study sites is described in Section 11 . 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of hum an 
subjects are protected, that the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and 
amendment(s) as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements . Details 
of the study site monitoring process are described in a separate clinical monitoring plan document. 
9 STA TISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan to be approved 
by the Sponsor prior to database lock. 
9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal testing of efficacy or  safety hypotheses is planned. Safety and efficacy outcomes  
will be summarized descriptively.  
9.3 Sample Size Determination  
Approxima tely 1500 subjects will be screened to enroll approximately 750 subjects, allowing 
for a 50% screen failure rate. Approximately 375 subjects will be randomized to the 
pimavanserin group a s well as  the placebo group (i.e., 375 subjects in each treatment gro up). 
With an assumed dropout rate of 30% in the double-blind pha se, 525 subjects in total are 
expected to complete the study. 
A sample size of 375 subjects in each treatment group ensures that within each treatment 
group, the probability of observing at least 1 AE with a true incidence of 1.0% is 0.977; 
the probability of observing at least 1 AE with a true incidence of 1.5% is 0.997; and the 
probability of observing at least 1 AE with a true incidence of 2.0% is 0.999.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 59 of 92 9.4 Subject Populations  for Analysis 
The primary analyses will be based on the S afety Analysis S et. The S afety Analysis S et is 
defined as all subjects who take at least one dose of study drug. 
The Full Analysis Set ( FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose 
of study dru g and have both a Baseline CGI -S and at least one post- Baseline value for the 
CGI-I or CGI -S. The FAS will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. 
9.5 Description of Statistical Methods  
9.5.1 Primary Analyses 
Safety results will be summarized by treatmen t group using descriptive statistics. Adverse 
events  will be classified into standard terminology using MedDRA . All AEs will be listed and 
TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term. 
A TEAE is defined as an AE that started after the first dose of study drug and no later than 
30 days after the last dose of study drug. Summaries by maximum severity and by 
relationship will also be provided. Serious TEAEs, fatal TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation will also be summarized . 
9.5.2 Seconda ry Analyses 
MMSE and ESRS -A observed values and change from Baseline will be summarized by 
treatment group and visit. T he change from Baseline in the MMSE and ESRS -A scores will 
be summarized  using mixed model re peated measures (MMRM). The model will inclu de 
effects for region, treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, Baseline score, and 
Baseline score -by-visit interaction.  No formal comparisons between treatment groups are 
planned. The MMRM results for the pimavanserin and placebo groups will be tabulated by visit.  
9.5.3 Exploratory Analyses 
For the C-SSRS, the number and percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation or suicidal 
behavior during the study will be tabulated. For the GCAS, the number and per centage of 
subjects with a score of 3 or 4 during the study will be tabulated. 
The CGI -I scores and the change from Baseline in the CGI -S and SDI  scores will be 
summarized  using MMRM. The model will include effects for region, treatment group, visit, 
treatment -by-visit interaction, Baseline score, and Baseline score -by-visit interaction . For 
CGI-I, the Baseline CGI -S score will be used as the Baseline covariate in the model. The 
change f rom Baseline in the EQ -5D- 5L will be summarized using an ANCOV A model with 
effects for region, treatment group, and Baseline score. No formal comparisons between

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 60 of 92 treatment groups are planned. The MMRM results for the pimavanserin and placebo groups 
will be  tabulated by visit. 
9.5.4 Other Safety Analyses 
The serum clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis results at each  time point will be 
summarized by treatment group. Change from Baseline values will also be summarized. 
The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important (PCI) 
post-Baseline laboratory values will be summarized by treatment group at each post -Baseline 
visit and overall post- Baseline for selected parameters. The PCI criteria will be specified in 
the statistical analysis  plan . 
Vital signs and body weight at Baseline and each post- Baseline visit will be summarized by 
treatment group. Change from Baseline values will also be summarized.  
The results of the physical examinations at each visit will be tabulated by treatment gr oup. 
Electrocardiogram parameters at study visits will be summarized by treatment group. Change 
from Baseline values will also be summarized. Categorical analyses will be conducted on the 
incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QT c intervals in 
accordance with ICH guidelines.  
9.5.5 Interim Analyses  
One or more unblinded interim analyses of data from subjects who have exited the study (i.e., completed, enrolled into the open- label extension , or terminated early) may be 
conducted in order to support safety and efficacy evaluations for regulatory submissions. 
9.6 Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review interim safety data, 
including data on AEs and SAEs . The DSMB will be independent of the Sponsor and the 
Investigators and will be empowered to recommend stopping the study due to safety concerns . The DSMB may review blinded, unblinded or partially unblinded data, but the 
Sponsor and the Investigators will remain blinded to the data provided to the DSMB until the official unblinding of the database at the completion of the study. The membership, activi ties, 
responsibilities, and frequency of meetings will be described separately in the DSM B charter.  
9.7 Measures to Minimize Bias  
Eligible  subjects will be randomized into one of two  treatment groups (pimavanserin or 
placebo) in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive response technology (IRT) system. The 
randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America, Europe, or rest of world). The assignments will be based on a pre- generated permuted -block randomization 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 61 of 92 schedule. Blinding will be assured by restricting access of Investigators and Sponsor 
personnel and/or designee to the treatment codes, and providing identical tablets and 
packaging for the pimavanserin and placebo treatments. 
9.8 Breaking the Study Blind/Subject Code  
For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all subjects will be released to the Sponsor after 
all subjects have completed the study and the clinical database is locked.  
For DSMB safety reviews, the treatment codes will be released to an independent statistician/programmer to produce unblinded statistical outputs. The Sponsor and the Investigators will remain blinded.  
One or more unblinded interim analyses of data from subjects who have exited the study 
(i.e., completed, enrolled into the open- label extension , or terminated early) may  be 
conducted ( Section 9.5.5), and unblinding of the Sponsor to individual treatment assignment 
as part of such analysis is permitted. 
Other than in the situations described above, unblinding of individual treat ment assignment 
during the study is discouraged. The Investigator may break the blind in the event of a 
medical emergency  if it is considered necessary for the care of the subject . The Investigator 
should attempt whenever possible to contact the Medical Monitor before unblinding a subject’s treatment to discuss the event. Lack of Medical Monitor contact does not preclude 
the Investigator from unblinding the subject . In an emergency  situation, the subject’s 
treatment assignment may be obtained by the Investigator from the IRT system. Details of the 
process to be followed are provided in a separate IRT manual. In the event that the IRT 
system is used to perform a code break, the Sponsor or designee will be notified immediately 
via an automated notification from the IRT system that an unblinding has occurred. The notification only alerts the Sponsor or designee that the unblinding occurred, and does not include any information about the unblinded subject’s treatment assignment. 
10 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTI ON 
10.1 Data Collecti on and Management Responsibilities  
All documents required for the conduct of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained by the Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for 
monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor and regulatory authorities . 
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and auditors), regulatory authorities  (including inspectors), and 
the IRB/EC direct access to source documents (s uch as original medical records). Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 62 of 92 reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study. The Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availab ility of source documents from which the information on the eCRF was 
derived. 
10.2 Source Documents  
All study specific information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject’s 
record (source documentation), and then entered into a validated electronic data capture 
(EDC ) database by trained site personnel . The source documentation may consist of source 
notes captured by site personnel as well as laboratory reports, ECG reports, and electronic 
source data.  
10.3 Case Report Forms  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded in an EDC system on eCRFs. The 
Investigator and his or her site personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The 
Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all the information recorded on the eCRFs . All information requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject 
identification data, visit date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will require explanation. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to s ource documenta tion at 
the site.  
10.4 Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained as described below. On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, subjects must be identified by a Subject Id entification Nu mber only. Documents that are not for submission to 
the Sponsor or designees (e.g., signed ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator in compliance with Federal regulations or other applicable laws or ICH Guidance on GCP. 
10.5 Study Records R etention  
Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation as per ICH GCP 
guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of signed, dated and completed eCRFs, documentation of eCRF corrections, signed ICFs, audio recordings, subject- related source 
documentation, and adequate records for the receipt and disposition of all study drug. 
Investigators should maintain all essential study documentation, for a period of at least 
2 years following the last approval of marketing application in an ICH region (US, Europe, and Japan), or until at least 2 years after the drug investigational program is discontinued, unless a longer period is required by applicable law or regulation. Only the Sponsor can

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 63 of 92 notify an Investigator or vendor when any records may be discarded. Investigators should 
contact the Sponsor before destroying any files. 
10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must meet all 
eligibility criteria in order  to participate in the study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by the Sponsor under any circumstances. 
If, during the course of a subject’s post- randomization participation in the trial it is 
discovered that the subject did not meet  all eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow 
the subject to continue in the trial will be made by the Sponsor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as 
a major protocol deviation and not a waiver . All follow -up safety assessments must be 
completed and documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.4). The Investigator must 
report any protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance 
with local regulations, within reasonable ti me. 
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by the Sponsor (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB/EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to regulatory authorities , as either an 
amendment or a noti fication . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following 
activities with a focus on critical processes and critical study data:  
• Risk Identification: identification of risks to critical study processes, governing 
systems, i nvestigational product, study design, data collection, and recording. 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 64 of 92 • Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by considering the following factors: 
(a) likelihood of error occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data 
integrity, and ( c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e .g., mitigating) or can be accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality tolerance limits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject 
safety or data integrity and deviations from the predefined qualit y tolerance limits will 
trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for 
issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic Risk Review, communication and escalation of Risk Management activities 
during trial execution and risk outcome reporting in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
11.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor or designees and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for contacting 
and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, 
inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protoc ol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research . The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the e CRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH Guidance on  GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites part icipating in this study will be audited . These audits may include a review of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with th e protocol, 
ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. The Sponsor’s or designee’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject 
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

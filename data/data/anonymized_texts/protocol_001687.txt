1. RCT Details  
This section provides a high -level overview of the RCT that the described real- world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely 
as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in  the healthcare data bases.  
 1.1 Title 
Effect of Sitagliptin on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes ( TECOS  trial)  
 1.2 Intended aim(s)  
 TECOS primarily tested the hypothesis that sitagliptin, when used as part of usual diabetes care, is non -inferior to usual care 
without sitagliptin with regard to the risk of  significant confirmed cardiovascular outcomes.  
 1.3 Primary endpoint for replication and RCT finding  
 Composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal strok e, or hospitalization for unstable angina  
 
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable ) 
 Power of 90% for the test  of noninferiority (hazard ratio, 1.00). For superiority,  1,300 patients with a  primary composite 
cardiovascular outcome  would provide a power of approximately 81% to  determine the superiority of sitagliptin over 
placebo  (hazard ratio, 0.85).  
 1.5 Primary t rial estimate  targeted for replication  
 HR = 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88 - 1.09) comparing sitagliptin to placebo  (Green et al., 2015)  
 
2. Person responsible for implementation of replication in Aetion  
Ajinkya Pawar, Ph.D.  implemented the study design in the Aetion Evidence Platform. S/he is not responsible for the validity of the 
design and analytic choices. All imp lementation steps are recorded and the implementation history is archived in the platform.

5. Cohort Identification  
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing sitagliptin  to the 2nd generation sulfonylurea 
(SU) antidiabetic class as a proxy for placebo . 2nd generation  SUs are  not known to have an impact on the outcome of interest . In 
addition, SUs were the most frequent background treatment in TECOS  (after metformin), and both DPP4i and SUs are 
preferentially prescribed to similarly older patients in the real world  (Patorno et al., 2019).  The patients will be  required to have 
continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180 days before initiation of sitagliptin  or a comparator drug ( cohort entry  
date) . Follow -up for the outcome (4P -MACE), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the trial, patients are allowed to take 
other antidiabetic medications during the study.  
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
 New users (defined as no use in 180 days prior to index date) of an exposure and a comparator drug  will be identified.  
 
5.2.1 Eligible c ohort entry dates  
Market availability of sitagliptin  in the U .S. started on October 17, 2006 .       
• For Marketscan: October 17 , 2006- Dec 201 7 (end of data availability ).  
• For Medicare: Jan 1, 2012 -Dec 31, 2017 (start - end of data availability).  
• For Optum : October 17, 2006 -March 31, 2019 (end of data availability).  
 
5.2.2 Specify inclusion /exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define  the index date  
 
Inclusion and exclusion crite ria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are provided 
in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables :  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 5  
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is initiation of sitagliptin . Initiation will be defined by no use of sitagliptin  or a comparator in the prior 
6 months before treatment initiation (washout period).  
 Comparator agents : 
• Initiators of sitagliptin  will be compared to initiators of - 
o 2nd generation sulfonylureas  
 Because sitagliptin  and comparators are frequently used as second or third line treatments of T2DM, we ex pect it  to be unlikely that 
sitagliptin  and comparators are initiated in patients with substantially different baseline risk for proposed outcomes.  
 
6.2 Preliminary c ovariate s: 
• Age 
• Sex 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the default baseline covariate assessment period , defined as  180 days 
prior to and including index date  
 Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. 
We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between 
treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility 
analysis and the initial pow er assessment  and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ). These covariates are based on those used by 
Patorno et al. (201 9). 
 6.3 Outcome variables  and study follow -up:  
 6.3.1 Outcome variables  
 Primary Effectiveness outcomes of interest  (definitions provided in  Appendix A ):  
 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making : Protocol Template  
 6 • Primary outcome : 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), i.e., non- fatal myocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke, 
or CV mortality; as well as each individual component:  
• Secondary outcomes:  Individual MACE component s: 
o Hospital adm ission for MI (for purposes of this individual component, fatal MI is included)  
o Hospital admission for stroke (for purposes of this individual component, fatal stroke is included)  
o Hospital admission for ACS/unstable angina  
o All-cause mortality/CV mortality:  
§ All-cause inpatient mortality identified using discharge status codes will be used as a proxy for “CV mortality” 
in commercial databases  
§ Information on CV mortality through data linkage with the National Death Index (NDI) will only be come  
available  at a later date  for Medicare and will be used in secondary analyses . 
 
Control outcomes of interest  (control outcomes only serve to assess aspects of study validity but are not further interpreted) :  
1. Severe hypoglycemia (we expect to see protective effect ; American Diabetes Association, 2018 ) 
Control  outcome definitions  
 
 
     
 
 
6.3.2 Study follow -up 
Both as -treated (AT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of 
cohort entry. Because adherence in the real world  databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary  analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
 Outcome  Hospital Discharge Code(s)  Comments  
Severe hypoglycemia  Severe hypoglycemia  
Any-position ED or primary inpatient ICD -9 diagnosis: 251.0, 251.1x, 251.2x, or 250.8x.  
Outcomes identified by 250.8x are not included if they co -occur with one of the 
following diagnoses: 259.8, 272.7, 681.xx, 682.xx, 686.9, 707.1x, 707.2x, 707.8, 707.9, 
709.3, 730.0x, 730.1x, 730.2x, 731.8  Note - The  corresponding ICD -10 
codes will  be used   also 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 7 For the AT analyses, the follow -up will start the day after initiation of liraglutide  and comp arator and will continue until the earliest 
date of the following events:  
• The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes ,  
• The date of end of continuous registration in the database , 
• End of the study perio d, 
• Measured death event occurs,  
• Nursing home admission  
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to 
no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for 
cohorts for the same reason.  
• The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug ( sitagliptin  
and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 30 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses).  
•  The date of augmentation or switching from an exposure to a comparator or any other agent in the comparator class and 
vice versa (e.g. switching from glimepiride to glipizide would be a censoring event);  
o A dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion  
o An added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion  (e.g. if a 
sitagliptin  user adds insulin, he or she does not get censored at the time of insulin augmentation)  
 
For the ITT analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching  and treatment discontinuation will be replaced with a 
maximum allowed follow -up time of 365 days .

 In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90 -day gap in database enrollment  will be used . This 
outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stag e. 
Complete a 1:1 PS -matched comparative analysis using this outcome.  PS should include only 3 covariates: age, sex, and combi ned 
comorbidity index . Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008).  
 
• Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators  and FDA.  Reviewers evaluate the results of the 
analyses described above in Section s 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow -up time, and reasons 
for censoring by treatment group, as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power.  These parameters are re -evaluated in the 
subsequent sections, after incor porating feedback and refining the protocol.

• In the PS -matched cohort from Section 9, calculate the HR for each outcome for sitagliptin versus 2nd generation SU  patients 
using a Cox proportional hazards model.  
 
13.2 For secondary  analyses:  
• In both pre-matched cohort s, perform asymmetrical trimming to remove patients with PS values below the 2.5th percentile of 
treated patients and above the 97.5th percentile of untreated patients. In the trimmed cohort, calculate the HR for canagliflozin 
versus ref erent patients using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for deciles of the PS.

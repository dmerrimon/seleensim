2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a  malignancy of immature granul ocytes or monocytes. 
Malignancy is characterized by accumulation of leukemic blastocytes and blockade of 
normal bone marrow production resulting in thrombocytopenia, an emia, and neutropenia. 
In the U.S., approximately 11,930 new cases of AML are expected  to be diagnosed in 
2006, with an estimate d 9,040 deaths occurring in the same time  period. Almost all newly 
diagnosed cases, as well as deaths, will be in adults.
1 S t a n d a r d  t r e a t m e n t  f o r  A M L  
includes systemic combination chemotherapy to control bone marr ow and systemic 
disease. Treatment is generall y divided into an induction phase , to attain remission, and a 
maintenance phase. Approximately 60% to 70% of adults with AML can be expected to 
attain complete remission status following appropriate inductio n therapy. Remission rates 
in adult AML are inversely relate d to age, with an expected remission rate of >65% for 
those younger than 60 years. Increased morbidity and mortality during induction appear 
to be directly related to age.2 
 Standard therapy for hematologic malignancies, particularly acu te leukemias, has 
changed little over the past 20-30 years. This is in part due to the lack of understanding, until recently, of the biology of the disease which has led to little change in the 
management of these patients. The treatment has been based on c ombination therapy with 
standard chemotherapy agents. In acute myeloid leukemia, typica lly with an 
anthracycline and cytarabine, and in acute lymphoblastic leukem ia with multi-agent 
therapy. Recent advances in the discovery of important molecula r abnormalities has led 
to the development of new agents that are likely to change the outcome of patients and 
the standard approach to the trea tment of these patients. Some examples are already in 
clinical practice (eg, the use of all-trans retinoic acid-based  t h e r a p y  f o r  p a t i e n t  w i t h  
PML/RARα rearrangements) and others are in development with great possibilities of 
2012-0060

  being approved in the near future (eg, FLT3 inhibitors, alone o r in combination with 
chemotherapy). However, there is urgent need for identification  of new therapeutic 
targets and agents that may be  used for these patients.  
 
 
2.1 Erlotinib  
 
Erlotinib, a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of tyr osine kinase activity 
associated with the HER1/EGFR, has demonstrated tumor growth in hibition both 
in vitro and in vivo. Erlotinib w as designed to target the sign aling pathway that 
mediates the effects of EGFR ac tivation on cell proliferation. 
 
Erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily for the treatment of patient s with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least 1 prior chemotherapy 
regimen was approved in the US on 18 November 2004 and in the E U on 19 
September 2005, based on data from  the randomized, placebo-con trolled Study 
BR.21. This trial demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
survival benefit, as well as de layed time to deterioration of l ung cancer symptoms, 
in patients who received erlotin ib. This indication has now bee n approved in 
multiple countries worldwide.  Also, erlotinib 150 mg daily has been approved by European regu latory 
authorities for use as maintenance therapy in patients with adv anced or recurrent 
NSCLC who had stable disease foll owing 4 cycles of a platinum-b ased doublet 
chemotherapy. In the US, erlotinib 150 mg daily is approved for  u s e  a s  
maintenance therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent NSCL C who have not 
progressed after 4 cycles of first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. 
These indications are based on results from the SATURN study, a  multicenter, 
double-blind, randomized phase 3 study that  demonstrated stati stically significant 
and clinically relevant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Two additional phase 3 clinical trials of erlotinib have been c ompleted in NSCLC 
patients: 
•  First-line treatment of NSCLC, concurrently administered in combination 
with carboplatin/paclitaxel (Study OSI2298g); this trial showed  no benefit 
of the addition of erlotinib to f irst-line chemotherapy for NSCLC. 
 •  First-line treatment of NSCLC, concurrently administered in combination 
with cisplatin/gemcitabine (Study BO16411); this trial showed n o benefit 
of the addition of erlotinib to f irst-line chemotherapy for NSCLC. 
  
2.1.1 Adverse Events 
 
As of 15 November 2010, more than 33,000 healthy subjects and c ancer 
patients have participated in c ompany-sponsored and investigato r-

2.2 Rationale for Erlotinib in AML 
 
Recently anecdotal reports have suggested that erlotinib can induce complete 
remission in patients with acute myeloid leukemia being treated  for a concomitant 
non-small cell lung cancer.3,4 This was assumed to be an off target effect of 
erlotinib, but the exact mechanism was not clear. Previous repo rts had suggested 
that both gefitinib and erlotinib induced apoptosis in leukemic  cell lines and cells 
obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodys plastic 
2012-0060

  syndromes, while sparing normal CD34+ cells.5-8 Gefitinib was also found to 
have a differentiation effect.8 Using proteomic and RNA1-based approaches Syk 
w a s  i d e n t i f i e d  a s  t h e  o f f  t a r g e t  f o r  t h e s e  a g e n t s  i n  A M L .9 This effect was 
confirmed using a somewhat specific Syk inhibitor, R406 which d emonstrated 
that Syk inhibition can trigger differentiation of AML and MDS cells.9 A similar 
effect was observed with gefitinib.9 Importantly, Syk mRNA and protein is 
widely expressed in AML,10 during B-cell development11, in myeloid and other 
hematopoietic cells12, and in primary CLL lymphocytes13. Inhibition of Syk with 
fostamatinib has also demonstrated significant antileukemia act ivity in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia14,15 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia16. We thus 
hypothesize that erlotinib may have significant clinical activi ty in patients with 
AML, possibly through inhibition of Syk. 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
 This will be a phase II, single-arm, open-label study.  
 
 All patients will receive therapy with erlotinib administered o rally as a continuous 
daily dose in 28-day cycles. Patients will continue therapy until clinically significant 
progression of the disease  or unacceptable toxicity.  
 
 The historical experience in this patient population is that re sponse with standard 
therapy, when available, is less than 1%. In many instances (eg , patients with 
myelodysplastic syndrome failing hypomethylating agents), no standard therapy is even available. Thus, an overall response rate of 20% will be c onsidered significant.  
 4.0 PATIENT SELECTION 
 
Patients must have baseline evaluations performed prior to the first dose of study drug 
and must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results of all baseline evaluations, 
which assure that all inclusion and exclusion criteria have bee n satisfied, must be 
reviewed by the Principal Inves tigator or his/her designee prio r to enrollment of that 
patient. In addition, the patient must be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study, including the study visit schedule and required evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consent. The written informed consent  must be obtained from 
the patient prior to initiating treatment. The following criter ia apply to all patients 
enrolled onto the study unle ss otherwise specified. 
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria 
 
4.1.1 Patients with AML who have either been refractory to prior ther apy or 
have relapsed after prior therapy. Patients with MDS or CMML wh o 
received therapy with a hypomet hylating agent and progress to A ML are 
eligibleif they have received any therapy for MDS and failed (i .e., lack or 
loss of response) regardless of w hether they have received ther apy for 
AML or not.  The WHO classifi cation will be used for AML.

4.1.2 Age 18 years 
 
4.1.3 ECOG Performance Status 2  
 
4.1.4 Adequate liver (total bilirubin 2x ULN, ALT ≤2.5x ULN) and renal 
(creatinine 2x ULN) function. 
 
4.1.5 Patients must provide written informed consent. 
 
4.1.6 Patients must have been off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to e ntering 
this study, unless there is evidence of rapidly progressive dis ease, and 
must have recovered from the clinically significant toxic effec ts of that 
therapy to at least grade 1. Use of hydroxyurea for patients wi th rapidly 
proliferative diseas e is allowed before the start of study ther apy and for the 
first four weeks on therapy.  
 
4.1.7 Patients – both males and females – with reproductive potential  ( i e ,  
menopausal for less than 1 year a nd not surgically sterilized) must practice 
effective contraceptive measures throughout the study.  Women o f 
childbearing potential must provi de a negative pregnancy test ( serum or 
urine) within 14 days prio r to initiation of study. 
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria 
 
4.2.1 Patients with known allergy or hype rsensitivity to erlotinib. 
 
4.2.2 Patients with any other known dis ease (except carcinoma in-situ ) 
concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition (e.g. u ncontrolled 
diabetes; cardiovascular disease including congestive heart fai lure NYHA 
Class III or IV, myocardial infarction within 6 months, and poo rly 
controlled hypertension; chronic renal failure; or active uncon trolled 
infection) which, in the opinion of the investigator could comp romise 
participation in the study. 
 
4.2.3 Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol. 
 
4.2.4 Significant  gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with absorption o f 
erlotinib. 
 
4.2.5 Patients who can receive a stem cell transplant within 4 weeks.  
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1
 General: All patients should be registered in CORe.  
 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 10 of 28  
  5.2 Treatment Plan: Patients will receive erlotinib therapy according to the 
suggested guidelines below. Individual minor variations in the initiation of 
therapy, are acceptable as indicated by patient condition and p hysician judgment.  
These variations should be documen ted in the patient’s medical record.  
5.2.1 Therapy :  Patients will receive erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg orally, once 
daily in 28-day cycles. 
5.2.2 Dose Adjustments : Dose adjustments will be done as described below 
using the following dose-levels: 
 
Dose Level* Erlotinib daily dose 
0 150 mg 
-1 100 mg 
-2 50 mg 
* Dose escalations/reductions di fferent than those described in this tab le 
should be discussed with PI or Co-PI and documentation of the d iscussion 
made in the patient’s medical record. 
6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITES 
 
6.1 Dose Reduction Criteria for Hematologic Toxicity at Least Possi bly Related 
to Erlotinib 
 
Patients with AML usually present with abnormal peripheral bloo d counts at the 
time therapy is started and myel osuppression is an expected eve nt during the 
course of therapy for acute le ukemias. Thus, no dose adjustment s or treatment 
interruptions for myelosuppressi on will be planned for the firs t 4 weeks of therapy 
unless an adjustment or interrupt ion is considered by the inves tigator to be in the 
best interest of the patient.  The reason for the variation sho uld be documented in 
the patient’s medical record. After this time, treatment interr uptions and dose 
adjustments may be considered on an individual basis. The follo wing guidelines 
can be used to consider treatment: 
 6.1.1 Patients with neutropenia or thr ombocytopenia as a consequence of the 
disease do not require treatment interruptions for myelosuppres sion. Dose-
reductions in these patients shou ld be considered in an individ ual case and 
discussed with the PI. The following guidelines can be used for  these 
patients:  
 
6.1.1.1 Patients with a response and pre-cycle counts of neutrophils >1x10
9/L and platelets >50 x109/L who have sustained low 
counts of neutrophils <0.5 x109/L or a platelet count <20 x 
x109/L (eg, for more than 5 consecutive days) may have 
treatment interrupted. Upon recovery of counts to neutrophils >1x10
9/L and platelets to >50 x109/L treatment may be re-started 
with a 1 dose level reduction.  A  reduction of 2 dose levels ma y 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 11 of 28  
  be considered if the myelosuppression was deemed severe and 
life threatening by the treating physician, and if it is in the  
patient's best interest. 
 6.1.1.2 If there are persistent peripheral blood blasts, or the bone ma rrow 
shows >5% blasts, may continue treatment regardless of neutrophil and platelet count a nd give supportive care as neede d.  
 6.1.1.3 If no marrow evidence of leukemia, may hold therapy until recovery of granulocytes to ≥1 x10
9/L and platelets ≥ 50 x109/L, 
then resume at same or 1 lower dose level according to guidelines mentioned above. 
 
6.2 Dose Reduction Criteria for Non-Hematologic Toxicity at Least  Possibly 
Related to Erlotinib 
 
Toxicity 
(NCI CTCAE v4.0) Dose Modificationa 
Diarrhea 
Grade 1 or 2 None.  May initiate therapy with loperamide or alternate 
antidiarrheal.  See Section 6.3 for treatment details. 
Grade 3b or 4b a) Interrupt erlotinib until resolu tion to ≤ grade 2 and then rest art 1 
dose level lower. If the event does not resolve to grade 2 within 
14 days, erlotinib will be discontinued.  
Rash 
Grade 1 None 
Grade 2 None.  Initiate treatment as outlined in Section 6.3.   If rash persists 
and is intolerable or worsens over 10 – 14 days, then reduce by  1 
dose level.  
Grade 3b Reduce by 1 dose level.  If rash persists or worsens over 10 – 14 
days, then interrupt erlotinib u ntil resolution to ≤ grade 2 and then 
restart 1 dose level lower. If the event does not resolve to grade 2 
within 14 days, erlotinib  will be discontinued. 
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue erlotinib. 
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Any Grade If ILD possibly related to study  drug is suspected, erlotinib s hould be 
interrupted immediately  pending diagnostic evaluation.  If ILD is diagnosed, erlotinib should 
be discontinued permanently and appropriate treatment institute d as 
necessary. 
Other Non-Hematologic Toxicities  
Grade 1 or 2 None 
Grade 3b, c Interrupt erlotinib until resolu tion to ≤ grade 2 and then rest art 1 dose 
level lower. 
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue erlotinib 
a)  Doses that have been reduced 1 dose level for toxicity may be re-escalated to the previous 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 12 of 28  
  dose level only if the toxicity abates or returns to baseline s everity and the investigator 
believes it is in the best interest of the patient.  Doses that  have been reduced 2 dose levels for 
toxicity may only be re-escalated to the previous dose level (ie, dose level at first reduction) 
and only if the toxicity abates or returns to baseline severity  and the investigator believes it is 
in the best interest of the patient.  Doses that have been redu ced 2 or more dose levels for 
toxicity may not be re-escalated to the starting dose level (or  dose-escalated dose for tobacco 
smokers).  Any patient who fails to tolerate treatment at 50 mg /day will be discontinued from 
the study. 
b) If not responding to optimal treatment within 48 hrs. 
c) Only if  2 grade level change from baseline 
 
6.3 Suggested Management of Toxicity: The following guidelines are offered as 
suggestions for the management of toxicity. Variations of these  are acceptable 
based on the patient’s individual circumstances and physician p reference.   
 If a patient experiences several toxicities, dose adjustments a re to be made based 
on the greatest degree of toxicity (ie, reducing the dose to th e lowest level).  If 
significant toxicity is still apparent, the dose may be reduced  a second time.  Any 
patient who fails to tolerate treatment of 50 mg/day will be withdrawn from the study.   
 
Antidiarrheal and antirash medications may be introduced at any  time if clinically 
indicated. Previous phase 1 and 2 studies have demonstrated that the frequency and severity of diarrhea can be managed with loperamide.  The recommended 
dose of loperamide is 4 mg at first onset, followed by 2 mg eve ry 2 to 4 hours 
until diarrhea resolves for 12 hours. Other antidiarrheal medic ations may be used 
as clinically indicated.  In the event of severe or persistent diarrhea, nausea, anorexia , or vomiting 
associated with dehydration due to erlotinib therapy, erlotinib  should be 
interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to intensi vely treat the 
dehydration.    Patients may be informed that ski n toxicity is to be expected d uring treatment 
with erlotinib.  Skin toxicity may take the form of dry skin, r ash, acneiform 
eruption, or hair or nail changes.  Prophylactic treatment of t he skin may prevent 
or reduce skin toxicity.  The patient should be encouraged to u se an alcohol-free, 
emollient cream applied twice a day to the entire body as soon as the patient starts 
therapy with erlotinib.  Creams and ointments are recommended b ecause they 
have a greater ability to retain moisture than lotions.  Exampl es of suitable 
emollient creams include:  Neutrogena
® Norwegian formula, SARNA® Ultra, 
Vanicream™, Aveeno® (fragrance-free formulation), and Eucerin® cream.  Other 
over-the-counter aqueous creams or emulsifying ointments may al so provide 
symptomatic benefit.  Lotions are not recommended because they often contain 
alcohol, which may dry the skin.  Patients may also be encourag ed to use a 
titanium dioxide or zinc oxide-based sunscreen product applied to sun-exposed 
areas twice per day.

  Patients who develop skin toxicity and are symptomatic may be t reated with 
topical therapy such as hydrocortisone cream or clindamycin gel .  If needed, oral 
minocycline or oral doxycycline may be combined with the topica l therapy.  A 
topical immodulating cream such as Elidel could also be conside red.  For more 
severe rash, oral cortic osteroids may be ben eficial.  Patients who fail to respond to 
these measures may have the dose of erlotinib interrupted or re duced.  See Annex 
5 for more information on skin toxicity management. 
 
Minocycline may interfere with a nticoagulants and oral contrace ptives.  Patients 
treated with minocycline who are taking anticoagulants and/or o ral contraceptives 
should be monitored accordingly. 
 There have been infrequent repor ts of serious ILD, including fa tal events, in 
patients receiving erlotinib for t he treatment of NSCLC and oth er advanced solid 
tumors.  In the event of acute onset of new or progressive, unexplained pulmonary 
symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, where ILD is suspec ted, study drug 
should be interrupted pending diagnostic evaluation.  If ILD is  diagnosed, study 
drug should be permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as necessary.  Treatment with erlotinib should be used with extra caution in p atients with total 
bilirubin > 3 x ULN. Patients with hepatic impairment (total bi lirubin > ULN or 
Child-Pugh A, B and C) should be closely monitored during thera py with 
erlotinib.    
Gastrointestinal perforation (including fatalities) has been re ported in patients 
receiving erlotinib.  Patients receiving concomitant anti-angio genic agents, 
corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and/or taxane-based chemotherapy, or who have prior 
history of peptic ulceration ordi verticular disease are at incr eased risk.  
Permanently discontinue erlotinib in patients who develop gastr ointestinal 
perforation.  
 
Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal ne crolysis, which 
in some cases were fatal.  Interrupt or discontinue erlotinib t reatment if the patient 
develops severe bullous, bliste ring, or exfoliating conditions.    
 Ocular Disorders, including corn eal perforation or ulceration h ave been reported 
during use of erlotinib.  Other  ocular disorders including abno rmal eyelash 
growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis have been obser ved with erlotinib 
treatment and are known risk factors for corneal ulceration/perforation.  Interrupt or discontinue erlotinib therapy if patients present with acute /worsening ocular 
disorders such as unexplained eye pain.  
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 14 of 28  
  Erlotinib dosing should be discon tinued for any severe toxicity  that does not 
respond to treatment or failure to recover within 14 days from hematological 
toxicity attributable to erlotinib. 
 
6.4 Dose Escalation 
 
Patients who have had a prior dose reduction of erlotinib and w ho have no 
toxicity for at least 1 month of therapy may increase the dose of erlotinib provided 
they have experienced no grade ≥3 erlotinib-related toxicity. D ose escalation may 
be done by one dose level at a time and dose escalations should  not be done more 
often than every 28 days. Patients may not escalate to a dose l evel they received 
earlier where the patient experienced grade 4 toxicity.  
 
6.5 Supportive Care Guidelines 
  
Supportive measures including er ythropoietin, analgesics, blood  transfusions, 
antimicrobials, and hematopoie tic colony stimulating factors for treatment of 
cytopenias are permitted.   
 Prophylactic use of  hematopoietic colony stimulating factors is not permitted.  
 Other chemotherapy, investigational cytotoxic agents, radiation, or biologic therapy is prohibited while the patient is on study with the fo llowing exceptions 
during cycle 1: During the firs t 7 days of study only, patients  m a y  r e c e i v e  
leukaphereses to control elevated  blast and/or platelet counts and hydroxyurea is 
allowed for a maximum of the f irst 28 days on study.  Intrathecal chemotherapy to 
treat isolated CNS involvement  of leukemia is allowable. 
 
6.6 Patients may be taken off study at any time to receive a stem c ell transplant as 
clinically indicated.

10.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
 
10.1 Adverse event is any untoward me dical occurrence that may prese nt during 
treatment with a pharmaceutical p roduct but which does not nece ssarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  
 
 Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious  and unintended 
and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or 
therapy of disease or for the modification of physiologic funct ion.  
  Assessing causal connections between agents and disease is fun damental to the 
understanding of adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may  be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not bee n administered, 1) 
the event would not have happene d at all, 2) the event would ha ve occurred later 
than it actually did, or 3) the e vent would have been less severe. 
  The Investigator or physician de signee is responsible for verifying and providing 
source documentation for all a dverse events and assigning the a ttribution for each 
event for all subjects  enrolled on the trial. 
 10.2 Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the CTC AE version 4.0 and 
documented in medical record.  Only unexpected AEs will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this protocol.  Adverse events and protocol specific d ata will be entered 
into PDMS/CORe.  Expected event s during leukemia therapy are: 
 10.2.1 Myelosuppression related events (d ue to disease or leukemia the rapy) 
 
10.2.1.1 febrile or infection episodes not requiring management in the intensive care unit 
 10.2.1.2 epistaxis or bleeding except for catastrophic CNS or pulmonary hemorrhage 
 
10.2.1.3 anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia

Page 20 of 28  
  10.3 Abnormal hematologic values will not be recorded on the case re port form.  For 
abnormal chemical values, the apogee or nadir (whichever is appropriate) will be 
reported per course on the case report form. 
 
10.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “s erious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in a ny of the following 
outcomes: 
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experi ence that 
places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at imm ediate risk of 
death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not i nclude an 
adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form,  might have 
caused death. 
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation 
 A persistent or significant in capacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse dru g experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopard ize the patient 
or subject and may require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical ev ents include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emerg ency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inp atient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32).  
 Important medical events as def ined above, may also be consider ed serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator or the IND Sponsor, 
IND Office. 
 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeti ng the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance w ith the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of Texas M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for In vestigators 
on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices ”. Unless 
stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5  working days of 
knowledge of the event). 
 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 21 of 28  
   All life-threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the 
study drug, must have a writt en report submitted within 24 hours  (next 
working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Ma nager in the 
IND Office.  
 
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) w ill be 
utilized for safety reporting t o the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the fi rst protocol-
specific intervention,  until 30 days after the last dose of drug, unless the 
participant withdraws consent. S erious adverse events must be f ollowed until 
clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tests have returne d to baseline, 
progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acce ptable resolution 
of the event.  
 
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 3 0 day time 
period that are related to the study treatment must be reported  t o  t h e  I N D  
Office. This may include the deve lopment of a secondary maligna ncy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Spon sor (Safety 
Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ensure serious 
adverse events are reported according to the Code of Federal Re gulations, 
Good Clinical Practices, the prot ocol guidelines, the sponsor’s  guidelines, 
and Institutional Review Board policy.  Investigator Communication with Supporting Company: 
 
Serious adverse event will be reported by FAX concurrently to OSI Drug Safety 
(Fax number: 303-546-7706). Information not available at the time of the initial 
report (e.g., an end date for the  adverse event or laboratory v alues received after 
the report) must be documented on a follow-up report.  A final report to document resolution of the SAE is required.   Hospitalizations for the management of any 
expected adverse events (previously described) will not have an expedited report but it will be included in the annual report via the SAE  log. 
 
Pregnancies: Any pregnancy that occurs durin g study participation or within 4 
weeks of the patient’s last study drug administration should be reported using the 
MD Anderson SAE Form. To ensure patient safety each pregnancy m ust also be 
reported to OSI and the IND Of fice within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 22 of 28  
  The Investigator will follow the pregnant female until completi on of the 
pregnancy.  The Investigator will provide this information as a  follow-up to the 
initial SAE. 
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detec ted in an aborted 
fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or cong enital anomaly), the 
Investigator should follow the procedures for Expedited Reporti ng of SAEs. 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
17 
 
This is an open-label, to assess the efficacy and safety of erl otinib in patients with AML. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is ov erall response as defined in  section 9.3. 
 The historical experience in t his patient popula tion is that re sponse with standard therapy, 
when available, is less than 1%. In many instances (eg, patient s with myelodysplastic 
syndrome failing hypomethylating agents), no standard therapy i s even available. Thus, 
an overall response rate of 20% will be considered significant.   For the purpose of this 
analysis, a response will be cons idered if occurring after 3 mo nths of therapy (or earlier).  
 The Simon’s optimal two-stage design will be used to implement the study. A total of 29 
patients will be enrolled to thi s study. These sample sizes are  based on Simon’s optimal 
2-stage designs of alpha=0.05 with power of 95% (beta=0.05) to test the null hypothesis 
that the ORR will be ≤ 1%  versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR will be ≥ 20. At the first stage, 14 patients wi ll be enrolled. If no response i s observed among the 14 
patients, the trial will be terminated early for futility. If o ne or more patients have 
response, 15 more patients will be enrolled at the 2
nd stage. If at least 2 responses 
achieved after the completion of the 2nd stage, the study will conclude that the treatment 
improves the response rate from 1% to 20%.  The probability of early termination under the null hypothesis is 87%. The probability of seeing at least 2 responses under the null 
(ORR = 1%) is 3% while the probability of seeing at least 2 wit h an event rate of 20% is 
94.8%.  Further enrollment will continue during the interim analysis un less no responders 
(CR+PR+HI) have been reported by  the time of enrollment of the 14th subject being 
analyzed. In this event, enrollment will be suspended and these  14 subjects will be 
followed to further assess their responses. During this follow- up period, as soon as one 
response is observed, enrollment will resume. If no response is  observed after the 14 
subjects have been fully assessed, the trial will be terminated  for futility. 
 
11.1  Safety Monitoring 
 
Toxicities will be monitored using the method of Thall, Simon, and Estey [1]. 
Toxicity is defined as clinically significant, non-hematologic grade 3 or 4 
toxicities at least possibly related to erlotinib. We would lik e to control the rate of 
clinically significant, non-hematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities  at least possibly 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 23 of 28  
  related to erlotinib to be lower than 30% during the 1st 28 day s. Using this 
information a non-informative flat prior distribution of Beta (0.6, 1.4) was chosen 
for the new combination treatment. 
 
The interim monitoring will be first conducted after the first 10 patients have been 
evaluated and then be repeated  continuously. The monitoring rul e for toxicity is 
Pr(E, Tox > 0.3 | data) > 0.90,  where E, Tox is the proportion of any grade 3 or 4 
clinically significant, non-hema tologic toxicities at least pos sibly related to 
erlotinib. That is, the trial will be terminated if at any time  during the study there 
is a more than 90% chance that the average rate of grade 3 or 4  non-hematologic 
adverse events is more than 30%.   The stopping boundaries, based on these assumptions and monitoring conditions are shown in Table 1. For example, accrual will be stopped if 6  or more patients 
experience toxicity among the first 10 patients treated or if 7  or more patients 
experience toxicity in the first 13 patients. 
 
Table 1:  Stop accrual if the number of grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adve rse 
events is equal to or greater than indicated (i.e., # Grade 3 o r 4 toxicity) among 
the number of patients accr ued (i.e., # Patients) 
 
# Grade 3 or 4 toxicity 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 
# Patients 10 13 15 18 21 23 26

11.2 Statistical Analysis 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall response (ORR) as assessed by 
investigators and defined in s ection 9.3. The overall response rate (ORR) will be 
calculated for Using the intent-t o - t r e a t  ( I T T )  d a t a .  T h e  c o r r e s ponding 95% 
confidence interval will be derived.   Safety summaries will include tabulations in the form of tables  and listings. The 
frequency (number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs wil l be reported. 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 24 of 28  
  Additional AE summaries will include AE frequency by AE severit y and by 
relationship to study drug. Adverse events requiring discontinu ation of study drug 
will be summarized separately, both overall and by AE severity and by 
relationship to study drug. Subjects found to have abnormal val ues considered 
clinically significant will be summarized. Laboratory shift tab les containing 
counts and percentages will be prepared by laboratory parameter  and time. 
Summary tables will be prepared for each laboratory parameter. Figures of 
changes in laboratory parameters over time will be generated. 
 
Subject demographics (including age, sex, and race/ethnicity) a nd other baseline 
characteristics (including ECOG performance status, disease bur den, and number 
of prior therapies) will be summ arized. Summary statistics will  include: means, 
standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportions for 
categorical variables.  For secondary endpoints, descriptive statistics will be used to  s u m m a r i z e  t h e  
expression of biomarkers and the concentrations of plasma erlot inib.  The 
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the expressions of biomarkers and concentrations of plasma erlotinib between patients with an d without 
response.

  Appendix  A:  Pharmacodynamic Investigations During Erlotinib O ral Therapy in Patients 
with AML Who Have Failed Prior Therapy.  
 
The major objectives of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  investigations during this 
clinical trial are as follows:  
1. To unveil which one or all three distinct biologic processes ar e blocked by erlotinib such 
as cell death by apoptosis, irreve rsible cell cycle blockade or  terminal differentiation in 
AML
1. 
2. To determine the molecular mechanism involved in erlotinib indu ced off-target effect on 
numerous cell-cycle proteins and onco-proteins2. 
3. To determine the effect of erlotinib on Syk (a non-receptor tyr osine kinase) inhibition3, a 
recently identified novel target of AML.  
4. To relate plasma pharmacokinetic and cellular pharmacodynamic e ndpoints and to seek 
correlations between these measurements and response to therapy .  
 Only patients entering at MD Anderson Cancer Center will be stu died.  All patients with ≥5,000 
WBC/l of peripheral blood will be requested to participate in the c ellular pharmacodynamic 
studies. Patients will sign consen t forms to enter these invest igations.   
 Once a patient has consented to participate in the investigatio n, please contact Ms Yuling Chen 
(pager 713 404-2550) in The Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology (Dr. Gandhi, phone, 713 792-3336) to coordinate scheduling of blood samples.   To facilitate preparedness for 
laboratory studies, please plan on initiating therapy in the subsequent morning if the clinical situation allows and please inform us as soon as there is a pos sibility of patient entering the 
clinical trial.      
Blood samples will be collected at the following times during C ycle 1.**   
 
1. 0 (Pre-dose) 
2. 6 hour 
3. 24 hours 
4. Day 5 
5. Day 28  
 
Each blood sample will be collected in a Vacutainer green top t ube.  The samples will be mixed 
and immediately put on ice-bath.  Samples will be brought to Dr . Gandhi’s laboratory in the Tan 
zone (T6.3932).   The blood will  be centrifuged and plasma will  be separated, transferred to 
storage tubes and immediately fr ozen, and stored until analysis.  After removal of plasma, the 
blood cells will be resuspended in  PBS and CLL lymphocytes will  be isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque 
density-gradient centrifugation pr ocedures.  Cells will be used  for the following laboratory 
endpoints.    **Every effort will be made to collect all samples at all time points for all patients; however, 
missing collection in one or more of these time points in occasional patients will not be considered a protocol de viation/violation.

NOTE:  We may not be able to do all studies in every patient.  This will be decided based on 
diagnosis and number of leukemia cells recovered from the perip heral blood sample.   
 Plasma pharmacokinetics:  Plasma will be separated from the per ipheral blood samples and 
analyzed by a reference laborat ory for concentration of erlotin ib.   
 Cell death assay:  The leukemic blast cells before and during erlotinib therapy (1 x 10
6 cells) 
from real-time will be stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide to determine induction of apoptosis using FACS calibur/flow cytometry machin e
2.   
 Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization assay:  The leuke mic blast cells before and 
during erlotinib therapy (1 x 106 cells) obtained in real-time will be stained with DIOC6 and 
propidium iodide to determine the loss of mitochondrial outer membrane polarity using FACS calibur/flow cytometry machine
2.   
 Assessment of differentiation: Because preclinical studies illu strated either/or effect of apoptosis 
or differentiation caused by erlotinib in AML cell lines, we wi ll determine if erlotinib can 
overcome the block of differen tiation during erlotinib therapy1,2. The leukemic blasts before and 
during erlotinib therapy (1 x 106 cells) obtained in real-time will be washed and stained with P E-
conjugated anti-CD11b antibody (myelomonocytic marker from Bect on Dickinson; clone 
ICRF44) and Isotypic mouse IgG1 (Becton Dickinson) to measure CD11b positive cells using flow cytometry.  Measurement of cell cy cle blockade: Phospho-proteome analysis r evealed that off target effect of 
erlotinib can influence the phosp horylation status of numerous proteins including the 
retinoblastoma (Rb) protein whic h is critical for G1/S transition of the cell cycle1. Therefore, we 
plan to measure the total and phospho-Rb (Ser-807/811) before a nd during therapy using 
immunoblotting technique.   Measurement of JAK/STAT proteins: Erlotinib is known to induce apoptosis via inhibiting the 
phosphorylation of oncogenic JAK2 kinase on Tyr 1007/1008 in AM L cell lines, which 
otherwise would phosphorylate STAT-5 (Tyr-694), a transcription  factor and a direct target of 
JAK21.   T h e r e f o r e  o u r  p l a n  i s  t o  m e a s u r e  t h e  J A K 2  a n d  S T A T - 5  p r o t e i n s and their post-
translational modification duri ng erlotinib therapy using immun oblotting experiments.  
 Measurement of NPM-1 and p14
ARF:  In AML cell lines, the anti-ne oplastic action of erlotinib 
was associated with redistribution of NPM-1 (nucleophosmin-1, a  myelomonocytic master 
regulator) and p14ARF (a tumor suppressor protein) from nucleus to the cytoplasm1.  So we will 
be measuring these two proteins  by immuno-fluorescence method a nd immunoblotting 
experiments by staining with an tibodies specific for NPM-1 and p14ARF before and during 
erlotinib therapy.  Measurement of Syk and the downstream molecules: Two recent imp ortant findings, one, 
erlotinib has off-target effect on Syk tyrosine kinase and two,  inhibition of Syk protein induced 
cytotoxicity in AML - identified Syk as an AML target4,5. Therefore our plan is to monitor Syk

  phosphorylation during therapy and the consequent modulation in  Syk-regulated pathways such 
as NFKB, PI3-K/AKT6,7, STAT-38, mTOR9 and MAPK/ERK pathways10.  In addition, inhibition 
of BCR-induced Syk activa tion down-regulates Mcl-111, so we will be evaluating the expression 
and functional role of all the a bove said proteins during erlot inib therapy.

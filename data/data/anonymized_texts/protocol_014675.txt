Study Phase Phase IIa 
Background  Introduction of rituximab into first-line non-Hodgkin’s l ymphoma (NHL) 
regimens in recent years has improved cure rate in several NHL subtypes 
by at least 10%. Despite extensive use of r ituximab across a range of NHL 
subtypes in combination with chemotherapy, as a single agent, or as 
maintenance therapy, there is still a high unmet medical need for patients 
with refractory or relapsed NHL (eg, mantle cell lymphoma [MCL] , 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL] and follicular lymphoma [FL]). 
The B-lymphocyte lineage specific surface antigen CD19 is the earliest 
and broadest of the selective B-cell markers, which is highly expressed in 
most patients with B-cell NHL. Because of this expression pattern, an 
anti-CD19 antibody may have clinical utility as a new therapeutic 
approach to NHL treatment. MOR00208 is an Fc- engineered humanized 
monoclonal antibody with significantly enhanced antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
phagocytosis (ADPC) and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis).  
Preliminary data from a currently ongoing Phase I study in adult patients 
with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL demonstrated that 8 weekly 
administrations of MOR00208 are safe and well-tolerated, with a 
recommended biological dose of 12 mg/kg. The most common study  
drug-related adverse events (AEs) reported so far are infusion-related 
reactions, leukopenia/neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 8 of 84 Study Purpose/Rationale Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma accounts for approximately 5% of all new 
cancer cases. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of 
lymphoproliferative malignancies which are in 90% of cases derived of B 
cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive B- cell lymphoma, 
accounts for one-third of NHL. After standard treatment with the 
anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in combination with CHOP chemotherapy 
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristin, prednisone) still 30% to 40% 
of DLBCL patients are relapsed or refractory, requiring further treatment. 
Mantle cell lymphoma, like DLBCL, is an aggressive form of NHL but is 
far less responsive to treatment than DLBCL.  
Follicular lymphoma, an indolent B-cell lymphoma, accounts for 22% of 
NHL. Even if the overall response rate is high, standard therapy is rarely 
curative and nearly all patients will relapse. There is no standard-of- care 
treatment available for patients with advanced FL. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety 
of MOR00208 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory NHL. 
Study Objectives (Key 
Primary and Secondary) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

Design and Methodology This is a Phase IIa open-label, multicenter safety and efficacy study that 
will enrol approximately 40 to 120 adult patients with refractory or 
relapsed NHL who have received at least one prior therapy. The study will 
enrol different NHL subtypes: FL, DLBCL, MCL and other indolent NHL 
(marginal zone lymphoma [MZL], mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 
lymphoma [MALT], etc). Efficacy will be determined with the ORR,  
which will be evaluated by using the revised IWG criteria (Cheson 
response criteria) and will be defined as the proportion of patients with 
CR and PR (CR+PR).  
The study will employ a two- stage design and may be stopped for futility 
(lack of efficacy) for any NHL subtype, thus potentially reducing the 
number of patients exposed to ineffective treatment.  
Stage 1 – At least ten patients per NHL subtype (in total a minimum of 
40 patients) will be enrolled to receive MOR00208 12 mg/kg IV weekly 
infusions for 8 weeks. After 8 and 12 weeks of dosing (for patients having 
had at least SD at Week 8), patients will be evaluated to determine if it is 
futile to continue testing patients of a subtype. If in stage 1 fewer than 2 
patients per NHL subtype have a best response of PR or better, then the 
subtype cohort will be stopped for futility. In other words, no more 
patients of that subtype will be enrolled in the next stage. If at least 2 
patients per NHL subtype have a response of PR or better, then this cohort 
will progress to Stage 2.  
Regardless of futility decisions, any patients with a response of at least SD 
will qualify for further 4 weeks of dosing.  
Stage 2 – An additional 20 patients will be enrolled for each NHL subtype 
cohort demonstrating a response of PR or better in 2 patients in Stage 1. 
After 8 weeks, the ORR per cohort will be evaluated.  
All patients with a response of at least SD will qualify for further 4 weeks 
of dosing.  
Maintenance treatment  – Patients with an ongoing response of at least 
PR at the end of Cycle 3 (regardless of Stage 1 or 2) may receive further 
study drug until progression.  
Population Adult patients with refractory or relapsed B-cell NHL who have received 
at least 1 completed cycle of combination therapy with rituximab + 
chemotherapy OR at least 4 weekly administrations of rituximab as 
monotherapy.  
1) FL  
2) DLBCL  
3) MCL  
4) Other indolent NHL

Sample Size, Planned 
Total Number of Study 
Sites and Locations The study will enrol patients in two stages. Enrolment to the stages will be 
consecutive.  
The primary objective of the study is to assess the antitumor activity as 
measured by ORR after two cycles of treatment with MOR00208 (two 
28-day cycles). A two- stage design is used to minimize exposure of NHL 
subtypes not showing responsiveness to MOR00208. No formal sample 
size estimations for determination of futility were computed for Stage 1. 
The number of patients to be used in this stage was determined to be the 
minimum number needed to adequately determine futility in any specific 
NHL subtype.  
The entire study will enrol between 40 to 120 patients, dependent upon 
patient response in each subtype in Stage 1.  
Stage 1:  Approximately 40 patients, a similar number of patients will be 
enrolled per NHL subtype:  
 FL: a t least 10 patients  
 DLB CL: at least 10 patients  
 MCL : at least 10 patients  
 other  indolent NHL:  at least 10 patients  
Observing less than 2 responses (at least PR) in stage 1 in any NHL 
subtype will be the criterion for discontinuing evaluation of MOR00208 in 
that NHL subtype. If the study drug is effective with a true ORR of 30%, 
the probability to stop for futility after the first stage for a specific NHL 
subtype, is only 14.9%.  
Stage 2:  For those NHL subtypes with 2 or more responders, an 
additional approximately 20 patients will be enrolled for a total of 30 
patients per subtype. Assuming that the true ORR of any NHL type is 
30% and that the number of responses actually observed in the s tudy 
corresponds to the expected number of responses (9 responses), N=30 
would yield a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the ORR of 
14.7%.  
Up to a maximum of approximately 80 additional patients, a similar 
number of patients will be enrolled per “responding” NHL subtype. S ome 
of the cohorts may have been stopped for futility after Stage 1:  
 FL: a t least 20  patients  
 DLB CL: at least 20 patients  
 MCL : at least 20 patients  
 other  indolent NHL:  at least 20 patients

Dose, Route of 
Administration, 
Treatment Regimen MOR00208 dose: 12 mg/kg  
Patients will receive up to 2 cycles for a total of 8 infusions: each 28- day 
cycle will consist of a MOR00208 infusion on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and 
Day 22 of the cycle. Premedication will be administered for the first 
3 infusions.  
Patients with a response of at least SD on Day 28 of Cycle 2 will qualify 
for a further cycle (Cycle 3) of MOR00208 with infusions on Day 1, Day 
8, Day 15 and Day 22 of that cycle.  
Patients who have an ongoing response of at least PR may be eligible for 
continued treatment every two weeks or monthly, until disease 
progression.  
Supply, Preparation and 
Administration MOR00208 DP is a lyophilisate supplied in single-use 20-mL glass vials. 
Each vial contains 200  mg of MOR00208 for reconstitution with 5 mL 
water for injection (WFI). Reconstitution yields 40 mg/mL MOR00208 in 
25 mM sodium citrate, 200 mM trehalose and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 
20 at pH 6.0. Each product vial is intended to deliver 5 mL of drug 
solution or 200 mg of MOR00208. MOR00208 will be diluted into a 
250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride for injection. 
MOR00208 will be administered via IV infusion using an in-line filter in 
all cases.  
Visit Schedule and 
Assessments Refer to Schedule of Assessments in Section 10. 
Efficacy Assessments Response will be determined using the revised IWG response criteria for 
malignant lymphoma (Cheson response criteria), evaluated in terms of 
ORR (CR + PR), stable disease (SD), DoR, TTP, and PFS. Response rates 
will also be determined using CT scan.  
Pharmacodynamics will be assessed by measuring B-, T- and NK cell 
populations; for patients with a CR, bone marrow histology will be 
performed. 
Special Safety 
Assessments Physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
haematological and biochemical tests and number and severity of AEs.

Data Analysis  The primary efficacy endpoint will be ORR as determined by using 
revised IWG response criteria for malignant lymphoma. The final ORR 
for each subtype will be the rate of patients who met the criteria of PR or 
CR at the end of either the second or third cycle or during a response 
assessment in the follow-up period (best response). Patients with PD after 
Day 28 of the second cycle will be discontinued and classified as 
nonresponders. Those with SD after Day 28 of the second cycle will be 
allowed to continue treatment into a third cycle.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 23 of 84 4 BACKGROUND 
 
4.1 Overview of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) accounts for approximately 5% of all new cancer cases. 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies and 
is in 90% of cases derived of B cells. 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, accounts for 
one-third of NHL, and after standard treatment with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab with the 
chemotherapy CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristin and prednisone) 30% to 40% 
of patients are still relapsed or refractory, requiring further treatment. Mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL), like DLBCL, is an aggressive NHL but is far less responsive to treatment than 
DLBCL.  
Follicular lymphoma (FL), an indolent B-cell lymphoma, accounts for 22% of NHL. Even if 
the overall response rate is high, standard therapy is rarely curative and nearly all patients will 
relapse. There is no standard-of-care treatment available for patients with advanced FL. 
Therapy with a monoclonal antibody would have the potential to improve response rates and 
overall survival without increasing haematologic toxicity. 
This is supported by initial data from other anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies (MDX-1342 and 
SAR3419) and the bispecific antibody blinatumomab (Viardot, 2011), MDX-1342 a 
glycoengineered fully human anti-CD19 Ab (Camacho, 2009), SAR3419 a humanized IgG1 
conjugated with DM4 (a cytotoxic maytansinoid derivate) (Coiffier, 2011) published 
preliminary data from their Phase I studies indicating that a CD19 is a valid target and that an 
anti-CD19 therapy has potential clinical benefit. No significant myelosuppression was reported 
from these trials.  
4.2 Overview of MOR00208 
MOR00208 (synonym: XmAb®5574), an Fc engineered mAb that binds to the human B-cell 
surface antigen CD19, is being developed for the treatment of CD19+ lymphoid malignancies. 
The engineered antibody possesses variable modes of significantly increased tumor 
cytotoxicity relative to the parent, nonengineered, murine 4G7 anti-CD19 antibody. The 
increase in binding of MOR00208 Fc to Fc gamma receptors (Fc γR) due to engineered 
muta
tions significantly enhances in vitro ADCC, ADCP, and direct cytotoxic effects 
(apoptosis) on tumor relative to the unmodified antibody. MOR00208 has not been shown to 
mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity.  
In preclinical studies, MOR00208 has demonstrated to significantly enhance in vitro ADCC, 
ADCP, and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on CD19+ tumor cell line spanning a broad 
range of human lymphomas and leukaemias (Burkitt’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia [CLL], hairy cell leukaemia [HCL], CD19+ chronic myeloid leukaemia [CML], 
DLBCL, and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL]) expressing different levels of CD19 
antigen (15000 to 105000 molecules/cell). Similar effects were also noted on freshly isolated 
patient CLL or ALL cells and are also expected to translate to primary NHL cells since the 
expression range reported for ALL and CLL B cells covers the respective range observed for

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 24 of 84 NHL B cells (Ginaldi et al., 1998; Olejniczak et al., 2006). In vivo, MOR00208 has also shown 
a superior efficacy compared with its nonengineered version as demonstrate in xenograft 
models of human lymphoma inducing a significant reduction of tumor growth and increased 
survival. 
Tissue cross-reactivity studies have shown that the pattern and distribution of MOR00208 
binding to cynomolgus monkey tissues closely parallels that of human tissues. Flow cytometry 
experiments with MOR00208 show binding to human and cynomolgus monkey B cells. 
However, similar results were not observed with B cells of other common laboratory species 
(rat, mouse, rabbit and dog). Therefore, the range of pharmacology studies was restricted to 
human and cynomolgus monkey cell-based in vitro systems, CD19+ human B-cell tumor 
xenograft models in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, and to cynomolgus 
monkeys in vivo. In cynomolgus monkeys, in vivo B-lymphocyte depletion in peripheral 
blood, bone marrow, spleen and in inguinal lymph nodes, the anticipated response to 
MOR00208, was observed. Cynomolgus monkeys were judged to be the only relevant 
common laboratory species for toxicity studies. 
The results of studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity of 
MOR00208 are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). The findings in preclinical 
toxicology studies were limited to the expected pharmacologic effects of MOR00208 and no 
unanticipated toxicity was observed. These studies include a nonclinical toxicology study 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to support the use of MOR00208 in human clinical trials. 
The supporting Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant, multiple-dose toxicology study 
involved four administrations of MOR00208 over an 8-week time period. Other than the 
expected dose-related decreases in B-lymphocyte level and in cellularity of spleen tissues, 
there were no MOR00208-related changes identified in clinical observations, food 
consumption, body weight, electrocardiography, ophthalmology, urinalysis, coagulation, serum 
chemistry, and gross anatomic pathology at doses up to 50 mg/kg. In addition, GLP-compliant 
tissue cross-reactivity studies were performed on normal tissue panels from human and 
cynomolgus monkey donors. No specific staining to structures other than the expected 
mononuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes and haematopoietic precursor cells was observed. 
Study XmAb®5574-01, a Phase I study in patients with CLL/SLL, was the first study of 
XmAb®5574/MOR00208 in humans. The preliminary results of Study XmAb®5574-01 
showed an acceptable safety profile as well as preliminary activity. One dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT) of Grade 4 neutropenia lasting at least 7 days was observed during 
Study XmAb®5574-01 in one patient at the maximum-administered dose (12 mg/kg) out of 
16 patients treated at this dose level. 
Because the major pharmacologic effect of MOR00208 is B-cell depletion, investigators 
should be vigilant for adverse events (AEs) associated with the clinical use of B-cell depleting 
anti-CD20 mAbs as similar effects might be observed with MOR00208. 
4.2.1 Clinical Experience with MOR00208 
A 
Phase I study of MOR00208 (XmAb®5574-01) in adult patients with relapsed/refractory 
CLL/SLL was the first study of XmAb®5574/MOR00208 in humans. During the course of this 
study, 27 patients were treated in dose cohorts from 0.3 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg (n=16) 
intravenously on a weekly schedule for 8 weeks, with an extra dose administered on Day 4. 
Patients enroled in the expansion phase of Cohort 6 (12 mg/kg) received an additional

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 25 of 84 4 monthly doses of MOR00208 after completing the initial 2 cycles of therapy if there was no 
evidence of disease progression or intolerable drug-related toxicity. 
The preliminary antitumor activity of MOR00208 observed in this Phase I study is encouraging 
and provides support for additional studies. Twenty of 23 patients (87%) with evaluable data in 
the clinical database had a reduction in their absolute lymphocyte count (ALC; range 2% to 
99%), with 17 of 20 (85%) having reductions of >50% from their baseline values. Lymph node 
size reduction (range 4% to 89%) as assessed by CT scans were observed in 13 of 18 (72%) of 
patients to date. While the number of patients in this Phase I study is limited to draw definitive 
conclusions, there appeared to be a dose response relationship with greater reductions in ALCs 
and nodal size reduction in the higher dose cohorts. 
The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was not established, since only one DLT occurred. 
Therefore the selected dose (12 mg/kg) from study XmAb®5574-01 will be used in this clinical 
trial. 
4.2.2 Safety of MOR00208 
MO
R00208 provides a novel mechanism of action that may add to the care of NHL. Based on 
the available data from the completed clinical study of MOR00208 (Study XmAb®5574-01), 
nonclinical studies and experiments, and literature data on CD19, the sponsor is of the opinion 
that the potential benefit of MOR00208 outweighs the potential risks. It is expected that the 
potential risks will be adequately controlled by the design of this trial (eg, by the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria) and by frequent monitoring of potential adverse drug reactions throughout 
the entire study. Based on the preliminary results of the clinical study of MOR00208 in patients 
with CLL/SLL, anticipated possible risks associated with administration of MOR00208 include 
the following:  
One DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia (normal absolute neutrophil count [ANC] at baseline) lasting 
at least 7 days was observed at the maximum-administered dose of 12 mg/kg. 
As of 11 May 2012, 5 serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported in 5 patients; 2 were 
considered possibly related to the study drug. One related SAE of febrile neutropenia (Grade 3) 
occurred in the same patient who experienced the DLT. The second related SAE of tumor lysis 
syndrome (Grade 3) occurred after the first dose of study drug. The other 3 SAEs were 
assessed as unrelated by the investigator and included rash (Grade 1), pneumococcal 
pneumonia (Grade 3), and sinusitis/acute bilateral otitis media (Grade 3).  
The most frequent AE was infusion-related reaction in trial XmAb®5574-01, which occurred in 
12 of 21 (57.1%) patients, despite premedication with antihistamine, acetaminophen and 
corticosteroids as mandated for the first 3 infusions of MOR00208. All infusion reactions 
occurred during the patient’s first infusion (typically within the first 15 minutes of the start of 
infusion), as has been described with other B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody therapies in 
this patient population. Infusion reaction was more frequent in the higher dose cohorts, 
although infusion reaction did occur in at least one patient in every cohort. The infusion 
reactions were all Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. All patients were able to complete their dose 
after pausing of the infusion and symptomatic treatment, some with a reduction in the infusion 
rate.

Protocol Amendment 5, Final v7.0 EudraCT Number: 2012-002659-41 
 
MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 26 of 84 Leukopenia and neutropenia has been observed in 14% and 24% of patients, respectively, with 
one patient experiencing Grade 4 neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia has also been reported at a 
frequency of 14% in patients. 
Since a major pharmacologic effect of MOR00208 is B-cell depletion, risks associated with the 
use of approved anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapeutics based on their labeling should be 
considered. These anticipated possible risks include the following: B-cell depletion, absolute 
lymphocyte reduction, infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, 
neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, hepatitis B reactivation, progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy, mucocutaneous reactions and infections. 
Anticipated possible risks associated with administration of MOR00208 are described in detail 
in the IB for MOR00208. 
5 STUDY PURPOSE/RATIONALE 
MOR00208 has enhanced cytotoxicity against CD19+ tumors in both in vitro and in vivo, and 
it is expected to provide potent recruitment of immune effector cells as a result of the Fc 
engineering. MOR00208 is being developed for the treatment of CD19+ lymphoid 
malignancies. CLL, NHL, HCL and B-precursor ALL represent tumor types that have been 
well characterized in regard to expression of the CD19 antigen. 
Introduction of rituximab into first-line NHL regimens in the recent years has improved cure 
rate in several NHL subtypes by at least 10%. Despite extensive use of rituximab across a 
range of NHL subtypes in combination with chemotherapy, as a single agent, or as 
maintenance therapy, there is still a high unmet medical need for patients with refractory or 
relapsed NHL (eg, MCL, DLBCL, and FL). (van Oers, 2011; Rummel, 2010; Parekh, 2011) 
The B-lymphocyte lineage-specific surface antigen CD19 is the earliest and broadest of the 
selective B-cell markers, which is highly expressed on the malignant cells in most patients with 
B-cell NHL. Because of this expression pattern, an anti-CD19 antibody may have clinical 
utility as a new therapeutic approach to NHL treatment. MOR00208 is an Fc-engineered mAb 
with significantly enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-
dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADPC), and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on the 
tumor relative to the unmodified antibody. 
Several mAbs targeting CD19 are currently being evaluated in early-phase clinical trials, 
demonstrating preliminary efficacy. Data from the Phase I trial in patients with 
relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (study XmAb®5574-01) demonstrate that 
MOR00208/XmAb®5574 is well-tolerated and has potential clinical benefit. With an enhanced 
cytotoxicity and safety/tolerability profile, MOR00208 has the potential to be an effective 
therapy for patients with CD19-expressing B-cell malignancies. The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of MOR00208 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
NHL.

6.1 Primary Objective 
 To assess the antitumor activity of single-agent MOR00208 in adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory NHL who have received at least 1 prior therapy containing rituximab as one 
of the treatments. 
 
6.2 Secondary Objectives 
 To evaluate the duration of response 
 To establish safety and tolerability of MOR00208 
 To assess the potential immunogenicity of MOR00208 
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MOR00208 in patients with 
relapsed or refractory NHL 
 
7 STUDY DESIGN 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Investigational Plan 
This is a Phase IIa open-label, multicenter safety and efficacy study of MOR00208, that will 
enrol approximately 40 to 120 adult patients with refractory or relapsed NHL who have 
received at least 1 prior therapy containing rituximab. 
The study will enrol patients from four different NHL subtypes: FL, DLBCL, MCL and other 
indolent NHL (MZL, MALT, etc.). 
The study will employ a two-stage design where the decision to further enrol any NHL subtype 
in Stage 2 will depend on best responses after 2 or 3 cycles in Stage 1. 
Stage 1 – At least ten patients per NHL subtype (a minimum of 40 patients in total) will be 
enrolled to receive MOR00208 12 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks. After 8 and 12 weeks (the latter 
applicable only for patients with at least SD after 8 weeks) of dosing, patients will be evaluated 
for response. If in Stage 1 fewer than 2 patients per NHL subtype have a best response of PR or 
better, then continued enrolment in that cohort will be stopped for futility. If at least 2 patients 
per NHL subtype have a best response of PR or better, then additional patients will be enrolled 
into Stage 2 for that subtype cohort.  
Any patients with a response of at least stable disease (SD) in Stage 1 will qualify for a further 
4 weeks of dosing. 
Stage 2 – At least an additional 20 patients will be enrolled for each NHL cohort demonstrating 
a response in Stage 1. After 8 weeks, the ORR will be evaluated for each NHL cohort. 
Any patients with a response of at least stable disease (SD) in Stage 2 will qualify for a further 
4 weeks of dosing.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 32 of 84 Enrolment to treatment will be performed after all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been 
confirmed and the patient is found to be eligible.  
Patients can be re-screened once if since the last visit (either screening or baseline visit) at least 
four weeks have elapsed. 
In cases of re-screening, patients need to be reconsented and a new patient number will 
be assigned. 
Re-screening procedures 
Patients can be re-screened at the discretion of the investigator under certain circumstances. 
Re-screening is restricted to one attempt per patient and may be performed only if one of the 
following criteria is met: 
 If the inclusion of a patient who has already consented and who met all the inclusion 
and has met none of the exclusion criteria is delayed due to an unexpected change in 
the patient’s personal situation (e.g. family issues), 
 If a patient previously failed to be eligible due to any event (e.g. planned surgery) that 
has since been resolved, 
 If the allowed concomitant medication doses have stabilized, 
 If laboratory values that prevented the inclusion of a patient based on the first screening 
attempt have changed to satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the 
currently valid study protocol,  
 If a patient who previously failed screening becomes eligible for the study, based on a 
change in the inclusion and exclusion criteria following a protocol amendment. 
 If a patient failed screening due to non-progressed/non-relapsed disease at the time of 
screening and later is clinically diagnosed as having progressed/relapsed. 
 
NOTE:  A patient should only be re-screened if there is a clear indication that the patient may 
be eligible according to the currently valid study protocol.   
In these cases, if previous screening activities were discontinued and enrollment did not occur, 
the following procedure should be implemented: 
 the patient must sign and date a new Informed Consent Form as part of the screening 
proc
edure, 
 the patient will receive a new unique inclusion/identification number and, in case of 
el
igibility, a new unique number via the IWRS, 
 a new Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed, 
 the patient will be documented as re-screened in the source documents, and 
 recording of medical histories, physical examinations, prior NHL treatments, adverse 
events, and concurrent medications will be transcribed from the previously used to the 
new CRF if the conditions and medications still apply to the current status of the

must be completed again. 
A re-screened patient can be enrolled if all current inclusion criteria are met and none of the 
exclusion criteria are met.  
9 TREATMENT 
Each investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study drug and other study 
materials from the sponsor via delegated depot are correctly received, recorded, handled and 
stored safely and properly in accordance with all applicable regulatory guidelines, and used in 
accordance with this protocol. The investigator can delegate these tasks to a dedicated 
pharmacist or another person (according to the national laws and regulations). Drug 
accountability forms will be kept by the site during the study and will be checked during 
monitoring visits. 
For the first 5 patients in the study (irrespective of the subgroup) the first study drug infusion 
will be administered as in-patients (ie, these patients will remain in the hospital overnight for 
the first infusion). Whether subsequent patients will have to stay overnight will then be decided 
by the sponsor after consultation with the investigators concerned. 
All study drug containers – ie, outer packing and vial - (opened, unopened, or empty) must be 
returned to the sponsor/sponsor’s designee and will be destroyed by the sponsor or 
representative after the study and overall drug accountability has been completed by the 
sponsor or representative.  
Opened or empty vials should only be returned if this is not in violation of local guidances or 
SOPs. 
A list of study drug and other materials that have been returned or destroyed must be prepared 
and signed by the principal investigator or designee. If there are any discrepancies, an 
explanation for these should also be provided. 
The IB for MOR00208 or other safety documents for study drugs will be supplied to the study 
sites. 
9.1 Patient Numbering 
This is an open-label study. Patients will not be randomized. 
For each patient screened, the investigator or designee will log into the Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS) and will enter the age at time of consent and the gender. The IWRS 
will allocate the next available screening identification (ID) number, ensuring that screening ID 
numbers are assigned sequentially per center. These numbers (7 digits) are made up of the 
country code (2 letters) (eg, PL, DE), the site number (2 digits) (01, 02), and a 3-digit number 
(001, 002) given to each patient in sequence as they are screened at site. Leading zeros will be 
used for the site and 3-digit number part of the ID number to ensure a consistent length of 
7 digits. The investigator will enter the information (ie, age at time of consent and the 
associated screening ID number) into the confidential patient identification list. The patient 
will be identified by the previously assigned screening ID number throughout the study. No 
additional patient number will be used. For numbering of patients who were re-screened, 
please see Section 8.4.

9.2 Investigational Medicinal Products 
9.2.1 Instructions for Prescribing and Taking the Study Drug 
De
tailed descriptions concerning correct storage conditions, handling, solution preparation, and 
administration will be provided in a drug preparation manual for MOR00208. 
MOR00208 DP is a white to yellowish lyophilisate for reconstitution with 5 mL water for 
injection (WFI), supplied in single-use 20 mL glass vials. The solution after reconstitution is 
colorless to slightly yellow and essentially free of foreign particles; it may contain few white to 
whitish product-related particles. Reconstitution with 5 mL WFI yields approximately 5.4 mL 
of drug product that contains 40 mg/mL of MOR00208, 25 mM sodium citrate, 200 mM 
trehalose and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20 at pH 6.0. Each product vial is intended to deliver 
5 mL of drug solution or 200 mg of MOR00208. Each vial of MOR00208 is packaged in a 
single drug product box. 
MOR00208 DP must be stored under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C in an appropriately locked 
room accessible only to the pharmacist(s), the investigator, or a duly designated person.  
For administration, MOR00208 will be diluted into a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% 
sodium chloride for injection. MOR00208 DP and commercially available 0.9% sodium 
chloride saline for injection will be provided to investigational sites by the sponsor or delegated 
depot.  
The individual MOR00208 infusion will be prepared and administered at the study site, 
according to directions of the sponsor, which will be provided in a drug preparation manual. In 
general, a vial of MOR00208 must be used as soon as possible after reconstitution with WFI; 
any solution remaining in the vial has to be discarded. After dilution for infusion, 
administration of MOR00208 should take place as soon as possible. Maximum allowed storage 
times and conditions will be detailed in the drug preparation manual. 
For the first infusion, IV infusion should be started with an infusion rate of 70mL/h for the first 
30 minutes and then subsequently increased to a rate of 125mL/h; the total infusion duration 
should ideally not exceed 2.5 hours. All subsequent MOR00208 infusions will be administered 
IV at a constant rate over a 2-hour period. In all cases an in-line filter has to be used. 
MOR00208 infusion should NOT be administered as an IV push or bolus. 
Resuscitation equipment should be readily available. 
9.2.2 Treatment 
The
 dose of MOR00208 will be 12 mg/kg, which was established in study XmAb®5574-01. 
For all patients, weight measurements are to be performed at each visit (except Day 2 of Cycle 
1) and the values are to be entered into the eCRF recording the day of the actual measurement.  
Measurements can be done up to 24 hours before study drug administration. The weight 
obtained at at each visit before study drug administration should be used to calculate the study 
drug dose for the respective visit.

REMARK:   An acute infusion reaction may occur with an agent that causes cytokine release (eg, monoclonal antibodies or 
other biological agents). Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve 
completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity 
(including drug fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness of breath); Fatigue 
(asthenia, lethargy, malaise); Headache; Hypertension; Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; 
Rash/desquamation; Rigors/chills; Sweating (diaphoresis); Tachycardia; Tumor pain (onset or exacerbation of tumor pain due 
to treatment); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); Vomiting  
 
During Cycle 1, premedication including antipyretics (eg, acetaminophen 500-650 mg PO or 
IV or equivalent), histamine H1 receptor blockers (eg, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV or 
equivalent), and glucocorticosteroids (methylprednisolone 80 to 120 mg IV or equivalent;

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 36 of 84 please refer to Table  17.6) should be given for the first 3 infusions. In medically justified cases, 
the investigator may use other doses and/or formulations if this is documented thoroughly in 
the eCRF and the source data.  
Premedication for patients who do not experience any infusion reactions during the first 
3 infusions will be optional for subsequent infusions at the discretion of the investigator. 
Otherwise, the premedication should be continued for subsequent administrations of 
MOR00208. In case of development of rigor or chills treatment with meperidine is allowed. 
Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions 
If a patient presents with Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion reactions: 
 Infusion should be stopped immediately 
 The patient should receive appropriate further treatment with an antihistamine and/or 
paracetamol or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) if clinically indicated. 
 Once symptoms are resolved or reduced to “mild” by investigator assessment the 
infusion can be continued at an infusion rate of 50%. If after one hour, the patient’s 
symptoms do not return and vital signs are stable, the infusion rate may be increased 
every 30 minutes as tolerated to the baseline rate. 
If a patient who developed infusion reactions (Grade 1 or 2) receives further infusions, then 
premedication should be given before all subsequent infusions of MOR00208. 
Grade 3 infusion reactions 
If a patient presents with Grade 3 infusion reactions: 
 Infusion should be stopped immediately  
 The patient must  receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine and/or 
paracetamol or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) and, if necessary, further 
medications (ie, epinephrine, bronchodilator). 
 Obtain blood sample for cytokine analysis during the event and approximately 24 hours 
later. 
 Only after complete resolution of all symptoms (less than Grade 1) and after having 
received appropriate prophylactic medication(s) above may the infusion be resumed at 
an infusion rate of 25%. If, after one hour, the patient’s symptoms do not return and 
vital signs are stable, the infusion rate may be increased to a maximum of 50%. 
 If, after resumption of infusion, symptoms have returned (irrespective of Grade), 
infusion must be stopped immediately and the infusion tubing should be disconnected 
from the patient. Patient should not receive further study drug. 
Grade 4 infusion reactions 
If a patient presents with Grade 4 infusion reactions: 
 Infusion should be stopped immediately and the infusion tubing should be disconnected

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 37 of 84  Patient should receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine and/or paracetamol 
or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) and, if necessary, further medications (ie, 
epinephrine, bronchodilator). 
 Obtain blood sample for cytokine analysis during the event and approximately 24 hours 
later. 
 Patient must not receive further study drug. 
9.5.2 Management of Patients with Positive Hepatitis B Serology 
Al
l patients will be screened for hepatitis B before dosing. Patients with a positive test for anti-
HBc can only be included if HBV-DNA is not detected. In these patients, HBV-DNA should 
be assessed at regular intervals during treatment (see Table 2 ).  
If HBV-DNA becomes detectable during treatment, patients should be prophylactically treated 
and followed-up for potential hepatitis B reactivation as per local practice or guideline for anti-
CD20 antibodies like rituximab. 
For ongoing patients (ie, either in treatment, follow-up, or maintenance) who were included 
before anti-HBc measurement was introduced with this amendment, anti-HBc should be 
measured at least once (see Table 2) unless a patient’s anti-HBc status is known from within 
6 months prior to screening. If anti-HBc is positive and HBV-DNA from within 6 months 
before screening is not known, then HBV-DNA should be measured. If HBV-DNA is positive, 
then patients can only stay in the study if they were assessed by a physician experienced in the 
treatment of hepatitis B and pre-emptive treatment was initiated if deemed appropriate and/or 
according to local practice/guideline. 
9.6 Management of Treatment-Related Toxicities 
If a patient develops a study drug-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity and the toxicity has not resolved 
to Grade 1 or to at least the baseline grade (if the condition was pre-existing at screening) at the 
day of the next scheduled administration, study drug administration for that visit will be 
postponed.  
If treatment needs to be postponed for more than 15 days for the same study drug-related 
toxicity, the patient’s treatment should be permanently discontinued. Patients who discontinue 
before end of Cycle 2 proceed with the EOS visit. Patients who have had at least SD at the end 
of Cycle 2 and have not progressed should continue with the first follow-up visit in the study 
(see Section 9.10 and 10.3). 
If 
based on medical judgment, the treating physician considers a laboratory parameter change 
or adverse event not to be a study drug-related toxicity, but to represent natural fluctuation or 
progression of the underlying disease, it is up to the physician’s discretion and assessment of 
the individual risk/benefit ratio to determine whether the patient should be dosed (see 
Section 10.8.4). The decision and rationale behind the decision should be documented in the 
sourc
e data.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 38 of 84 9.7 Safety-related Criteria for the Initiation of Each New Cycle of 
Therapy 
Patients can only enter the next treatment cycle if the following criteria are met. If at least one 
criterion is not met (unless this is due to the fluctuation/progression of the underlying disease 
or infiltration of the bone marrow by the NHL; see Section 9.6), the beginning of the cycle will 
be post
poned until resolution to Grade 1 or at least the baseline value (for pre-existing 
conditions at screening). If a cycle has to be postponed for more than 15 days for the same 
persisting study drug-related toxicity then the patient will be withdrawn from the study (see 
Section 9.11.2 ).  
1. ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L    
2. Platelet count ≥ 75 × 109/L   
3. Haemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (may have been transfused) 
4. Serum creatinine < 2.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
5. Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 × ULN  
6. A lanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN 
7. No study treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity in CNS, cardiovascular, infections or 
ga
strointestinal system organ class (as per CTC 4.0 classification) 
9.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Any prior, concomitant, or procedural medications or therapy given to or taken by the patient 
within 1 month before the study and up to the first follow-up visit must be recorded in the 
source document and the eCRF along with the indication and dosage. However, information 
should be provided on any previous NHL-specific therapies since the time point of the first 
diagnosis of NHL. The generic or the trade name may be recorded. Other than the study drug, 
patients should not receive any other NHL-specific therapy during the study. The patient 
should not receive any investigational agent other than MOR00208 during the participation in 
the study. 
Noninvestigational medications needed to treat concomitant medical conditions may be 
continued during the study. Prophylactic antibiotics/antifungals are allowed at the discretion of 
the investigator. Any other medication for treatment of symptoms of NHL or concurrent 
diseases is allowed and can be prescribed at the discretion of the investigator. However, the 
medical monitor should be contacted to discuss the use of any NHL-related therapies before 
those therapies are started. 
However, treatments that might potentially interfere with the study drugs should be avoided 
and (with the exception of treatments required in emergency situations) should be approved by 
the medical monitor before administration. 
The investigator should instruct the patient not to take any additional medications (including 
over-the-counter-products) during the study without prior consultation. All medications 
(including over-the-counter medications) administered after the patient has signed the informed 
consent must be listed on the concomitant medications form in the eCRF.

Protocol Amendment 5, Final v7.0 EudraCT Number: 2012-002659-41 
 
MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 39 of 84 All respective treatments given during the treatment period until the first follow-up visit should 
be recorded in the eCRF as concomitant medication. Starting from the first follow-up visit, 
only anti-cancer treatments and, in case of an AE, other relevant concomitant medications 
(according to the discretion of the investigator) should be entered. 
9.9 Treatment Compliance 
Patients will receive MOR00208 under the direct supervision of study personnel. Each 
administration volume or dose will be checked and the vial/outer package code and volume or 
dose per administration will be recorded in each patient’s eCRF as well as in the source data. 
Drug accountability will be checked by the field monitor during site visits and at the 
completion of the trial. 
 
9.10 Treatment Postponement 
Study drug administration may be postponed for medical reasons (see Section 9.6) or other 
rea
sons (eg, social reasons, weather circumstances). In case of a postponement in study drug 
administration, the treatment should be restarted as early as possible and continue with the 
postponed visit. The allowed window for each treatment visit is ± 1 day, outside this window a 
one-time postponement for up to 7 days is allowed. However, the period between two drug 
administrations should always be at least 5 days. If not, then the administration on the 
following visit should be skipped.  
Should treatment be postponed for more than 15 days due to the same treatment-related 
toxicity, then the treatment should be permanently discontinued. Patients who discontinue 
before end of Cycle 2 proceed with the EOS visit. Patients who have had at least SD at the end 
of Cycle 2 and have not progressed should continue with the first follow-up visit in the study as 
defined in Section 10.3.  
Furt
her or longer postponements, especially during the maintenance treatment, can be allowed 
by the sponsor in close collaboration with the investigator if this is justified by the previous 
response to the treatment and the current medical condition of the patient. 
 
9.11 End of Treatment and Study Drug Discontinuation 
9.11.1 End of Treatment 
Pa
tients may voluntarily withdraw from the study or be dropped from it at the discretion of the 
investigator at any time. In addition, the investigator should discontinue study drug if he or she 
thinks that continuation would be detrimental to the patient´s well-being. 
If such withdrawal occurs, or if the patient fails to return for visits, the investigator must 
determine the primary reason for a patient´s premature withdrawal from the study and record 
the information on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). If the reason for withdrawal is an 
AE, monitoring will continue until the outcome is evident. The specific event or test result(s) 
must be recorded in the eCRF.

Protocol Amendment 5, Final v7.0 EudraCT Number: 2012-002659-41 
 
MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 40 of 84 Patients may be withdrawn from the study prematurely for one of the following reasons: 
 Adverse event(s) 
 Abnor
mal laboratory value(s) 
 Abnormal test procedure result(s) 
 Protocol violation 
 Subject withdrawal of consent 
 Loss to follow-up 
 Administrative problems 
 New cancer therapy 
 Disease progression 
 Death 
 Withdrawal of a patient at the specific request of the sponsor. 
The sponsor must be notified within 24 hours if a patient is withdrawn from the study. 
Patients who withdraw or discontinue before having received study drug on Cycle 2 Day 22 
will only be replaced if the reason for withdrawal/discontinuation was not lack of efficacy. 
Patients will not be replaced after they have received treatment for Cycle 2 Day 22, regardless 
of the reason of withdrawal or discontinuation. 
Patients who are withdrawn for any reason may not re-enter this clinical study at any time. 
 
9.11.2 Study Drug Discontinuation 
St
udy drug must be discontinued for a given patient if the investigator determines that 
continuing it would result in a significant safety risk for the patient. 
Patients who discontinue study before completing the second cycle and response assessment 
should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed 
for the End of Study visit should be performed. At a minimum, all patients who discontinue 
study treatment, including those who refuse to return for a final visit, will be contacted for 
safety evaluations during the first 4 weeks following the last dose of study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug should be considered withdrawn from the study after the 
final visit assessments are performed or when it becomes clear that the patient will not return 
for these assessments. The last day of study drug administration should be entered into the 
eCRF and the reason for discontinuing study drug should be given. Patients lost to follow-up 
should be recorded as such in the eCRF. Treatment after study drug discontinuation is at the 
discretion of the investigator.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 41 of 84 9.12 Study or Site Termination 
The investigator and the sponsor both reserve the right to terminate the study at any time at a 
given clinical study center. The sponsor also reserves the right to terminate the entire study or 
temporarily interrupt enrolment and/or dosing of already enrolled patients for further 
evaluation, eg, if during ongoing evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio the sponsor decides that the 
risks outweigh the benefits of MOR00208.  
Stopping criteria for this study will include, but not be limited to: 
1. Two or more patients within the first six patients enrolled experience unexpected Grade 
4 or 5 toxicities of the same or related Adverse Event terms according to CTC and these 
events are assessed as being related to MOR00208 by the investigator or the sponsor. 
2. ≥ 30% of patients following the initial six enrolled experience unexpected Grade 4 or 5 
toxicities of the same or related Adverse Event terms according to CTC and these 
events are assessed as being related to MOR00208 by the investigator or the sponsor. 
 
Should a termination of a given clinical study center or the whole study be necessary then the 
procedures will be arranged on an individual study basis after review and consultation by all 
involved parties. In terminating the study, the sponsor and the investigator will ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests. Institutional Review 
Boards (IRBs)/IECs and competent authorities will be notified of premature termination in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

following the previous visit, further FU Visits should then be scheduled every 6 months.  
2 Before study drug administration. 
 3Tumor biopsy/aspirates should be obtained if malignant lymph nodes are easily accessible. 
4 Premedication for patients who do not experience infusion reactions during the first 3 infusions will be optional at the discretion of the investigator for subsequent infusions. 
5 The PK sample will be taken before study drug administration; at the end of the infusion; and 1 hour, 4 hours, and 24 hours after end of first MOR00208 infusion. The sample 
taken on Day 2 (ie, 24 hours after end of first infusion) belongs formally to Day 1. 
6 The PK sample will be taken before study drug administration and 1 hour after the end of MOR00208 infusion. 
7 The PK sample will be taken at second and third follow-up visit only. 
8 Not performed at third FU (no response assessment). 
9 Results from bone marrow examination done within 4 weeks before screening are acceptable, if the patient’s disease has been stable since then. In this case, obtaining bone 
marrow samples for the sole purpose of CD19 expression does not need to be repeated. 
10 Bone marrow examinations should only be repeated if response at last bone marrow examination was not CR. 
11 Including body height at screening only. Physical examination includes palpable tumor assessment, general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, breasts and 
axillae (if applicable including bi-dimensional measurement of cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes), cardiovascular system, back and spine, abdomen (if 
applicable including spleen size below the costal margin), extremities, infusion site, lymph nodes, and neurological examination. 
12 Physical examination will be used for response assessment. 
13 Immediately before infusion; 15, 30, and 60 minutes during infusion; at end of infusion; and every hour for two hours after completion of infusion. 
14 Performed 1 hour ± 10 minutes post dose. Additionally, for Cycle 1 Day 1 predose; 12-lead ECG recording should include determination of heart rate and RR, PR, QRS, QT, and 
QTc intervals. The 12-lead ECG will be recorded after 5 minutes of rest in a supine position. 
15 For all patients neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis CT is required. PET should also be performed for response assessment if tumor was PET avid at baseline. 
16 Radiographic examinations in addition to the neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis CT/PET evaluations are to be done, as appropriate. (For MRI, please see Section 10.6.) Follow-up 
radiographic examinations will be performed at the end of Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and at the second and subsequent follow-up visits for any procedures performed at baseline visit. 
17 Radiographic evaluations may be performed up to 3 days before the scheduled visit during Cycle 1-3 and within +/- 4 days of the planned visit during follow-up. If a patient 
discontinues from the study before a response assessment, an evaluation will occur approximately one month after the patient discontinues from the study. CT/PET examinations 
that were done up to 3 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1 may be used as a patient’s baseline assessment. (For MRI, please see Section 10.6.)

19 Sample to be taken and evaluated  before study drug administration. 
20  Maintenance treatment for patients with at least ongoing PR will be administered either every second week or monthly until progression. The treatment frequency during the 
follow up period should be maintained. Before administration, blood parameters (hematology, serum chemistry, urine pregnancy test) should be evaluated in local laboratory 
according to local guidelines/practice for the administration of monoclonal antibodies. Vital signs should be measured every hour or according to local practice with anti-CD20 
antibodies. 
21 Hepatitic C serology only to be done at screening. HBV-DNA only to be measured during treatment and follow-up if total anti-HBc was positive. If HBV-DNA is positive, 
please see Section 9.5.2 . Anti-HBc should be measured if an anti-Hbc status from during the study or within 6 months prior to screening is not known. 
22 Only urine pregnancy test is to be done if the regular follow-up visit coincides with the maintenance treatment visit. Otherwise, serum pregnancy test should be done.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 45 of 84 10.1 Screening Evaluations 
All patients must have signed and dated the informed consent before initiation of any study-
related evaluation. However, assessments that have been performed before the signing of the 
informed consent and that fall within the screening period window may be used as screening 
assessments only if  the assessments were performed as part of the routine standard of care visit 
for the patient. The investigational site must provide a note to file in the patient folder to attest 
to any such occurrence. The screening period lasts for up to 21 days. All patients must satisfy 
all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed in Sections 8.1 and 8.2.  
The sc
reening evaluations will include: 
 Demography and ECOG performance status (see the appendix, Section 17.5) 
 Pri
or and concomitant medication 
 Medical history and physical examination including height, weight, palpable tumor 
assessment, general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, breasts and 
axillae (if applicable including bi-dimensional measurement of cervical, 
supraclavicular, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes), cardiovascular system, back and 
spine, abdomen (if applicable including spleen size below costal margin), extremities, 
infusion site, lymph nodes, and basic neurological examination) 
 Staging 
 Blood sampling: 
o Haematology with complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet 
count, serum chemistry, and coagulation 
o β-HCG pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential 
o Determination of CD16 expression on NK cells and ADCC assessment (Due to 
the exploratory nature of the ADCC assay, the sponsor may decide at any point 
during the study to terminate these assessments in which case the sites will be 
informed accordingly) 
o Hepatitis B and C screening (please see Section 9.5.2) 
 Urine sampling for urinalysis 
 Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Results from bone marrow examination done within 
4 weeks before screening are acceptable, if the patient’s disease has been stable since 
then. The following are included: 
o Histology (to be analysed locally) 
o Determination of CD19 on malignant B cells (to be done through central lab) 
 Tumor aspirate and biopsy, if malignant lymph nodes are easily accessible. The 
following are included: 
o Histology (to be analysed locally) 
o Determination of CD19 on B cells (to be analysed through central lab)

10.2 Main Treatment Phase (Cycles 1-3) 
Only patients fulfilling all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria should be enrolled. 
The schedule of required procedures for each treatment day is detailed in Table 2 . Clinical site 
stud
y days are Days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22 for Cycle 1 and Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 28 for Cycle 2. 
Patients qualifying for Cycle 3 will have visits on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 28 of this cycle.  
During the first two 28-day cycles, patients will receive a total of 8 infusions: each 28-day 
cycle will consist of a MOR00208 infusion on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 22 of the cycle.  
 Patients with a response of at least SD on Cycle 2, Day 28, will qualify for 1 further 
cycle of MOR00208 (infusions on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 22 of the 28-day 
cycle). This potential Cycle 3 should start 2 weeks ± 1 day after Cycle 2, Day 22. 
Before dosing, premedication as detailed in Section 9.5 should be administered. 
Clini

10.3 Follow-up Phase until Follow-up Visit 12 
All patients who performed treatment Cycle 3 should have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after end 
of the last treatment cycle (4 weeks ± 2 days after Cycle 3 Day 28). Patients should return for 
further follow-up visits until relapse of the lymphoma or for a maximum of 4 years. The 
second and third follow-up visit should be scheduled 6 weeks ± 1 week following the previous 
visit, the fourth to sixth follow-up visit should be scheduled 3 months ± 2 weeks following the 
previous visit, further follow-up visits should then be scheduled every 6 months. If not 
otherwise indicated, the following assessments should be performed at every follow-up visit: 
 Patients with an ongoing response of at least PR after Cycle 3 may receive maintenance 
treatment with MOR00208 (12 mg/kg either every second week or monthly). Before 
administration, blood parameters (hematology, serum chemistry) should be evaluated in 
the local lab according to local guidelines/practice for the administration of monoclonal 
antibodies. A urine pregnancy test should be performed for women of childbearing 
potential. These lab results will only be captured in the eCRF if the administration visits 
coincide with the planned follow-up visits. 
 Assessment of AEs and concomitant medication (see Section 9.8) 
 Ass
essment of body weight 
 Physical examination including palpable tumor assessment (general appearance, skin, 
head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, breasts and axillae (if applicable including bi-
dimensional measurement of cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and inguinal lymph

10.4  MOR00208 Treatment and Study Procedures after Follow-up  
Visit 12 
Patients who have not progressed after four years of treatment with MOR00208 (ie, after 
Follow-up Visit 12 as described above) may continue receiving the IMP thereafter, until 
progression, based on the decision of the treating physician. The treatment frequency (during 
the follow-up period as described above) should be maintained.  
Prior to each administration of MOR00208, the following assessments should be performed at 
a local laboratory: 
 Assessment of body weight 
 H aematology including CBC with differential and platelet count and serum chemistry

10.6 Effi
cacy  
Efficacy will be evaluated in terms of the ORR, SD, DoR, TTP, and PFS. The ORR will be 
evaluated using the revised IWG criteria (Cheson, 2007) and will be defined as the proportion 
of patients with CR and PR (CR+PR).  
The DoR will be the time from first meeting of criteria for response (ie, CR or PR) to first 
documentation of relapse or progression. 
The TTP is defined as the time from study entry (first dosing) until documented lymphoma 
progression or death as a result of lymphoma. Deaths from other causes are censored at the 
time of death. 
PFS is defined as the time from study entry (first dosing) until lymphoma progression or death 
as a result of any cause. 
Response criteria are provided in Section 17.4. 
CT or
 PET Examination, or Further Radiological Examinations 
CT: For all patients, CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis is required as indicated in the schedule of 
assessments at baseline and at all time points when a radiographic response assessment is 
performed. 
PET: For patients with DLBCL and patients known or expected to have PET-avid lymphomas, 
a PET scan should be performed at baseline in addition to the CT scan. At the subsequent 
visits, PET should be done in DLBCL patients or if at baseline the lymphoma was PET-avid, 
but can be omitted if PET definitely would not change the reponse assessment according to the 
clinical judgement of the investigator (eg, CT already shows progressive disease).  
MRI may be used in lieu of CT for subjects with contraindications to administration of contrast 
agents or due to other medical reasons (at the same time windows as CT), or in addition to CT 
at the discretion of the investigator (in this case, MRI may be performed as/when appropriate). 
The method used at baseline should be used throughout the study unless otherwise medically 
indicated. 
Additional radiographic evaluations:  are to be done, as appropriate. Follow-up radiographic 
evaluations will be performed for any procedures performed at baseline visit at the end of 
Cycle 2 and 3 (if applicable) and at the second, fourth and every further follow-up visit. 
Follow-up radiographic evaluations may be performed anytime ± 4 days of the planned visit. If

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 52 of 84 a patient discontinues from the study before any response assessment, if possible a response 
evaluation will occur approximately one month after the patient discontinues from the study. 
CT, PET or additional radiological examinations (eg, MRI) that were done up to 3 weeks 
before Cycle 1 Day 1 may be used as a patient’s baseline assessment at the investigator’s 
discretion. 
Physical Examination 
The response assessment will be supported by the palpation of lymph nodes from the physical 
examination (see Section 10.2) 
Bone M
arrow  
At the Screening visit (Baseline), a bone marrow aspirate and a biopsy should be obtained. 
Results from bone marrow examination done within 4 weeks before screening are acceptable if 
the patient’s disease has been stable since then. In this case only available data will be used and 
bone marrow examinations at screening for which this data are not available will not be 
performed. Repeat of marrow aspirates and biopsies should be obtained at Day 28 of Cycles 2 
and 3. Histological examination should be performed and the infiltration by malignant B-cells 
should be evaluated. 
If bone marrow has been obtained within 4 weeks before screening and disease has been stable,  
the bone marrow biopsy does not need to be repeated solely to obtain samples for 
determination of CD19 expression. 
10.7 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed for MOR00208 
from serum samples collected on the following schedules (if not otherwise specified, a 
deviation of 10 minutes from the planned collection time point is acceptable):  
- For the first study drug administration (Cycle 1 Day1), serum samples will be collected 
predose and then at the end of infusion and 1 hour, 4 hours and 24 hours (± 1 hour) 
after end of first MOR00208 infusion. 
- During Cycle 1 on Days 8, 15 and 22, serum samples will be collected predose for 
trough level determination and then 1 hour after the end of the infusion. 
- During Cycle 2 and 3 on Days 8 and 22 of each cycle, serum samples will be collected 
predose for trough level determination and then 1 hour after the end of the infusion. 
- During Cycle 2 and 3 on Day 28 
- At the 1st, 2nd and 3rd follow-up visit 
Serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be handled and stored as specified in the lab 
manual at the study site until shipment on dry ice to an external analytical laboratory. Per 
sample 2 aliquots (primary and back-up) should be obtained. At the analytical laboratory, the 
samples will also be stored as specified in the lab manual until analysis. Detailed instructions 
for handling of serum samples will be provided in the laboratory-specific documentation. 
Pharmacokinetic sample assessment of MOR00208 will be performed at a specified central 
laboratory.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 53 of 84 10.8 Safety Assessments 
Safety monitoring for all patients enrolled in the study will include laboratory safety 
assessments (haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis, coagulation, and anti-MOR00208 
antibodies) and clinical evaluations (physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECG) as 
detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 10) and Section 10.8.4. All AEs and serious 
adverse
 events (SAEs) will be recorded. 
Laboratory and AE toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Patients who 
experience any toxicity should be followed until the toxicity has stabilized, the toxicity 
returned to the baseline level, or a new treatment has commenced. 
Safety monitoring is detailed in Section 11. 
10.8.1 Adverse Events 
An 
adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
subject administered a medicinal product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
to this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, 
whether or not it is considered related to that study drug.  
Temporally associated means after signing the informed consent form until 30 days after last 
administration of the study drug. 
For screening failure patients only SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. 
AEs include any clinically significant deterioration of a patient’s medical status after the 
signing of the informed consent form. Also an increase in frequency or intensity of a 
preexisting episodic event or conditions and events resulting from protocol mandated 
procedure (eg, invasive procedures) fall under the definition of AE. In addition, overdoses 
(defined as exceeding planned dose by more than 10%) should be recorded as AEs. 
As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine the following: 
 Relationship to study drug (suspected/not suspected) 
 Duration (start and end date or if continuing at end of study) 
 Intensity: The intensity of all AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following definitions: 
o Mild: Tolerable 
o Moderate: Interferes with normal activity 
o Severe: Incapacitating (causes inability to perform usual activity or work) 
Product Name: MOR00208 Protocol Number: MOR208C201

Protocol Amendment 5, Final v7.0 EudraCT Number: 2012-002659-41 
 
MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 54 of 84  Toxicity grade: The toxicity grade of AEs will be graded according to the NCI-CTC 
(C
TCAE version 4.0 of May 28, 2009) using the following definitions: 
o Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic  
  observations only; intervention not indicated. 
o Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated;  
  limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (refers to 
  preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
  managing money, etc.). 
o Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
  hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
  limiting self-care activities of daily living. 
o Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
o Grade 5: Death related to AE. 
 Outcome 
 Action taken (no action taken; study drug temporarily interrupted; study drug 
permanently discontinued due to this AE; concomitant medication taken; non-drug 
therapy given; hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization) 
 Seriousness: Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as 
one that: 
o Results in death. 
o Is life-threatening. 
o Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization signifies that the patient was inpatient for at least one overnight 
stay) unless hospitalization is for 
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with deterioration of symptoms related to NHL 
 Elective or preplanned treatment for a preexisting condition that is 
unrelated to NHL and has not worsened since signing of the informed 
consent 
 Social reason and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the 
patient’s general condition 
 Hospitalization signifies that the patient was in-patient for at least one 
overnight stay. 
o Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
o Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
o Is medically significant, ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or 
may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
previously.

Protocol Amendment 5, Final v7.0 EudraCT Number: 2012-002659-41 
 
MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 55 of 84 NOTE: The term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was, in the view of 
the reporting investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Medical 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious in other situations: 
Important AEs that are not immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the previous definitions should also be considered serious. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs and AEs of special interest are monitored 
continuously and have special reporting requirements (see Section 11.1). 
The 
investigator should determine the causality (relation to the study drug) based on his/her 
clinical experience and on the information given in the IB. The causal relationship of all AEs to 
the study drug will be judged as either suspected or not suspected. A suspected causal 
relationship means at least a reasonable possibility that the event is caused by the study drug. If 
no relationship has been provided by the investigator, the event will be considered as related to 
study drug. 
Information about adverse drug reactions already known about the investigational study drug 
can be found in the IB, or will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications. This 
information will be included in the patient informed consent form and should be discussed with 
the patient during the study as needed. 
 
10.8.2 Physical Examination 
A 
qualified physician (or nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant under the supervision of a 
physician, if permitted by local legislation and medical practice) will conduct physical 
examinations before study drug administration. The physical examination will include an 
assessment for the presence of abnormalities of the following: general appearance, skin, head, 
eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, breasts and axillae (if applicable including bi-dimensional 
measurement of cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes), cardiovascular 
system, back and spine, abdomen (if applicable including spleen size below costal margin), 
extremities, infusion site, lymph nodes, and basic neurological examination (general motor and 
sensory systems, mental status, cranial nerves, and coordination). 
In the event that new and worsening abnormal physical examination findings are encountered 
during the study, these terms are defined as follows: A new abnormal physical examination 
finding is defined as one that occurs when a patient’s normal baseline physical examination 
becomes abnormal post baseline, based on clinical grounds. A worsening abnormal physical 
examination finding is defined as one that occurs when a patient’s abnormal baseline physical 
examination becomes worse post baseline, also based on clinical grounds. Any new findings, 
worsening findings, or both should be recorded as AEs. 
10.8.3 Vital Signs 
Vi
tal signs will be measured at the various pre- and posttreatment time points described in the 
Schedule of Assessments in Table 2 . Vital sign parameters include measurements of heart rate, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Before vital signs 
are measured, the patient should be resting for at least 5 minutes (if possible). The same

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 56 of 84 position will be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient, and blood pressure 
will be measured from the arm contralateral to the site of study drug administration whenever 
possible. Body temperature should be measured using normal hospital practice. 
The actual time for measurement of vital signs should not deviate more than 10 minutes from 
the planned time but the actual time should be recorded accurately. If the infusion is interrupted 
and/or subsequently restarted, vital signs should be assessed every 60 minutes after the first 
hour until two hours after the end of the infusion.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 58 of 84 The signed and interpreted laboratory results will be kept as supplemental pages to the patient’s 
eCRF. The laboratory results should be reviewed, dated and signed in a timely manner by the 
investigator. 
With the exception of PK samples (see Section 10.7), anti-MOR00208 antibodies, CD19 and 
CD16 
expression, and the ADCC assessment, all clinical laboratory parameters (see Table 3 ) 
will be analyzed at the local hospital laboratories. All blood samples will be processed and 
handled according to standard laboratory procedures. Anti-MOR00208 antibody assessments, 
the ADCC assessment, CD19 and CD16 expression assessment will be performed at a 
specified laboratory. 
Serum samples will be collected for anti-MOR00208 antibodies and stored at the study site as 
specified in the lab manual until shipment on dry ice to the external analytical laboratory. At 
the analytical laboratory, the samples will also be stored according to the lab manual until 
analysis. Detailed instructions for handling of plasma and serum samples will be provided in 
the laboratory manual. 
For all study drug administrations, the following parameters should be evaluated in a blood 
sample taken within 24 h predose on the day before study drug administration or on the day of 
study drug administration (“emergency laboratory”); if outside the limits described below, 
depending on the individual risk-/benefit ratio of the patient, IMP administration should be 
postponed (see Sections 9.6, 9.7, and 9.10):

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 59 of 84 Urine will be collected at the various pre- and posttreatment time points described in the 
Schedule of Assessments in Table 2  and analyzed at the local hospital laboratory. In the case of 
any abnormal result, a microscopic urine examination should be conducted. 
A pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential at various pre- and 
posttreatment time points either by urine pregnancy test or β-HCG test of a serum sample. The 
pregnancy test assay should have a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/mL. On dosing days, the 
result should be available before study drug administration. 
If an abnormal laboratory value of Grade 4 or an abnormal laboratory value judged to be 
clinically significant that was not present at baseline is not reported as an AE, then the 
investigator should clearly document the rationale for not doing so in the source 
documentation. 
Any abnormal laboratory findings that constitute an AE should be reported as such and should 
be followed up until the outcome is known. Also, additional diagnostic tests may be indicated 
to determine a more precise diagnosis of the patient’s condition (eg, ordering a WBC 
differential count to help characterise a high or low WBC count, or ordering a determination of 
RBC indices to help characterise a low haematocrit). 
Detailed instructions and amounts of blood needed for the respective laboratory measurement, 
as well as details of which local or central laboratory is involved for the respective laboratory 
measurements, will be summarized in site-specific laboratory manuals. 
Blood samples will be obtained for assessment of serum chemistry, haematology, and 
coagulation parameters at the various  pre- and posttreatment time points described in the 
Schedule of Assessments in Table 2 . The time of blood collection should be documented in the 
eCR
F.  
10.8.5 Electrocardiogram 
A 
standard 12-lead ECG will be obtained at the various pre- and posttreatment time points 
described in the Schedule of Assessments in Table 2. A 12-lead ECG will be recorded after 
5 minutes of rest in a supine position. Heart rate and RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals will be 
determined. All ECG recordings will be reviewed on an ongoing basis at the investigational 
site. The investigator will evaluate the clinical significance of each value outside the reference 
ranges according to the nature and degree of the observed abnormality. Any new abnormal 
values considered to be clinically significant should be reported as AEs. 
10.9 Other Variables 
10.9.1  Demographic Data 
Demographic variables to be recorded will include age, gender, race, ethnicity, body height, 
and body weight. Weight and height should be measured while the patient is without shoes, but 
dressed. 
10.9.2 Relevant Medical History and Current Medical Conditions 
Re
levant medical history and current medical conditions will be recorded until the start of the 
study drug administration.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 60 of 84 The medical history of NHL should be documented in detail. This should include the date of 
first diagnosis, details on NHL subtype, previous treatments, and best response and duration of 
response to these treatments. Any previous therapy (eg, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or 
radiation therapy) for the NHL-specific therapy should be recorded in the eCRF. 
Also, examinations leading to the diagnosis of the latest progression of NHL should be 
documented in the patient’s source documents. This may include, for example, results of 
laboratory examinations, imaging results, or clinical symptoms related to the NHL. The 
baseline assessment of the lymphoma should include a staging. 
10.9.3 Prior and Concomitant Medication and Examinations 
Al
l respective treatments given during the treatment period until the first follow-up visit should 
be recorded in the eCRF as concomitant medication. Starting from the first follow-up visit, 
only anti-cancer treatments and, in case of an AE, other relevant concomitant medications 
(according to the discretion of the investigator) should be entered. 
Further examinations that constitute standard measures and are not covered by the protocol are 
left to the discretion of the investigator. However, such examinations performed during the 
study should be documented in the patient’s source documents as well. 
10.9.4 Immune Cells 
For
 evaluation of the status of the immune system, B-, T- and NK cells in peripheral blood will 
be measured frequently throughout the study (exploratory assay) on sites selected for this assay 
by the sponsor. The absolute and percentage changes from baseline will be evaluated. 
CD16 expression on NK cells in peripheral blood will be evaluated at baseline (exploratory 
assay). 
10.9.5  Immunogenicity 
Number and proportion of patients who develop anti-MOR00208 antibodies will be 
summarized. In addition, summarization of a semiquantitative antibody assessment will be 
based on anti-MOR00208 antibody titres of confirmed positive samples. 
10.9.6  B Cells 
CD19 expression on malignant B cells in bone marrow and/or tumour aspirate (if malignant 
lymph node is easily accessible) will be evaluated at baseline (exploratory assay). The CD19 
expression at baseline will be correlated with safety and response. Tumor and/or lymph node 
aspirates will be evaluated centrally. Biopsies (eg, trephine) to evaluate histology will be done 
locally. 
If a tumour biopsy is available at screening, cytogenetics from malignant cells should be 
obtained if no historical data are available. In case bone marrow is affected, cytogenetics can 
be obtained from these samples.  
10.9.7  Genotyping 
A mucosal cheek swab will be used for DNA analysis of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa polymorphism. 
The evaluation will be performed at a specified laboratory. 
Genotyping is optional, it will be only performed if the patient agrees. A patient can participate 
in the study regardless of consent to undergo genotyping.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 61 of 84 11 SAFETY MONITORING 
The patients will be closely observed and questioned for any kind of AE during the study 
procedures and at follow-up appointments throughout the study period with nonleading 
questioning (eg, “How do you feel?”). AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
the patient during or between study visits or through physical examination, laboratory tests, or 
other assessments. 
Study personnel must remain vigilant for the occurrence of AEs, particularly those that may be 
life-threatening. Personnel who are trained in the acute management of infusion-related 
reactions, cytokine release syndrome, anaphylaxis, and other emergencies and who have access 
to appropriate clinical supplies must be immediately available from start of infusion until no 
less than 30 minutes after dosing. 
All AEs should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug 
treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stopping concomitant 
treatments, changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospitalization, or any other 
medically required intervention. Once an AE is detected, it should be followed up, and an 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in its 
severity, its suspected relationship to the study drug(s), any of the interventions required to 
treat it, and its outcome. 
11.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording and 
Reporting 
All AEs (except non-serious AEs for screening failures) that occur after the signing of 
informed consent and up to 30 days after last drug administration will be recorded in the eCRF 
and in the patient’s medical records, whether or not considered by the investigator to be related 
to the study drug. Thereafter only AEs assessed as related should be recorded. All AEs should 
be recorded using acceptable diagnoses, if possible. For screening failure patients the 
non-serious adverse events will not be recorded in the e-CRF but only in the patient’s medical 
records. 
In addition all SAEs will be recorded on the SAE Report Form. Study centres are 
instructed to report all SAEs and AEs of special interest (ie, infusion-related reactions 
and allergic reactions to study drug grade 3 or higher, cytokine release syndrome, 
overdoses) to United Bio Source within 24 hours using the study-specific SAE report 
form.  
Infusion-related reactions and allergic reactions to study drug grade 3 or higher, or cytokine 
release syndrome, which are AEs of special interest in this study, should be reported along with 
their respective symptoms (eg, hives, chill, and fever for infusion reaction). Equally, for 
overdoses the symptoms caused by the overdose should be reported. If an AE has already been 
reported, it is not necessary to report each individual sign and symptom of that AE as a 
separate AE. For example, if myocardial infarction is reported as an AE, there is no need to 
report elevated creatine phosphokinase and abnormal ECG, or other related signs, symptoms, 
or laboratory values as separate AEs. However, if both occurred in isolation and myocardial 
infarction was not diagnosed, then each event would be reported as an AE.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 62 of 84 All nonserious AEs must be followed up for a final outcome. An outcome of “unknown” is not 
considered to be an acceptable final outcome. An outcome of “not yet resolved” is an 
acceptable final outcome for nonserious AEs at the end of a patient’s participation in a study. 
All SAEs must be followed up for a final outcome until resolution or, if resolution becomes 
unlikely, until stabilization or death. The follow-up for SAEs that are a progression of NHL 
only until the end of a patient’s participation in a study is acceptable. This includes obtaining 
information on recovery and any sequelae and, in case of a fatal outcome, the cause of death.

11.2 Pregnancies 
As detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2) and Section 10.8.4, serum pregnancy 
testing will be carried out at the Screening, Follow-up, and End of Study visits. During the 
treatment period of the study, urine pregnancy testing will be performed locally and can be

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 63 of 84 repeated if required. Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported 
using a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy of a study 
patient or a female partner of a study patient must also be reported within 24 hours of learning 
of its occurrence to  
 
Female study patients who become pregnant must be withdrawn from the study. 
A newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient or female partner of a study patient who has 
received trial medication is not considered an SAE unless it meets any criteria of seriousness or 
it is suspected that the trial medication interacted with a contraceptive method and led to 
pregnancy. If the pregnancy results in clinical consequences/complications in mother or child, 
eg, if the child is born with a birth defect, this should be reported as an SAE of mother or child 
as applicable. 
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or 
congenital abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. Every infant has to be 
followed up for 2 months after delivery.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSIS 
14.1 Populations for Analysis 
The following analysis populations will be defined: 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population: Consists of all patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug. Patients without any postbaseline assessment of NHL response will be included as 
nonresponders. 
Safety Population:  Consists of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.  
Pharmacokinetic Population:  The Pharmacokinetic Population will consist of all patients 
who have sufficient pharmacokinetic data to characterize the time course of MOR00208 in 
serum for the first study drug administration. 
The Safety Population will be used for safety analysis and to analyze immunogenicity. The ITT 
Population will be used to analyze immunogenicity and the pharmacodynamic endpoints. 
Summaries for the analysis of response will be provided for the ITT Population. 
Pharmacokinetic summaries will be presented for the Pharmacokinetic Population. 
Tabulations of summary statistics, graphical presentations, and statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS software. 
Continuous, quantitative variable summaries will include the number of patients (N) (with 
nonmissing values), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and first and 
third quartiles. 
Categorical, qualitative variable summaries will include the frequency and percentage of 
patients who are in the particular category.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 65 of 84 The last preadministration observation will be used as the baseline value for calculating 
postadministration changes from baseline. All data obtained on the eCRF and entered into the 
database will be provided in separate data listings showing individual patient values. The 
planning and reporting of statistical analyses will be carried out as described in the CRO’s 
SOPs. 
14.2 Patient Characteristics 
A table will be provided with the following information: 
 Number of patients enrolled. 
 Number of patients included in each analysis population. 
 Number of patients withdrawn from the study and the reason for withdrawal. 
Demographic information (age, height, weight, and body mass index) will be summarized for 
the Safety and ITT Populations using descriptive statistics. Gender, ethnicity and race will be 
summarized by counts and percentages. 
Medical histories will be summarized by counts and percentages. Concurrent medications will 
be recorded and coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary and grouped by different classes, if 
applicable. 
The NHL-specific medical history will be summarized for the duration of disease, number of 
previous therapies, type of previous therapy, and best response following previous 
NHL-specific therapy. 
14.3 Immunogenicity Analysis 
One of the secondary endpoints will be to evaluate the potential immunogenicity of 
MOR00208 in the Safety Population. This analysis will be based on both absolute (number and 
percentage of patients who develop anti-MOR00208 antibodies) and semi-quantitative 
(anti-MOR00208 antibody titer determination of confirmed positive samples) assessments. 
The number of patients who develop confirmed anti-MOR00208 antibodies will be 
summarized descriptively by means, standard deviations and ranges.  
14.4 Primary Objective 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be ORR as determined by using revised IWG response 
criteria for malignant lymphoma. The final ORR for each subtype will be the rate of patients 
who met the ORR definition at the end of either the second or third cycle or during the 
follow-up period (best response). The denominator for calculating the rate will be based upon 
the total number of patients in the ITT population, thus patients without any postbaseline 
assessment of NHL response will be included as nonresponders. Overall ORR, independent of 
NHL subtype, will also be summarized; 95% CI for ORR for each subtype and over all 
subtypes will be summarized. 
All efficacy analyses will be provided for the ITT Population.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 66 of 84 14.5 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using the ITT Population. For all safety 
analyses, the Safety Population will be used.  
14.5.1 Secondary Efficacy Variables and Analyses 
The
 proportion of patients in each subtype with stable disease (SD) will be summarized after 
the second cycle. 
The DoR will be the time from first meeting of criteria for response (ie CR or PR) to first 
documentation of relapse or progression. 
The TTP is defined as the time from study entry (first dosing) until documented lymphoma 
progression or death as a result of lymphoma. Patients not experiencing a progression will be 
censored at the last NHL assessment. Deaths from other causes are censored at the time of 
death. The data will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates. 
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from study entry (first dosing) until lymphoma 
progression or death as a result of any cause. Patients not experiencing a progression or death 
will be censored at the last NHL assessment. The data will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier 
estimates. 
 
14.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Concentration and pharmacokinetic data will be collected and analyzed for this study. 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed based on non-compartmental data 
analysis and summarized by means, standard deviations and ranges:  
Cmax Maximum serum concentration observed 
tmax Time to maximum serum concentration observed 
Cpd Apparent trough serum concentration before dosing  
AUC 0-t Area under the concentration curve. The time curve from time zero (0) to the 
time that the last concentration above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) is 
observed. 
AUC 0- Area under the concentration curve. The time curve from time zero (0) to 
infinity (), where infinity is computed from AUC 0-t + [C t/Z)]. C t is calculated 
from the concentration at the last sampling time at which the sample is above 
LLQ. 
Z Apparent terminal rate constant calculated from the regression analysis (slope) 
from the log-transformed measured concentrations on the terminal phase of the 
time-point concentration curve 
t½ Apparent terminal half-life calculated from ln(2)/ Z

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 67 of 84 dose/(AUC 0-*Z) 
AUC 0-, Z, t½, CL and Vz will only be calculated for those patients where a sufficient and 
meaningful number of serum concentration values are available. More detailed information on 
the methodology of PK analysis will be supplied in the statistical analysis plan. 
 
14.7 Safety Analysis 
14.7.1 Adverse Events 
The
 primary endpoint is the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). This endpoint will 
be determined based on the Safety Population. 
Adverse events will be coded according to MedDRA (version 15.1) system organ class (SOC) 
and preferred term. Incidence of all AEs will be summarized by SOC, preferred term, 
relationship to treatment, severity and seriousness. Adverse events will be summarized overall 
and by each NHL subtype. 
An AE summary table will be presented showing the incidence and frequency of treatment 
emergent AEs (TEAEs), SAEs, MOR00208-related TEAEs, MOR00208-related TEAEs by 
severity/toxicity (according to NCI-CTC toxicity criteria), and infusion reactions. The 
incidence refers to the number and percentage of patients and the frequency to the number of 
AEs. Exact 95% confidence intervals for the incidence rates will be included for overall 
population. 
The number and percentage of patients with one or more treatment-emergent AEs will be 
summarised by NHL subtype and by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. Such 
summaries will be displayed for all TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severity/toxicity, and TEAEs 
by relationship to study drug. 
The sponsor will describe other AEs of special interest (for the definition please see Section 
11.1), in addition to those reported as SAEs. 
The 
number and percentage of patients with one or more pretreatment AEs will be summarised 
by NHL subtype and by system organ class and preferred term. 
14.7.2  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
The analysis of laboratory parameters will be presented as separated into blood parameters 
(haematology, serum chemistry, endocrinology, coagulation) and urine parameters (urinalysis). 
All data will be listed. 
For haematology and serum chemistry, the laboratory values will be transformed into SI values 
based on SI units to make laboratory parameters comparable between different local 
laboratories. The relevant reference ranges supplied by each laboratory will also be 
transformed into SI reference ranges for each laboratory. 
Descriptive summaries of actual (absolute) values and change-from-baseline values will be 
presented for haematology and serum chemistry for the Safety Population. 
Each abnormal value will be flagged to show whether it is a value below or above the reference 
range. For the assessment of laboratory variables, 5 categories will be used that into account

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 68 of 84 the investigator’s assessment of clinical relevance: ‘clin. rel., above’, ‘non-clin. rel., above’, 
‘within’, ‘non clin. rel., below’, ‘clin. rel., below’. 
The assessment of laboratory variables will be tabulated by time point for each clinical 
laboratory analyte for the Safety Population (frequency tables). Additionally, for each 
laboratory parameter, shifts in assessments from baseline to all postadministration time points 
will be presented (shift tables). 
If NCI-CTC grades are available for a clinical laboratory analyte, they will be derived 
according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0, and used to present additional frequency and shift 
tables based on NCI-CTC grades. 
The assessment of categorical urinalysis variables will be tabulated by time point for each urine 
parameter for the Safety Population (frequency tables). Additionally, for each of these urine 
parameter shifts in assessments from baseline to all postadministration time points will be 
presented (shift tables). 
Laboratory values that are outside the reference range will also be flagged in the data listings, 
along with corresponding reference ranges. 
14.7.3 Physical Examination 
Ba
seline physical examination will be summarized by body system. New and worsening 
abnormal physical examination findings during the study will be entered as AEs and analyzed 
within the AE tables. 
14.7.4 Vital Signs 
De
scriptive summaries of actual values and changes from baseline will be calculated for vital 
signs. These summaries will be presented for the Safety Population at all time points. Each 
abnormal value will be flagged to show whether it is a value below or above the normal limit. 
The normal limits are detailed in the appendix ( Section 17.2). 
14.7.5  Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiogram data will be summarized as change from baseline. The summary ECG 
assessment (categories: “normal; abnormal clinically significant”; “abnormal not clinically 
significant”) will be tabulated by time point for the Safety Population. 
Each abnormal PR (ECG), QRS, and RR interval value will be flagged to show whether it is a 
value below or above the normal limit. The normal limits are detailed in the appendix 
(Section 17.2). 
Summ
ary statistics for all time points will be displayed for QT and both QTc correction 
methods, side-by-side. The Bazett’s corrections method for QTc will be applied as follows:

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 69 of 84 Also, the number and percentage of patients with QTc values above the normal limit 
(441-480 ms, 481-500 ms, or > 500 ms) and the number and percentage of patients who 
experienced a change > 30 ms or a change > 60 ms will be presented by time point. 
14.8 Biomarkers 
Biomarker assessments will include expression levels of CD19 on malignant B cells, FcγRIIa 
and FcγRIIIa genotyping, CD16 expression on NK cells, and B-, T- and NK cell counts.  
In addition, the ADCC capacity of the patient will be assessed.  
Due to the exploratory nature of these assays, the sponsor may decide at any point during the 
study to terminate these assessments, in which case the sites will be informed accordingly. 
 
14.9 Sample Size Determination 
A two-stage design is used to minimize exposure of NHL subtypes not showing responsiveness 
to MOR00208. No formal sample size estimations for determination of futility were computed 
for Stage 1. The number of patients to be used in this stage was determined to be the minimum 
number needed to adequately determine futility in any specific NHL subtype. The entire study 
will enrol between 40 to 120 patients, dependent upon patient response in each subtype in 
Stage 1. 
Stage 1:  Approximately 40 patients, a similar number of patients will be enrolled per NHL 
subtype: 
 FL: 10 patients 
 DLBCL: 10 patients 
 MCL: 10 patients 
 other indolent NHL: 10 patients 
Observing less than 2 responses (at least PR) in 10 patients in any NHL subtype will be the 
criterion for discontinuing evaluation of MOR00208 in that NHL subtype. If the study drug is 
effective with a true ORR of 30%, the probability to stop for futility after the first stage for a 
specific NHL subtype is only 14.9%.  
Stage 2:  For those NHL subtypes with 2 or more responders, an additional 20 patients will be 
enrolled for a total of 30 patients per subtype. Assuming that the true ORR of any NHL type is 
30% and that the number of responses actually observed in the study corresponds to the 
expected number of responses (9 responses), N=30 would yield a lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval for the ORR of 14.7%. Up to a maximum of 80 additional patients, an 
equal number of patients will be enrolled per “responding” NHL subtype. Some of the cohorts 
may have been stopped for futility after Stage 1: 
 FL: 20 patients 
 DLBCL: 20 patients 
 MCL: 20 patients 
 other indolent NHL: 20 patients 
 
Approximately 25 to 30 centres in the United States of America and Europe are planned.

No interference testing will be performed in the study. However, 95% CI of the ORR after 
Stage 2 will be calculated. 
 
14.11  Procedures for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data 
Missing values will not be substituted by estimated values but will be treated as missing in the 
statistical evaluation. All data from all patients dosed in the study will be included in all 
listings, plots, summary tables, and statistical analyses when appropriate. 
 
14.12  Rules for Excluding Patients from Analysis 
All dosed patients will be included in the analyses unless otherwise specified. The sponsor will 
make any decisions regarding whether any patients will be excluded from the evaluations when 
the protocol noncompliance is considered to have a negative impact on the scientific aspects 
and interpretation of the study results. If the patient has received any MOR00208, all available 
safety data will be used. The reason(s) for any exclusion will be described in the report. 
 
14.13  Procedures for Reporting Deviations from Original Statistical 
Plan 
Details of the analyses to be performed on data from this study will be provided in a separate 
SAP. Any deviations from the statistical analysis outlined in this protocol will be described, 
and reasons for the deviations listed, in the final clinical study report. 
 
15 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
15.1 Institutional Review 
Before starting this study, the protocol (authorized by the sponsor) will be submitted to the 
regulatory bodies/local health authorities (in accordance with local regulations) and to the 
IEC/IRB for evaluation. The protocol will also be signed by the principal investigators before 
submission to the IEC/IRB and to regulatory authorities where applicable. The study will not 
start at the concerned study site before the respective IEC/IRB gives written approval or a 
favourable opinion in accordance with ICH E6 GCP and all applicable regulatory bodies/local 
health authorities give approval or a favourable opinion as required. 
No substantial changes to the final approved (authorized) protocol will be initiated without the 
IEC’s/IRB’s prior written approval or favourable opinion and approval by the regulatory 
bodies/local health authorities of a written amendment, except when necessary to eliminate 
immediate hazards to the patients or when the change involves only logistics or administration. 
The sponsor will authorize and the principal investigator(s) will sign the protocol amendment 
before submission to the IECs/IRBs. Protocol amendments should be submitted to the IEC/IRB 
without delay. Any significant deviation from the protocol when no approved amendment

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 71 of 84 exists will be regarded as a protocol noncompliance, and will be addressed as such during the 
reporting of the study. 
15.2 Ethical Considerations 
15.2.1 Regulatory and Ethical Compliance 
Thi
s clinical study was designed and shall be conducted and reported in accordance with the 
protocol, with ICH E6 GCP, with applicable local regulations, and with the ethical principles 
laid down in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
15.2.2 Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB/IEC 
The
 protocol and the proposed patient information/informed consent form must be reviewed 
and approved by a properly constituted IRB/IEC before study start. A signed and dated 
statement that the protocol and informed consent form have been approved by the 
IRB/IEC/Regional Surveillance authority must be given to the sponsor before study initiation. 
Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his 
or her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the 
instructions and procedures found in this protocol. 
The IRB/IEC must be informed of all substantial subsequent protocol amendments and of 
reportable suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other unexpected 
safety issues occurring during the study that are likely to affect the safety of the patients or the 
conduct of the study. Approval for such changes must be transmitted in writing to the sponsor 
by the investigator. 
The IRB/IEC should be provided with all updates of the IB. Also, written reports should be 
provided to the IRB/IEC annually or more frequently if requested on any change significantly 
affecting the conduct of the study and/or increasing risk to the patients. A final report of study 
outcome, if required, should also be submitted to the IRB/IEC. 
 
15.3 Investigator’s Responsibilities 
15.3.1  Overall Responsibilities 
The investigator is responsible for conducting the study in full accordance with the protocol 
and the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guideline, approved by the ICH, and any applicable national and local laws and regulations. 
Information regarding any investigational centres participating in this study that do not comply 
with these standards will be documented, and noncompliant sites should be excluded. 
The investigator is accountable for the performance of the study (treatment of the patient and 
the documentation). If any responsibilities are delegated, the investigator should maintain a list 
of appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related 
duties. 
A “Delegation of Authority Log” will be filled in and signed by the responsible investigator. In 
accordance with this authority log, study site staff (eg, subinvestigators, nurses) will be 
authorized to perform study-related tasks and to enter specific data into the eCRF. 
Product Name: MOR00208 Protocol Number: MOR208C201 
Date: 26 May 2020 IND Number: 114,856 
Protocol Amendment 5, Final v7.0 EudraCT Number: 2012-002659-41 
 
MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 72 of 84 The CRO or designee is responsible for IRB/IEC submission, monitoring, biometry, data 
management, pharmacovigilance, and part of project management. The relevant submissions to 
the Competent Authorities are being handled by the sponsor in close cooperation with the 
CRO. 
Most clinical laboratory tests will be done locally. Each investigator will receive detailed 
written instructions on the laboratory samples to be taken and laboratories to be used. 
15.3.2 Patient Informed Consent 
The
 investigator will obtain a freely given written consent from each patient after an 
appropriate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards and any 
other aspect of the study that is relevant to the patient's decision to participate. The informed 
consent form must be signed, with name and date and time noted by the patient, before the 
patient is exposed to any study-related procedure, including screening tests for eligibility. 
The investigator will explain that the patients are completely free to refuse to enter the study or 
to withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and without 
the need to justify. The investigator or delegate should complete the informed consent section 
of the eCRF for each patient enrolled. 
Each patient will be informed that his or her source records may be reviewed by the study 
monitor, a quality assurance auditor, a health authority inspector (eg, FDA, 
Paul-Ehrlich-Institut [PEI]), or other individuals in accordance with applicable regulations, and 
that these persons are bound by confidentiality obligations. The investigator will protect any 
personal information not related to the study and will assure that these persons are bound by 
confidentiality obligations. 
15.3.3 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents 
The
 monitors, auditors, authorized personnel of the sponsor, health authority inspectors or their 
agents, and authorized members of IECs/IRBs will be given direct access to source data and 
documentation medical charts/records, laboratory results, printouts, videotapes, etc) for source 
data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local 
requirements. 
15.3.4  Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients 
The investigators must assure that the privacy of the patients, including their personal identity 
and all other personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In eCRFs and other 
documents or image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will not be identified by their 
names but by an identification code (eg, initials and study patient number). 
Personal medical information may be scrutinized for the purpose of verifying data recorded in 
the eCRF. This may be done by the monitor, properly authorized persons on behalf of the 
sponsor, the quality assurance unit, or regulatory authorities. Personal medical information will 
always be treated as confidential. Should the need arise that the investigator forwards a copy of 
personal medical information (ie laboratory report) to the sponsor or delegate, then the 
investigator is responsible for obliterating all patient details revealing their personal identity.

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 73 of 84 15.3.5 Relevant Protocol Noncompliances 
Nonc
ompliances from the protocol should not occur. If noncompliances occur, the investigator 
should promptly inform the medical monitor or the monitor for nonclinical aspects and the 
implication of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed. Any noncompliances must be 
documented, stating the reason and date, the action taken, and the impact on the patient and/or 
the study. The documentation must be kept in the investigator’s study file and the sponsor’s 
file. 
Examples of relevant protocol noncompliances that will be addressed (but are not limited to 
these) are as follows: 
 Patients who enter the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria 
 Patients who develop withdrawal criteria during the study 
 Patients who receive the incorrect dose 
 Patients who receive an excluded concomitant treatment (eg, another mAb). 
 Noncompliance with protocol setting that puts the safety of the patient or the scientific 
validity of the study at risk 
 
In case of any major protocol noncompliances, the investigator will decide on the further 
participation of the patient in this study, after having discussed all relevant aspects with the 
medical monitor. The sponsor may, however, request the exclusion of such a patient from 
further participation in the study. 
A list of all included patients with all deviations from the intended study procedures and other 
criteria that may affect the patient's validity for statistical analysis will be prepared upon 
clinical completion of the study. This will then be discussed by a panel consisting of the 
clinical project manager, a medical expert of the sponsor, the data manager, and the study 
biometrician. This panel will decide upon the membership of the patient in the patient 
populations for statistical analysis. 
 
15.4 Study Monitoring 
Study monitoring will be performed in accordance with ICH E6 GCP, the CRO’s SOPs, the 
protocol, and applicable local regulations. 
 
15.5 Audit and Inspection 
According to ICH E6 GCP, the sponsor or regulatory authorities may audit the investigational 
sites. The sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit, independent of the Clinical Research and 
Development Department, is responsible for auditing the study. The investigator must accept 
such audits by sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit and ensure access to source documentation. 
The investigator must accept that regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection to verify 
compliance of the study with GCP. If informed that a regulatory inspection will take place, the 
investigator must inform the sponsor without delay.

This study is covered under the sponsor’s Liability Insurance Policy covering damage to 
patients according to applicable legal requirements. A copy of the Certificate of Insurance 
and/or an information leaflet containing essential information about the insurance coverage 
will be provided to the investigator as required by Regulatory Authorities, IRBs or IECs. 
The investigator must inform the patients accordingly and must also point out that the patients 
are allowed to undergo other medical treatment (except in an emergency) only with the 
investigator’s prior approval or to receive additional medication only with the investigator’s 
prior approval. 
 
15.7 Study Report and Publication Policy 
The results of this clinical study will be documented in an integrated clinical study report 
according to ICH E3 Note for Guidance on Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports, 
which will be signed by the authors, sponsor, and coordinating investigator. Reports will also 
be generated for IEC/IRB review and for regulatory reporting as required. 
Any presentation or publication of data from this study will be intended as a joint publication 
by the investigator(s)/appropriate study centre personnel and appropriate sponsor personnel. 
Authorship will follow the ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to 
Biomedical Journals and will be defined prior to the first publication. All other investigators, 
coinvestigators, and study coordinators will be listed in an acknowledgement. 
For multicenter studies, it is mandatory that the first publication be based on data from all 
centres, and that data are analyzed and submitted as stipulated in the protocol by a statistician 
assigned by the sponsor. The authors have the final responsibility for the decision to submit 
their manuscript and shall be given full access to the data resulting from the study. The 
coordinating investigator and/or authors shall coordinate any intended publication of study 
results with the sponsor, to enable the sponsor to ensure that results are presented in a 
responsible and coherent manner. The sponsor reserves the right to review all manuscripts and 
abstracts before their submission for publication or presentation. This is not intended to restrict 
or hinder publication or presentation, but is to allow the sponsor to protect the confidentiality 
of information and to provide comments that may not yet available to the investigator. In the 
rare event that such publication would affect the patentability of any invention to which the 
sponsor has rights, the sponsor has the right to request an additional delay to the proposed 
publication of no more than 90 days so as to allow the sponsor to protect its intellectual 
property rights. 
The results of the study may be used by MorphoSys AG for the purposes of national and 
international registration, publication, and information for medical professionals. If necessary, 
the authorities will be notified of the investigators’ names, addresses, qualifications, and extent 
of involvement.

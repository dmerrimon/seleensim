 2.  BACKGROUND  
  
 2.1  Study Disease and Rationale  
  
Approximately 40% of cancer patients are diagnosed with spine metastases at some point 
during their disease course (1) and up to 90% of terminal cancer patients have evidence 
of metastatic spinal disease on post -mortem studies (2 -6).  Management of spine 
metastases varies depending on the individual patient circumstances, but may include 
systemic therapy alone or radiation  therapy.  In patients with spinal instability, spinal 
cord compression, or neurologic deficits as a result of their spine disease, the standard of 
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  7  care is direct decompression and/or stabilization followed by radiation therapy based on a 
large randomized study which revealed significantly higher rates of ambulation in 
patients undergoing surgical resection followed by radiation therapy versus radiation 
therapy alone (7).    
    
Rates of local recurrence following surgical resection alone are high (Gilbert, Black, 
Greenberg, Rodriguez, Sorensen), likely at least in part as a result of difficulty attaining a 
widely negative surgical margin, especially in the epidural space.  As suc h, radiation 
therapy is typically offered following surgical resection of a metastatic spine lesion in 
order to decrease the risk of local recurrence and development of neurologic deficits or 
cord compression.  Historically most patients have been treated with conventional 
radiation therapy which generally involves 2 -3 weeks of daily radiation treatment to both 
the involved vertebral levels as well as a vertebral level above and below.  However, 
recurrence rates following conventional radiation therapy to t he spine are high and 
patients frequently require retreatment for progressive or recurrent symptomatic disease 
(Klekamp and Samii, Chow E, Sze WM, Wu JS).    
  
More recently, a 1 -5 day course of stereotactic radiosurgery has been utilized as a method 
of de livering a higher biological equivalent dose and hopefully reducing local recurrence 
rates particularly in patients with oligometastatic disease, radioresistant primaries, 
recurrence after prior radiation therapy, high risk of epidural disease, or who have  social 
or clinical need for shortened treatment duration.  The safety and efficacy of SRS in 
patients with intact vertebral disease has been well established and is currently being 
compared to conventional radiation therapy in the context of a randomized controlled 
trial (RTOG 0631).  Data suggests that in spite of the smaller field size with SRS, rates of 
marginal failure are low and local control rates are high (Ahmed IJROBP 2011; Gerszten, 
Jin, Ryu, Chang, Ryu).  Although frequently performed in standar d clinical practice, only 
3 small retrospective studies have been published to date exploring the efficacy of SRS in 
post-operative patients with resected spine metastases (Rock, Moulding, Gerszten), and 
the role and benefit of SRS in this setting remains uncertain.  
  
As systemic therapies improve and survival times increase for many cancers, it is likely 
that the incidence and prevalence of spinal metastases will increase as well, and 
improving management of spine metastases will be critical in minimizing  pain, 
improving neurologic function, and potentially improving survival. The purpose of the 
study is to prospectively examine the efficacy of post -operative SRS boost in patients 
who have undergone surgical resection of metastatic spine disease.  
  
 3.  PATIENT SELECTION  
  
   3.1  Eligibility Criteria   
  
3.1.1    Age ≥12 years   
  
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  8  3.1.2 Histologically proven solid tumor malignancy with metastasis to the spine. 
Diagnosis may be acquired from needle biopsy, cytology, surgical biopsy or 
resection.  
  
3.1.3 Radiographic evidence of spinal metastasis is required and may be obtained from 
radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography imaging, and magnetic resonance 
imaging. Other studies may be used with principal investigator approval, but plain 
radiograph (X -ray) alone is not sufficient.  
  
3.1.4 The patient must have undergone surgical resection (gross total, subtotal, or biopsy) 
of the spinal lesion(s) no more than 16 weeks prior to SRS treatment.  
  
3.1.5 Treating physician must deem that SRS is appropriate treatment for the metastatic 
spinal lesion(s).  
  
3.1.6 Each SRS target must be the equivalent of ≤3 vertebral levels   
  
3.1.7 The patient must have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 40 or greater (Append ix 
F).  
  
3.1.8 If a woman is of child -bearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test                          
must be demonstrated prior to treatment. Women of childbearing potential and                           
men must agree to use adequat e contraception (hormonal or barrier method of                           
birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation and for up to 12                          
weeks following the study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she i s                          
pregnant while participating in this study she should inform her treating physician                          
immediately.  
  
3.1.9 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent   
document.

3.2.3 Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing 
or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, 
cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit 
compli ance with study requirements will be excluded.  
  
3.2.4 Pregnant women are excluded. We recommend that women of child -bearing 
potential use an acceptable method of birth control to avoid pregnancy for 6 
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  9  months following stereotactic radiosurgery and that m ale subjects use effective 
contraception for the same period.

 5.  TREATMENT PLAN  
  
5.1 Treatment Planning  
  
5.1.1 Simulation  
  
  All patients will be immobilized in a reproducible radiosurgery setup as 
deemed most appropriate by treating physician and clinical team.  Patients 
will undergo CT simulation preferably both with and without intravenous 
contrast.  If there is a contraindication to CT contrast it is ok to wit hhold it at 
the discretion of the treating physician.  In addition, unless there is a 
contraindication to MRI they will undergo MRI simulation including T1 with 
gadolinium, T2 and STIR axial and saggital sequences.  For precise 
delineation of the spinal co rd, patients should undergo CT myelogram 
(optional) unless the spinal cord is adequately visualized on simulation MRI.  
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  10  Scans should include at least 1 vertebral level above and below the involved 
levels.  
  
    
5.1.2 Image Fusion  
  
Following completion o f simulation scans, the following datasets will be 
fused using the treatment planning software: 1) CT simulation; 2) CT 
myelogram (if performed); 3) pre -operative diagnostic scan; 4) MRI 
simulation.  The exact sequences of these scans to fuse will be at th e 
discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon.  If a patient 
is unable to undergo one of these scans he may remain on the protocol at the 
discretion of both the treating physician and principal investigator.    
  
5.1.3 Tumor and Object  At Risk (OAR) Delineation  
  
Tumor and OARs will be delineated and approved by both the treating 
radiation oncologist and treating neurosurgeon.    
  
5.1.3.1     Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)  
  
GTV will defined as the residual disease as visualized on post -operative 
imaging.  
    
5.1.3.2     Clinical Target Volume (CTV)  
  
CTV will account for the GTV, tumor bed, and other sites of potential 
microscopic disease spread at the discretion of the treating physicians.  
The CTV should include areas of disease on pr e-operative imaging as well 
as surgical findings as documented in operative notes and in personal 
communications with the surgeon.  Surgical incision does not need to be 
included in the treatment volume except in unique situations where it is 
believed to b e a region at high risk of recurrence.  
  
5.1.3.3 Planning Target Volume (PTV)  
    
PTV will include the CTV plus approximately 1.5 -2 mm geometric 
expansion.  PTV should be reduced as necessary so that the PTV does not 
extend into the cord contour.    
  
5.1.3.4   Object at risk (OAR)  
  
Adjacent OARs will be contoured on the simulation films.  The maximal 
dose constraints are as follows:  
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  11    
Spinal cord (as defined on CT myelogram plus 2 mm).  Should be 
delineated at least 1 vertebral body above and below PT V: 25 Gy to 0.1 cc   
  
Cauda equina (defined as thecal sac on CT myelogram without margin).   
Should be delineated at least 1 vertebral body above and below PTV: 25  
Gy to 0.1 cc  
  
Esophagus: 32.5 Gy  
  
Heart/pericardium: 35 Gy  
  
Great vessels: 55 Gy  
  
Trachea: 32.5 Gy  
  
Skin: 40 Gy  
  
Kidney: According to current Johns Hopkins Hospital standard SBRT 
practices  
  
5.1.4 Radiation Prescription and Dosimetry   
  
Patients will be treated to a total dose of 30 Gy with a once daily fractionation 
schedule of 6  Gy per fraction, administered Monday through Friday.  
Treatment may begin on any weekday with break for weekend, as long as the 
patient receives at least 2 fractions the first week.  Radiation treatment 
planning will be performed by a specialized dosimetr ist or physicist.  Goal 
PTV coverage is >90% receiving >90% of prescription dose but coverage 
should be compromised as necessary to meet normal tissue constraints as 
outlined above and will not be considered a protocol deviation.  Final plan 
approval and s pinal cord dose is at the discretion of the treating physician and 
final prescription dose may be reduced to meet spine cord constraints if 
deemed necessary by the treating physician (for example, in cases of epidural 
disease or disease abutting the spine cord).  
  
5.1.5 Equipment  
  
Patients will be treated using a megavoltage linear accelerator with nominal 
beam energy of 6 MV.  
  
 5.1.6 Beam Verification    
  
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  12  Either on -line cone beam CT guidance or orthogonal imaging will be used 
according to the standard Johns Hopkins radiosurgery protocol for precise 
patient setup.  Images will be reviewed and approved by a physician prior to 
initiation of treatment.    
    
    
5.1.7 Therapy Interruption  
  
For radiation therapy interruptions of up to and including 5 days, irradiation 
should be completed to the full prescribed dose.  On the last day, the total 
number of fractions and the reasons for interrupting therapy must be 
documented  
  
If radiation therapy interruption goes beyond 5 days, th e patient will be 
removed from the protocol treatment.  Resumption and completion of 
treatment will then be at the discretion of the radiation oncologist in 
consultation with the principal investigator.  All patients who initiate protocol 
treatment will be  followed per the study calendar.  
    
5.1.8 Risks of Radiation  
  
Short term toxicities of radiation therapy include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, hair loss in treated area, erythema or irritation of the skin, dry skin, 
difficulties with wound heal ing, difficulty or pain with swallowing, worsening 
or new neurologic deficits, injury to nerves or spinal cord causing disability 
and pain, weakness of limbs, bowel and bladder dysfunction, decrease in blood 
cell counts, edema of cord requiring steroids, d amage to the baby if patient is 
or becomes pregnant, decreased sperm count, death.      
  
Long term toxicities include damage to spinal cord resulting in paralysis or 
death, damage to other normal structures such as kidney, lung, heart, liver, 
bowel, skin,  esophagus, weakening of bone with increased risk of fracture, 
growth abnormalities of bones, muscles or other organs, second tumor or 
cancer caused by radiation.  
  
 5.2  Follow Up   
  
Patients will be followed until the time of data analysis for the study. At two years 
following completion of post -operative stereotactic radiosurgery, follow -up imaging 
will be performed only at the discretion of the treating physician. It is preferred that 
follow -up imaging and evaluation be performed at Johns Hopkins, but they may also 
be performed at outside facilities as necessary for insurance, scheduling, or other 
reasons. If a patient is unable to be seen at Johns Hopkins for follow -up we will 
collect patient reported toxicity via telephone.  
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  13    
Follow -up imaging should include CT and/or MRI followed by CT myelogram  
(optional) if the results of initial imaging studies are inconclusive and the patient has 
symptomatic evidence of progression.  
  
Follow -up evaluations will include a complete neurological exam and evaluation of 
the surgical wound, neurologic evaluation by the ASIA Impairment Scale 
(Appendix A), and pain evaluation by the 10 point visual analog scale (Appendix B) 
and MDACC brief pain inventory short form (Appendix C).  
  
 5.3  Toxicity  
  
Toxicit y will be recorded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.  Early stopping will be considered for grade 4 
or greater spinal cord toxicity according to this scale that is attributable to the study 
intervention.  T he criteria are available online at the Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm#ctc_40   
  
Toxicity will also be monitored according to the RTOG/EORTC acute (Appendix D) 
and late (Appendix E) common toxicity assessments for CNS and spinal cord.  
Consideration for early stopping will be considered for grade 4 or greater spinal cord 
toxicity according to this scale attributable to study intervention.   
  
 5.4  Duration of Th erapy  
  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, radiosurgery will be 
administered for a total of 5 fractions or until one of the following criteria applies:  
  
- Disease progression,  
- Intercurrent illness that prevents further administrati on of treatment,  
- Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
- Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
- General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
  
 5.5  Criteria for Removal from Study  
  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed applies:  
  
- Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
- Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
- General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 J12133 Version 06/26/2018  14    
 The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be 
documented in the Case Report Fo rm. If a participant withdraws from the study, they 
will be followed for survival data.   
  
6. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
  
 Not applicable.    
    
  7.  STUDY CALENDAR  
Every effort should be made to adhere to the protocol timeline as closely as possi ble, but if studies are delayed or missed as a result of 
unavoidable conflicts such as hospitalization at an outside facility, deteriorating of patient status, or other adversity pre cluding presentation for 
evaluation, it will not be considered a protocol deviation.

1Surgical resection includes gross total resection, subtotal resection, or biopsy. Margin status (negative, microscopically po sitive, gross disease) should be recorded.  Margin status should be based on 
the pathology report if possible, but when not recorde d on pathology report may be based on the operative note, post -operative imaging and/or personal communications between the treating physician 
and surgeon  
2Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 4 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy.  
3CT simulation is required for radiation treatment planning. CT simulation must be conducted within 8 weeks prior to protocol therapy.  MRI simulation for treatment planning is at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
 4Medical history should be a compl ete history at pre -study evaluation, but later histories will be interval histories only.    
5Use RTOG Acute Toxicity Criteria during RT and for first 6 months following completion of RT.  Use RTOG Late Toxicity Criteri a at baseline and at scheduled interv als 6 months following completion 
of RT.  
6CT scan may be performed with or without contrast  
7Imaging which is delayed or missed as a result of the deterioration of the patient’s clinical condition or other adversity wi ll not be considered a protocol violation.  
8If a patient is unable to be seen for a follow -up consult, we will assess the patient’s condition via telephone.

evidence of progression on CT, MRI and/or CT myelogr am based on direct comparisons by at 
least 2 members of the team of the most recently obtained radiographic images compared to 
the immediate pretreatment images AND 2) progressive symptoms defined as worsening 
neurologic function attributable to tumor grow th at the level treated according to the ASIA 
Impairment Scale OR worsening pain attributable to tumor growth at the treated level 
according to the MDACC brief pain inventory (short form) defined as a new score ≥5 at the 
treated level of spine  
  
9.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
  
9.1   Study Design/Endpoints  
          
      9.1.1   Study Design  
  
This is a phase II trial evaluating the rate radiographic local recurrence following 
post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost in patients with metastat ic solid 
malignancies with spine metastases status post resection.  
    
9.1.2 Endpoints  
  
9.1.2.1  Primary Endpoint  
  
Radiographic local recurrence at 12 months in each patient.  
Radiographic local recurrence (LR) will be defined as evidence of 
progressive disease on CT and/or MRI in the treatment volume or at the 
margin of the treatment field when compared to imaging studies prior to 
the post -operative radiosurgical boost.  The de termination of local 
progression will be made by at least 1 radiation oncologist and 1 
neurosurgeon and confirmed by a neuro -radiologist and the Principal 
Investigator.  If equivocal, the lesion may be followed with serial short 
interval scans for further clarification.  If the equivocal lesion develops 
into local recurrence on serial scans, the timing of local recurrence will be 
backdated to the date of the first suspicious CT or MRI.  
  
9.1.2.2  Secondary Endpoints  
  
9.1.2.2.1  Time to radiographic local r ecurrence in each patient  
  
9.1.2.2.2  Re-treatment at 12 months in each patient   
Retreatment is defined as either radiosurgery, conventional 
radiation therapy or surgical intervention to the area that was 
J12133 Version 06/26/2018  18  treated because of tumor progression in that regi on as defined by 
imaging studies according to the primary objective  
  
9.1.2.2.3  Symptomatic local recurrence at 12 months in each patient   
Symptomatic local recurrence requires 2 of the following:  
1) EITHER:  
NEW pain in treated region of ≥5  on the MD Ande rson 
Cancer Center brief pain inventory OR:  
Worse performance on ASIA Impairment Scale  
  
AND:  
2) Evidence of local recurrence on imaging as defined in the 
primary objective  
  
9.1.2.2.4  NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4 and RTOG/EORTC acute and late common toxicity 
assessments for CNS and spinal cord for each patients.  
Radiation myelopathy is defined as grade 4 or greater spinal 
cord toxicity according to this scale.  
  
9.1.2.2.5  Examination of wound at each follow -up visit for each patient.  
Wound dehiscence is defined as a re -opening of the surgical 
wound which is independent from wound infection.  
  
9.1.2.2.6  Time to return to chemotherapy in each pat ient measured from 
first day of radiosurgery treatment  
  
9.1.2.2.7  Tumor histology in each patient  
  
9.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
 9.2.1 Sample Size    
A total of 35 patients will be enrolled in the protocol.  Assuming a 60% 
radiographic local control rate at 12 months with conventional radiation 
therapy (Rades 2009), our trial will need a total of 35 patients to yield 80% 
power detecting 20% absolute imp rovement (LC=80%) at an alpha level of 
0.05 (one -sided) to be statistically significant.   
    
             9.2.2  Accrual  
    We anticipate enrollment of approximately 1 -2 patients per month to the         
protocol with accrual completed in approximately  24 months.  
  
9.2.2.4    Stratification Factors  
  
            There will be no stratification factors upon initial enrollment in the protocol.    
J12133 Version 06/26/2018  19    
 9.3   Statistical Analysis plan  
  
 9.3.1  Primary:   
The proportion of patients who were absence of local recurrence (local control) at 12 
months after initial SRS will be estimated along with 90% confidence interval. The 
local recurrence is defined in section 9.1.2.1.   
  
9.3.2 Secondary:  
  
Time to radiogr aphic local recurrence will be calculated from the date of initial SRS to 
the date of LR was documented. Probability of time to LR and median time to LR will 
be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method.   
  
A proportion of patient being retreated during first 1 2 months since initial SRS will be 
estimated along with 95% confidence interval.  
  
The symptomatic local recurrence rate at 12 months will be estimated along with 95% 
confidence interval using binomial distribution.  
  
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and 
RTOG/EORTC acute and late common toxicity assessments for CNS and spinal cord 
will be used for scoring toxicity and adverse events. The proportion of patients who 
experience grade 3 or above toxicities will be est imated, along with 95% confidence 
intervals by each type of toxicity. Observed sever adverse event associated with SRS 
including radiation myelopathy will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
  
Time to return to chemotherapy will be calculated fro m the date of initial SRS to the 
starting date of chemotherapy. The chemotherapy date is censored if patient has not had 
chemotherapy at time the study database is closed for final analysis. Probability of time 
to return to chemotherapy will be estimated u sing Kaplan -Meier method.       
  
Patient’s tumor histology and wound healing will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.   
     
10.   ADVERSE EVENTS AND RECORDING   
  
 10.1  Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition during or following an exposure to a 
treatment, whether or not considered causally related to the treatment.  An undesirable 
medical condition may be symptoms (headache, nausea), signs (tachycardia, enlarged 
liver), or abnormal results of an investigation (MRI, laboratory finding).  In clinical trials, 
J12133 Version 06/26/2018  20  from the time of signing an informed consent, an AE may include an undesirable medical 
condition, occurring at any time, even if no trial treatment has been administered.  
  
10.2      Radiation Related Adverse Events    
  
All radiation related adverse events will be recorded on the local toxicity case report 
forms.  
  
11.  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) AND REPORTING  
  
 11.1  Serious Adverse Event  
  
11.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring at any point during a clinical trial that 
fulfills one or more of the following criteria:   
  
● Results in death.  
  
● Is immediately life threatening.  
  
● Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
  
● Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
  
● Unexpected event that cause harm or place person at a greater r isk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized, and which was possibly related to 
the research.  Unexpected means that the event was not described in the 
consent form or the event exceeded the expected severity.  
  
● Is an important medical event that m ay jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
  
11.2      SAE Reporting Guidelines for Johns Hopkins Hospital  
  
All SAE, with the exception of death, must be reported to the Johns Hopkins Hospital 
Institutional Review Board (JH -IRB) within 10 working days of the principal 
investigator learning of the event.  Reporting for the death of a patient which was 
unexpected (i.e.: not related to a risk of participation that was listed in the protocol or 
the consent document, and was more likely than not to be caused by the research 
procedure/intervention, must be reported to the JH -IRB within 3 working days of 
when the princi pal investigator receives the report of the death.  Reporting for death of 
a participant that was expected due to the nature of the patient’s underlying disease or 
condition, or identified as caused by a possible risk of the study 
procedure/intervention as  described in this protocol or consent form, must be reported 
J12133 Version 06/26/2018  21  to the JH -IRB within 10 working days from the time the principal investigator learns 
of the event.  If death occurs 30 days after the participant has stopped or completed 
their study treatment, the principal investigator does not have to report the death until 
the time of continuing review.    
12.     DATA AND SAFETY REPORTING/ REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
  
 12.1   Data Quality Monitoring  
  
In addition to the ongoing quality assurance evaluations  for each individual at the time 
of treatment, there will be regular internal monitoring meetings between the principal 
investigator, a medical oncologist, and the study coordinator to assess the data quality.  
These meetings will occur annually and a moni toring report of the findings will be 
submitted to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee on an annual basis.  Any protocol 
deviations or violations will be documented in the monitoring reports.  The review 
will include: consent forms, eligibility criteria, protocol compliance, treatment 
administration, toxicity reports, response, regulatory compliance, case report forms 
(completeness as well as verifying that information coded on the case report forms are 
supported by source documents), and all other materia ls related to the trial.  This is a 
Level I study under the SKCCC Data Monitoring Plan (date).  The Clinical Research 
Office QA group will assume external auditing responsibilities by performing an audit 
at the end of the first year and then periodically t hereafter depending on the rate of 
accrual and prior audit results.  The Safety Monitoring Committee will review this 
trial for safety and data quality annually.  
  
 12.2    Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
  
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
(12/6/2012).  The Clinical Research Office QA Group will perform an audit after  
the first subject has been treated and then periodically depending on the rate of  
accrual and prior a udit results.  All trial monitoring and reporting will be reviewed  
annually by the SKCCC Safety Monitoring Committee.  
  
The PI is responsible for monitoring the study.  Data must be reviewed to assure the 
validity of data, as well as, the safety of the s ubjects.  The PI will also monitor the 
progress of the trial, review safety reports, and clinical trial efficacy endpoints and to 
confirm that the safety outcomes favor continuation of the study. The PI will also be 
responsible for maintaining the clinical  protocol, reporting adverse events, assuring 
that consent is obtained and documented, reporting of unexpected outcomes, and 
reporting the status of the trial in the continuing renewal report submitted to the IRB 
and to the trial monitoring review group.  
  
 12.3  Data Reporting  
  
12.3.1 Method  
          
J12133 Version 06/26/2018  22  Data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs). These CRFs will be completed by 
the study coordinator. The CRFs for each subject will be kept in a separate research 
binder. Along with each completed C RF there will be corresponding source 
documentation filed for verification. The Principal Investigator, Research Study Nurse, 
and Study Coordinator will informally meet on a regular basis to make sure that the trial is 
progressing as mandated by the protoc ol. The CRO will audit this trial per their standards 
to ensure and verify that the protocol is be carried out according to specs as well as to 
verify that data included on subject CRFs are accurate. Exit reports generated as a result 
of these CRO audits w ill be forwarded to both the Safety Monitoring Committee as well  
as to the adjudicating IRB of record for review.

SUMMARY  19 
Meniere’s disease (MD) affects 2 to 4 people per 10,000 and represents up to 15% of new 20 
patients with vertigo in a tertiary neurotology clinic.1 As of yet, it s pathophysiology is uncertain  21 
and there is no gold -standard treatment .2 Given the lack of level I  evidence for  MD therapies, we 22 
seek to perform a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, crossover, pilot trial of 23 
venlafaxine extended -release (ER) 37.5 mg daily for the prophylactic treatment of MD. 24 
Venlafaxine is a safe and well -tolerated medication,3-5 and it will be trialed at the lower end of 25 
the dosage spectrum typically used for depression.6 No literature exists for the use of venlafaxine 26 
in MD, but there  is evidence that it could be e ffective through both central and peripheral 27 
vestibular -modulating mechanisms.  28 
Venlafaxine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) typically used in 29 
the treatment of depression.7 There is evidence to suggest that selective serotonin reuptake 30 
inhibitors (SSRIs) can be effective in the treatment of MD through serotonin’s ability to 31 
modulate vestibular function in vestibular nuclei, the inferior olive, and the cerebellum.8,9 32 
Norepinephrine has also been shown to inhibit activity in vestibular nuclei.10 Lamotrigine, a 33 
serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in 34 
treating MD and is currently in a clinical trial .11 Venlafaxine can reduce vasopressin receptor 35 
activation .12 This may reduce endolymphatic hydrops, because the endolymphatic sac expresses 36 
vasopressin receptors which may be important in fluid and ion homeostasis in the inner ear.13-16 37 
Venlafaxine is well -known in the treatment of anxiety and depression ,17,18 which are 38 
common comorbidities in MD19 that may ultimately contribute to a cycle of somatic and 39 
psychological symptoms  synergistically aggravating  disease  perception .19,20 Furthermore,  40 
migraine is quite common in MD.21,22 Venlafaxine has been shown to be effective in the 41 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 3 
 
treatment of migraine6 and vestibular migraine,23,24 which highlights its potential in treating MD 42 
given that  vestibular migraine may share with MD many aspects of presentation and 43 
pathophysiology .25,26 44 
This trial will take place in a tertiary, multidisciplinary, vestibular -focused, neurotology 45 
clinic  at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), led by Dr. Habib Rizk . Dr. Yuan Liu 46 
will assist with patient recruitment in clinic and project coordination. Dr. Shaun Nguyen will also 47 
help with project coordination, as well as data analysis given his expertise in conducting clinical 48 
trials. Forty subjects will be recruited to achieve 80% power in detecting a t least a  30% 49 
difference in vertigo frequency control . The study will require about 1 4.5 months t o complete: an 50 
8-month recruitment period  to obtain 40 subjects ; and for each subject a 1-month lead -in 51 
screen ing period,  a 2-month first treatment phase, a 1 .5-month washout phase, and a 2 -month 52 
second treatment phase. The subjects will be randomized to treatment and the investigators will 53 
be blind ed to outcomes until after the data have been collected and analyzed. Using patient - 54 
reported symptoms and various validated instruments, the outcome s measured will include 55 
change in vertiginous symptoms, functional level, cognitive function, anxiety and depression 56 
severity,  and quality of life  (QOL) . 57 
If the results demonstrate that  venla faxine is effective in the prophylactic treat ment of  58 
patients with MD, the path will be paved for larger parallel -treatment design studies. Serotonin 59 
and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors  have not been trialed in MD, but t hey hold promise as a 60 
non-invasive medical treatment option . 61

A. Personal Statement  113 
I am a neurotologist committed to a research career aiming to develop a better understanding of 114 
undertreated /underdiagnosed  or poorly investigated vestibular disorders such as vestibular 115 
migraine , Meniere’s disease  and superior semicircular canal dehiscence, their impact on patients, 116 
as well as determining the best treatment course for these entities. My long -term goal is to 117 
develop metrics t hat would allow us to improve patients’ quality of life, reduce their fall risk, and  118 
minimize their  loss of productivity. I am a fellowship -trained neurotologist and have participated 119 
in multiple clinical outcome s-related research trials for various neurotologic pathologies during 120 
my postdoctoral training , resulting in 30 publications. Upon completing my clinical training, I 121 
was recruited to establish and direct a multidisciplinary vestibular program at the Medical 122 
University of South Carolina. Our team is comprised of neurologists, physical therapists , 123 
dieticians,  and audiologists who collaborate to provide the best care for patients with vestibular 124 
disorders. We see approximately 2000 patients a year with various causes of dizziness and gait 125 
disturbances. Since 2015, I have served on educational panels in the American Academy of 126 
Otolaryngology, notably the Equilibrium Committee, as well as the joint task force with the 127 
American Academy of Neurology to develop  measures aiming to improve the clinical evaluation 128 
of vestibular patients. I have also served as a physician expert on the American Balance Society 129 
(ABS) multidisciplinary meetings . I am also an ABS  board member an d I chair the program and 130 
the nomination committee s. I am the co -director of the biennial Charleston Vestibular Update 131 
Course. I have completed a Master of Science in Clinical Research to get more formal training in 132 
epidemiology, study design and analysis , biostatistics and regression analysis, community 133 
engagement research, grant application development, and team science , in order to 134 
better  accomplish my research goals. To date, we have quantified the impact of vestibular 135 
disorders on cognitive function (a) . We have also  defined  the skull base thickness in patients 136 
with superior semicircular canal dehiscence ( b). Th ese works  led to a collaboration with the 137 
Otolaryngology and Neurosurgery departments of the University of Cincinnati on a 138 
contemporary review on idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( c), as well as to a collaboration 139 
with the Neurotology Division at the University of California San Francisco on the epidemiology 140 
of vestibular migraine ( d). I currently have an intramural grant to foster 141 
interprofessional/interdisciplinary training in the clinical care setting at the Medical University of 142 
South Carolina. I am currently mentoring two vestibular audiologists (Christine Strange and 143 
Cortney Van Ausdal) as well as one of our vestibular therapists (Rebecca English) to help with 144 
their career development. They have presented data from our vestibular clinic in national 145 
meetings over the past three years as well as participated in expert panels at the American 146 
Academy of Otolaryngology National Meeting. I have mentored  a predoctoral student (Taylor 147 
Locklear) funded by a T32 institutional grant for the summer of 2018. In the past 9 months, he 148 
has already had two oral presentations at national meetings , one manuscript published,  and one 149 
manuscript submitted and undergoing the peer -review process  at the Journal of Vestibular 150 
Research concerning the association of vitamin D and BPPV . 151

C. Contribution to Science  172 
1. Quality of life measures and cognitive dysfunction in vestibular p athologies : 173 
This project started with the advent of our multidisciplinary vestibular clinic. A large portion 174 
of our patients with dizziness  complain ed of cognitive difficulties. Our current dizziness - 175 
related QOL  questionnaires usually assess  the physical, functional  and emotional dimensions 176 
of a pathology’s impact, with few or non -existent inquiries into the cognitive dysfunction of 177 
those patients. It is the  latter that usually affects  QOL  and productivity the most. With the 178 
lack of a standardized tool to measure this impairment, we administered the well -established 179 
general Cognitive F ailure Questionnaire (CFQ) on all our dizzy patients to quantify that 180 
dimension of the QOL that is affected. We found major disparities of cognitive dysfunction 181 
that are driven by the etiology, in conjunction with other factors. Vestibular migraine and 182 
Meniere’s disease drove the CFQ scale very high (a). We then proceeded to test the English 183 
version of the newly -developed Neuropsychologic al Vertigo Inventory (NVI). We have 184 
started the project and are collaborating with the Neurotology Division at  UCSF. We will be 185 
studying the NVI as well to assess its usability in clinic as an outcome tool and clinical tool 186 
and have already obtained pilot results  (b).  In collaboration with U CSF we have also 187 
participated in  a project to describe the epidemiology of vestibular migraine (c). During the 188 
course of these projects, we collected a vast amount of information about vestibular function 189 
tests, in patients with various diagnoses, especially in regard to vestibular evoked myogenic 190 
potentials, to look at their role in non -traditional indications such as Meniere’s disease and 191 
vestibular m igraine (d) . This is the subject of a submitted manuscript to  Audiology and 192 
Neurotology that  is currently under peer -review.  193

2. Radiographic characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients with vestibular and 206 
neurotological pathologies : 207 
My neurotology fellowship was focused on chronic ear disease , cochlear implant ation,  and 208 
spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks research. Over the course of two years, I was involved 209 
in a protocol for measuring skull base thickness in our CSF leak patients, providing 210 
quantifying metrics about the pathology. This initial project was expanded to look at 211 
outcomes of surgery correlated to the skull base thickness and body mass index (BMI) . Once 212 
our vestibular clinic was established, I translated this protocol into our superior semicircular 213 
canal dehiscence (SSCD) patients. We found, interestingly, that despite having on average a 214 
lower BMI than our spontaneous leak patients, the SSCD subjects had  a generalized thinner 215 
skull base. This reinforces the possibility of multiple mechanisms, probably autocrine, 216 
independent of i ncreased intracranial pressure, which  participate in some of those 217 
neurotologic pathologies. Other teams corroborated these findings in subsequent studies.  218

A. Personal Statement  253 
I am in my final year of training in neurotology and skull base surgery . I have been developing 254 
over these past  years the foundational knowledge in medicine and medical research needed to 255 
successfully complete this prospective study.  I have broad training in otolaryngology, bu t 256 
throughout my residency and in to fellowship, I have delved deeper into the study of neurotologic 257 
diseases, especially vestibular disorders such as Meniere’s disease  and vestibular migraine . I 258 
have won awards from the American Otologic al Society and Triological Society for quality of 259 
research submitted to national meetings as a resident. I have also won the Research Resident 260 
Award repeatedly during residency. In my final year of residency, I served on the Otology and 261 
Neurotology Education Committee of the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and 262 
Neck Surgery. I also co -authored a chapter on dizziness in the book ENT Essentials . As a fellow, 263 
I have increased my research workload due to a growing interest in many fields of otology and 264 
neurotology, and in anticipation  of a future as an academic neurotologist, with the career goal of 265 
advancing  knowledge in hearing and vestibular sciences. I have successfully collaborated with 266 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 12 
 
colleagues, residents, and medical students on numerous publications, and I am currently 267 
mentoring several residents and medical students in otologic research. I have worked closely 268 
with Dr. Rizk, who is one of my current mentors, since the start of fellowship. I hope to build the 269 
neurotology and skull base program at Loma Linda University, where I will likely return to work  270 
after completing fellowship;  and I will strive  to establish a partnership with the Medical 271 
University of South Carolina to tackle challenges in research which require a multi -institutional 272 
approach. This current proposal builds on my previous work in Meniere’s disease and vestibular 273 
migraine. If successful, it will be a significant advance in the study of Meniere’s disease 274

1. My initial research interests were broadly distributed in various disciplines  of 295 
otolaryngology. Specially pertaining to head and neck surgery, I uncovered the benefits of 296 
early swallowing exercises for patients undergoing chemoradiation, performed a pilot study 297 
of a novel free flap monitoring system, revealed mechanical properties of  the nasal septal 298 
cartilage and the effects of surgery  on its integrity , explored the efficacy of various 299 
maxillomandibular procedures in improving sleep apnea, reported on the efficacy of a 300 
treatment protocol for burning mouth syndrome, systematically reviewed the utility of 301 
preoperative imaging for parathyroid disease in patients with concurrent thyroid disease, and 302 
discovered the need for reduced prescription of postoperative opioids in a prospective, 303 
randomized trial.  304

2. When I decided on a career in otology and neurotology, I began to focus my research efforts 317 
in hearing and vestibular sciences. I revealed that intratympanic gentamicin  was less 318 
effective in treating functional deficit of those suffering from Meniere’s disease when 319 
vestibular migraine was a comorbidity.  In recent collaborations with Dr. Rizk, I described 320 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 14 
 
ways that different characteristics of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials can be useful in 321 
differentiating Meniere’s disease and vestibular migraine  (submitted for publication) . 322 
Concurrently , I worked with Dr. Rizk to describe cognitive function in patients with various 323 
vestibular diseases, such as Meniere’s disease, vestibular migraine, and benign paroxysmal  324 
positional vertigo (BPPV). We used a novel instrument developed specifically for patients 325 
with dizziness, and found that Meniere’s disease had similar cognitive impairment to 326 
vestibular migraine, both worse than BPPV. We are starting a new prospective phase of the 327 
study to recruit healthy subjects in order to compare cognitive function among those with 328 
dizziness with those without.  329

A. Personal Statement  350 
I have the expertise, leadership , and motivation necessary to successfully carry out the proposed 351 
work in Meniere’s  disease  research. I have a broad background in otolaryngology, radiology, and 352 
clinical trials research, with specific training and expertise in key research areas (research 353 
methodology, biostatistics, outcomes research, cost -effective analysis, and clinical trials) for this 354 
application. As a resident/fellow, I carried out translational research in alcohol addiction models, 355 
clinical research involving investigational new drugs, and outcomes research in substance abuse 356 
where I won seven national/international research awards. As one of the first certified principal 357 
investigators (CPI) by the American Academy of Physician Inv estigators, I am directing  one of 358 
the most robust clinical trials program s in otolaryngology – head and neck surgery in the world, 359 
where I have serv ed as principal investigator/co -investigator  on over 200 clinical trials (Phases 1, 360 
2, and 3) investigating the treatment  of hearing loss, Meniere’s disease, tinnitus, chronic 361 
sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and head and neck cancer. I will work with Dr. Rizk and Dr. 362 
Liu in identifying and enrolling potential patients with  Meniere’s disease. In summary, I have a 363 
demonstrated record of accomplished and productive research projects with over 165 364

SPECIFIC AIMS  390 
MD is a frequent cause of episodic vertigo , but evidence -based therapies for MD are limited . The 391 
goal of the proposed project is to identify evidence -based treatment s for MD that will improve 392 
disease -specific outcomes as well as cognitive , psychological, and quality of life  outcomes. Our 393 
overall objective for this proposal is to determine the efficacy of venlafaxine  ER at a dose of 37.5 394 
mg per day in the treatment of MD, with specific attention to change in dizziness episode  395 
frequency and severity , along with the other above mentioned outcomes . Our central hypothesis 396 
is that venlafaxine in the prophylactic treatment of M D reduces the severity and the frequency of 397 
the vertigo spells and improves functional , cognitive , psychological, and quality of life  outcomes 398 
in these patients.  399 
The specific aims of this project are the following:  400 
- Aim 1  is to compare the efficacy of venlafaxine to placebo in decreasing the number and 401 
severity of dizziness episodes , and in improving functional outcomes in patients with 402 
definite MD.  403 
- Aim 2  is to compare the efficacy of venlafaxine to placebo in improving self -perceived 404 
cognitive , psychological, and QOL  outcomes in definite MD. 405 
- Our exploratory aim  is to validate the E nglish vers ion of the newly developed 406 
Neuropsychological Vertigo Inventory as an appropriate tool to measure cognitive 407 
dysfunction in patients  with MD  and to measure response to treatment . 408

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  410 
Meniere’s disease (MD) is a major cause of episodi c vertigo, affecting around 190  people  per 411 
100,000 in the US.27 It represents up to 15% of new patient consultation s for vertigo i n a tertiary 412 
neurotology clinic.1 MD was first described in the 19th century and is one of the most studied 413 
topics in otology .28 But despite its promi nent historical role in research , its etiology is uncertain 414 
and a  cure remains  absent .29,30  415 
Many therapies have been tried  to curtail the symptoms of MD , including lifestyle 416 
modifications with reduction of salt intake  and increase in water intake; medications  such as  417 
diuretics, betahistine, transtympanic st eroids, transtympanic gentamicin ; and  surgical treatments 418 
such as  endolymphatic sac decompression, vestibular neurectomy , and la byrinthectomy.2 419 
However, no gold -standard treatment or treatment protocol exists, and existing therapies for MD 420 
rely heavily on l ower level s of evidence.2,31 Furthermore, although some therapies have  proven 421 
to reduce episodic vertigo , such as transtympanic g entamicin, they carry significant  side effects 422 
including hearing loss and tinnitus, which are already cons equences of the disease itself.32 423 
Venlafaxine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) typically used in 424 
the treatment of depression.7 It has been shown to be effective for depression at doses between 425 
75 mg and 375 mg , 2 to 3 times daily .7 We aim to use a 37.5 mg daily dose, as has been used in 426 
successful treatment of vestibular migraine.23,24 There are several reasons why we seek to 427 
conduct a trial to  evaluate the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of MD , as detailed below.  428 
There is evidence to suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)  can be 429 
effective in the treatment of MD  through central mechanisms.33-35 It has been shown in rats that 430 
serotonin can modify responsiveness to glutamate and N-methyl -d-aspartate (NMDA) in 431 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 24 
 
vestibular nuclei, leading to dep ression of excitatory activity.8 In addition, m icroinjection of 432 
serotonin into the rat inf erior olive has  been shown to increase firing rate of neurons while 433 
slowing oscillation frequency and increasing oscillation coherence, suggesting a role for 434 
serotonin in enhancing motor timing in the olivocerebellar system.9 These studies suggest that 435 
serotonin plays a n important  role in regulating vestibular function, as SSRIs have been shown to 436 
be effective in treating vertigo, and SSRI withdrawal  has been associated with acute dizziness, 437 
vertigo, and incoordination.36-39 Norepinephrine has been shown to have inhibitory activity in the 438 
medial vestibular nuclei and excitatory activity in the lateral vestibular nuclei of rats .10 In one 439 
study, 85% of neurons in all vestibular nuclei experienced change in basal firing rate with 440 
norepinephrine application, with inhibition in 86% of those tested, acting mainly throu gh alpha2 - 441 
adrenergic receptors.40 Lamotrigine, a serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake 442 
inhibitor,  has been shown to be effective in treating MD and is currently in a clinical trial .11 443 
Venlafaxine, through its activity in increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations , 444 
could therefore mitigate the vestibular symptoms of MD through central mechanisms.  445 
Venlafaxine has been shown to reduce vasopress in receptor activation in mice.12 This 446 
potential action of venlafaxine is important in that p lasma vasopressin has been found to be 447 
increased in MD and implicated in endolymphatic hydrops.41,42 The endolymphatic sac is 448 
important in regulating ion and flui d homeostasis in the inner ear,43,44 and is therefore important 449 
to consider in the development of MD, as MD has been shown to be a di sease of endolymphatic 450 
hydrops.45 Notably, v asopressin type 2 receptors have been found to be expressed in the luminal 451 
epithelium of the endolymphatic sac,13 and v asopressin is thought to be a potential regulator of 452 
endolymphatic ion and fluid homeostasis .14,15 It has been proposed that similar to how 453 
vasopressin induces translocation of aquaporins into luminal cell membranes in t he kidney, it  454 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 25 
 
may play a role in fluid dysregulation in the endolymphatic sac in MD.13,46 Specifically, Claudin 455 
4, a tight junction molecule expressed in the endolymphatic duct and sac , was recently  shown to 456 
be a target of vasopressin.47 Systemic administration of vasopressin in guinea pigs has been 457 
demonstrated to cause bilateral inner  ear hydrops with hearing loss.16 Furthermore, interventions 458 
aimed to decrease systemic vasopressin such as stress reduction have been shown to be better 459 
than traditional medications alone in controlling vertig o in MD after a 2 -year follow up.41 One 460 
study found that long term d ecreased vasopressin after endolymphatic sac surgery  was associated 461 
with better vertigo control.48 These data suggest that venlafaxine may be useful in treating MD 462 
through its vasopressin  modulating activity.  463 
A large number of patients with MD suffer from comorbid anxiety and depression .19 One 464 
study found that 70 -80% of patients with active MD could be diagnosed with depression while 465 
the same was true in 32 -39% of those with inactive MD.49 It is unclear whether psychological 466 
factors such as anxiety and depression could  take part in causing MD, but it is feasible that once 467 
these factors are present, a positive feedback loop may set in where the somatic symptoms of 468 
MD could worsen the psychological symptoms, which could then in turn worsen the perception 469 
of somatic symptoms, and so on.19,20 This is the basis for the potential development of persisten t 470 
postural -perceptual  dizziness, a disease that is exceptionally  difficult to manage, in patients with 471 
MD.50 Furthermore, vasopressin, as  a stress hormone  related to anxiety and depression ,51 could 472 
alter inner ear fluid mechanics as earlier mentioned.14 We have found through a prospective 473 
study of cognitive function in dizzy patients that M D presents with cognitive dysfunction greater 474 
than that of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and comparable to that of vestibular migraine; 475 
and a great deal of this cognitive decline was mediated through depression.52 Venlafaxine is a 476 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 26 
 
well-known and effective treatm ent for anxiety and depression,17,18 and as such, may prove  477 
useful in treating both the psychological and somatic repercussions of MD.  478 
Migraine is comorbid in 22 -56% of MD patients, twice as high as the general 479 
population.21,22 It has come to be increasingly recognized that MD and vestibular migraine ar e 480 
closely related  in that they have  great overlap in presentation,53 diagnostic criteria,54,55 and 481 
potentially pathophysiology .25,26 For instance, the trigeminovascular system, which is widely 482 
thought to be the pathway for activation of migraine,25 can directly affect inner ear blood flow  483 
through the trigeminal nerve.56 It has been hypothesized that chronic under -perfusion may lead to  484 
ischemic injury and incite MD.57 Venlafaxine has shown efficacy in the treatment of 485 
migraineError! Bookmark not defined. and vestibular migraine ,23,24 but it has never been trialed for MD.  486 
Venlafaxine has a well -established safety profile.3 It is well-tolerated in the treatment of 487 
depression.4,5 In addition,  it will be used in the proposed  trial at the lower end of the depression 488 
treatment dosage spectrum ( typically  >75 mg daily). In a trial of venlafaxine 75 mg daily vs. 489 
placebo for migraine prophylaxis, excellent or good tolerance was reported in 86.7% of patients, 490 
with common side effects of nausea, vomiting, dro wsiness, fatigue, and insomnia.6 It does not 491 
bind significantly to adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, or histamine H1 receptors.7 Thus, it has 492 
a low risk of causing significant anticholinergic side effects.4 493 
High quality evidence is needed when examining MD treatments, especially when 494 
introducing a potential new class of therapy. A 2018 international consensus article provided an 495 
algorithm for MD treatment , which found a lack of level I  evidence for any specific modality.30 496 
Thus, given the evidence discussed suggesting the potential of venlafaxine  as a non -invasive 497 
therapy to alter the natural course of MD through both central and peripheral vestibular 498 
mechanisms, we believe a high -quality pilot study seeking  to examine changes to multiple 499 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 27 
 
aspects of disease burden (i.e. , vestibular, functional, psychiatric, cognitive, quality of life) 500 
would be worthwhile to prove or disprove the efficacy of this class of medication .  501

Sample Size  523 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 29 
 
This is a randomized, double -blind, crossover trial which will required a treatment group and a 524 
placebo group. Based on a power of 80%, we calculated possible sample sizes using : 1) expected 525 
proportion of subjects achieving treatment success , and 2) difference  in DHI score  needed for 526 
clinical significance . 527 
We estimate 20% of  the placebo group will devel op a good response to treatment (>50% 528 
reduction in vertigo frequency ).59-62 To detect a difference of  30% in success rate, such  that at 529 
least 50% of patients in the venlafaxine  arm will develop a similar response , 36 subjects would 530 
be needed per treatment arm . Given the crossover design this would results in  18 subjects per  531 
treatment arm before crossing over, and 36 total subjects.  532 
The original publication detailing the development of the DHI found a standard deviation 533 
in score of 21.9 among dizzy patients , and a minimum difference of 18 points after treatment to 534 
signify a significant change in sel f-perceived dizziness handicap.58 Using these values, we 535 
calculate a per treatment arm sample size of 24, which results in 24 total patients needed for the 536 
crossover design.  537 
Using the proportion s sample size calculation (because  it has a greater number of 538 
subjects), and factor ing in a 10% drop -out rate  (e.g., improper medication use, inadequate data) , 539 
a total of 40 patients would need to be enrolled.  540 
 541 
Study Protocol  542 
A timeline summary of the study protocol is presented in Figure 1  and Table 2 . Based on our 543 
high clinical volume o f new dizzy patients (around 80  per month), and that approximately 10% 544 
of patients will have a diagnosis of definite MD, w e estimate that 8  patients  can be screened  per 545 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 30 
 
month. Because around 40 % of our referrals are outside the Tri -county area of Charleston, which 546 
may present a problem for follow -up, a conservative estimate of enrollment is 5 subjects per 547 
month . In order to enroll 40  patients, our  total study  period will be approximately 14 .5 months 548 
(last patient screened will require 6 .5 months to provide all data).  549 
 550 
Screening Period  551 
New patients diagnosed wi th definite MD will undergo a 1 -month screening period during which 552 
they will keep a diary of each vertigo episode , including duration , severity on a visual -analog 553 
scale of 1 to 10 from least to most severe , and associated symptoms (aural fullness/pressure, 554 
hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or headache). They will receive an audiogram from our clinic 555 
audiologist at their initial visit to mak e the diagnosis of definite MD, which will be staged based 556 
on hearing loss according to the 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck 557 
Surgery  (AAOHNS) guidelines63 (Table 3 ). The frequency of their vertigo episodes in the 2 558 
months prior will be documented, along with all prior medical treatments for MD.  559 
Before the end of  their initial clinic visit, they will receive conservative treatment 560 
typically recommended for patients diagnosed with MD in our clinic. This treatment will consist 561 
of dietary and lifestyle modifications, including salt restriction to 1500 mg a day;  increased water 562 
intake to a minimum of 35 ml/kg  per day;  and caffeine , alcohol , tobacco, and stress  563 
avoidance .30,64 -66 Subjects who are considering enrollment in the trial will be instructed to stop 564 
all medications used for MD, such as diuretics and betahistine.  Patients who require oral or 565 
transtympanic steroids for acute hearing loss will not be eligible for enrollment.  566 
We suspect many patients will have comorbid migraine as has been seen in our clinic.  567 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 31 
 
These patients will be  counsel ed about trigger identification  (e.g., dietary , environments, 568 
workplace, lifestyle ). Our migraine treatment strategies are  outlined in Appendix A.  569 
 570 
Enrollment and Randomization  571 
Patients who document 2 or more MD -related vertigo episodes in their diary during the screening 572 
period will be offered enrollment in the study. Patients who document fewer episodes will 573 
continue to receive standard of care treatment in clinic. If a patient is interested in participating,  574 
the study coordinator will describe the study protocol, assess the patient’s  eligibility based on the 575 
inclusion and exclusion criteria , and have the patient  sign necessary paperwork per standard IRB 576 
procedures. Patients will be required to receive comprehensive metabolic panel testing  to rule out 577 
metabolic disturbances and renal  and liver dysfunction. Vitals will also be screened for 578 
uncontrolled hypertension. Female patients who have not undergone menopause will be given 579 
urine pregnancy tests and advised against pregnancy during the trial period. Once enrolled, the 580 
patient will complete the following  surveys: 1) Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI),58 2) 581 
Neuropsychological Vertigo Inventory (NVI),67 3) Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ),68 4) 582 
Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ9),69 5) Penn State Worry Questionnaire  (PSWQ) ,70 6) 583 
Meniere’s Disease Patient -Oriented Symptom Index (MDPOSI),71 and 7) 20-Item Short Form 584 
Health Survey (SF20) .72 Descriptions of these tool s are provided below in the Outcome 585 
Measures  section.  586 
Enrolled  subjects  will be randomly assigned to 2 groups, one taking a daily venlafaxine 587 
ER 37.5 mg tablet, and the other taking a daily placebo replica  of venlafaxine manufactured by 588 
our university investigational drug services pharmacy . Rando mization of subjects will take place 589 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 32 
 
before enrollment of any subjects. The pharmacy staff wil l not have access to patient d ata beside 590 
patient identifiers. The pharmacy will be instructed to use the Excel random num ber generator 591 
function to generate a list of 40 numbers between 1 and 1000, representing patients 1 through 40, 592 
in order of enrollment. The 20 lowest numbers will be assigned to the venlafaxine group, and the 593 
rest to the placebo group. The pharmacy staff will then distribute the medication or placebo 594 
accordingly to the blinded clinician s to give to subject s in order of enrollment . When the groups 595 
cross over,  the pharmacy staff will perform a switch in the medication without revealing subject 596 
group identit ies to the clinician. For patients who drop out, the subsequent enrolled patients will 597 
take on their treatment group assignment. After all data have been collected, the pharmacy staff 598 
will reveal to the  statistician whether a patient belongs in group “1” or “2”, without revealing 599 
which group received  the placebo  first. After all data have been analyzed, the pharmacy staff will 600 
give the identifier key (revealing identity of groups 1 and 2) to the investigator s to interpret the 601 
results.  602 
Subjects will be given a 2 -month supply of medication or placebo plus 7 capsules for the 603 
2-week weaning period by  the pharmacy. They will be advised on how to take the medication 604 
and the side effects of venlafaxine  by the investigator . They will be instructed to call the 605 
principal (HR) or co -investigator (YL) at the clinic number or page either of them (instructions 606 
will be provided) afterhours,  if any side effects are affecting their ability to take the medication. 607 
Subjects will again be instructed to keep a diary of every vertigo episode.  608 
 609 
Treatment and Washout Phases  610 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 33 
 
Each treatment phase  will last 2  months. Details of patient diaries will also be documented  and 611 
patients will be instructed to maintain their diaries. Diaries will also be checked for adequacy to 612 
make sure subjects are documenting their symptoms appropriately.  Between the first and second 613 
2-month tr eatment phases there will be a 1 .5-month washout period, during the first 2 weeks of 614 
which, subjects  will wean off the first medication by taking the capsules every other day, and 615 
during the last 4 weeks of which , no trial medication  or any other new medication will be taken 616 
but diaries will be maintained.  If at any point in the trial acute hearing loss develops, a new 617 
audiogram will be obtained and transtympanic and oral steroid treatments  will be offered . If a 618 
patient chooses to receive steroid treatment after being counseled about the risks and benefits, he 619 
or she will be disqualified from the trial.  620 
 621 
Outcome Measures  622 
Symptoms and Functional Level  623 
The main symptoms of MD to be examined are number of vertigo episodes and severity of 624 
episodes. Symptom reduction will be calculated based on the 1995 AAOHNS  guidelines63 for 625 
assessing MD improvement after treatment ( Table 4)  and previous studies on treatment 626 
outcomes of episodic vestibular disorders such as vestibular migraines.73,74 We will use a 627 
modified version of vertigo control classification because our treatment phases are 2 months long 628 
and we will not be able to wait 18 -24 months after treatment to assess efficacy  per AAOHNS 629 
guidelines.63 Previous studies have defined four categories of response to treatment: 1) very good 630 
response if more than 75% reduction in vertigo spells frequency and/or intensity, 2) good 631 
response if 50 -75% reduction, 3) fair response if 25 -50% reduction, and 4) poor response if less 632 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 34 
 
than 25% reduction. Combining the 2 approaches, our numerical value calculation ( Table 4 ) will 633 
be the mean number of vertigo episodes in the 2 months after starting a treatment (either 1st or 634 
2nd treatment phase) divided by the mean number of vertigo episodes in the 3 months prior to the 635 
1st treatment phase multiplied by 100 and round to  the nearest whole number. Our v ertigo control 636 
classes will be defined as follows:  637 
- Class A: numerical value 0 (complete control of vertigo)  638 
- Class B: numerical value 0 -40 or >60% reduction in mean vertigo episode severity (good 639 
control of vertigo)  640 
- Class C: numerical value 41 -80 or 20 -60% reduction in severity (fair control of vertigo)  641 
- Class D: numerical value 81 -120 or -20-20% reduction in severity (no change in vertigo)  642 
- Class E: numerical value >120 or >20% worsening in severity (worse vertigo)  643 
- Class F: secondary treatment initiated due to disability from vertigo (e.g. steroid 644 
injection, gentamicin injection, endolymphatic sac decompression, labyrinthectomy)  645 
We will document  duration of episodes and associated symptoms (aural fullness/pressure, 646 
hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or headache) as well, but will simply conduct direct numerical 647 
comparisons or provide descriptive analyses given their likely subjectivity and variability. 648 
Functional level will be assessed according to the 1995 AAOHNS guidelines63 (Table 5 ) at 649 
every visit.  650 
 651 
Questionnaires  652 
The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI, Appe ndix B ) is a 25 -item questionnaire of self- 653 
perceived handicap from dizziness.58 There are 7 questions in the physical domain, 9 in the 654 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 35 
 
emotional domain, and 8 in the functional domain.  The DHI has been shown to be valid and 655 
reliable, has been translated into 14 languages, and is the most widely -used survey of self - 656 
report ed impairment from dizziness .58,75 It has also been shown to correlate well with balance 657 
testing.76 The DHI will be used to assess the overall severity of vestibular symptoms in our MD 658 
subjects.  659 
The English version of the Neuropsycho logical Vertigo Inventory (NVI, Appendix C ) 660 
consists of  28-items  with a 5 -point Likert scale for each qu estion .67Error! Bookmark not defined. It was 661 
recently developed as a cognitive assessment specific to patients with dizziness. The NVI 662 
assesses 7 domains of cognition: space perception, attention, time perception, memory, 663 
emotional, visual/oculomotor , and motor. We recently conducted a  prospective study showing 664 
that the NVI can detect a difference in cognitive dysfunction among different vestibular 665 
disorders; including MD, vestibular migraine, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; and that 666 
it is more sensitive than the DHI in revealing these differences.52 We will use the NVI to gauge 667 
vestibular -specific changes in cognitive impairment after treatment.  668 
The Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ , Appendix D ) is a 25 -item survey which 669 
assesses cognitive and executive function not tied to any specific disease state .68 It aims to assess 670 
perception, memory, and motor function in everyday tasks. The CFQ  is valid and well- 671 
established ,77,78 and will be  used as a reference for cognitive dysfunction to gauge the results of 672 
the NVI , since the NVI is a newer survey.  673 
The Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ9 , Appendix E ) is a 9 -item survey  that assess es 674 
the severity of depression.69 It is a  validated tool that  has been shown to be reliable in assessing 675 
outcomes of depression treatment.79 The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ, Appendix F ) 676 
is a 16 -item survey  for assessment of anxiety which has been used to identif y generalized anxiety 677 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 36 
 
disorder.70,80 Psychological disturbances have been recognized in MD and it is important to 678 
assess their severity along with that of vestibular symptoms.19,81 Therefore, the PHQ9 and PSWQ 679 
will be used to assess the extent of depression and anxiety effects on quality of life  in MD 680 
subjects.  681 
The Meniere’s Disease Patient -Oriented Symptom Index (MDPOSI,  Appendix G ) is a 682 
23-item survey  developed as a MD -specific tool  to assess the impact of MD symptoms on 683 
patients’ lives.82 It is valid and reliable, and we aim to use it as a more specific measure of 684 
disease -related quality of life than the DHI .71 685 
The Medical Outcomes Study 20 -item Short Form Health Survey ( SF20 , available at 686 
https://www.rand.org/health -care/surveys_tools/mos/20 -item-short -form/survey -instrument.html ) 687 
is a 20 -item general health questio nnaire originally developed for the Medical Outcomes Study 688 
to assess quali ty of life in chronic diseases.72 It assesses 6 areas of health: physical functioning, 689 
role functioning, social functioning, mental health,  health perceptions, and pain.  We will use this 690 
survey to gauge in a broad sense the general quality of  life of MD patients given MD is  a chronic 691 
disease.  692 
 693 
Adverse Effects  694 
Side effects experienced by subjects at any point, whether it affects their ability to continue 695 
treatment or not, will be tabulated during visits and from patient phone calls. Specifically, we 696 
will monitor for minor side effects of nausea, insomnia, somnolence, constipation, sweating, dry 697 
mouth, nervousness and asthenia; and major side effects of rash, increase in blood pressure, 698 
weight change, seizures, and serotonin syndrome.4 A comprehensive metabolic panel will be 699 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 37 
 
required prior to taking any medication  to rule out any gross renal or hepatic abnormalities . 700 
Urine pregnancy tests will be administered for female patients who have not undergone 701 
menopause. No other laboratory tests will be performed unless other  abnormalities are suspected.  702 
 703 
Data Analysis  704 
The benefit of a crossover study over a traditional  clinical  trial design is that it  relies on 705 
elimination of carryover effects after the 1st treatment phase.83 A confirmatory pre -test to check 706 
the adequacy of the washout period and the assumption of negligible carryover effects will be 707 
performed by using unpaired Student t-tests comparing  all outcome measure means at the end of 708 
the 2nd treatment phase with that of the end of the 1st treatment phase  for both the venlafaxine 709 
and placebo groups. For outcome measures  that pass the confirmatory test, paired t-tests will be 710 
used to gauge within -subject differences per the crossover study design. For outcome measures 711 
that do not pass the confirmatory test, only the 1st treatment phase data will be used for analysis 712 
as if it were a parallel -treatment  clinical trial.  713 
Descriptive statistics will be performed on demographics and all other variables. In 714 
general, Student t-tests will be used to compare means of 2 groups and Pearson chi -square tests 715 
will be used to compare proportions where appropriate. The Kolmogorov -Smirnov test will be 716 
used to assess normality of variables and the Mann -Whitney U test will be used in lieu of the 717 
Student t- test for variables with non -normal distributions. Pearson correlations will be calculate d 718 
to assess associations among questionnaire  results. Linear regression will be performed to weigh 719 
the effect of venlafaxine or placebo against that of other variables such as depression and 720 
anxiety, which may confound results. P<0.05 will be used to establish statistical significance.  721 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 38 
 
 722 
Potential Limitations  723 
Vestibular symptoms may wax and wane over time in MD, potentially biasing results of the 724 
treatment phases due to underlying natural progression of the disease . However, this difference 725 
should be minim al given the short interval of 3  months between start of the first and second 726 
treatment. Another problem may be inadequate washout time for the effects of the 1st treatment 727 
phase to wear off. We will assess for significant carryover effects as described above. There 728 
may, however, be permanent carryover effects after 1 course of treatment which we cannot 729 
control.   730

 881 
Step 1: Questions 1 and 2  882 
Need one or both of the first two questions endorsed as a “2” or a “3” 883 
(2 = “More than half the days” or 3 = “Nearly every day”)  884 
Step 2: Questions 1 through 9  885 
Need  a total of five or more  boxes  endorsed  within  the shaded  area of the form  to arrive  at the 886 
total symptom  count.  (Questions  1-8 must  be endorsed  as a “2” or a “3”; Question  9 must  be 887 
endorsed as “1” a “2’ or a “3”)  888

Step 1  894 
A depression  diagnosis  that warrants  treatment  or a treatment  change,  needs  at least one of the first 895 
two questions  endorsed  as positive  (“more  than half the days”  or “nearly  every  day”)  in the past 896 
two weeks.  In addition,  the tenth  question,  about  difficulty  at work  or home  or getting  along  with 897 
others should be answered at least “somewhat  difficult”  898 
Step 2  899 
Add the total points for each of the columns 2 -4 separately  900 
(Column  1 = Several  days;  Column  2 = More  than half the days;  Column  3 = Nearly  every  day. Add 901 
the totals for each of the three columns together. This is the Total  Score  902 
The Total Score = the Severity Score  903

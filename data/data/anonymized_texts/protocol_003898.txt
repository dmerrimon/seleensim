Principal Invest igator:  Sun S Kim, PhD , APRN  
 
 
Description of the Project  
You are being asked to take part in a research study .  This research study is looking at women 
living with HIV and studying strategies to help the se women who want to quit smoking.  Dr. 
Kim works  at the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMB) .  Please kindly read this  form and 
feel free to ask questions .  If you have more questions later, you can discuss these  with Dr. Kim  
and her  telephone number is 201-388-2656 . 
 
Procedure of the Study  
This study involves written questions, telephone interviews, counseling  and a special test of the 
liquid in your mouth (spit) .  You will  have counseling and nicotine patches  at no cost to you.  
How you get  the counseling  will be  decided by chance, like flipping a coin.  Half of the women 
in the study will get the counseling by telephone  voice calls and the remaining half will get  it 
by telephone video calls.  You will have t he counseling  once  a week  for 8 weeks  and ea ch 
session will last no longer than  30 minutes.  The patches  will be provided for 8 weeks  and you 
need to apply one patch at a time as directed .  You will be asked to start the patch on the first 
day of quitting .  
Before the counseling , you will be asked to sign and return this consent form.  You will be also 
asked to complete written research questions about your age , schooling , attitudes toward living with 
HIV,  drugs , alcohol  use, smoking,  and your confidence  in resisting smoking temptation and bad 
mood s. Your answers to these questions will help us identify your needs to stop smoking and provide 
the right advice .  
Counseling  will be the same for everybody. The only difference is how the counseling is 
provided  (teleph one video  or telephone voice call). The advice is given to help you quit. After 
the day you quit you will be counseled on how to manage withdrawal symptoms of smoking.  
You will be followed over 6 months  from the target quit day and asked about some of the 
questions that you have answered before.  This is to see  if there are any changes in your answer s 
after the counseling and whether the change s will continue .  We will follow you at  1-, 3-, and 6-
months from the first day  of quitting .  You will be asked to participate in all follow -up 
assessments  and perform a spit test at 3 -, and 6-month follow -ups even if you are not able to quit 
smoking . You will be assisted by a research staff who will watch how you conduct the test via 
telephone video call.  So, y ou wil l be asked to do a video call  during the test , even if you have 
the counseling by telephone  voice  calls.  The follow -up will take about  5-10 minutes at 1-month 
follow -up and about 30-40 minutes when you perform the  spit test at 3 - and 6-month follow -ups.

Risks  
You m ay experience uncomfortable feelings when you quit smoking .  If you have a thought of 
hurting yourself because you are too sad after you quit or  because you start to smoke again , 
please call the toll -free suicidal hotline or 911.  You m ay experience some  side effects of patches  
such as rashes , upset stomach , headache, dizziness , fast heart beats and strange  dreams.  All these  
things  occur at about  10-15% of people and most  of them  are mild.  They will disappear once 
you stop using  the patch .  If you have severe headache, dizziness, vomiting  or blisters on the  area 
where you have applied the  patch, you should  immedi ately take off the patch and call Dr. Kim  at 
(201) 388-2656.   
Another po ssible  risk is bad fe elings  when doing the telephone interview .  You may want to 
speak with Dr. Kim at (201) 388 -2656 to discuss these feelings.  
You may  also feel embarrassed and uncomfortable if you report that you have not  been smoking 
but the saliva test s hows  that you have  been  smoking .  We will explain its possible causes to you  
if it happens.   If you find out you are going to have a baby during the study , patches  may hurt your 
baby.  So, you must  agree to use  an effective birth contro l during the study .  If you become 
pregnant, y ou will be advised not to use  patches.  However, you will  be allowed to stay in the 
study and continue to get advice  and follo w-up calls. 
 
Anoth er risk of b eing in this study is that your personal information  could be lost or become 
known by others .  This is very unl ikely to happ en, and we will do everything we can to make 
sure that your information  is protected.  However, i f we learn that you plan to hurt yourself or 
others, we will break confidentiality to help you.  If we le arn of any child or elder abuse,  we are

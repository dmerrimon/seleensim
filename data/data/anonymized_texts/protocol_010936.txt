Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
The Test lens to be used in this study is the Bausch + Lomb (kalifilcon A) Daily Disposable Multifocal Contact Lens , manufactured by Bausch & Lomb Incorporated, Rochester, NY.  The 
description of the Test lens is as follows: 
• Sphere power:  +3.00 to -6.00  
• Add: Low and High  
• Diameter: 14.2 mm  
• Base curve: 8.6 mm  
• Material: kalifilcon A  
• Packaging solution: phosphate -buffered solution  
The Investigator or designee will instruct all subject s that they must comply with the Subject  
Instructions provided to them.  
Subject s will be instructed that other contact lenses (other than the assigned study lenses) and contact 
lens care products (other than any eye drops  provided) are not allowed to be used during the study.   
Study Duration of Treatment:  
Approximately 3 weeks  
Criteria  for Evaluation : 
‒ The primary endpoint is the proportion of subject s agreeing with the statement “Clear vision: near, 
far, and in-between”  
Statistical Methods:  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  
The responses to the primary endpoint statement will be summarized using categorical summary statistics (strongly agree, agree, slightly agree, neither agree nor disagree, slightly disagree, disagree, strongly disagree).  
Responses of strongly agree, agree, and slightly agree w ill be coded to a category “Agree.” Responses of 
strongly disagree, disagree, and slightly disagree will be coded to a category “Disagree.” The trichotomized responses will be summarized categorically (agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree).  
Neutral  responses ( i.e., “neither agree nor disagree”) will not be included in the primary statistical analysis.  The 
non-neutral  responses used for the analysis will be presented using categorical summary statistics (agree, 
disagree). An exact 95% confidence interval around the proportion of subjects agreeing with the statement will be presented along with the p- value from a one- sided exact binomial test of the alternative hypothesis is that the 
proportion of subject s agreeing is greater than 0.5.  
Sample Size  Calculations:  
Approximately 300 subject s will be enrolled. Allowing for up to 10% losses, power calculations were completed 
for 270 completed subject s. An exact binomial test with a nominal 5% one -sided significance level will have 
93% power to detect the difference between the Null hypothesis proportion, π₀ of 0.5 and the Alternative 
proportion, π ₁, of 0.6 when the sample size is 270.

2.5 Minimization of B ias and C onfounding F actors  
The Sponsor will avoid improper  influence on any parties participating in, or contributing 
to, the clinical investigation or the induction thereof. The selection and treatment of 
subject s and evaluation of clinical investigation data are potential sources of bias. Methods 
that are incorporated within the clinical investigation design to minimize potential bias 
include, but are not limited to, screening subject s to confirm eligibility with defined 
inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to enrollment; maintaining a log of all subject s screened 
and enrolled; collecting demographics and medical  ocular  history at baseline to later assess 
possible characteristics that may influence endpoi nts; standardizing data collection 
requirements and clinical investigation procedures; requiring a Financial Disclosure by Investigators; using standardized training materials for all trial personnel; and by 
Study #916 - Protocol

 scheduling regular monitoring visits to  be conducted to verify adherence to the clinical 
investigation plan and source data. 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Description of Study Design  
The is a single -treatment study evaluating the product performance of a new silicone 
hydrogel multifocal daily disposable contact lens.  
Approximately 300 subject s (600 eyes) will be enrolled in this 3- week, single -arm, 
bilateral, open -label study at approxima tely 20 investigative sites in the United States.  
The study is designed to include habitual wearers of multifocal lenses. All subjects will be 
seen for a Screening/Dispensing Visit, at which time informed consent will be obtained and eligibility will be a ssessed.  
All consented subjects will be assigned a subject identification (ID) number in sequential order by the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. At the Screening/Dispensing Visit, all eligible subjects will receive study contact lenses to wear on a daily disposable basis for approximately 3 weeks, with scheduled in- office follow -up visits at 1 week and 3 weeks. 
3.2 Informed Consent Process  
Voluntary written informed consent must be obtained from every subject  prior to the 
initiation of any study- related activities. The Investigator must have a defined process for 
obtaining consent. Subject s must be given ample time to read, understand, and ask 
questions, in order to consider voluntary participation. The subject  must indicate voluntary 
consent by providing a written signed and dated informed consent form (ICF). A copy of the signed and dated ICF must be provided to the subject , and the original document must 
be filed in the subject ’s study records. 
The ICF must meet all applicable local laws and be written in language that the subject  
understands. Subject s must be informed that their participation in the study is voluntary 
and that their decision to withdraw from participation at any time during the study will not impact any aspect of their standard care. Subject s will be provided with cont act information 
for the appropriate individuals should questions or concerns arise after signing the ICF during the clinical study.  
Subject s must also be informed that their records may be accessed by appropriate 
authorities and Sponsor -designated personnel. The Investigator must ensure all procedures 
and practices are in place to protect the privacy and the best interest of the subject . 
3.3 Selection of Study Population  
Recruitment for the study may start at any point after the Investigator agrees, in writing, to 
participate in the study. Written informed consent, including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enrollment in the study, or dispensing of study products cannot begin until the Investigator has received Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Sponsor approval to conduct the study. The Sponsor and IRB must approve any advertising used to recruit subjects prior to use of that advertising. 
All consented subject s must be accounted for, whether or not they participate in the study. 
The Sponsor will record information for each potential study subject  who signs an ICF. 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 16 of 84 
 Once a potential subject  is consented, their information will be recorded on the screening 
log and the Investigator should proceed with screening procedures. 
Potential su bjects will be classified as eligible or “Screen Failures.” A subject deemed a 
Screen Failure cannot participate in the study since he/she has not met the study inclusion 
criteria or has met the exclusion criteria. Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) must be 
completed for screen failure subjects and a copy of their signed ICF, and any information 
collected as part of screening (e.g., source documents, etc.) must be kept in their permanent records.
 
Once a subject  is enrolled (i.e., a subject ID number is as signed), a subject is considered 
active and must be accounted for at every visit until exited (completed or discontinued) from the study, even if they are not dispensed study materials. Refer to Section 3.3.4 for 
subjects determined to be lost to follow-up.

treatment or follow -up 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 18 of 84 
 • Persistent Grade 3 or 4 slit lamp findings  
• Persistent study -related symptoms/complaints  
• Unacceptable contact  lens visual acuity (VA)  
• Unacceptable contact lens centration  
• Unacceptable contact lens movement  
• Failure to follow stu dy procedures 
A subject  MUST be discontinued prior to the final study visit for any of the following 
reasons:

• Investigator decision that it is not in the best medical interest of the subject  to 
continue participation in the investigation 
• Lost to follow-up ( Section 3.3.4) 
• Either eye is discontinued 
• Becomes pregnant during the study 
Prior to discontinuing a subject , every effort should be made to contact the subject , 
schedule a final study visit, obtain as much follow -up data as possible, and retrieve all 
study materials. Adverse events will be followed as described in Section 6.0.  
Subject  discontinuations must be documented clearly on the source document and 
applicable eCRF. The Inves tigator should indicate the PRIMARY (one) reason that the 
subject  was discontinued for each eye. Subject s who voluntarily withdraw from the study 
are not required to provide a reason for their decision but should be encouraged to share 
this information. Subject s who are discontinued from the study following enrollment will 
not be replaced. 
Exit Visit assessments should be completed for early discontinued subject s, if possible. 
At the final study visit, all study subject s who are discontinuing should be examined to 
ensure that their ocular health is consistent with pre -study, baseline conditions. Any 
adverse effects determined to have been reasonably caused by participation in the study 
will be followed per the standard of care. Participation in the study w ill not impact post-
study choices of study subject s for correcting their vision using marketed products (e.g., 
contact lenses and contact lens care solutions). 
Whether a subject  completes or is discontinued from the study, they will be directed by the 
Investigator to resume their habitual method of vision correction.   
3.3.4 Lost to Follow- up 
Subjects who did not return for scheduled follow -up visits, as defined by the visit window, 
and could not be contacted via 2 telephone calls and 1 letter with delivery confi rmation, 
are to be considered lost to follow -up. All attempts to contact the subject  should be 
documented and kept with the subject ’s source documentation, and the applicable eCRFs 
will be completed. If the Investigator determines that a subject  has been l ost to follow -up, 
the “study exit date” should be recorded as the last successful contact or the date a certified

Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 28 of 84 
 i. Complete the 3 -Week Follow -Up Visit eCRF s. If the subject  is discontinued or exited 
at this  visit, complete Exit Visit eCRF s. 
5.1.4 Exit Visit   
Note:  All VA measurements MUST be made using a phoropter.  
a. Indicate status of the subject  on the Subject  Exit Form. If the status is “Discontinued” 
or “Non- dispensed,” indicate the PRIMARY exit reason for each  eye on the Subject  
Exit Form.  
b. Collect changes in ocular medical history and concomitant medications 
c. For all subject s, complete an exit ocular examination without lenses on the eyes. Collect 
the following assessments: 
− Spherocylindrical refraction  
− High -contrast distance (OD, OS, OU) logMAR BSCVA 
− Keratometry  
Compare the final visit high -contrast distance (OD, OS) BSCVA to the high- contrast 
distance (OD, OS) BSCVA obtained at the Screening/Dispensing Visit. If the VA has 
decreased by ≥ 10 letters, expl ain. 
For each eye, compare the final visit keratometry readings to the Screening/Dispensing Visit keratometry readings. If there is a change of 1.00 D or more, explain. 
d. Collect/assess all AEs/ADEs, including serious or significant non- serious AEs.

Accountability Log. 
f. Complete the Investigator survey following the completion of the subject ’s final study 
visit.  
g. Complete the Exit visit eCRF s.  
5.1.5 Unscheduled Visits  
Additional visits may be scheduled, as necessary, to ensure the safety and well -being of 
subject s. All additional exams should be fully documented in the source documents and on 
Unscheduled Visit eCRFs, as appropriate. Visits intended to fulfill scheduled visit 
requi rements that fall outside the designated scheduled visit range, are not Unscheduled 
Visits. In these cases, the visit data will be collected and transcribed to the appropriate scheduled visit eCRF. 
If a subject  is seen for multiple visits during a given vi sit timeframe, the data from the visit 
that is intended to meet the protocol requirements for the scheduled visit should be captured 
on the visit eCRF. Where such a determination cannot be made, the first visit within the scheduled visit interval will be u sed for completion of the protocol required scheduled visit 
eCRF. Data from any additional visits within a scheduled visit interval will be captured on an Unscheduled Visit eCRF.  
If a subject  is only seen for replenishment of study lenses, a complete exam  is not required, 
as long as the subject  is not experiencing any problems. If study lenses are replaced, record 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 29 of 84 
 the eye, dispensed lens sphere power, add power (high, low, none), and primary 
replacement reason in the Product Dispensing Only eCRF . Collect w orn study lenses from 
the subject . Record the eye, lens type, add power, sphere power, lot number, and quantity 
dispensed in the Product Accountability Log. 
Subjects who require further follow -up on an AE/SAE upon discontinuation or at the 
conclusion of the 3-Week  Follow- Up Visit will be followed according to the Post-study  
Follow-up Section 3.3.4 . At thes e follow- up visits, the subject should remove contact 
lenses s/he may be wearing. Assessments will be performed  according  to the investigator’s 
judgement. The Investigator is required to follow the subject until the condition no longer 
warrants further follo w-up for study purposes. 
Note: All VA measurements MUST be made using a phoropter.  
a) Indicate the reason for the Unscheduled Visit.  
Note: If the subject  is experiencing problems, complete the entire Unscheduled Visit Form.  
b) Collect the following information  from the subject regarding study lenses: 
− Average number of days per week worn 
− Average daily wearing time, hours per day 
− Average hours of comfortable wear per day  
− Hours lenses worn on the day of this visit  
− Rewetting drop use. 
c) Collect Symptoms/Complaints.  
d) If the subject  did not come to the visit wearing one or more study lenses, go to step e. 
Otherwise, evaluate the  study lenses (while on eye), and record the following 
assessments:  
− Distance (OU), intermediate (OU), and near (OU) lens VA  
− Lens wettability  
− Lens deposits 
− Lens centration  
− Lens movement 
Compare the high contrast OU distance lens VA to the high contrast OU distance  
BSCVA obtained at the Screening/Dispensing Visit. If the VA has decreased by ≥ 10 
letters or more, explain. 
e) Perform  a slit lamp examination (remove the lenses if the subject wore lenses to the 
visit). Record all slit lamp findings and at a minimum sketch the following in the 
subject ’s source document:  
− Any ungraded finding marked as “PRESENT”  
− Any corneal scars  
− Any corneal staining  
− Any corneal infiltrate  
− Any other graded slit lamp findings Grade >2 
f) If an unscheduled lens replenishment for the same lens is required, dispense additional lenses , and collect the following:  
− Primary reason for replacement  
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 30 of 84 
 − Dispensed lens sphere power 
− Dispensed lens add power (high, low) 
− Distance (OU), intermediate (OU), and near (OU) lens VA  
− Lens wettability  
− Lens centration  
− Lens movement 
 
Note :   Remember to record replenishment  on the Product Accountability Log. 
Note:  The Investigator must return all worn and unworn study lenses to the Sponsor in the 
return materials provided. All study contact lenses must be accompanied by a Product Accountability Log. 
g) If an unscheduled lens replacement requires a change in lens power for unacceptable 
vision , follow steps f, g, h, and i in Section 5.1.2. 
h) The Unscheduled Visit eCRFs should be completed. 
If the subject  is discontinued or exited at this visit, complete the Exit Visit eCRFs.  
5.1.6 Missed Visits  
If a subject  misses any scheduled follow- up visit, the visit is considered missed. Indicate a 
missed visit on the eCRF for that scheduled visit. Schedule the subject for an Exit Visit as 
soon as possible. If the subject  cannot be reached or rescheduled, the subject  should be 
recorded as Lo st to Follow -Up.  
5.1.7 Product Dispensing Only Visit  
If a subject  is seen for resupply or replacement of study materials and the subject  is not 
experiencing any problems, a complete exam is not required. If any assessment is performed, then an Unscheduled Visit Form must be completed instead of a Product Dispensing Only Form. 
If study lenses are dispensed, collect the following information in the source document for 
each being dispensed, and transcribe to the Product Dispensing Only eCRF Form: 
− Visit date  
− Subject  ID number 
− Primary reason for lens replacement  
− Dispensed lens power, add power 
 
Record the sphere power /add, lot number, quantity dispensed, and for which eye the lenses 
are being dispensed in the Product Accountability Log. 
 
Note:  The Investigator must return all worn and unworn study lenses to the Sponsor in the return 
materials provided. All study contact lenses must be accompanied by a Product 
Accountability Log .  
5.1.8 Post Study Follow- up 
If a subject  requires discontinuation or is compl eting the study, but has an ongoing AE, the 
subject should not be exited until the event resolves or stabilizes.  This may imply that 
follow- up will continue via Unscheduled visits, and that additional evaluations may be 
requested by the Sponsor.   
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 31 of 84 
 Investi gator must schedule Unscheduled Visits, as necessary.  
Note:  All VA measurements MUST be made using a phoropter.  
a) Remove any contact lenses the subject  may be wearing. Perform a slit lamp 
examination. Record and sketch the  ocular  results and findings in the subject ’s source 
document  
b) Complete an ocular examination without lenses on the eyes, including 
spherocylindrical refraction and distance (OD, OS , OU) BSCVA  
c) The Investigator is required to follow the subject  until the condition no longer warrants 
furthe r follow -up for study purposes. A n Unscheduled Visit eCRF must be completed 
for each of these visits 
Once AE has resolved or stabilized, the Investigator may proceed with completing the exit visit 
5.2 Questionnaires and Surveys  
5.2.1 Baseline Question naire 
Each eligible subject will complete a questionnaire  prior to study lens insertion.  
Responses will be regarding current habitual lens wear . 
5.2.2 Online Consumer Survey  
Each  subject  will
  be required to complete a Subjective Assessment through an internet 
survey. Each enrolled subject  will be provided with an internet address to access at least 7 
days after  the 1 -Week Follow -Up Visit but before the 3 -Week Follow -Up Visit. Each 
subject  will be provided with a confidential unique ID and password (login) in order to 
access the online survey. If the user forgets their password, there will be a “forgot password” option within the system. The system will send reminders to the subject  via 
email or mobile alerts. The study coordinator will call the subject  prior to the visit date to 
remind the subject  to complete the survey. 
There will be a specified timeframe in which the survey must be completed. The Inves
tigator will provide the market research firm with the subject ’s email address. If the 
subject  has not completed the survey during the specified duration, the market research 
firm may contact that subject  by email with a reminder to complete the survey. If the 
subject  has not completed the survey by the time of the 3- Week Follow -Up Visit, the 
subject  may complete it at that time . 
5.2.3 Investigator Survey 
The Investigator (or designee) will complete a survey to answer questions about each 
subject ’s study lens wear at the subject ’s Exit Visit. This information will be collected 
within the eCRF system. 
5.3 Study Completion / Early Study Terminations / Suspensions  
5.3.1 Study Completion  
For purposes of the Investigator notifying the IRB, the study is complete when all 
subject s at the sites have been exited. Sponsor approval is required prior to IRB 
notification . 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 32 of 84 
 5.3.2 Early Study Termination/Suspension  
If during the study it becomes evident to the Sponsor that the study should be stopped 
prematurely or placed on hold, appropriate notification will be given to the Investigator(s) 
IRBs, and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as applicable. Bausch + Lomb will instruct the Investigators to stop/restart dispensing study materials and will arrange for study closeout, if applicable, at each site. 
5.4 Concomitant Medications/Therapy  
Other contact lenses are not allowed to be used by subject s during the study.  
Ocular medications or systemic or topical med ications that, in the Investigator’s opinion, 
could potentially affect ocular physiology or lens performance are prohibited during the 
course of the study.  
5.5 Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be assessed using lens wear parameter data.  
5.6 Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the Sponsor and the IRB and agreed to by the 
Investigator. It is a Sponsor expectation that Investigators will follow  the protocol and 
procedures as written. The Sponsor will not grant protocol waivers for this study. The Investigator may implement a deviation from the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subject s without prior IRB approval. As soon as poss ible after such an 
occurrence, the implemented deviation, as well as the reasons for it should be submitted to the IRB for review and approval. It should also be submitted to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required. 
In the  event a protocol deviation occurs, the date of and reason for deviations must be 
documented in all cases. Significant or major protocol deviations impacting the rights or 
safety of the subject,  or the integrity of the study must be reported by the Investigator to 
the IRB and Medical Monitor immediately. Reporting of all other protocol deviations must adhere to the requirements of the governing IRB. Unless the protocol deviations put the subject  at risk or the subject ’s condition requires that they be discontinued from the study, 
subject s may continue to participate until the end of the study. 
Site Corrective Action Plans will be developed and completed as deemed necessary by the Sponsor, Sponsor designee (e.g., CRO) for sites or Investigators who deviate from this protocol in a way that adversely affects the rights, safety, or well-being of the subject (s) and/or the quality or integrity of data. The Site Corrective Action Plan will 
outline the deviation and the site’s corrective and/or remedial actions. Decisions regarding critical deviations that merit Investigator disqualification and site closure will be made by the Sponsor and documented in the Trial Master File. 
6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.1 Introduction to Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse events, serious AEs (SAEs), significant non- serious AEs, non- significant non-
serious AEs, adverse device effects (ADEs), anticipated serious adverse device effects

Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 33 of 84 
 (ASADEs) , and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs)are defined in this section 
and in the protocol’s glossary.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subject s, users, or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical dev ice, comparator, or the procedures 
involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events not related to investigational medical devices . 
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition s 
An AE that (related or not related to the investigation al test articles , comparator products 
or study procedures): 
o Led to death. 
o Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in: 
‒ A life -threatening illness or injury; or 
‒ A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function (e.g., 
blindness); or 
‒ Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization; or 
‒ Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenita l abnormality or birth defect.  
Note: A planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure 
required by the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
an SAE. 
Serious adverse events may include  but are not limited to  any hazardous, sight- threatening 
conditions occurring after exposure to the investigational test article  or control product  
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal 
tissue). For the purposes of reporting, this includes: 
o Central or para- central location  
o Penetration of Bowman’s membrane 
o Infiltrate ≥ 2 mm diameter  
o Associated with iritis  
o Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure  
o Culture positive for microorgani sms 
o Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits 
NOTE: Signs of a presumed infectious corneal ulcer may include irregular focal 
infiltrates, active lesions with raised edges, significant diffuse infiltration, anterior 
corneal to mid- stromal involvement, erosion with overlying staining, conjunctival 
and lid edema, anterior chamber reaction (iritis), and severe bulbar and limbal redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset, severe redness, purulent or 
mucopurulent discharge, tearing, and photophobia.
 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 34 of 84

6.1.2 Significant Non- Serious Adverse Event  Definition s 
A significant non- serious adverse event is an AE that does  not meet the serious criteria, is 
considered significant by the Sponsor, and requires expedited reporting to the S ponsor (see 
Section 6.2.1) . These events include but are not limited to:   
• Peripheral non-progressive non-infectious corneal ulcers 
• All symptomatic corneal infiltrative events  
• All cases of corneal staining greater than or equal to Grade 3  
• A temporary loss of two or more lines of BSCVA (for greater than or equal to 2 weeks)  
• Neovascularization cases Grade 2 or greater  (if not within 6 mm of the cornea) 
• Any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens discontinuation of greater than or equal to 2 weeks. 
6.1.3 Non-Significant Non- Serious Adverse Events Definition s 
A non- significant non- serious adverse event may include but are not limited to the 
following and does not require expedited reporting: 
• Bacterial Conjunctivitis;  
• Viral Conjunctivitis;  
• Allergic Conjunctivitis;  
• Corneal Edema;  
• Contact Lens Related Papillary Conjunctivitis; and,  
• Loss of Contrast Sensitivity  
6.1.4 Adverse Device E ffect (ADE) Definition s 
An adverse device effect is an  AE that is  assessed to be related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
6.1.4.1 Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  (ASADE)  Definition  
An a nticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an ADE that first meets the 
serious criteria (see Section 6.1.1) and which , by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome, 
has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application (including a 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 35 of 84 
 supplementary plan or application) and/or in the risk analysis report. ASADEs include  but 
are not limited to :   
• Corneal Ulcer (infectious or non-infectious) 
• Keratitis  
• Sensi tivity to light (photophobia) 
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discharge 
• Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision) 
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by removing the lens 
6.1.4.2 Unantic ipated Serious Adverse Device E ffect (U SADE)  Definitions  
An unanticipated serious ocular or non -ocular adverse device effect is an adverse event 
related to the use of an investigational medical device that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event as described in Section 6.1.1 and 
which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current versio n of the risk analysis report.  
This definition includes but is not limited to AE s resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical devic e.  
This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  USADEs include but are not limited to  
• Any central or paracentral (within 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results in permanent opacification (s uch as corneal scar or  vascularization)  
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and/or hyphema 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea 
• Permanent loss of ≥2 lines of BSCVA  
• All cases of iritis.  
6.1.5 Relationship Definition: Study Device and/or Other Study Materials  
• Related: There is at least a reason able possibility that the AE  is related to 
the study device (study solution) and/or r ewetting drops. Reasonable 
possibility means that th ere is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or 
association between the study device and/or r ewetting drops and the AE.   
• Not related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE  is 
related to the study device (study solution) and/or r ewet ting drops. This 
assessment implies that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal relationship or association to the study device and/or Rewetting Drops and a more likely or certain alternative etiology exists.  
6.1.6 Severity  Definitions  
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, 
requires no treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities.  
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 36 of 84 
 • Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low 
level of concern to the subject and may interfere wit h daily activities but can 
be relieved by simple therapeutic care.  
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and 
requires systemic therapy or other treatment 
6.2 Procedures for Evaluati ng Adverse Events  
Throughout the course of this study all efforts will be made to remain alert to reportable 
AEs. If an AE occurs the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate medical intervention will be made.  All SAEs, ocular and systemic, must be recorded and 
reported as required. 
All reportable AEs occurring after signing of informed consent and through the subject ’s 
end of participation in the study must be reported.  If there is an Ongoing AE at the time 
of subject’s discontinuation or at 3- Week Follow up visit, Unscheduled visit(s) must be 
scheduled to follow up on the AEs until the event resolves or stabilize. 
Ocular AEs of possible clinical significance should be photo-documented and shared with 
the Medical Monitor in electronic form.  
When evaluating for reportable AEs,  the Investigator should refer to the definitions for 
AEs to determine : 
a) whether the event is serious (refer to  Section  6.1.1 and Section 6.1.2)  
b) whether the event is severe (refer to Section 6.1.6) 
c) whether the event is s ignificant (refer to Section  6.1.2 and  Section  6.1.3) 
d) whether the event is related to the study device (refer to Section 6.1.5) 
6.2.1 Procedures for Reporting Serious or Significant Adverse Events  
An AE classified as a SAE or a Significant Non -Serious Ocular AE require s expeditious 
handling and reporting to the Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements, as follows:  
• To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the IMP , must 
be immediately ( i.e., within a maximum 24 HOURS after becoming aware of 
the event) reported  to the Lexitas and Sponsor. All information relevant to the 
SAE must be recorded on the Sponsor provided SAE report form  signed by 
the Investigator. Within 24 hours of knowledge of a new SAE, the investigator 
must enter the SAE  information onto the hard copy SAE report form and send  
the form to  the following email distribution:  
  
• The investigator must verify that the report was received by Lexitas and/or 
Sponsor. If the investigator is not able to verify it was successfully received by Lexitas and/or Sponsor , the investigator must call the CRO  clinical study 
manager by phone to follow-up. The CRO will forward the documentation to the medical monitor and the sponsor for review. 
• Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event before initially notifying Lexitas and Sponsor of an SAE or a Significant Non-Serious AE. Additional relevant information such as 

Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 37 of 84 
 hospital records and autopsy reports should be provided to Lexitas and 
Sponsor as soon as they are available.  
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of 
the subjects: notably, he/she should follow a subject with an SAE or Significant Non -Serious AE until the event has resolved or the condition has 
stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has 
left the study, and that additional evaluations may be requested by the Sponsor. 
• Ensure that the subject’s identity is protected and the subject’ s identifiers in 
the clinical trial are pro perly mentioned on the form. 
• BEGIN TREATMENT OF THE AE IMMEDIATELY BY A SUITABLY LICENSED EYE CARE PROFESSIONAL.  
• Continue to update the paper SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report 
Form , if applicable, each time the subject is seen during the management of 
the event  and at resolution of the event .  All updated report forms should be 
submitted by the site to Lexitas and Sponsor within 24 hours. Whenever 
possible, it is suggested that the Investigator take photographs of all ocular AEs of possible clinical significance and forward them to the Lexitas and 
Sponsor. 
• Events requiring medical treatment will be evaluated by the Sponsor. Upon review of the medical treatment, Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations representatives may contact the Investigator to request f urther information 
concerning the treatment . 
• Report all USADEs to the reviewing IRB within 10 working days following awareness of the U SADE or according to the established reporting procedures 
of the IRB, whichever is shorter. 
• Submit all bills, prescription receipts, and culture reports/fees related to the AE to the Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations.  Expense incurred for study related medical treatment will be paid by Bausch +Lomb Clinical Operations.  
6.2.2 Procedures for Reporting Off- Site Unanticipa ted Serious Adverse Device 
Effect s 
When participating in multicenter clinical investigations, Investigators may receive off -site 
USADE reports. These are Sponsor reports of U SADEs which occurred at other clinical 
sites for the same trial, or in different trials using the same investigational test article  or 
comparator , that met the criteria for reporting to a regulatory agency. These should be 
reported to the reviewing IRB within 10 working days or per their established reporting procedures, whichever is shorter.  
6.2.3 Device Deficiencies : Definition and Reporting Procedures  
A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunct ions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
Investigators must evaluate, record, and report any complaints/ deficiencies or malfunctions experienced with the study solution  during this trial to the Medical Monitor  
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 38 of 84 
 promptly. The  Sponsor and Medical Monitor  shall review all device deficiencies,  and, upon 
the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any additional information related to the 
safety reporting of a particular event.  
Report device deficiencies within 24 hours of knowledge to: 
  
The Medical Monitor will distribute, within 24 hours of knowledge, all device deficiencies to the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor shall review all device deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
whether they could have led to a n SAE. In the event of a disagreement between the Sponsor 
and the Investigator(s), the Sponsor shall communicate both opinions to the reviewing IRB per their established reporting procedures and the health authority. 
6.2.4 Procedures for Culturing  of Co rneal U lcer or Suspected O cular I nfection  
For purposes of this study, the Sponsor requests that cultures should be obtained in cases 
of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated. Cultures should be taken from the cul -de-sac, lower  eyelid margin, and the corneal lesion (if 
applicable). The required culturing techniques are outlined in Appendix B . 
When a culture is obtained, the contact lenses and contact lens cases which were being utilized by the subject at the time of the AE should be collected from the subject for culturing and processing by the local clinical laboratory designated by the site. 
Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies ( e.g., lenses, lens cases, and/or 
lens case solutions) are for information only. Because microbes may be introduced into 
subject supplies during use, recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate etiology or direction of organism transmission. 
The ocular cultures, along w ith the associated contact lenses and contact lens cases, will 
be sent to the local clinical laboratory designated by the site for analysis. The clinical 
laboratory will report the culture results to the Investigator who will record the results in the eCRF . 
6.2.5 Guidelines for Reporting Pregnancies  
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed,  
or late menstrual period). Female sub jects who become pregnant during the study will be 
followed until completion of pregnancy. Every effort will be made to obtain the health status of the mother and infant or fetus (in cases of miscarriage or therapeutic abortion) at term. Pregnancy itself i s not considered an AE. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be reported on a Pregnancy Report  and submitted to the 
Medical M onitor via facsimile or email transmission within 24  hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness of the pregnancy.  The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to 
the Sponsor as per the distribution listed below. 
All pregnancies will be followed until outcome even after study closure.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies will be reported on a  paper Pregnancy Outcome Report  and submitted t o 
the Medical Monitor via facsimile or email transmission once the outcome is learned. The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to the Sponsor as per the distribution 
listed below. 

Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 39 of 84 
 Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
any pregnancy complication, spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy, for medical reasons, will be recorded as an SAE. Any serious complication or event resulting from the pregnancy should be reported to the Medical Monitor  within 24 hours 
on the SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report Form  along with the Pregnancy Report 
Form . 
The contact for  reporting pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes are: 
  
7.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
7.1 Assessment of Effective ness 
Analyses of effectiveness outcomes will be completed using the Full Analysis Set. 
7.1.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoints  
7.1.1.1 Clear Vision: Near, Far, and In- Between  
The primary endpoint will be assessed as part of the online consumer survey. The responses 
to the primary endpoint statement will be summarized using categorical summary statistics (strongly agree, agree, slightly agree, neither agree nor disagree, slightly disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). 
Responses of strongly agree, agree, and slightly agree will be coded to a category “Agree.” 
Responses of strongly disagree, disagree, and slightly disagree will be coded to a category 
“Disagree.” The trichotomized responses will be summarized categorically (agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree).  
Neutral responses (i.e., “neither agree nor disagree”) will not be included in the primary statistical analysis. The non-neutral  responses used for the analysis will be presented using 
categorical summary statistics (agree, disagree). An exact 95 % confidence interval around 
the proportion of subjects agreeing with the statement will be presented along with the p -
value from a one -sided exact binomial test of the alternative hypothesis is that the 
proportion of subject s agreeing is greater than 0.5. 
7.1.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints  
There are no predefined secondary effectiveness endpoints. 
7.1.3 Supportive Effectiveness  
7.1.3.1 Consumer Survey  
Agreement with statements in the online consumer survey will be analyzed using the 
methods described for the primary endpoint.  
7.1.3.2 Investigator Questionnaire  
The following investigator questionnaire will also be evaluated using one -sided exact 
binomial test of the alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of subject s agreeing is 
greater than 0.5.

 𝐻𝐻0: 𝜋𝜋 ≤ 0.5 
𝐻𝐻1:𝜋𝜋> 0.5  
7.1.4.2 Control of Multiplicity  
The primary endpoint is a single test, so multiplicity control is not necessary for this 
evaluation. For the online survey and investigator questionnaire inferential tests described 
in Section 7.1.3.2, the risk of type I errors will be controlled as follows. 
• These supportive effectiveness outcomes will not be eligible for statistical 
hypothesis testing unless the null hypothesis is rejected for the primary endpoint. 
• The Holm adjustment will be applied.

and Section 7.1.3.1. In addition, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the results 
of the questionnaire. 7.2 Assessment of Safety  
Analyses of safety data will be conducted using the Safety Population. 7.2.1 Adverse Events  
All adverse events occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis 
of MedDRA terminology. Descriptions of AEs will include the date of onset, the date the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study device, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. All reported treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be 
summarized by the number of subjects reporting AEs, system organ class, severity, 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 42 of 84 
 seriousness, and relationship to study medication. TEAEs are those AEs with an onset on 
or after the date of the first study device use.  
Adver se events will be summarized by severity.  Each subject will be counted only once 
within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the adverse events with the highest severity within each category.  
Adverse events will be summarized by relationship  to study device.  Each subject will be 
counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the adverse 
events with the greatest relationship within each category. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing 
verbatim given by the investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, actions taken, and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial use of the study device.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by subject.  In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who 
experienced SAEs will also be provided. 
7.2.2 Clinical Safety Examinations 
Data from the f ollowing assessments will be summarized categorically by visit.

• BSCVA in logMAR units 
7.2.3 Concomitant Medications 
All previous and concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology from 
the WHO Drug Dictionary. Previous therapies and concomitant medications data will be presented in data listings. 
7.3 Subje ct Disposition  
A tabulation of subject disposition will be provided. The tabulation will include the 
numbers of subjects who enter the study, complete the study, and discontinue the study. The reasons for discontinuation will be included. 
7.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
7.5 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be recorded throughout the study. A tabulation of protocol 
deviations will be presented in a separate, comprehensive excel tracker . 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 43 of 84 
 7.6 Compliance  
Subjects will report the average number of days per week that the lenses were worn and 
their average daily wearing time (hours) at follow -up visits. The data will be summarized 
by visit. 
7.7 Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned  
7.8 Additional Statistical Considerations  
7.8.1 Analysis Populations 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all eligible, dispensed subjects or eyes.  
• The Safety Set will consist of all dispensed subjects or eyes. 
7.8.2 Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 300 subject s will be enrolled. Allowing for up to 10% losses, power 
calculations were completed for 270 completed subject s. An exact binomial test with a 
nominal 5% one -sided significance level will have 93% power to detect the difference 
between the Null hypothesis proportion, π₀ of 0.5 and the Alternative proportion, π₁, of 0.6 
when the sample size is 270. 
7.8.3 Handling of Missing Data  
Missing data will not be imputed. 7.8.4 Multicenter Issues  
The study will be conducted at multiple investigational centers in North America  with the 
intention of pooling the results for analysis. 7.8.5 Multiplicity Issues  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by requiring the primary effectiveness  endpoint 
to be statistically significant. Specifically, failure of the primary effectiveness  endpoint will 
invalidate the statistical significance of the supportive effectiveness  endpoints. See  Section 
7.1.3 for further detail  
8.0 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE

8.2 Study Monitoring  
Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations representatives must be allowed to visit all study site 
locations to assess the data, quality, and study integrity in a manner consistent with applicable health authority regulations and the procedures adopted by  
Bausch + Lomb Clinical  Operations.  
Prior to the start of the study, member(s) of the Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations, Clinical Affairs, and Global Regulatory Affairs will review the protocol, eCRF, regulatory obligations, and other material or equipment relevant to the conduct of the study with the Investigator/Sub-Investigator and relevant study site personnel.  
Monitoring visits and telephone consultations will occur as necessary, or per the 
monitoring plan, during the course of the investigation to verify the following: 
• The rights and well-being of subjects are protected  
• The conduct of the investigation is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment, 21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56 and 812; 42 CFR Part 11 – Clinical Trials Registration and Results Information S ubmission; EN ISO 
14155:2020 Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects – Good

• The integrity of the data, including adequate study documentation 
• The facilities remain acceptable  
• The Investigator and site personnel remain qualified and able to conduct the study 
• Investigational test article accoun tability  
During the course of the study, if the Sponsor determines that an Investigator is not compliant with the protocol and/or applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor will take action to secure compliance.   In addition, the Sponsor may terminate  the Investigator’s 
participation in the study if appropriate, or if the Investigator remains  
non-compliant despite the Sponsor’s actions.  
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 45 of 84 
 Plans for monitoring study sites, designed to ensure compliance with GCPs, study- specific 
procedures, human rights, and applicable regulations, are described in the Monitoring 
Plan.3 
8.3 Source Documentation  
All medical information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject ’s 
record (source documentation) in real time as it is  collected. Source documentation consists 
of original subject  documents, as well as data and records with information relevant to the 
subject  and his/her participation in the study.  
Examples of source documents include hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, signed ICFs, evaluation checklists, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies, and information initially recorded in an electronic format. Source documentation 
worksheets may be provided by the Sponsor to record pertinent information.  
Subject -completed forms are also considered to be source data. In no instance should an 
Investigator or study site personnel record any data or make changes to subject -completed 
forms. The Investigator or designee should review subject -completed forms during study 
visits for completeness and accuracy. If an entry is found to be illegible or a mistake is 
found (e.g., incorrect year was recorded), the subject  should be instructed to edit the entry 
by drawing a single line through the original entry, entering the new information, and dating and initialing the change.  
Subject s should be provided the rating scales (separate document) to use while responding 
to the lens performance assessments being collected. Enter rating from 0 to 100 (e.g., 90). Source documentation worksheets may be provided by the Sponsor as a tool to record 
pertinent information. The completed worksheets can then be incorporated into the subject ’s medical chart. If it is preferred to not use the worksheets in the subject ’s 
permanent record, then the worksheets should be used as a reference to determine the type of study data to record in the subject ’s permanent record. The source document workshe ets 
may be used as a supplement for the subject’s medical records .  
8.4 Electronic Case Report Forms and Data Verification 
Subject data required by this protocol are to be transferred from the source to the eCRFs. 
The Investigator and his/her study site personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The Investigator is required to verify that all of the requested information is accurately recorded on the eCRFs. All information required on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject  identification, date(s), assessment values, etc., and any 
omission or discrepancy will require explanation. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documents. Market research  data will be collected via ePRO and 
processed according to the policies and procedures of the ePro vendor. The data will not be included on eCRFs or verified by Bausch + Lomb . 
A Clinical Monitor will be respon sible for reviewing and verifying 100% of the data 
recorded on the eCRFs, utilizing the original source documentation, and will query discrepant findings. The Investigator and study site personnel will be responsible for answering all queries.  
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 46 of 84 
 The eCRF data will be reviewed for completeness, accuracy, consistency, and medical 
sense. Programmed edit checks will be used to reduce data entry errors and identify unusual data for verification prior to statistical analysis.  
A copy of the eCRF data will be retain ed at the conclusion of the study by the Investigator, 
who must ensure that it is stored in a secure place. 
8.5 Recording of Data and Retention of Documents 
Subject data recorded on eCRFs during the study will be documented to maintain subject  
confidentiality.  The subject  will only be identified by the subject ID number. 
Confidentiality of subject ’s records must be maintained to ensure adherence to applicable 
local privacy regulations. 
The Investigators have to retain records for 2 years after the investigation al product is 
approved by the FDA. The Investigator agrees to adhere to the document retention 
procedures when signing the protocol Investigator Statement of Approval.

• Electronic CRFs  
• Subject ’s signed ICF (including HIPAA) 
• Accountability records for the test article(s)  
• Correspondence from and to the Sponsor 
• Any other documents relevant to the conduct of the study 
In the event that study records are transferred to another location, the Investigator will provide notice of such transfer in writing to Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations. 
8.6 Auditin g Procedures  
Audits of clinical research activities in accordance with the Sponsor’s internal Standard 
Operating Procedures to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP may take place. 
A regulatory authority may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the study or after its completion). If an inspection is requested by a regulatory authority and/or IRB, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor immediately that this request has been made. 
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 47 of 84 
 8.7 Institutional Review Board 
The Investigator should ensure that the following are approved by their institution’s IRB, 
or if not using their institution’s IRB, approved by the reviewing central IRB prior to 
entering any subjects in the study:

APPENDIX C:  SUBJECT INSTRUCTIONS  
 
FOR SINGLE -USE DISPOSABLE WEAR 
CAUTION:  Investigational Device. Limited by Federal law (U.S.A.) to investigational use. 
 
INTRODUCTION  You will participate in this study designed to evaluate the product performance of the 
investigational Bausch + Lomb 
(kalifilcon A) Daily Disposable Multifocal Contact Lens (Test). Study 
lenses will be dispensed at the Screening/Dispensing Visit. It is very important that you do not use any other contact lenses other than those dispensed to you during the study.  
You will wear the lenses on a daily disposable basis and replace the lenses daily but do not discard your worn lenses,  as they will be collected at your 1 -Week and 3 -Week Follow -Up Visits. 
Throughout the study, place all worn lenses in a study lens case that was provided to you (up to 10 pairs of lenses per case) with no solution (dry). You will return the lens cases to the office at your 1-Week and 3 -Week Follow -Up Visits/Exit Visit. Bring all lenses (worn in lens cases and unworn 
blister packs) and blister foils to the 1 -Week and 3 -Week Follow -Up Visits/Exit Visit or any 
unscheduled visit. 
Please keep all appointments and follow these instructions thoroughly. If you have any questions 
or problems, call your study doctor at _________________.  
Note: Please schedule your 1 -Week and 3- Week Follow -up Visits at the Screening/Dispensing 
Visit.  
Follow-Up Visit Schedule  
Visit  Day/Month/Year Time  
1-Week Follow -Up           /            /  
*At the 1 -Week Follow -up, you will be provided information regarding an Online 
Consumer Survey to be completed after at least 7 days  of wear  after the 1 -Week Follo w-
Up Visit but before the 3 -Week Follow -Up Visit.  
3-Week Follow -Up           /            / ________________ 
Note: Wear your study lenses to your follow- up visit.  
For this study, you will be using the following products: 
• Lens cases for storage of worn study lenses (up to 10 pairs of lenses, stacked dry). 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION Do NOT use any products other than those dispensed to you by your study doctor for use in this 
study , with the exception of rewetting drops if you habitually use them.  
If problems or symptoms should occur, immediately remove your lenses,  and follow the steps 
described in the sections of these instructions entitled Warnings and Adverse Effects . Prompt 
attention to problems is essential and may require immediate profession al care.  
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 70 of 84 Remember, when wearing contact lenses, your eyes should look and feel good, and your vision 
should be clear. 
Because they are worn directly on your eyes, contact lenses affect the way in which your eyes 
function. These effects tend to increase with the length of time the lenses remain on your eyes between removals. Although the great majority of people successfully wear contact lenses without problems, before you decide whether to continue wearing contact lenses for daily disposable wear, you should discuss with your study doctor the effects of contact lenses on your eyes and the risks associated with wearing contact lenses. You also should read the sections of these instructions entitled “Warnings”, “Adverse Reactions”, “Precautions”, and “Wearing Restrictions and Indications”. Ask your study doctor to explain anything that you do not understand, including any additional restrictions which may be given to you by your study doctor. These contact lenses have been prescribed for single -use disposable w ear and should be replaced each time lenses are 
removed from your eyes. 
You also need to remember that soft contact lenses, including those covered by these instructions, 
are made of a type of plastic that absorbs liquids, vapors, and small particles, and for some people, 
may collect deposits from your natural eye fluids. Therefore, you should strictly follow these instructions and any other instructions given to you by your study doctor. Any failure to follow these instructions and the wearing restrictions will increase the chances of contamination, damage to the lenses, or a buildup of deposits on the lenses, which can lead to serious, sight -threatening 
eye infections and injuries. 
Adherence to your prescribed wearing schedule and regular check- up visits to your study doctor 
are also necessary for the proper and safe use of contact lenses. Soft contact lenses generally are 
comfortable from the beginning. Therefore, be sure to follow the wearing schedule prescribed for you, and do not over wear your lenses simply because they remain comfortable, and you are not experiencing a problem. Only your study doctor, through a professional examination, can determine how your eyes are reacting to the contact lenses and whether there are any early signs of possible problems.  
Finally, if problems or symptoms should occur, immediately remove your lenses,  and follow the 
steps described in the section of these instructions entitled “Warnings and Adverse Reactions.” Prompt attention to problems is essential and may require im mediately professional care.  
Remember, when wearing soft contact lenses your eyes should look and feel good, and your vision should be clear. 
 1. WEARING RESTRICTIONS and INDICATIONS  
The lenses have been prescribed for single -use disposal wear and will be replaced after each 
removal.  
− Keep a spare pair of lenses and a lens case available in case you have to remove your lenses 
immediately upon the appearance of a problem or symptom. 
− Do not use aerosol products such as hair spray while wearing your lenses. The le nses may 
absorb the spray, resulting in injury to the eye and damage to the lens. 
− Avoid wearing the lenses around fumes, irritating vapors, smoky or dusty conditions. The lenses may absorb the chemicals or particles, resulting in injury to the eye. 
− Avoid rubbing your eyes with the lenses in, which can irritate the eye or dislodge the lens. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 71 of 84 − If you get something in your eye, remove the lens immediately. Do not replace with new 
lens until your eye feels normal. 
− Tell your regular physician and every other doctor that you visit, that you wear contact lenses and the type of lenses that you wear. If you are admitted to a hospital, also tell your nurses that you wear contact lenses. 
− Do not use any eye drops, ointments, or medicines in your eye unless they are specif ically 
approved by your study doctor or physician. Some drops, ointments, or medicines will cause injury to the eye if used by a contact lens wearer.  
− Ask your study doctor whether there are any other wearing restrictions that apply to you, 
write those rest rictions in the spaces provided below and follow them carefully. 
             
             
             
             
 
2. WARNINGS  
You should be aware of and fully discuss with your study doctor the following warnings pertaining 
to contact lens wear:  
− Problems with contact lenses could result in serious injury to your eye. It is essential that you follow your study doctor’s direction and all labeling instructions for proper use of lenses. Eye problems, including corneal ulcers, can develop rapidly and lead to loss of vision.  
− Daily disposable lenses are not indicated for overnight wear, and you should not wear lenses while sleeping. Clinical studies have shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when daily disposable lenses are worn overnight. 
− Strict compliance with your wearing restrictions, wearing schedule, and follow -up visit 
schedule should be followed. 
− Studies have shown that contact lens wearers who are smokers have a higher incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers. 
− If you experience eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness of the eye, you should immediately remove lenses and promptly contact your study doctor. 
3. PRECAUTIONS  
You should be aware of and fully discuss with your study doctor the following safety precautions:  
− Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions for lubricating or wetting your lenses. 
− If the lens sticks (stops moving), you should use a solution intended to lubricate or rewet a 
contact lens, as recommend by your eyecare practitioner . The lens should move freely on 
your eye for the continued health of your eye. If non- movement of the lens continues, you 
should immediately consult your study doctor. Do not attempt to remove the lens, except 
on the instructions of your study doctor. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 72 of 84 − Always wash and rinse your hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, 
soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in your eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water -base cosmetics are l ess likely to damage lenses than oil -
base products. 
− Do not touch contact lenses with your fingers or hands if your hands are not free of foreign materials, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury to your eye. 
− Carefully follow these handling, insertion, and wearing instructions for the daily disposable contact lenses and those instructions prescribed by your study doctor. 
− Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by your study doctor. 
− Always handle lenses gently and avoid dropping them. 
− Ask your study doctor about wearing lenses during water activities and other sports. 
− Inform your doctor (health care professional) about being a contact lens wearer. 
− Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens container unless specifically indicated for that use. Pour the lens into your hand. 
− Do not touch the lens with your fingernails. 
− Always contact your study doctor before using any medicine in your eyes. 
− Always inform your employer of being a contact lens wearer. Some jobs may require use of eye protection equipment or may require that you not wear contact lenses. 
− As with any contact lens, follow -up visits are necessary to assure the continuing health of 
your eyes. Your study doctor should provide you with a recommended follow -up schedule. 
4. ADVERSE REACTIONS (Problems and What to Do) 
You should be aware that the following problems may occur: 
− Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
− Comfort is less than when lens was first placed  on eye,  
− Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
− Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes,  
− Unusual eye secretions, 
− Redness of the eyes,  
− Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
− Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
− Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
− Dry eyes.  
If you notice any of the above, you should: 
− Immediately remove your lenses.  
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 73 of 84 − If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens has dirt, an 
eyelash, or other foreign body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears undamaged, insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem continues, you should immediately remove the lenses and consult your study doctor. 
When any of the above problems occur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, 
neovascularization, or iritis may be present. You should keep the lens off your eye and seek immediately professional identification of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.  
5. PER SONAL CLEANLINESS and LENS HANDLING  
− Preparing the Lens for Wearing:  
It is essential that you learn and use good hygienic methods in the care and handling of the lenses. Cleanliness is the first and most important aspect of proper contact lens care. In particular, your hands should be clean and free of any foreign substances when you handle your lenses. The procedures are:  
○ Always wash your hands thoroughly with mild soap, rinse completely, and dry with a lint-free towel before touching your lenses. 
○ Avoid the  use of soaps containing cold cream, lotion, or oily cosmetics before handling 
your lenses, since these substances may come into contact with the lenses and interfere with successful wearing. 
○ Handle your lenses with your fingertips and be careful to avoid contact with fingernails. It is helpful to keep your fingernails short and smooth. 
○ Start off correctly by getting into the habit of always using proper hygienic procedures so that they become automatic.  
○ Should you accidentally place an inside -out lens on your eye, one of the following signs 
should signal you to remove and replace it correctly: 
▪ Less than usual comfort, 
▪ The lens may fold on the eye, 
▪ Excessive lens movement on blink, 
▪ Blurred vision. 
If the lens folds and sticks together: Place the lens in the palm of your hand and GENTLY rub the 
lens between your index finger and palm in a gentle back and forth motion. Replace the lens if it does not unfold. 
If the lens flattens or drapes across your finger, the lens or your finger may be too wet. To correct 
this, dry your finger by transferring the lens several times from one index finger to the other, drying 
the opposite finger each time. 
- Placing the Lens on the Eye:  
There are other methods of lens placement. If the following methods are difficult for you, your study doctor will provide you with an alternate method. 
Note : If after placement of the lens, your vision is blurred, check for the following: 
○ The lens is not centered on the eye (see “Centering the Lens,” next in these instructions). 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 74 of 84 ○ If the lens is c entered, remove the lens (see “Removing the Lens” section) and check 
for the following: 
▪ Cosmetics or oils on the lens (replace the lens), 
▪ The lens is on the wrong eye, 
▪ The lens is inside-out (it would also not be as comfortable as normal). 
If you find that  your vision is still blurred after checking the above possibilities, remove both lenses 
and consult your eye professional. The One -Hand Placement Technique  
Place the lens on your index finger. Head up, looking straight 
ahead, pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your placement hand. Look up steadily at a point above you. Then place the lens on the lower white part of your eye. Remove your index finger and slowly release the lower lid. Look down to position the lens properly. Close your eyes for a moment; the lens will center itself on your eye.  
The Two -Hand Placement Technique  
With the lens on your index finger, use the middle finger of the other hand to pull the upper lid against the brow. Use the middle finger of your placement hand to pull down the lower lid and then place the lens centrally on your eye. While holding this position, look downward to position the lens properly. Slowly release your eyelids.  
If the lens feels uncomfortable, then look in the mirror and gently place a finger on the edge of the contact lens and slowly slide the lens away from your nose while looking in the opposite direction. Then by blinking, the lens will re -center itself. If the lens still feels uncomfortable, follow the steps described in the 
section of these instructions entitled “Adverse Reactions.” 
− Centering the Lens : 
Very rarely, a lens that is on the cornea will be displaced onto the white part of the eye during lens wear. This can also occur during placement and removal of the lenses if the correct techniques are not performed properly. To center a lens, follow one of the procedures below. 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then while looking in a mirror, gently 
place a finger on the contact lens and gently slide the lens towards t he center of the eye.  
Or 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then, while looking in a mirror, move your eye towards the lens to place it on the center of the eye.  
− Removing the Lens:  
Always remove the same lens first.  
1) Always wash your hands thoroughly with mild soap, rinse completely, and dry with a lint-free towel before touching your lenses.  

Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 75 of 84 2) Always be sure that the lens is in the correct position on your eye before you try to remove 
it (a simple check of your vision, closing one  eye at a time, will tell you if the lens is in the correct 
position). Look up and slowly pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your removal 
hand and place your index finger on the lower edge of lens. Squeeze the lens lightly between the thumb and the index finger and remove it. Avoid sticking the edges of the lens together. 
3) Remove the other lens by following the same procedure. 
Note: If this method of removing your lens is difficult for you, your study doctor will provide you 
with an alternate method.  
− Care for a Sticking (Nonmoving) Lens: 
It is important to the health of your eyes that your contact lenses move freely. If a lens sticks (stops 
moving), use a solution intended to lubricate or rewet a contact lens, as recommend by your eyecare 
practitioner . In this case, do not use plain water or anything other than the recommended solutions. 
Do not attempt to remove a lens that is sticking, which could damage your eye. If the lens does not begin to move when you blink after several applications of the solution or, contact your study doctor immediately. Do not attempt to remove the lens except on the advice of your study doctor. 
6. EMERGENCIES  
If chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, etc.) 
are splashed into your eyes, you should: FLUSH EYES IMMED IATELY WITH TAP 
WATER AND THEN REMOVE LENSES PROMPTLY. CONTACT YOUR STUDY DOCTOR OR VISIT A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM WITHOUT DELAY
.

Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 76 of 84 APPENDIX D:  FITTING  GUIDE  
FOR SINGLE -USE DISP OSABLE WEAR 
CAUTION:  Investigational device. Limited by Federal law (U.S.A.) to investigational use. 
 
IMPORTANT  
This Fitting Guide has been developed to provide professionals with information covering 
characteristics of the investigational daily disposable contact lens and to illustrate fitting procedures. Please read carefully and keep this information for future use. This Fitting Guide is intended for the eye care professional but should be made available to subjects upon request. The eye care professional should provide the subject with the Subject Instructions that pertain to the subject’s prescribed lens, and the recommended wearing schedule. 
 LENS PARAMETERS AVAILABLE (For the study lenses used in this study)  
Test Article:  
The study lens to be used in this study is the Bausch + Lomb kalifilcon A daily disposable contact 
lens. The description of the study lens is as follows: 
• Sphere Power: -6.00 D to +3.00 in steps of 0.25 D 
• ADD: High or Low  
• Diameter: 14.2 mm 
• Base Curve: 8.6 mm 
• Material: kalifilcon A  
 
HOW THE LENS WORKS (ACTIONS)  
In their hydrated state, when the contact lens is placed on the cornea, they act as a refracting 
medium to focus light rays on the retina.  
 INDICATIONS  
The Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lens is intended for the daily disposable wear 
correction of refractive ametropia (myopia and hyperopia) in aphakic and  
not-aphakic persons with non- diseased eyes, exhibiting astigmatism of 1.00 D or less, that does not 
interfere with visual acuity. The lenses may be prescribed in spherical powers ranging from +3.00D to -6.00D in steps of 0.25 D with a high or low ADD. The lenses have been prescribed for single -
use disposal wear and will be replaced after each rem oval. 
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS (REASONS NOT TO USE)  
DO NOT USE the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lens when any of the following 
conditions exist: 
• Acute and subacute inflammation or infection of the anterior chamber of the eye, 
• Any eye disease, injury, or abnormality that affects the cornea, conjunctiva, or eyelids, 
• Severe insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (dry eyes),  
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 77 of 84 • Corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), 
• Any systemic disease that may affect the eye or be exaggerated by wearing contact len ses, 
• Allergic reactions of ocular surfaces or adnexa (surrounding tissue) that may be induced or 
exaggerated by wearing contact lenses or use of contact lens solutions, 
• Any active corneal infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral), 
• If eyes become red or irritated.  
 
WARNINGS  
After a thorough eye examination, including appropriate medical background, subjects should be fully apprised by the prescribing professional of all the risks with contact lens wear. Subjects should be advised of the following warnings pertaining to contact lens wear: 
• Problems with contact lenses could result in serious injury  to the eye. It is essential that 
subjects follow their eye care professional’s direction and all labeling instructions for proper use of lenses. Eye problems, including corneal ulcers, can develop rapidly and lead to loss of vision . 
• Daily disposable lenses are not indicated for overnight wear, and subjects should be instructed not to wear lenses while sleeping . Clinical studies have shown that the risk of 
serious adverse reactions is increased when daily disposable lenses are worn overnight. 
• Studies have shown that contact lens wearers who are smokers have a higher incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers. 
• If a subject experiences eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness of the eye, the subject should be instructed to immediately remove lenses  and promptly contact his 
or her eye care professional.  
• Patients should be instructed not to expose their contact lenses to water while wearing them.  Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe infection, vision loss, or blindness.  If their contact lenses have been submersed in water when swimming in pools, lakes, or oceans, the contact  lenses should be discarded and replaced with a new pair.  Recommendations for 
wearing lenses during any water activity should be discussed with the patient. 
 
PRECAUTIONS  
Precautions for Eye Care Professionals:  
• Due to the small number of subjects enrolled in clinical investigation of lenses, all refractive 
powers, design configurations, or lens parameters available in the lens material are not evaluated in significant numbers. Consequently, when selecting an appropriate lens design and parameters, the eye care professional should consider all characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including oxygen permeability, wettability, central and peripheral thickness, and optic zone diameter. 
• The potential impact of these factor s on the subject’s ocular health should be carefully weighed 
against the subject's need for refractive correction; therefore, the continuing ocular health of the subject and lens performance on eye should be carefully monitored by the prescribing eye care professional. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 78 of 84 • Subjects who wear contact lenses to correct presbyopia may not achieve the best corrected 
visual acuity for either far or near vision.  Visual requirements vary with the individual and should be considered when selecting the most appropriate type of lens for each subject. 
• Eye care professional should instruct the patients to remove the lens immediately if the eye becomes red or irritated.  
• Fluorescein should not be used while the subject is wearing the lenses, because the lenses will become dis colored. Whenever fluorescein is used, flush the eyes with sterile saline solution. 
Wait at least 5 minutes before inserting new lenses. If it is not possible to flush the eyes, wait a minimum of 1 hour before inserting new lenses. If inserted too soon, the lenses may absorb residual fluorescein.  
• Before leaving the eye care professional’s office, the subject should be able to promptly remove lenses.  
• The lenses are prescribed for disposable wear and are to be stored for return to the eye care professional once they are removed from the subject’s eye. It is important that subjects be instructed to always have available a pair of replacement lenses. In the event that a lens must be removed from the eye because of dust, a foreign body or other contaminant gets on the lens, or the lens becomes dehydrated, the lens should be removed and replaced with a replacement lens. 
Eye care professionals should carefully instruct subjects about the following safety precautions: 
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended directions on Care for a Sticking Lens. The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the subject should be instructed to immediately  consult 
his or her eye care professional. Do not attempt to remove the lens, except on the instructions of the eye care professional.  
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the eyes or on the lenses. It is  best to put on lenses before 
putting on makeup. Water -base cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses than oil -base 
products. 
• Do not touch contact lenses with the fingers or hands if the hands are not free of foreign materials, as microscopic scratches of  the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or 
injury to the eye. 
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing instructions in the Subject Instructions and those prescribed by the eye care professional. 
• Never wear lenses beyond th e period recommended by the eye care professional. 
• If aerosol products such as hair spray are used while wearing lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray has settled. 
• Always handle lenses gently and avoid dropping them. 
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing lenses. 
• Ask the eye care professional about wearing lenses during water activities and other sports. 
• Inform the doctor (health care professional) about being a contact lens wearer. 
• Never use tweezers or other  tools to remove lenses from the lens container unless specifically 
indicated for that use. Pour the lens into the hand. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 79 of 84 • Do not touch the lens with fingernails. 
• Always contact the eye care professional before using any medicine in the eyes. 
• Always inform t he employer of being a contact lens wearer. Some jobs may require use of eye 
protection equipment or may require that the subject not wear contact lenses. 
• As with any contact lens, follow -up visits are necessary to assure the continuing health of the 
subject’s eyes. The subject should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up schedule. 
 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The subject should be informed that the following problems may occur: 
• Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
• Comfort is le ss than when lens was first placed on eye, 
• Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
• Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes,  
• Unusual eye secretions, 
• Redness of the eyes,  
• Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
• Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
• Dry eyes.  
If the subject notices any of the above, he or she should be instructed to: 
• Immediately remove lenses.  
• If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens is in any way 
damaged, do not put the lens back on the eye. Place the lens in the storage case and contact the eye care professional. If the lens has dirt, an eyelash, or other foreign body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears undamaged, the subject should insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem continues, the subject should immediately remove the lenses and consult the eye care professional . 
If the above symptoms continue after removal of the lens, or upon insertion of a new lens, the subject should immediately remove the lenses and contact his or her eye care professional  or 
physician, who must determine the need for examination, treatment,  or referral without delay. 
(See Important Treatment Information for Adverse Reactions.) A serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, corneal vascularization, or iritis may be present, and may progress rapidly. Less serious reactions such as abrasions, epithelial stinging or bacterial conjunctivitis must be  
managed and treated carefully to avoid more serious complications. 
 IMPORTANT TREATMENT INFORMATION FOR ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Sight-threatening ocular complications associated with contact lens wear can develop rapidly, and 
therefore early recognition and tre atment of problems are critical. Infectious corneal ulceration is 
one of the most serious potential complications and may be ambiguous in its early stage. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 80 of 84 Signs and symptoms of infectious corneal ulceration include discomfort, pain, inflammation, 
purulent discharge, sensitivity to light, cells and flare and corneal infiltrates. Initial symptoms of a 
minor abrasion and an early- infected ulcer are sometimes similar.  
Accordingly, such epithelial defect, if not treated properly, may develop into an infected ulc er. In 
order to prevent serious progression of these conditions, a subject presenting symptom of abrasions or early ulcers should be evaluated as a potential medical emergency, treated accordingly, and be referred to a corneal specialist when appropriate. Standard therapy for corneal abrasions such as eye patching or the use of steroids or steroid/antibiotic combinations may exacerbate the condition. If the subject is wearing a contact lens on the affected eye when examined, the lens should be removed immed iately, and the lens and lens care products retained for analysis and culturing. 
 
SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
Persons who require vision correction and who would not or could not adhere to the replacement 
regimen for the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact le nses or are unable to place and remove 
the lenses should not be provided with them. Failure to follow handling instructions could lead to serious eye infections, which might result in corneal ulcers. 
Subject communication is vital because it relates not only to subject selection but also to ensure 
compliance. It is also necessary to discuss the information contained in the Subject Instructions with the subject at the time of the initial examination. Subjects selected to wear the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lens should be chosen for their motivation to wear contact lenses, general health, and cooperation. The eye care professional must take care in selecting, examining, and instructing contact lens subjects. Subject hygiene and willingness to fol low eye care professional 
instructions are essential to their success.  
A detailed history is crucial to determining subject needs and expectations. Your subject should be questioned regarding vocation, desired lens -wearing time (full or part time), and des ired lens usage 
(reading, recreation,  or hobbies). Initial evaluation of the lens should be preceded by a complete 
eye examination, including visual acuity, keratometry, and slit lamp examination. 
It is normal for the subject to experience mild symptoms such as lens awareness, variable vision, 
occasional tearing (watery eyes), and slight redness during the adaptation period. Although the adaptation period varies for each individual, generally within one week these symptoms will disappear. If these symptoms persist, the subject should be instructed to contact his or her eye care professional. 
 FITTING PROCEDURE  
1. Pre-fitting Examination  
A pre -fitting subject history and examination are necessary to: 
− determine whether a subject is a suitable candidate for daily disposable contact lenses 
(consider subject hygiene and mental and physical state), 
− make ocular measurements for initial contact lens parameter selection, and  
− collect and record baseline clinical information to which post -fitting examination results 
can be compared.  
A pre -fitting examination should include spherocylindrical refraction and VA, keratometry, and 
biomicroscopic examination. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 81 of 84 2. Initial Lens Power Selection  
− Lens power is determined from the subject's spherical equivalent prescription corrected to 
the corneal plane.  
− Select the appropriate power lens and place the lens on the eye. Allow the lens to remain on the eye long enough ( 10 minutes) to achieve a state of equilibrium. Small variations in 
the tonicity, pH of the lens solutions, and individual tear composition may cause slight changes in fitting characteristics.  
− Allow any increase in tear flow to subside before evaluating the lens. The time required will vary with the individual.  
3. Initial Lens Evaluation  
− To determine proper lens parameters,  observe the lens relationship to the eye using a slit 
lamp.  
○ Movement: The lens should provide discernible movement with: 
▪ Primary gaze blink  
▪ Up gaze blink 
▪ Up gaze lag  
○ Centration: The lens should provide full corneal coverage. 
− Lens evaluation allows the contact lens  fitter to evaluate the lens/cornea relationship in the 
same manner as would be done with any daily disposable soft lens. 
4. Criteria of a Well -Fitted Lens  
If the initial lens selection fully covers the cornea, provides discernible movement after a blink, is comfortable and provides satisfactory visual performance, it is a well -fitted lens and can be 
dispensed. 
5. Characteristics of a Tight (Steep) Lens  
A lens which is much too steep may subjectively and objectively cause distortion which will vary 
after a blink. However, if a lens is only marginally steep, the initial subjective and objective vision and comfort findings may be quite good. A marginally steep lens may be differentiated from a properly fitted lens by having the subject gaze upward. A prope rly fitted lens will tend to slide 
downward approximately 0.5 mm while a steep lens will remain relatively stable in relationship to 
the cornea, particularly with the blink. 
6. Characteristics of a Loose (Flat) Lens  
If the lens is too flat, it will:  
− Decenter, especially on post -blink. 
− Have a tendency to edge lift inferiorly and sit on the lower lid, rather than positioning 
between the sclera and palpebral conjunctiva.  
− Have a tendency to be uncomfortable and irritating with fluctuating vision. 
− Have a t endency to drop or lag greater than 2.0 mm on up- gaze post -blink. 
7. Follow- up Care  
− From the day of dispensing, the following schedule is required for this study. 
○ 1-Week Follow -Up Visit  
○ 3-Week Follow -Up Visit  
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 82 of 84 − Prior to a follow -up examination, the contact lenses should be worn for approximately 1 
continuous hour and the subject should be asked to identify any problems which might be 
occurring related to contact lens wear.  
− With lenses in place on the eyes, evaluate fitting performance to assure that CRITERIA OF A WELL FITTED LENS continue to be satisfied. Examine the lenses closely for surface deposition and/or damage. 
− After the lens removal, instill sodium fluorescein (unless contraindicated) into the eyes and conduct a thorough biomicroscopy examination. 
○ The pr esence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central cornea and/or corneal 
neovascularization may be indicative of excessive corneal edema.  
○ The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal -conjunctival hyperemia can be 
indicative of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens wear, and/or a poorly fitting lens. 
○ Papillary conjunctival changes may be indicative of an unclean and/or damaged lens. If any of the above observations are judged abnormal, various professional judgments are necessary to alleviate the problem and restore the eye to optimal conditions.  
MULTIFOCAL FITTING GUIDELINES  
1. Lens Selection  
− Update spectacle refraction and Add power.  
− Determine dominance at  distance vision by placing a +1.50 loose handheld trial lens 
alternatively over each eye binocularly through updated distance correction. The eye for which binocular vision is blurriest through the +1.50 is the dominant eye. 
− Select lens distance prescription based upon s pherical equivalent from spectacle 
prescription, adjusted for vertex distance if necessary. 
− Choose trial lenses based upon the above calculation and select Add power (Both eyes). 
• Bausch + Lomb INFUSE Multifocal Low Add: +0.75 to +1.50D 
• Bausch + Lomb INFUSE Multifocal High Add: +1.75D to +2.50D  
2. Lens Fitting  
− Allow lens to equilibrate for at least 10 minutes before assessing fit and vision. 
− Evaluate distance and near vision binocularly in normal room illumination. 
− If vision at distance and near is satisfactory , dispense lenses.  
3. To Refine Near Vision  
If patient is wearing two Low Add lenses: 
− Refinement 1: Place Bausch + Lomb INFUSE Multifocal High Add in non- dominant eye 
while keeping Bausch + Lomb INFUSE Multifocal Low Add in dominant eye. 
− Refinement 2: If vis ion is still unsatisfactory, continue adding +0.25 at a time to the non-
dominant eye using handheld lenses.  Adjust contact lens power when vision is satisfactory. 
If patient is wearing two High Add lenses: 
− Refinement 1: Add +0.25D to the non-dominant eye. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 83 of 84 − Refinement 2: If vision is still unsatisfactory, continue adding +0.25 D at a time to the non-
dominant eye using handheld lenses. 
4. To Refine Distance Vision  
If patient is wearing two Low Add lenses: 
− Refinement 1: Fit Bausch + Lomb INFUSE SVS in dominant eye while keeping Bausch + Lomb INFUSE Multifocal Low Add in non-dominant eye. 
− Refinement 2: If vision is still unsatisfactory, add - 0.25D at a time to dominant eye using 
handheld lenses.  Adjust contact lens power when vision is satisfactory. 
If patient is wearing two High Add lenses: 
— Refinement 1: Fit with Bausch + Lomb INFUSE Multifocal Low Add in 
dominant eye while keeping Bausch + Lomb INFUSE Multifocal High Add in non-dominant eye. 
— Refinement 2; If vision is still unsatisfactory, add -0.25 at a time to dominant eye using handheld lenses.  Adjust contact lens power when vision is satisfactory.  
5. Patient Education  
All patients do not function equally well with multifocal correction.  Patients may not 
perform as well for certain tasks with this correction as they have with multifocal reading glasses.  Each patient should understand that multifocal correction can create a vision compromise that may reduce visual acuity bad depth perception for distance and near tasks.  During the fitting process i t is necessary for the patient to realize the disadvantages as well 
as the advantages of clear near vision in straight ahead and upward gaze that multifocal contact lenses provide.  
 
WEARING SCHEDULE  
The wearing and daily disposable schedules should be determined by the eye care professional. Regular checkups, as determined by the eye care professional, are extremely important. 
Daily Disposable: There may be a tendency for the daily disposable subject to over -wear the lenses initially. 
Therefore, the importance of adhering to a proper, initial daily disposable schedule should be 
stressed to these subjects. The wearing schedule should be determined by the eye care professional. The wearing schedule chosen by the eye care professional should be provided to the subject. The lens is to be prescribed for single- use disposable wear and is to be replaced after each removal.  
All subjects should be supplied with a copy of the Subject Instructions. 
 HANDLING OF LENSES  
When lenses are dispensed, the subject should be provided with appropriate and adequate 
instructions and warnings for lens handling. The eye care professional should recommend appropriate and adequate procedures for each individual subject in accordance with the particular lens-wearing schedule. 
 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 84 of 84 CARE FOR A STICKING (NONMOVING) LENS  
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the subject should use a solution intended to lubricate or rewet a 
contact lens, as recommend by your eyecare practitioner .  The subject should be instructed to not 
use plain water, or anything other than the recommended solutions. The subject should be 
instructed to contact the eye care professional if the lens does not begin to move upon blinking after several applications of  the solution, and to not attempt to remove the lens except on the advice 
of the eye care professional.  
 
REPORTING OF ADVERSE REACTIONS  
All serious adverse experiences and adverse reactions observed in subjects wearing the Bausch +

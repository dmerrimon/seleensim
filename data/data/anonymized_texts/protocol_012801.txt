Detailed Title A Phase IIIB, randomized, open -label, multicenter clinical 
trial to assess the immunogenicity  and sa fety of GSK 
Biologicals’ Herpes Zoster vaccine GSK1437173A when co -
administered with Prevenar13 in adults aged 50 years and 
older.
Indication Prevention of Herpes Zoster (HZ) and related complications 
in adults ≥50 y ears of age (YOA) and immunocompromized 
(IC) adults ≥18 YOA .
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designVaricella -zoster virus (VZV) causes two distinct diseases. 
Varicella (chickenpox) occurs shortl y after primary VZV 
infection and is characterized by  systemic illness and a w idely 
disseminated rash. Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) occurs when 
VZV reactivates from latency  and t ypically manifests as a 
localized, dermatomal rash.
The typical HZ rash usually  lasts 2 to 4 weeks and is ty picall y 
accompanied b y pain and pruritus. The mo st common 
complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined 
as pain that persists after the resolution of the HZ rash. 
Declining VZV -specific immune responses with older age are 
a clear risk factor for developing shingles and PHN.
The objective of the current phase III study  is to assess 
immunogenicit y, reactogenicity and safety of GSK 
Biologicals’ HZ vaccine when its first dose is co- administered 
with a pneumococcal poly saccharide conjugate vaccine 
(Prevenar13 ) in adults aged 50 Y OA, as compared to the 
control group where the two HZ/su doses are administered 
subsequent to Prevenar13.
The twoparallel arms study  design was selected to allow an 
assessment of the immunogenicity , reactogenicit yand safet y
of HZ/su and Prevenar13 vaccin es when they  are co -
administered and when administered separatel y in a staggered 
schedule ( Prevenar13 followed by  HZ/su).
Objectives Co-Primary
To determine the vaccine response rate (VRR) to HZ/su 
(based on humoral immune response) one month after the 
second vaccine dose, when the first dose of HZ/su is co -
administered with Prevenar13 (Co-Ad group) .*204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0
CONFIDENTIA L
204487 (ZOSTER- 059 PRI)
Protocol Amendm ent 2 Final
30-JAN -2018 9Criterion to be used: 
The objective is met if the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI 
of the VRR for anti -gE antibody concentrations in the Co-
Ad group one month after the second vaccine dose is 
≥60%.
* The VRR for anti -gE is defined as the percentage of subjects 
who have at least: a 4 -fold increase in the anti -gE antibodies 
concentration as compared to the pre- vaccination anti -gE 
antibodies concentration, for subjects who are seropositive at 
baseline, or, a 4 -fold increase in the anti -gE antibodies 
concentration as compared to the anti- gE antibodies cut- off 
value for seropositivity , for subjects who are seronegative at 
baseline.
If the above objective is met in the Co -Ad group, then the 
following objective will be evaluated:
To demonstrate non -inferiority  of the humoral immune 
response to two doses of HZ/su at one month after the last 
vaccine dose, when the first dose of HZ/su is co-
administer ed with Prevenar13 (Co-Ad group) compared 
to when two doses of HZ/su are administered subsequent 
to Prevenar13 (Control Group).
Criterion for non- inferiority: 
One month after the last vaccine dose in each study 
group, the upper limit (UL) of the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the anti- gE antibodies Geometric Mean 
Concentration (GMC) ratio between the Control group 
and the Co- Ad group is <1.5.
If the above non -inferiority  objective is met, then the 
following objective will be evaluated:
To demonstr ate non- inferiority  of the humoral immune 
response to Prevenar13 at one month after the vaccine 
dose, when Prevenar13 is co-administered with the first 
HZ/su dose (Co -Ad group) compared to when 
Prevenar13 is administered separatel y from HZ/su 
(Control group), for the 13 seroty pes included in 
Prevenar13 anal yzed sequentially .
Criterion for non- inferiority: 
One month after the Prevenar13 vaccine dose in each 
study group, the UL of the 95% CI for each individual 
pneumococcal conjugate serotype Geometric Mea n Titer 
(GMT) ratio of the Control group over the Co- Ad group 
is <2.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

Adequate contraception: Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per y ear when 
used consistently  and correctl y and when applicable, in 
accordance with the product label for example: 
abstinence from penile -vaginal intercourse, when this 
is their preferred and usual lifesty le,
Combined estrogen and progesterone oral 
contraceptives,
injectable progestogen,
implants of etenogestrel or levonorgestrel,
Contraceptive vaginal ring,
percutaneous contraceptive patches,
intrauterine devic e or intrauterine s ystem,
male partner sterili zation prior to the female subject’s 
entry  into the study , and this male is the sole partner 
for that subject,
The information on the male sterility  can come from 
the site personnel’s review of the subject’s me dical 
records; or interview with the subject on her medical 
history .
male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide 
(foam, gel, film, cream or suppository ),and/or 
progesterone alone oral contraceptive.
Adequate contraception does not apply  to subjects of 
child bearing potential with same sex partners, or for 
subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from 
penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent 
basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifest yle.
Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product. 
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product. 
For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i. e. lack of efficacy ), 
abuse or misuse.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 26Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the co nduct of the trial, 
and only  when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level 
of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded or 
when required in case of a serious adverse event. In an 
open -label stud y, no blind is used. Both the investigator 
and the subject know the identity  of the treatment 
assigned.
Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
End of Study :
(Synonym of End of 
Trial)For studies without collection of human biologicals 
samples or imaging data EoS is the Last Subject Last 
Visit (L SLV). 
For studies with collection of Human Biologicals 
Samples or imaging data, EoS is defined as the date of the 
last testing/reading released of the Human Biological 
Samples or imaging data, re lated to primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. EoS must be achieved no later than 
8 months after L SLV.
Epoch: An epoch is a set of consecutive timepoints or a single 
timepoint from a single protocol. Epochs are defined to 
support a main purpose which is either to draw 
conclusions on subject participation or to draw a 
complete conclusion to define or precise the targeted 
label of the product. Supporting means that data collected 
at the timepoints included in an epoch must be sufficient 
to fulfil the purpose of the epoch.
Typical examples of epochs are screening, primary  
vaccinations, boosters, yearl y immunogenicity follow -
ups, and surveillance periods for efficacy  or safet y.
eTrack: GSK’s tracking tool for clinical trials.
Evaluable: Meeting all eligibility  criteria, compl ying with the 
procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, 
included in the per-protocol analysis (see Sections 6.7.2
and 10.4 for details on criteria for evaluability ).
Immunological correlate 
of pr otection:The defined immune response above which there is a high 
likelihood of protection in the absence of an y host factors 
that might increase susceptibility  to the infectious agent.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 27Intercurrent medical 
condition:An intercurrent medical condition is defined as a 
condition that has the capability  of confounding the 
immune response to the study  vaccine or its 
interpretation.
Investigational vaccine :
(Synonym of 
Investigational Medicinal 
Product)A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient being 
tested in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorisation when used in a way  different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about 
an approved use. 
Legally acceptable 
representative:
(The terms legal 
representative or legally 
authorized 
representative are used 
in some settings.)An individual or juridical or other bod y authorized under 
applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective 
subject, to the subject's partic ipation in the clinical trial.
Menarche: Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a 
young female and is preceded by  several changes 
associated with pubert y including breast development and 
pubic hair growth. Menarche usuall y occurs within 1-2
years of breast development, thelarche. However, a y oung 
female can become pregnant before her first menses. 
Thus, a conservative definition of non- childbearing 
potential in a pre -menarcheal female is a y oung female 
who has not y et entered puberty  as evidenced b y lack of 
breast development (palpable glandular breast tissue).
Menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation 
of menstrual cy cles, menses, and implies the loss of 
reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical 
definiti on accepts menopause after 1 year without menses 
with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age 
e.g. > 45 years.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 28Pharmacogenomics : The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
E15 Guidance for Industry defines pharmacogenomics as 
Study of variation of DNA and RNA characteristics as 
related to drug or treatment response. Pharmacogenetics, 
which is a subset of pharmacogenomics, is “the study  of 
variations in DNA sequence as related to drug response.” 
Pharmacogenomic biomarkers include ger mline (host) 
DNA and RNA as well as somatic changes (e.g., 
mutations) that occur in cells or tissues. 
Pharmacogenomic biomarkers are not limited to human 
samples but include samples from viruses and infectious 
agents as well as animal samples. The term 
pharmacogenomic experiment includes both the 
generation of new genetic or genomic (DNA and/or 
RNA) data with subsequent anal ysis as well as the 
analysis of existing genetic or genomic data to understand 
drug or treatment response (pharmacokinetics, safety , 
efficacy  or effectiveness, mode of action). Proteomic and 
metabolomic biomarker research are not 
pharmacogenomics.
Potential Immune-
Mediated Disease:Potential immune -mediated diseases (p IMDs) are a subset 
of AEs that include autoimmune diseases and other 
inflammatory  and/or neurologic disorders of interest 
which may  or may  not have an autoimmune aetiology .
Primary completion 
date:The date that the final subject was examined or received 
an intervention for the p urpose of final collection of data 
for all primary  outcome s, whether the clinical trial was 
concluded according to the pre -specified protocol or was 
terminated.
Protocol amendment: The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
defines a protocol ame ndment as: ‘A written description 
of a change(s) to or formal clarification of a protocol.’ 
GSK Biologicals further details this to include a change 
to an approved protocol that affects the safet y of subjects, 
scope of the investigation, study  design, or scientific

30-JAN -2018 311. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Varicella -zoster virus (VZV) causes two distinct diseases. Varicella (chickenpox) occurs 
shortly  after primary  VZV infection and is characterized by  systemic illness and a widel y 
disseminated rash. Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) occurs when VZV reactivates from 
latency  and t ypicall y manifests as a localized, dermatomal rash.
The typical HZ rash usually  lasts 2 to 4 weeks and is ty picall y accompanied by pain and 
pruritus. The most common complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined 
as pain that persists after the resolution of the HZ rash. Declining VZV -specific immune 
responses with older age are a clear risk factor for developing shingles and PHN 
[Dworkin , 2007; National Network for Immunization I nformation (NNii) , 2008].
About half of all HZ cases occur in individuals over the age of 60, and individuals who 
reach 85 YOA have a 50% chance of having HZ during their lifetime [ Oxman , 2005, 
Chua , 2010]. The risk of developing PHN varied from 5% to more than 30% depending 
on the study  design and age distribution [ Kawai , 2014]. Since the loss of VZV-specific T-
cell responses as a result of aging is associated with a heightened susceptibility  to HZ, 
vaccination is considered as a means to reduce the risk of HZ in older adults [ Oxman, 
2005; Sperber , 1992].
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ va ccine (Shingrix ) for the prevention of HZ is a 
recombinant subunit (su) vaccine consisting of VZV gl ycoprotein E (gE) as antigen and 
an adjuvant s ystem AS01 B.It has been evaluated in several studies in healthy  adults and 
shown to elicit strong cellular and humoral immune responses. The safet y and 
reactogenicity  profile of the study vaccine was also acceptable . Based on phase II data 
from the antigen dose -rangin g stud y ZOSTER -003 [ Chlibek , 2014], and the adjuvant 
dose comparison stud y ZOSTER -010 [ Chlibek , 2013], a gE antigen dose of 50 µg and 
the adjuvant sy stem AS01 Bwere selected for the final vaccine formulation. Henceforth in 
the document, the final vaccine formulation will be referred to as HZ/su. 
Two large pi votal phase III trials, ZOSTER -006 (also referred to as ZOE- 50) in subjects 
≥50 YOA and ZOSTER -022 (also referred to as ZOE- 70) in subjects ≥70 YOA, 
evaluated the vaccine efficacy  and safet y of HZ/su. These placebo- controlled trials 
enrolled more than 30,0 00 subjects who received either HZ/su or placebo on a 0, 2- month 
schedule. The final anal ysis of the ZOSTER -006 primary  efficacy  objective demonstrated 
that the vaccine is highl y efficacious in adults ≥50 YOA, with 97.2% (95% confidence 
interval [CI ] of 93.7 - 99.0) overall efficacy  against HZ. In addition, vaccine efficacy  
against HZ was between 96.6% and 97.9% for all pre- specified age groups (50 -59, 60 -69 
and ≥70 YOA) [ Lal, 2015]. The results from ZOSTER -022 demonstrated that the first 
primary  objective has been successfully  met, with 89.8% (95% CI of 84.3- 93.7) efficacy  
against HZ in subjects ≥70 YOA, and are therefore consistent with the results of 
ZOSTER -006. In addition, the co -primary  objective of a pre -specified pooled anal ysis of 
ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022 demonstrated that HZ/su has a vaccine efficacy against 
HZ of 91.3% (with 95% CI  of 86.8 -94.5) and effectively  prevents PHN in subjects ≥70 204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 32YOA (efficacy  of 88.8% with 95% CI  of 68.7 -97.1). No safety  concerns have been raised 
[Cunningham , 2016].
The immunogenicit y, reactogenicity, and safet y of HZ/su when co -administered with a 
23-valent pneumococcal poly saccharide conjugate vaccine ( Pneumovax 23 [trade name 
for Canada, Germ any and United States]/ Pneumo 23 [trade name for Estonia], Merck& 
Co., I nc) have been assessed in a phase III stud y in subjects  50 YOA (ZOSTER- 035).
The immunogenicit y co-primary  objectives have been met.
Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure (IB) for information regarding the pre -
clinical and clinical studies of GSK Biologicals’ study HZ/su vaccine.
1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
The objective of the current phase III study  is to assess immunogenicit y, reactogenicit y 
and safet y of GSK Biologicals’ HZ vaccine when its first dose is co -administered with a 
pneumococcal poly saccharide conjugate vaccine ( Prevenar13 ) in adults aged 50 YOA, 
as compared to the control group where the two HZ/su doses are administered subsequent 
to Prevenar13 .
The two parallel arms study  design was selected to allow an assessment of the 
immunogenicit y, reactogenicity and safety of HZ/su and Prevenar13 vaccines when they  
are co -administered and when administered separately in a staggered schedule 
(Prevenar13 followed b y HZ/su).
1.3. Benefit : Risk A ssessment
Please refer to the current IB for the summary  of potential risks and benefits of GSK 
Biologicals’ study HZ vaccine (HZ/su).

Benefits include:
Recei ving HZ/su during the study  may  reduce the risk of HZ occurrence and HZ -
related complications.
Receiving Prevenar13 during the study  may  prevent occurrence of pneumococcal 
pneumonia and invasive disease caused b y 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (1, 
3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F).
Medical evaluations/assessments associated with study  procedures (e.g. physical 
examination).
1.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Considering the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects par ticipating in this study , 
the potential or recognized risks identified in association with the study HZ vaccine 
(HZ/su) and stud y procedures are justified by the potential benefits ( prevention of HZ 
and related complications) that may  be afforded to the su bjects receiving HZ/su .
Please refer to the approved product label/package insert for the summary  of potential 
risks and benefits of Prevenar13 .
2. OBJECTIVES
2.1. Co-Primary  objectives
To determine the vaccine response rate (VRR) to HZ/su (based on humoral immune
response) one month after the second vaccine dose , when the first dose of HZ/su is 
co-administered with Prevenar13 (Co-Ad group) .
Criterion to be used: 
The objective is met if the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI of the VRR for anti -gE
antibody concentrations in the Co-Adgroup one month after the second vaccine dose 
is ≥60%.
If the above objective is met in the Co-Adgroup , then the following objective will be 
evaluated:
To demonstrate non -inferiority  of the humoral immune response to two doses of 
HZ/su at one month after the last vaccine dose, when the first dose of HZ/su is co -
administered with Prevenar13 (Co-Ad group) compared to when two doses of HZ/su 
are administered subsequent to Prevenar13 (Control Group).204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 35Criterion for non- inferiority: 
One month after the last vaccine dose in each study group, the upper limit (UL) of 
the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the anti- gE antibodies Geometric Mean 
Concentration (GMC) ratio between the Control group and the Co- Ad group is <1.5.
If the above non -inferiority  objective is met, then the following objective will be 
evaluated:

5.1. Regulatory  and ethical considerations, including the 
informed consent process
The study  will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements.
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the I CH Guideline for GCP , all 
applicable subject privacy requirements and the guiding principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki. 
GSK will obtain favourable opinion/approval to conduct the study  from the appr opriate 
regulatory  agency , in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements, prior to a site 
initiating the study  in that country .
Conduct of the study  includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and 
favourable opinion/approval of study  protocol and any  subsequent amendments.
Subject informed consent .
Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol.
GSK will provide full details of the above procedures to the i nvestigator, either verbally , 
in writing, or both.
Freely  given and written or witnessed/ thumb printed informed consent must be obtained 
from each subject prior to participation in the study. 
GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Informed Consent Form (IC F) which will embody  
the ICH GCP and GSK Biologicals required elements. While it is strongly  recommended 
that this model I CF is to be followed as closely  as possible, the informed consent 
requirements given in this document are not intended to pre- empt an ylocal regulations 
which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y 
effective. Clinical judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final 
structure and content of the local version of the ICF. 
The investigator has the final responsibility  for the final presentation of the ICF, 
respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF generated b y the 
investigator with the assistance of the sponsor’s representative must be acceptable to 
GSK Biologicals and be approved (along with the protocol, and an y other necessary  
documentation) b y the IRB/IEC.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

5.2.1. Subject identification
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially to the subjects who h ave 
consented to participate in the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study  centre.
5.2.2. Randomi zation of treatment
The treatment allocation will be performed using SBI R. The treatment numbers will be 
allocated b ydose. The allocation ratio will be 1:1 between each stud y group.
Randomi zation of supplies 5.2.2.1.
The randomiz ation of supplies within blocks will be performed at GSK Biologicals, using 
MATerial EXcellence ( MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Anal ysis 
System ( SAS®) (Cary , NC, USA) by  GSK Biologicals. Entire blocks will be shipped to 
the study  centres /warehouse(s).
To allow GSK Biologicals to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than 
anticipated at individual centres in this multi -centre study  and to thus reduce the overall 
study  recruitment period, an over -randomi zation of supplies will be prepared. 
Treatment allocation to the subject 5.2.2.2.
The treatment numbers will be allocated b y dose.
5.2.2.2.1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target will be to enrol approximately  912 eligible subjects who will be randomly  
assigned to two stud y groups in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 456 in each study group).
The enrolment will be performed to ensure distribution of the population across the th ree 
age strata (50 -59 YOA, 60 -69 YOA and  70 YOA). Therefore the expected distribution 
of subjects is as shown in Table 5 .
Age will be calculated as the number of years between the date of birth and the date of 
first vaccination. To ensure that the collection of date of birth will not jeopardise the 
privacy  of Personally  Identifiable Information (PII), only  a partial date of birth *
(MMYYYY) will be collected. Therefore, the 15th of the month will be used to replace 
the missing date.
In case the month is missing, the date will be replaced b y the June 30th of the year.
* In Germany, as per local regulations, only the year of birth will be collected.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
SBIR.Within each age strata (50 -59 YOA, 60 -69 YOA and 70 YOA), the 
randomi zation algorithm will use a minimisation procedure accounting for centre. 
After obtaining the signed an d dated ICF from the subject and having checked the 
eligibility  of the subject, the study  staff in charge of the vaccine administration will 
access SBIR. Upon providing the age (50 -59 YOA, 60- 69 YOA and 70 YOA) at the 
time of enrolment in the study  and t he subject identification number, the randomization 
system will determine the study  group and will provide the treatment number(s) to be 
used for the first dose.
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
When SBI R is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the Study  Procedures 
Manual (SPM) for specific instructions.
5.2.2.2.2. Treatment number allocation for subsequent doses 
For each dose subsequent to the first d ose, the study staff in charge of the vaccine
administration will access SBI R, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
5.3. Method of blinding 
This study  is an open- label study .
The laboratory  in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the treatment, and 
codes will be used to link the subject and stud y (without any link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
5.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the 
safet y of the subjects.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

Suspected HZ is defined as a new rash characteristic of HZ (i.e., unilateral, dermatomal 
and accompanied b y pain broadly  defined to include allody nia, pruritus or other 
sensations). A diagnosis of suspected HZ will be based upon investigator judgment. 
Complications of HZ include, but are not limited to, PHN, HZ vasculitis, disseminated 
disease, ophthalmic disease , neurologic disease, and visceral disease. 
The occurrence of HZ is an intercurrent medical condition (see Section 6.8) which should 
be reported u ntil study  end. All other intercurrent medical conditions should be reported 
until Month 3 for subjects from the Co-Ad group and Month 5 for subjects from the 
Control group. 
The standard reporting period as specified in Section 8.4.1 for Adverse Event 
(AE)/Serious Adverse Event (SAE) should be used for HZ complications.
At Visit Day  1, all subjects will be informed of the signs and s ymptoms of ty pical HZ .

Please refer to the Investigator Lab Manual for details on biospecimen management 
(handling, storage and shipment).
Samples will not be labelled with information that directly  identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, development and quality  assurance of the laboratory  tests 
described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality  of these 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this stu dy for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be asked to give a specific consent
to allow GSK or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future 
research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and 
will only  be performed once an independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has 
approved this research.
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from GSK 
Biologicals. 
Any sample testing will be done in line with the co nsent of the individual subject.
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform an y other biological assay s except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s). 
If additional testing is performed, th e marker priority  ranking given in Section 5.8.4 may 
be changed.
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study  visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall yto and discussed 
and agreed with GSK Biologicals.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

When materials are provided by  GSK Biologicals, it is MANDATORY that all clinical 
samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively  using those 
material s in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the 
exclu sion of the subject from the per -protocol analy sis (See Section 10.4 for the 
definition of cohorts to be anal ysed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel 
and the laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision comply  with this requirement. However, 
when GSK Biologicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical 
samples, appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to the

30-JAN -2018 586.2. Storage and handling of study  vaccine(s)
The study  vaccine(s) must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions 
in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to authorized 
study  personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre- study  activities under 
the responsibility  of the sponsor study  conta ct. The storage temperature should be 
continuously  monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring 
device(s) and recorded. Refer to the SPM for more details on storage of the study  
vaccine(s) .
Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius.
Any temperature excursion outside the range of 0.0 to +8.0 C (for +2 to +8°C/+36 to 
+46°F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (I MPs) must 
be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion de cision form ([e]TDF). 
The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label 
temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor .
In case of temperature excursion below +2.0°C down to 0.0°C impacting IMP(s) there is 
no need to report in (e)TDF, but adequate actions must be taken to restore the +2 to 
+8°C/+36 to +46°F label storage temperature conditions. The impacted I MP(s) may  still 
be administered, but the site should avoid re -occurrence of such temperature excursion.
Refer to the SPM for more details on actions to take.
Refer to the SPM for details and instructions on the temperature excursion reporting and 
usage decision process, packaging and account ability  of the stud y vaccine(s) .
6.3. Dosage and administration of study  vaccine s
For HZ/su:
After reconstitution, the vaccine should be used promptly ; if this is not possible, the 
vaccine should be stored in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). If not used within 6 hours it should 
be discarded. 
For Prevenar13 :
Prevenar13 is a commercially  available vaccine and should be administered in 
accordance with the instructions provided in the manufacturer’s product label/packaging 
insert.
Both vaccines will be administered as indicated in Table 15 and Table 16. The vaccines 
should be administered by  IM injection into the del toid muscle of different arms, using a 
standard aseptic technique. For subjects in the Co- Ad group at Visit Day  1, the HZ/su and 
Prevenar13 vaccinations must be administered in different arms. 204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

In addition to the vaccine doses provided for the planned number of subjects (including 
over-randomization when applicable), at least 30% additional vaccine doses will be 
supplied to replace those that are unusable. 
6.5. Contraindications to subsequent vaccination
The following events constitute absolute contraindica tions to further administration of the 
HZ vaccine. If any of these events occur during the study, the subject must not receive 
additional doses of vaccine but may  continue other study  procedures at the discretion of 
the investigator (see Section 8.5). 
Anaph ylaxis following the administration of vaccine(s).
Pregnancy .
If the subject experiences an SAE judged to be vaccine -related b y the investigator.
The occurrence of a new potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs) or the 
exacerbation of an existing pIMD that, in the opinion of the investigator, expose the 
subject to unacceptable risk from subsequent vaccination. I n such cases, the 
investigator shoul d use his/her clinical judgement prior to administering the next 
dose of the vaccine(s)/product(s). 
Refer to Section 8.1.5.1 for the definition of pIMDs.

If the subject experiences an event of HZ between the first and the second dose of 
HZ/su or between Visit Day 1 and an y dose of HZ/su vaccine (Refer Section 5.5and 
6.8).
The following events constitute contraindications to administration of HZ/su study  
vaccine at that point in time; if any  of these events occur at the time scheduled for 
vaccination, the subject may  be vaccinated at a later date, within the time window 
specified in the protocol, or withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator (Time 
windows between visits are given in Table 8and Table 9).
Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. 
Fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C / 100.4°F. The preferred location for 
measuring temperature in this study  will be oral.
Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory  
infection) without fever can be administered all vaccines/products.
6.6. Warnings and precautions
Refer to the approved product label/package insert of Prevenar13 .
6.7. Concomitant medication s/product sand concomitant 
vaccinations
At each study  visit/contact, the investigator or delegate should question the subject about 
any medication s/product staken and vaccination sreceived b y the subject.

30-JAN -2018 626.8. Intercurrent medical conditions that may  lead to elimination 
of a subject from per-protocol analy ses
At each stud y visit subsequent to the first vaccination/the vaccination visit ,it must be 
verified if the subject has experienced or is experiencing an y intercurrent medical 
condition (I MC). If it is the case, the condition(s) must be recorded in the eCRF. An I MC 
is defined as a condition that has the capability  of confounding the i mmune response to 
the study  vaccine or its interpretation. Subjects may be eliminated from the Per-protocol 
cohort for immunogenicity  if, during the study , they  incur an IMC. 
Examples of I MCs include cases of HZ or a confirmed or suspected immunosuppressi ve 
or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease (e.g., malignancy , HIV infection).
All IMCs including HZ will be recorded until Visit Month 3 for subjects in the Co -Ad 
group and Visit Month 5 for subjects in the Control group. All IMCs will be recor ded in 
AE/SAE screens as appropriate . 
Occurrences of HZ from Visit Month 3 (Co-Ad group) and Visit Month 5 (Control 
group) are to be reported till study  end (phone contact at Month 14 for the Co- Ad group 
and Month 16 for the Control group) but will not be considered as IMCs.

8. SAFETY
The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and 
reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (S AE) as provided in this protocol. 
Each subject will be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should they  
manifest an y signs or s ymptoms they  perceive as serious.
8.1. Safet y definitions
8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
labora tory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0
CONFIDENTIA L
204487 (ZOSTER- 059 PRI)
Protocol Amendm ent 2 Final
30-JAN -2018 63Examples of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccine(s) administration even 
though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study
vaccine(s) or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study vaccine(s) administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen. 
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
firststudy  vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history  section 
of the eCRF.
8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ,
Note: I n general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency  ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0
CONFIDENTIA L
204487 (ZOSTER -059 PRI)
Protocol Amendm ent 2 Final
30-JAN-2018 64been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalization are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospitalization ’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life function s. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may  interfere or preve nt every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other s ituations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardise the 
subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization .
8.1.3. Solicited adverse events
Solicited local (injection -site) adverse events 8.1.3.1.

Note : Subjects will be instructed to measure and record the oral bod y temperature in the 
evening. Should additional temperature measurements be performed at other times of
day, subjects will be instructed to record the highest temperature in the diary card.
8.1.4. Clinical laboratory  parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualify ing as adverse events or serious adverse events 
In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory  findin gs (e.g. clinical chemistry , 
haematology , urinal ysis) or other abnormal assessments that are judged b y the 
investigator to be clinically  significant will be recorded as AE or SAE if they meet the 
definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Section s8.1.1 and 8.1.2). Clinically  significant 
abnormal lab oratory  findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline 
and significantly  worsen following the start of the study  will also be reported as AEs or 
SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal 
asses sments that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by  the 
investigator as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or that are present 
or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or 
SAEs.
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically  
significant.
8.1.5. Adverse events of specific interest
Potential immune -mediated dis eases 8.1.5.1.
Potential immune -mediated diseases (p IMDs) are a subset of AEs that include 
autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory  and/or neurologic disorders of interest 
which may  or may  not have an autoimmune aetiology . AEs that need to be recorded and 
reported as pIMDs include those listed in Table 19 .
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. pathoph ysiology  
involving sy stemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be 
recorded as a p IMD.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

8.2.1. Pregnancy
Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating at the time of vaccina tion must not receive 
additional doses of study  vaccine (s) but may  continue other study  procedures at the 
discretion of the investigator.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any  adverse pregnancy  outcome 
or complication or elective termi nation of a pregnancy  for medical reasons will be 
recorded and reported as an AE or a SAE.
Note: The pregnancy  itself should alway s be recorded on an electronic pregnancy  report.
The following should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as desc ribed in 
Sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.3 :
Spontaneous pregnancy  loss, including:
spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy  loss before/at 22 weeks of gestation)
ectopic and molar pregnancy
stillbirth (intrauterine death of foetus after 22 weeks of gestation).
Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the 
EMA Guideline on pregnancy  exposure [ EMA , 2006 ].It is recognized that national 
regulations might be different.
Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 
days of life). 204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

8.3.1. Time period for detecting and recording adverse events, seri ous 
adverse events and pregnancies
All AEs starting within 30 day s following administration of each dose of study  vaccine 
must be recorded into the appropriate section of the eCRF, irrespective of intensity  or 
whether or not they  are considered vaccination- related.
The time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at the first receipt of study  
vaccine and will end approximately  12 months following administration of the last dose 
of study  vaccine for each subject. See Section 8.4for instructions on reporting of SAEs.
All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study  will be collected and recorded from 
the time of the first receipt of study  vaccine.
SAEs that are related to the study vaccine(s) will be collected and recorded from the time 
of the first receipt of study  vaccine(s) until the subject is discharged from the study .
In addition to the above -mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil 
international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study  participation (i.e. 
protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy ) or are 
related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine will be collected an d recorded from the 
time the subject consents to participate in the study until she/he is discharged from the 
study .
The time period for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin at the first receipt of 
study  vaccine and will end approximately  12 months following administration of the last 
dose of study  vaccine. See section 8.4 for instructions on reporting of pregnancies.
The time period for c ollecting and recording of pIMDs will begin at the first receipt of

30-JAN-2018 718.3.2. Post -Study adverse events and serious adverse events
A post -study  AE/SAE is defined as any  event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting period defined inTable 20. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs 
or SAEs in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE at 
any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to t he study vaccine (s), the investigator will promptly  notify  the 
Study  Contact for Reporting SAEs.

events
As a consistent method of collec ting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as:
‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine (s)or since the previous 
visit?’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documen tation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the 
subject’ s medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the 
eCRF . However, there may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases 
are requested b y GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded 
on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.

will be the oral cavity. When there is no other alternative, the temperature may be recorded by other route. If the 
temperature is taken by an other route (axillary, rectal or tympanic), the route should be documented .
The maximum intensity  of local injection site redness/swelling will be scored at GSK 
Biologicals using GSK Biologicals’ standard grading scale base on the US FDA 
guidelines for Tox icity Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials [ FDA , 2007].

30-JAN -2018 73The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.
The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities (such an AE 
would, for example, prevent attendance at work/school and would 
necessitate the administration of corrective therapy .)
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2 .
8.3.3.2.2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relati onship between study  vaccine(s) and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. I n case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify  
if the AE could be causally  relat ed to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e 
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to 
a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the investigator should indicate the 
AE to be related to all products.
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of th e event to the 
study  vaccine(s) will be considered and investigated. The investigator w ill also consult 
the IB and/or and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing In formation for marketed products to 
determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report t o GSK Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK Biologicals. The 
investigator may  change his/her opinion of cau sality  in light of follow -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causall y related to 
vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the 
following question:204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN-2018 74Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study vaccine?
YES :There is a reasonable possibilit y that the study vaccine(s)
contributed to the AE. 
NO :There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to 
the administration of the study  vaccine(s) . There are other, more 
likely  causes and administration of the study  vaccine (s)is not 
suspected to have contributed to the AE.
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 8.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical hist ory.
Other medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  the protocol.
Lack of ef ficacy  of the vaccine(s) , if applicable.
Erroneous administration.
Other cause (specify ).
Assessment of outcomes 8.3.3.3.
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study as:

Recovering/resolving.
Not recovered/not resolved.
Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.
Fatal (SAEs onl y).

Biologicals
Once the investigator becomes aware that a subject is pregnant, the investigator (or 
designate) must complete the required information onto the electronic pregnancy  report 
WITHIN 2 WEEKS.
Note: Conventionally , the estimated gestational age (EGA) of a pregnancy is dated from 
the first day  of the last menstrual period (LMP) of the cy cle in which a woman conceives. 
If the LMP is uncertain or unknown, dating of EGA and the estimated date of delivery  
(EDD) should be estimated by  ultrasound examination and recorded in the pregnancy  
report.
8.4.5. Reporting of pIMDs to GSK Biologicals
Once a p IMD is diagnosed (serious or non- serious) in a study  subject, the investigator (or 
designate) must complete the information in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events 
Report WITHIN 24 HOURS after he/she becomes aware of the diagnosis. The report 
allows to specify  that the event is a pIMD and whether it is serious or non serious. The 
report will alway s be completed as thoroughly  as possible with all available details of the 
event, in accordance with the pI MD standard questionnaire provided. Even if the 
investigator does not have all information regarding a p IMD, the report should still be 
completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report 
should be updated WI THIN 24 HOURS.
The investigator will alway s provide an assessment of causalit y at the time of the initial 
report. The investigator will be required to confirm the review of the pIMD causalit y by 
ticking the ‘reviewed’ box in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 
hours of submission of the pIMD.

30-JAN-2018 788.4.7. Regulatory  reporting requirements for serious adverse events
The investigator will promptly  report all SAEs to GSK in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 8.4.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility to promptly  notify , 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory  authorit y and other regulatory  agen cies about the 
safet y of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the 
investigator to the Stud y Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of other subject s are met.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator safet y report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccine(s) and unexpected. The purpose of 
the report is to fulfil specific regulatory and GCP requirements, regarding the product 
under investigation.
8.5. Follow -up of adverse events, serious adverse events, and 
pregnancies
8.5.1. Follow -up of adverse events and serious adverse events 
Follo w-up during the study 8.5.1.1.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to GSK 
Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 22).
All SAEs and pI MDs (serious or non -serious) documented at a previous visit/contact and 
designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts until the last visit of the subject .
All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until 30
days after the last vaccination .
Follo w-up after the subject is discharged from the study 8.5.1.2.
The investigator will follow subjects:
with SAEs, pI MDs (serious or non -serious) , or subjects withdrawn from the study  as 
a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or 
until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to GSK Biologicals using a paper/ electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy report as applicable.
GSK Biologicals may  request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible 204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, 
GSK Biologicals will be provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology .
8.5.2. Follow -up of pregnancies
Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . At the end 
of the pregnancy , whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mo ther 
and child will be forwarded to GSK Biologicals using the electronic pregnancy  report and 
the Expedited Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generall y, the follow -up period 
doesn’t need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of d elivery .
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it should alway s be reported as SAE.
8.6. Treatment of adverse events
Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice . Any medication admi nistered for the treatment of a SAE / pI MDs
should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject’s eCRF (refer to 
Section 6.7).
8.7. Subject card
Study  subjects must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main 
contact for information about the clinical study .
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each subject. In 
an emergency  situation this card serves to inform the responsible attending phy sician that 
the subject is in a clinical study  and that relevant information may  be obtained by  
contacting the investigator.

not come back for the concluding visit/was not available for the concluding contact 
foreseen in the protocol. 
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/la st contact of the subject will be used for 
the anal ysis.
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for 
scheduled visits or follow -up. 
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether t he decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made by 
the subject himself/herself , or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
Serious adverse event.
Unsolicited non -serious adverse even t.
Solicited adverse event
Protocol violation (specify ).
Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*.
Moved from the stud y area.
Lost to follow -up.
Other (specify ).
*In case a subject is withdraw n from the study  because he/she has withdrawn consent, the 
investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified by  the 
subject, in the eCRF .
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study  because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study  as result of a SAE/AE until resolution

withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the study vaccine (s)may not necessarily  be 
withdrawn from the study as further stud y procedures or follow -up may  be performed 
(safet y or immunogenicity) if planned in the stud y protocol. 
Information relative to premature discontinuation of the study vaccine (s)will be

10.3. Determination of sample size
Assumptions used for the sample -size calcu lations come from data available from study  
Zoster -010 (112077) and the Prevenar13 assessment report [ EMA , 2011 ]which provides 
a summary  of the data used by  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency  (EMA) to extend the indication of 
Prevenar13 to include adults aged 50 YOA.
The evaluation of the VRR following administration of two doses of HZ/su will be one of 
the co- primary  objectives. The objective will be met if the LL of the 95% CI of VRR is 
equal to or more than 60% (criterion used in other studies in the HZ/su vaccine program). 
In the absence of correlate of protection or threshold level, this criterion ensures that an 
acceptable percentage of subjects meet GSK definition of responder (a 4 -fold increase in 
anibody  concentration/titer). Based on ZOS TER -010 (112077) study  results, the vaccine 
response assumed in healthy  adults ( 50 years of age) is 95%.
The humoral immune responses to the 13 serot ypes of Prevenar13 one month post -dose 
and to HZ/su (anti -gE) one month post -dose 2 will be the two other co-primary  objectives 
and will be compared to demonstrate non -inferiority  of the Co-Ad to the Control groups.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 83Non-inferiority with respect to the antibod y responses to gE will be demonstrated if the 
ULs of the 95% CIs of the GMC ratios (Control group divid ed by Co -Ad group) are 
below the pre -defined clinical limit of 1.5 (based on variability  of the assay s used in the 
HZ/su vaccine program), one month post- dose 2 (Visit Month 3 for the Co -Ad group and 
Visit Month 5 for the Control group).
Non-inferiorit y with respect to the immune responses to the 13 vaccine pneumococcal 
seroty pes will be demonstrated if the UL of the 95% CI  of the MOPA GMTs ratios 
(Control group divided by Co -Ad group) is below the pre -defined clinical limit of 2 
(based on variability  of th e assay s used ) for each of 13 pneumococcal vaccine serot ypes, 
one month post -dose (Month 1).
No adjustment is needed for the type I error due to multiple comparison since fixed 
sequence test which allows full alpha propagation in pre- ordered family  of hy potheses 
will be used.
The global power to meet all co -primary  objectives with 410 evaluable subjects in Co -Ad 
and Control groups is approximately  91% ( Table 23). Assuming that about 10% of the 
subjects enrolled are non -evaluable (e.g. due to dropout, bad sample), approximately  912

10.4. Cohorts for A nalyses
10.4.1. Total vaccinated cohort
The Total vaccinated cohort (TVC) will include all subjects with at least one vaccine 
administration documented:
The TVC for anal ysis of reactogenicity  will include all subjects with at least one 
vaccine administered.
The TVC for analysis of safet y will include all subjects with at least one vaccine 
administered.
The TVC for anal ysis of immunogenicit y will include vaccinated subjects for whom 
immunogenicit y data are available.
The TVC anal ysis will be performed per treatment actual ly administered (at Dose 1).204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

Protocol Amendm ent 2 Final
30-JAN -2018 8510.4.2. Per-protocol cohort for analy sis of immunogenicity
The Per-protocol cohort for anal ysis of immunogenicity  will include all evaluable 
subjects: 
who meet all eligibility  criteria,
who comply  with the procedures and intervals allowed for the anal ysis,
who do not meet an y of the criteria for elimination during the stud y,
for whom data concerning immunogenicit y endpoint measures are available.
10.5. Derived and transformed data
Immunogenicit y
The cut -off value is defined by  the laboratory  before the analy sis and is described in 
Section 5.8.3 .
10.5.1. Handling of missing data
For the anal ysis of s olicited sy mptoms, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not 
be imputed. Therefore, the anal ysis of the solicited sy mptoms based on the TVC will 
include only  subjects/doses with documented safety  data (i.e. s ymptom screen 
completed).
For the anal ysis of unsolicited AEs/SAEs/pI MDs/concomitant medication, all vaccinated 
subjects will be considered and subjects who did not report an event will be considered as 
subjects without an event.
For a given subject and a given immunogenicit y measurement, missing o r non -evaluable 
measurements will not be replaced. Therefore, a subject will be excluded from an 
analysis if all measurements are missing or non -evaluable.
10.6. Analysis of demographics
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race and ethnicity ) will be tabulated per treatment 
group. 
The mean age (plus range and standard deviation [SD]) of the enrolled subjects, as a 
whole, and per treatment group will be calculated. The distribution of subjects enrolled 
among the stud y sites will be tabulated as a whole and per treatment group.
The same tabulations might be performed b y age category if deemed necessary.204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 8610.7. Analysis of immunogenicity
The primary  anal ysis will be based on the per-protocol cohort for anal ysis of 
immunogenicit y. If, in a ny study  group, the percentage of enrolled subjects with 
serological results excluded from the per-protocol cohort for anal ysis of immunogenicit y 
is 5% or more, a second anal ysis based on the Total vaccinated cohort will be performed 
to complement the per-protocol analysis.
10.7.1. Humoral immune response
A seronegative subject is a subject whose antibodies concentration/titer is below the 
cut-off value (cut -off value is defined by  the laboratory  prior to the analy sis).
A seropositive subject is a subject whose ant ibodies concentration/titer is greater 
than or equal to the assay cut- off value.
The seropositivity  rate is defined as the percentage of seropositive subjects.
The VRR for anti -gE is defined as the percentage of subjects who have at least:
a 4-fold increase in the anti -gE antibodies concentration as compared to the pre-
vaccination anti -gE antibodies concentration, for subjects who are seropositive at 
baseline, or,
a 4-fold increase in the anti -gE antibodies concentration as compared to the anti-
gE antibodie s cut-off value for seropositivity , for subjects who are seronegative 
at baseline.
The GMC/GMT calculations are performed b y taking the anti -log of the mean of the 
log concentration transformations. Antibody  concentrations below the cut- off of the 
assay  will be given an arbitrary  value equal to half the cut- off for the purpose of 
GMC/GMT calculation.
10.7.2. Statistical considerations for confirmatory objectives
All analy ses will be performed overall and by  age stratum, if the number of subjects 
enrolled is sufficient in each stratum.
For the multiplicity  adjustment, all hy potheses will be ranked into three families and one 
subfamily  according to the power of test ( Table 23 ). Fixed sequence testing which allows 
for full alpha propagation in pre- ordered hypotheses families will be applied in the 
following manner:
Family  1:
In the Co -Ad group, for anti -gE, at one month post- dose 2:
The VRR and 95% CI will be computed.
The objective is met if the LL of the 95% CI is 60%. 204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 87Family  2:
For anti -gE, at one month post -dose 2:
The 95% CI of the group GMCs ratio will be computed using an anal ysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model on the log10 transformation of the concentrations. 
The pre -vaccination log -transformed antibody  concentrations will be included as 
continuous covariate and t he ANCOVA model will include the vaccine group and 
age strata as fixed effects. 
In terms of concentrations, the Co -Ad group will be considered non -inferior to the 
Control group if the UL of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio of the Control group to the Co -
Ad group is <1.5.
Family  3:
For each vaccine pneumococcal serot ype (according to the order in Table 23 ), one month 
post-dose:
The 95% CI of the group MOPA GMT ratios will be computed using an AN COVA 
model on the log10 transformation of the titers. The pre -vaccination log -
transformed antibody titers will be included as a continuous covariate .The 
ANC OVA model will include the vaccine group and age strata as fixed effects. 
(Amended 30 January 2018)
In terms of MOPA GMTs, the Co-Ad group will be considered non- inferior to the Control 
group if the UL of the 95% CI for the MOPA GMTs ratio of the Control g roup to the Co-
Ad group is <2 for each of the 13 vaccine serotypes.
10.8. Analysis of safety
The anal ysis for safet y will be based on the TVC; all safet y analyses may also be 
performed b y age strata (50 -59, 60- 69 and ≥70 YOA).
When appropriate, tabulations will be presented overall and b y time of occurrence 
relative to last vaccination (e.g. using windows such as Day s 1 to 7, Day s 1 to 30 and 
more than 30 day s post -vaccination).
The results for the anal ysis of safet y will be tabulated as follows:
The number and p ercentage of subjects with at least one local solicited AE, with at 
least one general solicited AE, and with an y solicited AE during the 7 -day follow -up 
period with exact 95% CIs after each vaccine dose and overall by  vaccination group
will be provided;
The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general AE 
during the solicited 7 -day follow -up period will be tabulated with exact 95% CI ;
 For all solicited s ymptoms, the same tabulation will be performed for grade 3 
solicited AEs and for solicited general AEs with relationship to vaccination;204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

tabulated with exact 95% CI ;
The same tabulation will be performed for grade 3 unsolicited AEs and for 
unsolicited AEs with a relationship to vaccination. The proportio n of AEs resulting 
in a medically attended visit will also be tabulated;
Total number/percentages of doses (per dose and overall) followed b y AEs will be 
tabulated;
Number of subjects with pI MDs will be tabulated;
SAEs , including fatalities and withdrawal due to AE(s) will be described in detail.
10.9. Interpretation of analy ses
All co- primary  objectives will be evaluated using a one -sided Ty pe I error of 2.5% (as 
alread y justified b y fixed sequential testing procedure, no alpha adjustment needed) . The 
trial will be considered conclusive if all co- primary  objectives criteria are met.
10.10. Conduct of analy ses
Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan outlined in this protocol 
will be described and justified in the final study  repor t.
10.10.1. Sequence of analy ses
The anal ysis will be performed in the following steps:
1.Analysis of the co -primary immunogenicity objectives will be performed at the end 
of the active phase on data as clean as possible. A confirmatory re -analysis will be 
done at the end of the study using the final database . In addition, a nalyses of 
secondary objectives will also be performed at the end of the active phase. 
(Amended 30 January 2018) ..
2.Analy ses on safety  data will be performed when all data up to study  end (i.e., p hone 
contact at Month 14 for Co -Ad group and phone contact at Month 16 for Control 
group) will be available and cleaned. (Amended 30 January 2018)

11.1. electronic Case Report Form instructions
A validated GSK defined electronic data collection tool will be used as the method for 
data collection. 
In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to GSK. Subject data 
necessary  for anal ysis and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database 
or data s ystem. Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with 
applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures.
While completed eCRFs are reviewed b y a GSK Biologicals’ Site Monitor at the study 
site, omissions or inconsistencies detected b y subsequent eCRF review may necessitate 
clarification or correction by  the investigator or appropriatel y qualified designee. In all 
cases, the investigator remains accountable for the study  data. 
The investigator will be provided with a CD-ROM of the final version of the data 
generated at the investigational site once the database is archived and the study  report is 
complete and approved by  all parties.
11.2. Stud y Monitoring by  GSK Biologicals
GSK will monitor the stud y to verify  that, amongst other items, the: 
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected.

Section 1.1 1.1 Background:
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ candidate study vaccine (Shingrix) for the 
prevention of HZ is a recombinant subunit (su) vaccine consisting of VZV glycoprotein E 
(gE) as antigen and an adjuvant system AS01 B. It has been evaluated in several studies in 
healthy adults and shown to elicit strong cellular and humoral immune responses. The safety and reactogenicity profile of the candidate study vaccine was also acceptable.
Please refer to the current Investigator Brochure (IB) for information regarding the pre-
clinical and clinical studies of GSK Biologicals’ candidate study HZ/su vaccine._3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW-DQ_70)_

Major change
!This amendment is in response to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
Research (CBER) comments on Protocol Amendment 1, received on 09-January-
2018, requesting clarification on 1. the adjustment for baseline titers in the computation of the Multiplex Opsonophagocytosis Assay (MOPA) Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) ratios (Section 10.7.2) and 2. time points for primary evaluations on co-primary immunogenicity objectives (Section 10.10.1).
Other changes
!The tradename for 
pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (13-valent adsorbed)
in Canada has been corrected to Prevnar13 from Prevenar13.
!The laboratory to be used for MOPA testing has been selected and is presented in 
Appendix B.
!A typographical error in the estimated number of subjects in each age strata and 
study group has been corrected. Table 4 reflects the correct number of subjects for age stratification.

Section 5.8.3 Laboratory assays
Serological assay s for the determination of pneumococcal serot ype antibodies will be 
performed b y multiplex opsonophagocy tosis assay  (MOPA) at a GSK Biologicals’ 
laboratory  or in a laboratory  designated by  GSK Biologicals using standardized and 
validated procedures (refer to Table 11).
The GSK Biologicals’ / contract research organizations’ (CRO) clinical laboratories 
have established a Quality  System supported b y procedures. The acti vities of GSK 
Biologicals’ / CROs’ clinical laboratories are audited regularly  for qualit y assessment by 
an internal (sponsor -dependent) but laboratory -independent Quality  Department. Clinical 
laboratories contracted by GSK also conform to Good Laboratory P ractice guidelines 
and operat ein compliance with regulatory standards.
Section 10.7.2 Statistical considerations for confirmatory objectives
Family  3:
The 95% CI of the group MOPA GMT ratios will be computed using an analy sis of 
variance ( ANC OVA )model on the log10 transformation of the concentrations/ titers. The 
pre-vaccination log -transformed antibody titers will be included as a continuous 
covariate .The AN COVA model will include the vaccine group and age strata as fixed 
effects .204487 | Protocol Amendment 2 30 Jan 2018 | TMF-994517 | 2.0

30-JAN -2018 102Section 10.10 .1 Sequence of analyses
The anal ysis will be performed in the following steps:
1.Analy ses after end of active phase at Visit Month 3 for Co Ad group and Visit 
Month 5 for Control group will be performed on data as clean as possible, in order to 
explore the d emograph y as well as reactogenicity  and safet y. Anal ysis on the 
humoral response may  also be performed at this point in time if the data is available. .
These data will also be available for the purpose of public data disclosure .
Analysis of the co -primary immunogenicity objectives will be performed at the end 
of the active phase on data as clean as possible. A confirmatory re -analysis will be 
done at the end of the study using the final database. In addition, analyses of 
secondary objectives will also be performed at the end of the active phase.
2.Analy ses on immunogenicity  and safet
ydata will be performed when all data up to 
study  end (i.e., phone contact at Month 14 for Co-Ad group and phone contact at 
Month 16 for Control group) will be available and cleaned. After the study  
completion, results from both analy ses will be presented in a single study  report.
APPENDIX A LABORATORY ASSAYS
Specific antibod y measurements:
Anti -gE ELISA: Anti- gE antibody  concentrations will be measured using an anti -gE 
ELISA. Diluted blood serum samples of study  subjects will be added to microtiter wells 
pre-coated with gE antigen. Secondary  peroxidase -conjugated anti- human Abs will be 
added, which bind to the primary  human anti -gE Abs. After incubation of the microtiter 
wells with a chromogen substrate solution, the enzymatic reaction will be stopped. 
Optical densities will be recorded and anti -gE antibody  concentrations are calculated 
from a standard curve. The assay  cut-off is 97 mIU/mL . The assay  will be performed on 
human serum at GSK Biologicals’ laboratory  or another laboratory  designated by  GSK 
Biologicals.

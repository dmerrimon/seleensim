II. Abstract - Brief (200 words or less) description of purpose, methods, and expectation.   
  
 The high prevalence of myopia – especially in Asian countries – is well documented, as are the sight -
threa tening complications of high or degenerative myopia.  Retinal detachment, glaucoma, vitreal 
degeneration and focal retinal changes may occur secondary to the progressive axial elongation of the eye 
with age.  Specialty rigid lenses have long been shown to lessen this progression in the pediatric population; 
orthokeratology (ortho -k) lenses are worn at night and change the corneal topography to correct low to 
moderate amounts of myopia. Most of the studies on orthokeratology were conducted on Asian children.  To 
the best of our knowledge, no study has been done on African American (AA) children.  Our project seeks to 
investigate the efficacy of ortho -k in slowing axial elongation and myopic progression in AA children 
compared to that in other races .   
 
III. Introduction/literature review: Please describe the research rationale, aim, and hypothesis with relevant 
background (citing published studies).   Also, provide a list of pertinent references.  
 
 Orthokeratology (ortho -k), when used for partial or full correction of myopia, has been shown to slow myopic 
progression in children by 36 -56% as compared to their spectacle or contact -lens wearing peers.1  This 
effect is achieved by limiting the axial elongation of the eye,1, 2,3, 4 which is of particular conce rn in high 
myopes (>6.00D) and children, where myopic progression has been shown to proceed at a faster rate than 
average.1  As early intervention is considered beneficial if not essential, Ortho -k as a treatment modality for 
diminishing myopic progression  has, to our knowledge, been studied mostly in Asian  children.   
  
 The safety and efficacy of ortho -k as a means of decreasing myopic progression was well established by the 
Children’s Overnight Orthokeratology Investigation (COOKI), who evaluated refract ive error, visual changes 
and ocular health over a period of 6 months in myopic children. 7 The Longitudinal Orthokeratology 
Research in Children (LORIC) study looked at axial elongation in children as old as 12 years, and found that 
ortho -k decreased axia l elongation by approximately 50% compared to be -spectacled controls. 2   They also 
noted, however, high variability amongst the children that limits the clinician’s ability to predict the outcome 
of the intervention.2  The Corneal Reshaping and Yearly Obs ervation of Myopia (CRAYON) study confirmed 
that patients fit with ortho -k lenses showed less change in axial length and vitreous chamber depth when 
compared to subjects wearing soft contact lenses. 3 Other more recent studies by Santodomingo -Rubido et 
al, 7 Kakita et al4 and Charm et al1 confirm this decrease in axial elongation using IOL  Master 
measurements.   
  
 The most commonly accepted theory on how orthokeratology decreases axial elongation relies on the 
peripheral defocus created on the retina by th e corneal changes made by the rigid lens. 9   Hoogerheide et 
IRB/RRC application   Revised May 2012  al showed that those at greatest risk for myopic progression were those whose peripheral refraction was 
hypermetropic10 – that is, they had a hyperopic peripheral ‘defocus’.  A number of studies have since 
suggested that treatment approaches to myopia correction should address this peripheral refraction as a 
means of slowing further axial elongation.9 When looking at subjects treated with ortho k, we see that the 
lenses do in fact introduce a peri pheral myopic defocus while leaving the central refraction more or less 
emmetropic. 9 With this study, we hope to expand potential application of orthokeratology to a novel 
population, AA children.

IV. Summary of methods: describe study design by including:   
 A. Description of subjects:   
1. number of participants  
2. selection process  
3. inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 B. Procedures  
 C. Measurements  
 D. Method of analysis of data  
 
 
 The study will be a randomized control study using a single -masked design to investigate axial elongation 
and myopic progression in children  wearing ortho -k lenses (study group) versus single -vision spectacles or 
soft contact lenses (control group) for a p eriod of 24 months.  A minimum of 40 and a maximum of 60 
subjects will be recruited from patients at Illinois Eye Institute .  Once eligibility has been determined by an 
unmasked observer, patients will be randomly assigned to either  the orthokeratology gro up or the single -
vision contact lens /spectacle group.  
 
 Patient recruitment: Both research alert and chart review in E.H.R. will be used to help us recruit patients.  
 
 Eligible participants will be informed of the benefits and risks of the study both verbally and in writing.  Ethics 
approval will be obtained from the Institutional Review Board at the Illinois College of Optometry. Inclusion 
criteria include: the subject s, aged from 6 to 13 yeares,  must have yearly myopia progression ≤>-1.00 D , 
with a myopic prescription between -1.00D and -6.00D in at least one eye with refractive astigmatism 
<1.50D.  Visual acuity must be at least logMAR 0.10 (Snellen 20/25) or better at baseline examination in 
both eyes  through best corrected manifest refraction .  Oc ular examination must not reveal any strabismus, 
IRB/RRC application   Revised May 2012  ocular pathology or contraindications for orthokeratology lens wear , and no ocular trauma history .  Subjects 
must be in good general health with no systemic conditions that might impact their ocular health o r refractive 
error.  They must be willing to sleep a minimum of six hours per night. Finally, subjects must be willing and 
able to present to clinic for all necessary follow -up care.  Subjects will be excluded if their prescription falls 
outside the refrac tive guidelines,  have a history of any type of trauma or ocular surgery, have a history of 
prior experience with myopia control treatment, are amblyopic or if they are current gas permeable lens 
wearers. They will be discontinued from the study if they ar e non -compliant with the treatment protocol or do 
not achieve a desirable subjective result . 
 
 Baseline examination will include measurement of logMAR acuity (monocular and binocular), subjective 
manifest refraction and auto -refraction (with cycloplegia) w ith measurement of peripheral refraction, anterior 
segment evaluation, corneal topography ( tangential map recordings, including pupil measurement), IOL  
Master measurement of axial length and ultrasound pachymetry. Refractions will be performed with a 
maxim um-plus endpoint which gives maximum vision.  Objective measurements (including IOL  Master, 
autorefractor and pachymetry) will be taken in triplicate and averaged at both baseline examination and 6 -
month examination.  Cycloplegic measurements will be taken  at the baseline , 6-month evaluations , 12-
month evaluations , and 24 -month evaluations .   Measurements will be taken approximately 30 minutes after 
instillation of drops, in this order; Proparacaine 0.5%, Tropicamide 1% , and Cyclopentolate 1%.  
 
 
 After baseline examination, specialty orthokeratology  (Euclid)  lenses will be ordered for those assigned to 
the treatment arm based on topography, non -cycloplegic refraction,  pupil size,  and horizontal visible iris 
diameter.  Sub jects will have a dispensing appointment as well as after -care appointments at 1 -day (+/ - 1 
day), 1 -week (+/ -3 days), 1 -month (+/ -1 week), 6 -month (+/ -15 days) , 12-month (+/-15 days) , 18-month (+/-
15 days) , and 24 -month (+/-15 days) .  Lenses and solutions will be provided at no cost to the subject by 
examiners.   
 
 The subjects wearing spectacles will have a baseline examination, and follow up appointment at 6 -month , 
12-month, 18 -month, and 24 -month . New spectacle lenses will be provided at no cost to the s ubject if their 
current lenses differ from their spectacle prescription (as determined by the examiner) by more than 0.50D 
in either sphere or cylinder power.  Throughout the study, spectacles will also be updated at no cost for 
every 0.50D change in eithe r the sphere or cylinder measurement.  If spectacles are lost or broken, the 
investigators will cover 50% of the cost of replacement. The same protocol applies for those subjects 
wearing soft contact lenses.  
  
 The principal investigator, co -investigator a nd supervisor, who will act as unmasked examiners, will collect 
all examination data except axial length.  Masked observers (up to a maximum of 3) will be trained by the 
principal investigator in the use of the IOL  Master and will perform all measurements with the instrument.  
Objective measurements will be repeated three times and averaged to minimize inter -operator differences. 
Refractions will be performed at each examination and will follow a specific protocol to generate a balanced, 
maximum -plus endpoi nt.  All subjects will be required to wear the prescribed treatment every day for the 6 -
month period under investigation.   
 
Repeated measure ANOVA will be performed to determine if change of refractive error and axial 
length is different comparing subject s in the ortho -K group vs. ones in the control groups.  
 
 
V. Describe the potential scientific benefit(s) of the study.  
 
 Those with myopia would most immediately benefit from this research. Subjects who were not treated with 
ortho -k at a young age would be nefit from evidence that the lenses are effective in an older population.  
Another beneficiary would be the segment of the population at highest risk for degenerative changes: those 
who have high (>6.00 diopters (D)) myopic refractive errors or those whose  axial length elongates at a 
faster rate than average. These subjects would be most poised to benefit from this research, as axial length 
has been directly linked to increased risk of ocular pathology.  
 
VI. Outline the risks to the subjects and precautions  that will be taken to minimize them.  Note:  risks may 
extend beyond physical risk and may include psychological, social, and/or financial risk(s)  
 
IRB/RRC application   Revised May 2012   While orthokeratology is considered to be a safe and effective procedure by the American Academy of 
Ophtha lmology, potential risks include : mild lens binding upon awakening, corneal staining, solution allergy, 
fluctuating vision, irritation, redness, and in rare cases , corneal infection.  To minimize risk s, patients will be 
well educated on proper lens wear an d care and will be provided with the appropriate solutions at no cost.  
Patients will also be given written instructions. Patients will also be seen for frequent follow -up care and will 
have the 24  hour emergen cy contact information for the Urgent Care S ervice at the Illinois Eye Institute.   
 
VII. Describe the methods to be used to insure confidentiality of data.   
 
In order to ensure confidentiality, each subject  will be randomly assigned a unique study number.  
Therefore, all data will be tracked by number rather than by an IEI chart number,  name, or initials.  Only the 
researchers will have access to that information.  All data throughout the study will be coded  using this ID 
number.  The randomized numbers will be kept separate from the data collected.   
 
VIII. All research requires that the subject be aware of the fact that they are participating in a research project.  
This is accomplished using an Informed Consent Process that includes a verbal and written description of 
the project and other relevant information.  The Consent Form is used for adults (individuals over the age of 
18) and children or individuals who are not their own legal guardian (to obtain assent).   The form must be 
written at an eighth grade (or lower) level and fully explained to the research subject.  It must also be signed 
by the research subject, a legal guardian, if necessary, and a witness. Please refer to Handbook For 
Investigator for specif ic guidelines to be followed.   
A. Consent forms should be attached.    
B. Describe the process that will be used to obtain consent, including information on who will obtain 
the consent, and where and when will it be obtained.  
 
Investigators will consent the pa rents and children  in either pediatric clinic or contact lens clinic.  
 
IX. Please provide additional information that will be beneficial to the IRB.  
 
IRB/RRC application   Revised May 2012  The following apply to proposals that are being submitted for review by the Research Resource  Committee only:  
 
Pilot Study  
 
Certain studies are meant to obtain preliminary information in order to determine if a larger more involved study 
would be worthwhil e.  Such studies are considered pilot studies.  Sometimes these studies require a minimum 
budget other times the budget may be quite extensive.  The research allocation committee may look at your request 
in a different manner if your request for funding in volves a pilot study.  Many of the projects funded are considered to 
be pilot studies.  
 
 
X. Budget  
 
In writing research budgets for ICO funding the following factors should be considered.  
 
1. The total faculty research budget is limited.  The amount can vary with the academic year.  Funding for large 
projects (generally over $5000) is usually not a possibility.  The Research Resource  Committee will do its 
best to support faculty requests on a f irst come first supported basis.  The fiscal year ends on June 30th.  
Requests for funds should be submitted as early as possible during the academic year.  Include all itemized 
costs for funding.  Approved funds not spent by July 1st  (end of the academic  year) are deposited back to 
the general fund.  A new request will need to be submitted.  
 
2. Certain budget items will not be funded.  These include money allocated for salary, travel, long term support 
for experimental animals or services that could be provi ded by ICO support or secretarial staff.  Payment of 
human subjects for research projects will be considered on a case by case basis.  
 
 
Justification  
 
The Research Resource  Committee may look at a research project on the basis of its interaction with other  ongoing 
or upcoming faculty projects.  Please indicate whether a portion of your budget for items or equipment can be 
reused for other faculty projects.  This may include a project that may be a continuation of the first project or a new 
project by anothe r faculty member.  It is not a requirement that faculty justify their request for funding on the basis of 
other future research projects.  The committee would request that justification be provided for any high priced items 
and any items listed in the misc ellaneous categories.  
 
 
This study is supported by Wessley Foundation, Euclid, and Bausch & Lomb. Euclid will supply the ortho 
K lenses. Bausch & Lomb will supply the contact lens solution.

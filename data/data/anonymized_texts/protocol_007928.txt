 Methodology:  
This is a  multicenter, open  label study of the long -term safety of IDP -118 Lotion in subjects with plaque 
psoriasis. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least 18 years of age and have a clinical 
diagnosis of moderat e to severe plaque psoriasis ( defined as IGA score of 3 or 4).  
Approximately 500 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be entered into the study with the 
intent that at least 300 subjects will be followed for 6 months and at least 100 subjects will be followed 
for up to 1 year. All enrolled subjects will receive IDP -118 Lotion to be applied once daily for 8 weeks 
and then as needed once daily as assessed in  4-week periods  for up to 1 year.  
Two containers of the IDP -118 Lotion  will be dispensed to  each subject at b aseline. The study drug will 
be applied topically to the affected areas (as determined by the investigator at b aseline)  with the  initial 
application being made by the subject per ins truction from the study staff. Subjects will apply their  
treatments at home once daily as explained by the study coordinator or designee at each investigational center. All subjects will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight, artificial ultraviolet light 
sources  and to use protective clothing to pr event sunburn.  
Following the initial 8 -week treatment period, subjects will be evaluated for treatment success , defined 
as a score of 0  or 1 on the IGA. Subjects who achieve a treatment success at Week 8 will receive no 
further treatment and will be re -evaluated 4 weeks later at Week 12. Subjects who do not achieve a 
treatment success at Week 8 will receive an additional 4 weeks of once daily therapy and will also be re-evaluated at Week 12. At Week 12, the subject should have at least a 1 grade improvement from 
baseline to continue in the study. This 4 -week evaluation/treatment cycle may continue for up to 1 year 
(ie, subjects will be evaluated every 4 weeks and subjects who achieve treatment success will receive no 
treatment until the next 4- week evaluation visit and subjects who do not achieve treatment success will 
receive once daily treatment until the next 4- week evaluation visit). If a su bject remains on treatment 
after Week 12  by meeting the criteria of at least a 1 grade improvement , then at Week 24 , if continuous 
treatment was received , they must have an IGA score equat ing to “Clear” or Almost Clear”  to continue 
on study or they will be  considered a failed treatment . Subjects who achieve a treatment success at any 
visit may not achieve a treatment success at a subsequent visit, and may therefore undergo periods of treatment and periods of nontreatment. The minimum continuous  treatment ex posure will be (the first) 8 
weeks and the maximum  continuous  treatment exposure may be up to but no more than 24 weeks.   
Subjects who continue after Week 24 will be monitored to ensure treatment exposure does not exceed 24 consecutive weeks .

 The subjects  will be  evaluated at Screening (Day -35 to Day -1), Baseline (Day 0), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52. The IGA will be performed at every study visit.  
The study coordinator  or designee will dispense new containers of study drug to the  subject at 
appropriate (requiring treatment)  study visit (ie, at Week 2, Week 4, and any subsequent study visit at 
which the subject did not achieve treatment success). At all postbaseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52)  the subjects will be asked to return their containers of study 
drug and have their treatment compliance evaluated  if applicable. During the study, subjects  will be 
allowed to use inve stigator approved non -medicated cleansers ,  moisturizers  and suncreens; no other 
skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas.  
The investigator will assess the BSA  affected by psoriasis for each subject at every  study visit.  
Local skin reactions will be evaluated and potential AEs will be assessed  at every study visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination will be performed every 8 weeks during the study (ie, at Baseline and 
Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52). Blood samples will be collected  for complete blood count with 
differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry  at Screening and Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential, will undergo  urine and serum pregnanc y testing at s creening , 
and urine pregnancy testing will be performed at b aseline prior to randomization and at all study visits 
other than Week 2 . 
Subjects who discontinue study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 52 assessments, 
as appropriate, prior to commencem ent of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects 
who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or other AEs will be instructed to follow  up with their primary care physician, if indicate d. If any subject has an 
AE during the study , the subject will be follow  by the investigator until resolution (return to normal or to 
the baseline state) or stabilization, as d etermined by the investigator.  
In addition  to the above, application of study drug may be delayed or halted at any time if ongoing safety 
data evaluations (including reports of local skin reactions, such as skin atrophy, or severe AE s) raise 
concern for subject safety. If subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor in conjunction with the investigator to determine a course of action.  
Number of subjects  planned:  
Approxi mately 500 subjects in order to retain at least 300 subjects for 6 months and 100 subjects for 
1 year.  
Inclusion  criteria :  
1. Male or female, of any race, at least 18 years of age. 
2. Freely provides both verbal and written informed consent.

 Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
• IGA, assessed at every study visit  
Safety:  
• AEs, assessed at every study visit  
• Clinical laboratory parameters (chemistry and hematology), assessed at S creening and Weeks 4, 
8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52  
• Abbreviated physical examination findings, evaluated at b aseline, and Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 
48, and 52 
• Local skin reactions, assessed at b aseline and all subsequent study visits  
Statistical methods:  
All subjects who receive at least 1 confirmed dose of study drug, and have at least 1  postbaseline safety 
assessment will be included in the safety analysis set. All analyses will be made using the safety analysis 
set. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to present the data. Summaries of continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Summaries of ca tegorical 
variables will include the sample size, frequency count, and percentage.  
Investigator’s Global Assessment  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the assessment of efficacy. The number and percentage of subjects who achieve treatment success at the Week 8 study visit will be tabulated.  
Adverse Events  
The AE analysis will be tabulated in a manner which provides information about the incidence of AE’s 
for the entire treatment period as well as information by quarter to understand the evolu tion of AE’s over 
time. Thus, in addition to the AE analysis over the entire 12 -month treatment time, results will be 
presented for the first, second, and third 12- week period , which approximates a quarterly analysis. The 
analysis for the remaining period will be approximately 4 weeks longer than the first three quarters.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment -emergent adverse  events 
(TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study drug application, will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, 
and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by severity or relationship to study drug, each 
subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug.  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject and will include a 
verbatim description of the event as reported by the investigator, as well as the preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, action taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, outcome,  and relationship to the study drug. In addition, a listing of subjects who 
prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of subjects who reported an SAE.  
Local Skin Reactions  
The frequency of local skin reactions including itching, dryness, burning /stinging, skin atrophy, striae, 
telangiectasia , and folliculitis will be summarized by visit. Additionally, the percent of subjects who 
experience a local skin reaction (itching, dr yness, and burning /stinging) graded at a score of 3 at any 
point in the study following the first application of study drug will be tabulated.

 Safety Laboratory Values  
Changes from baseline in safety laboratory values will be summarized with descriptive statistics at all 
applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values. Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used to determine the shifts. A listing of all out -of-
range laboratory test results at any assessment time point will also be provided. Determination of clinical 
significance for all out -of-range laboratory values will be made by each investigator and included in the 
listing. In addition, a listing of all clinically significant laboratory test results will be provided.  
Concomitant Medications  
All previous therapies and concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology from the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. Previous therapies and concomitant medications data will be presented in data listings.  
Sample size calculations:  
The sample size selected for this study is expected to provide sufficient data for a long- term safety 
evaluation of IDP -118 Lotion when used by adult subjects with plaque psoriasis.

 5 Introduction  
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune mediated disease, and varies widely in its clinical expression. 
Disease severity ranges from mild (limited number of plaques) to very severe. Characteristic features of psoriasis include hyperproliferation of epidermal cells associated with dermal/epidermal inflammation, resulting in sharply demarcated red plaques, which may be covered by silvery scales affecting the skin and scalp.  
There are presently no curative treatments for psoriasis. Treatment options focus on relieving 
symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. Patient age, severity of disease, and the type and extent of body surface area (BSA) involvement are considerations in selecting therapy. 
Topical therapies are used in all disease severities, but may be impractical when psoriasis 
involves a large BSA. The mainstay of psoriasis treatment is topical corticosteroids, which range in potency from superpotent to low potency (Class I to VII, respectively). Generally, the more potent corticosteroids are required for effective management of psoriasis.  
IDP-118 (tazarotene 0.045% and halobetasol propionate 0.01%) Lotion is being developed 
for once daily treatment of plaque psoriasis. The current study is designed to obtain long-term safety data for IDP -118 Lotion when used over the course of a 1- year period  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the long- term safety of IDP -118 Lotion following 
once daily, 8-week treatment courses in subjects with plaque psoriasis followed for up to 1 year. Subjects will receive treatment courses as needed during the year to manage their 
plaque psoriasis with the following safety endpoint evaluations being conducted: 
• The percentage of subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, dryness, and 
burning/stinging) graded at a level of 3 at any point in the study following the first 
application of study drug 
• Changes from baseline in all safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements as 
summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group and study visit  
• Occurrences of new and ongoing adverse events (AE s). Descriptions of AEs will 
include the dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), maximum severity, 
seriousness, action taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and investigator’s assessment of causality  
• The number of treatment co urses administered over the year of observation

 7 Investigational Plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, open label study of the long- term safety of IDP -118 Lotion in subjects 
with plaque psoriasis. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least 18 years of age 
and have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( defined as an 
Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4).  
Approximately 500 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be  entered into the study 
with the intent that at least 300 subjects will be followed for 6 months and at least 
100 subjects will be followed for up to 1 year. All enrolled subjects will receive IDP-118 Lotion to be applied once daily for 8 weeks and then as needed once daily as assessed in 4-week periods for up to 1 year. 
Two containers of the IDP-118 Lotion will be dispensed to each subject at b aseline. The 
study drug will be applied topically to the affected areas (as determined by the investigator at 
baseline) with the initial application being made by the subject per instruction from the study staff. Subjects will apply their treatments at home once daily as explained by the study coordinator or designee at each investigational center. All subjects will b e instructed to avoid 
exposure to direct sunlight, artificial ultraviolet light sources, and to wear protective clothing to prevent sunburn. 
Following the initial 8 -week treatment period, subjects will be evaluated for treatment 
success, defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the IGA. Subjects who achieve a treatment success at 
Week 8 will receive no further treatment and will be re -evaluated 4 weeks later at Week 12. 
Subjects who do not achieve a treatment success at Week 8 will receive an additional 4 weeks of once daily therapy and will also be re- evaluated at Week 12. At Week 12, the 
subject should have at least a 1 grade improvement from baseline to continue in the study. This 4 -week evaluation/treatment cycle may continue for up to 1 year (ie, subjects will be 
evaluated every 4 weeks and subjects who achieve treatment success will receive no treatment until the next 4- week evaluation visit and subjects who do not achieve treatment 
success will receive once daily tr eatment until the next evaluation visit). If a subject remains 
on treatment after Week 12 by meeting the criteria of at least a 1 grade improvement, then at Week 24 , after continuous treatment, they must have an IGA score equating to “Clear” or 
Almost Clea r” to continue on study or they will be considered a failed treatment . Subjects 
who achieve a treatment success at any visit may undergo periods of non- treatment. The 
minimum continuous treatment exposure will be (the first) 8 weeks and the maximum continuous treatment exposure may be up to but no more than 24 weeks.   Subjects who 
continue past the Week 24 visit will be monitored to ensure treatment exposure does not exceed 24 consecutive weeks .

 The subjects will be evaluated at Screening (Day -35 to Day -1), Baseline (Day 0), and 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52. The IGA and percent of body 
surface area involvement (BSA)  will be performed at every study visit.  
At all post-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52) the subjects will be asked to return their containers of study drug and will have their treatment compliance evaluated as  applicable.  The study coordinator or designee at each 
investigational center will dispense new containers  of study drug to the subject at each post-
baseline study visit (ie, at Week 2, Week 4, and any subsequent study visit at which the subject did not achieve treatment success). During the study, subjects will be allowed to use investigator  approved non- medi cated cleansers , moisturizers  and sunscreens ; no other skin 
care products will be permitted on the treatment areas.  
Local skin reactions will be evaluated and potential AEs will be assessed  at every study visit. 
An abbreviated physical examination will be performed every 8 weeks during the study (ie, at Baseline and Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52). Blood samples will be collected for complete blood count with differential (CB C/Diff) and  serum chemistry at S creening and 
Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. All female sub jects of childbearing potential will 
undergo both urine and serum pregnancy testing at screening , and urine pregnancy testing 
will be performed at baseline and at all s tudy visits other than Week 2. 
Subjects who discontinue study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 52 assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or AEs will be instructed to follow  up with the investigator and/or their 
primary care physician, if  indicated. If any subject has an AE during the treatment period, the 
subject will be followed -up by the investigator until resolution (return to normal or to the 
baseline state) or stabilization, as determined by the investigator.  
In addition to the above , application of study drug may be delayed or halted at any time if 
ongoing safety data evaluations (including reports of local skin reactions, such as skin atrophy, or severe AEs) raise concern for subject safety. If subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor in conjunction with 
the investigator to determine a course of action.

for the study. 
8.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Reasons for withdrawal may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Psoriasis flare, as determined by the investigator, which requires treatment with a 
disallowed therapy . 
• Local skin reactions that are known to be drug- related AEs , which could raise 
concern for subject safety, as per the investigator. If subject participation is 
suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor in conjunction with the investigator to determine a course of action. 
• Either at the investigator's request, for tolerability reasons ( e.g., severe adverse 
reaction s), or at the subject’s request. 
• When the requirements of the protocol are not followed. 
• When a concomitant therapy likely to interfere with the results of the study is 
reported, or required by the subject (the investigators will report all such information 
on the source documents/case report forms and decide, in accordance with the sponsor, whether the subject is to be withdrawn). 
• When a subject is lost to follow up, t he investigators  will try twice to reach the 
subject by telephone and will send a follow up letter by certified mail before considering that the subject is lost to follow up. These actions will be reported on the End of Study CRF and a copy of the follow up letter will be  mainta ined in the 
investigator's file . 
All premature discontinuations and their reasons must be carefully documented by the investigator on the final CRF, and, if need be, on the AE form. In any case, no subject who has been included and has a study number assigned can be replaced by another if they discontinue pr ematurely for whatever reason. All data gathered on the subject prior to 
termination will be made available to the sponsor.  
Reasons for study completion/discontinuation as listed on the f inal r eport form are defined as 
follows: 
Normal Study Completion  – Subject completes the s tudy as planned in the protocol 
Adverse Event  – Complete  AE form

 Subject Request  – Consent withdrawal, subject moved, schedule conflicts 
Protocol Violation  – Contact the Sponsor or designee before making decision  
Lost to Follow Up  – Document with 2 phone calls and a certified letter  
Pregnancy  – Subject will discontinue study drug immediately, but will be followed to 
term. Complete pregnancy form 
Worsening Condition  – Subject requires alternate treatment for psoriasis before the end 
of the study and the investigator determines it is not due to lack of efficacy  
Lack of Efficacy  – Subject requires alternate treatment for psoriasis after at least 2 weeks 
of study drug treatment and the risk of continuing the subject in the study outweighs the 
benefit as  determined by the investigator  Subject is deemed a failed treatment; defined as 
either not having at least a 1 grade improvement at Week 12 or having received  up to 24 
weeks of continuous study drug  treatment and not exhibiting an IGA score equat ing to 
“Clear” or “Almost Clear.” 
Other – Specify i n comments section of final CRF 
For subjects who discontinue early during the treatment period, all procedures outlined f or 
the E arly T ermination (ET)  visit ( i.e., Week 52) should be completed at the time of 
discontinuation. The appropriate source document should be completed in addition to the 
End of Study CRF.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participating in this s tudy at any time and for whatever 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. No constraints will be placed on 
ordinary subject management, and subjects, when appropriate, will be placed on other conventional therapy upon request or whenever c linically necessary as determined by their 
physician.  
9 Treatment  Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
All subjects will receive open  label IDP -118 Lotion. The study drug will be applied topically, 
once daily, for 8 weeks and then, as needed  and assessed at  4-week visit intervals  over the 
course of the 1-year study duration. 
9.2 Randomization and Blinding

CONFIDENTIAL  
23 
 9.3 Concomitant Medications  
Any concomitant therapy stopped for washout as indicated below is to be recorded. As noted 
in the exclusion criteria, concurrent use of lithium or Plaquenil during the study is prohibited. In addition, there are mandatory washout periods and restrictions during the study for the use of the following: 
• Topical antipsoriatic drug product within 14 days prior to the Baseline visit 
• Phototherapy (including laser), photochemotherapy, or non-biologic systemic 
psoriasis therapy (such as newer oral psoriasis medications (eg Otezla), sys temic 
corticosteroids, methotrexate, retinoids, or cyclosporine) within 4 weeks prior to the 
Baseline visit  
• Immunomodulatory therapy (biologics) known to affect psoriasis within 3 months of 
the Baseline visit 
• Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sou rces of ultraviolet radiation within 
4 weeks prior to the Baseline  visit  
Any subjects using concomitant therapies that could interfere with the interpretation of study 
results during the course of the study (including but not limited to those listed above) should not be withdrawn, but the use of the product should be discontinued. Only investigator approved non- medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens are allowed in the treatment 
areas; n o other skin care products  will be permitted  on the study.  
Information on concomitant therapies will be recorded in the Concomitant T herapy source 
document. Any therapy used by the subject will be considered concomitant medication or therapy (eg,  aspirin, Tylenol, birth control pills, vitamins, moisturizers, sunscreens). Every 
attempt should be made to keep concomitant therapy dosing constant during the study. Any change to concomitant therapy should be noted on the Concomitant Therapy source document and CRF.  
9.4 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will complete a diary to record treatment compliance and to specifically note any 
missed doses of study drug. All subjects will be instructed as to the proper treatment procedure, will receive their first application of study drug at the investigational center, and will be reminded at Weeks 2 and 4 during the initial 8-week application period to apply the study drug as instructed. As necessary throughout the study, the subjects will undergo subsequent 4- week visit intervals and will be assessed for additional treatment periods. The 
treatment application procedure will be reviewed during every study visi t at which study 
drug is dispensed and treatment compliance will be recorded during every study visit at which study drug is collected. In all cases, the study drug will be weighed prior to dispensing

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 02 November 2015   
CONFIDENTIAL  
24 
 and will be re-weighed upon collection. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and 
unused study drug containers to each applicable study visit. 
9.5 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
The investigators must read the protocol thoroughly and must follow the instructions exactly. 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the sponsor and the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and agreed to by the investigator. Deviations usually have an impact on individual patients or a small group of patients and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria.  
A protocol violation occurs when there is non- adherence to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the patient,  when the patient or investigator has failed to adhere 
to significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the patient was 
enrolled without prior sponsor approval, or when there is non- adherence to the United States 
Food and Drug Admini stration ( FDA ) regulations and/or the International Conference on 
Harmonization ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the patients’ source documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required. 
10 Study D rug Materials and Management  
The study drug  will be dispensed by an appropriately qualified member of the study staff 
assigned by the investigator to this task .

with excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
10.1.3 Administration  
The investigational center staff member will instruct the subject on the proper application 
procedure of the study drug to the affected treatment areas identified at the Baseline visi t by 
the investigator. Subjects will be instructed to squeeze a small amount of study drug (about the size of a pea) onto a fingertip and then spread a thin layer of the study drug over the 
affected treatment area. If necessary, additional pea-sized amounts of study drug may be 
applied in increments to cover all affected treatment areas as designated by the investigator.  
The study drug should be applied as a thin layer of study drug to the entire selected treatment area(s) (3%-12% BSA) as indicated on the body diagram. Subjects will be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to direct sunlight, and artificial ultraviolet light sources while in the 
study and to wash their hands before and after application of the study drug.

 Following the initial 8 -week treatment period, subjects will be evaluated for treatment 
success, defined as a score of 0  or 1 on the IGA. Subjects who achieve a treatment success at 
Week 8 will receive no further treatment and will be re -evaluated 4 weeks later at Week 12. 
Subjects who do not achieve a treatment success at Week 8 will receive an additional 4 
weeks of once daily therapy and will also be re- evaluated at Week 12. This 4 -week 
evaluation /treatment cycle may continue for up to 1 year, as applicab le, based on  
achievement of treatment success. . Subjects who ac hieve a treatment success at a visit may 
not necessarily achieve a treatment success at a subsequent visit, and may undergo periods of non-treatment. The minimum continuous treatment exposure w ill be (the first) 8 weeks and 
the maximum continuous treatment exposure may be up to but no more than 24 weeks.  
Subjects who continue after Week 24 will be monitored to ensure continued treatment exposure is within the maximum allowable window. 
Prior to d ispensing study drug, each subject will receive both verbal and written instructions 
regarding proper dosing and study drug application technique. The study coordinator or 
designee will demonstrate the amount of drug to use daily and the method of application at the Baseline visit as described in Appendix 17.1. Subjects will apply their daily treatments at home, except on the day of the Baseline visit. At this visit, the study drug will be applied by the subject at the investigational center.  
Subjects will be instructed on the importance of returning their study drug container at each subsequent study visit as applicable. Subjects who do not return their study drug containers will be instructed to do so as soon as possible. Upon return, the study coordinator or designee will weigh each container (with the cap on) and question the subject on the history of study drug use since the Baseline visit. The study coordinator or designee will assess the amount of remaining study drug relative to the application area in order to judge the subject’s compliance with applying the study drug. Any missed applications of study drug will be noted in the appropriate source document. 
10.2 Study Drug Accountability  
Upon receipt of the study drug, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
designated study coordinator or designee will conduct a complete inventory of study materials and assume responsibility for their storage and dispensing. In accordance with federal regulations, the investigators must agree to keep all study materials in a secure location with restricted access. The investigator will keep a record of the inventory and dispensing of all study drug. This record will be made available to the sponsor’s monitor for the purpose of accounting for all clinical supplies. Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must b e recorded with an explanation.

 All supplies sent to the investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Each container will be weighed (with the cap on) before dispensing to and upon return by the subjects, and weights will be recorded on the required source documents, logs and appropriate CRF. All used and unused supplies will be returned to sponsor/designee for destruction at the conclusion of the study.

11.2 Evaluation of Efficacy 
This is study is not intended to assess efficacy, but rather the IGA is included to determine 
the need for treatment (in accord ance with the entry criteria) and subsequent re- treatment 
after the initial 8 -week course and any subsequent 4- week courses, if applicable. The IGA 
will be reported at every study visit.  
The IGA is based on a 5- point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), and will be assessed 
by the evaluator at each visit for the overall affected areas with plaque psoriasis. The face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae and intertriginous areas are to be excluded in this assessment. The scores shown in Table 2 will be used to describe the severity of overall p soriasis of the 
treatable areas.  
Table 2: Investigator’s Global Assessment Scale  
Grade  Score  Description  
Clear  0 No evidence of scaling; 
No evidence of erythema;  
No evidence of plaque elevation above normal skin level  
Almost 
Clear  1 Some plaques with fine scales;  
Faint pink/light red erythema on most plaques; 
Slight or barely perceptible elevation of plaques above normal skin level  
Mild  2 Most to all plaques have some fine scales but are not fully covered, some 
plaques are completely covered with fine scale;  
Most to all plaques are pink/light red to bright red in color;  
Some plaques have definite elevation above normal skin level, typically 
with edges that are indistinct and sloped on some of the plaques  
Moderate 3 Some plaques are at least partially covered with a coarse scale, most to all plaques are nearly covered with fine or course scale;  
Most to all plaques are bright red, some plaque may be dark red in color; Definite elevation of most to all plaques; rounded or sloped edges on 
most of the plaques  
Severe  4 Most to all plaques are covered with coarse, thick scales;  
Most or all plaques are bright, dark or dusky red; Almost all plaques are raised and well -demarcated; sharp edges on 
virtually all plaques  
 
At all study visits, the  investigator will also assess the percent BSA affected by psoriasis for 
each subject at each visit. All areas affected by psoriasis (3% -12%, inclusive, of BSA) are to 
be treated with study drug. Affected areas of the face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae, and 
intertriginous areas will be excluded in the determination of total area affected by psoriasis, and these reg ions will not be included in the treatment areas.

 11.3 Evaluation of Safety 
11.3.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign, symptom, clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. The collection of nonserious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs)  should begin following the subject's 
completion of the consent process to participate in the study. 
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by the maximum severity of the AE. 
The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs: 
• Mild:  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
• Moderate:  Mild to modera te limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; 
no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
• Severe:  Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required; hospitalization or prolongation of current 
hospitalization possible; may be incapacitating or life threatening  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either “Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be taken into account when assessi ng SAE 
causality:  
• Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn 
and the SAE resolved or the event recurred after re introduction 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an und erlying or 
concomitant illness  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy  
• No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists  
• If the AE is directly related to study procedures  or there is a lack of efficacy

37 
 11.3.1.1 Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or nonserious. An SAE or serious adverse reaction 
is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective surgery for a baseline condition is not considered an AE) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and must be reported to sponsor/designee within 24 hours of your awareness of the event.  
11.3.1.2 Pregnancy  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug , in a manner 
such that risk of contraceptive failure is minimized. Abstinence is allowed as a birth control method. 
Before enrolling a female subject of childbearing potential in this clinical trial, the 
investigator must review the following information about study participation: 
• Informed consent requirements 
• Contr aceptives in current use 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment. 
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact 
the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual period).

38 
 If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
enrollment, the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be submitted to the sponsor/designee, initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.  
11.3.1.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the study. Adverse events should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by the investigator or reported by the subject at each study visit.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit 
must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered drug- related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by the study site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject, will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropri ate CRF:  
• Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset date and end date 
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Corrective treatment, if given  
• Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded.  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor/designee within 24 hours of site notification to comply with regulatory requirements.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 02 November 2015   
CONFIDENTIAL  
39 
 All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to study drug, must be immediately reported by 
telephone or confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written SAE report form signed by the investigator within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
The fax number fo r reporting an SAE is: 
 
 
       
    
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Sponsor/designee of an SAE. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospital records and autopsy reports should be provided to Sponsor/designee as soon as they are available. Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to investigational product) that occurs within 30 days after stopping the study drug, the SAE must be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, 
notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow up will continue after the subject has left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by the sponsor. 
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not 
reported in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or severity.  
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document (Investigator Brochure or Package Insert) and are related (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study product. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory reporting agency(ies). Sponsor/designee will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs and all participating investigative sites in writing for investigator submission to the IRB/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the Investigator Brochure (ie, “15 day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.

 11.3.2 Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory analyses  (hematology and chemistry)  will be conducted on blood samples 
collected from subjects at Screening and Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. All results 
will be reported, including results that are abnormal. Clinically significant results, in the opinion of the investigator, should be reported as AEs. If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of the test must be obtained by the investigative site and filed in the subject’s documentation. 
11.3.3 Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A medical history will be taken at Screening, and confirmed and revised if needed, at 
Baseline. Medical histories having resolved 2 or more years before Baseline need not be 
collected unless considered relevant by the investigator.  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of weight and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and oral temperature) will be performed at 
Baseline, and Weeks 8 , 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. Height will be measured at Baseline only.  
Any abnormal physical exam findings will be recorded. 
11.3.4 Local Skin Reactions  
Tolerability will be evaluated at baseline and all postbaseline study visits through 
assessments of selected local signs and symptoms (itching, dryness, burning/stinging). 
Additionally , at each study visit, the investigator will examine the treatment areas f or the 
presence or absence of significant known drug- related AEs  (skin atrophy, striae, 
telangiectasia, and folliculitis ). Any local skin reaction that requires the use of a concomitant 
therapy or is a cause for study drug interruption or discontinuation should be reported as an AE. The scales to be used for assessing local skin reactions are presented in Table 3.

 12.1 Analysis of Effi cacy 
This is study is not intended to assess efficacy, but rather the IGA is included to determine 
the need for treatment (in accordance with the entry criteria) and subsequent re- treatment 
after the initial 8-week course and any subsequent 4- week courses, if applicable. Certain 
efficacy data and endpoints will, however, be summarized. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the assessm ent of efficacy . The number and 
percentage of subjects who achieve treatment success at the W eek 8  study visit will be  
tabulated .  
Additionally, the number of weeks required for subjects to achieve their first score of clear or 
almost clear will be presented in a frequency table.  
The number of weeks between times when the subject is not medicating will also be presented in a frequency table. This analysis assumes that a subject is not medicating because they achieved a satisfactory evaluation of their psoriasis. The number of weeks will first be averaged by subject and that score will  be entered into the frequency tabulation. Appropriate 
tabulation brackets of time will be chosen, as appropriate. 
12.2 Analysis of Safety  
12.2.1 Adverse Events  
The AE analysis will be tabulated in a manner which provides information about the 
incidence of AE’s for th e entire treatment period as well as information by quarter to 
understand the evolution of AE’s over time. Thus, in addition to the AE analysis over the entire 12 -month treatment time, results will be presented for the first, second, and third 
12-week peri od, which approximates a quarterly analysis. The analysis for the remaining 
period will be approximately 4 weeks longer than the first three quarters.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study drug application, will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, syste m organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. When 
summarizing TEAEs by severity or relationship to study drug, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the great est 
severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug.

 All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject and will 
include a verbatim description of the event as reported by the investigator, as well as the preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, action taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and relationship to the study drug. In addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of subjects who reported an SA E. 
12.2.2 Laboratory Tests 
Changes from baseline in safety laboratory values will be summarized with descriptive statistics at all applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values. Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used to determine the shifts. A listing of all out-of- range laboratory test results at any assessment 
time point will also be provided. Determination of clinical significance for all out-of- range 
laboratory values will be made by each investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clinically significant laboratory test results will be provided.  
12.2.3 Local Skin Reactions 
The frequency of local skin reactions including itching, dryness, burning /stinging , skin 
atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and folliculitis  will be summarized by visit. Additionally, the 
percent of subjects who experience a local skin reaction  (itching, dryness, and 
burning /stinging) graded at a score of 3 at any point in the study following the fir st 
application of study drug will be tabulated. 
12.2.4 Concomitant Medications  
All previous therapies and concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology 
from the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. Previous therapies and concomitant medications data will be presented in data listings.  
12.3 Subject  Disposition  
A tabulation of subject disposition will be provided. The tabulation will include the numbers of subjects who enter the study, complete the study, complete 6 months and 12 months of the study, and discontinue the study. The reasons for discontinuation will be included. 
12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for the  safety analysis set as defined in Section 12.8.1.

 17 Appendices  
17.1 Subject Instruction Sheet  
A thin layer of study drug should be applied once daily at about the same time each day over 
the affected treatment areas indicated by the investigator.  As a reminder, the face, scalp, axillae (armpit) and intertriginous (skinfold) areas will be excluded.  
Specifically, subjects will squeeze a small amount of study drug (about the size of a pea) 
onto a fingertip and then spread a thin layer of the study dr ug over the affected treatment 
area. If necessary, additional pea-sized amounts of study drug may be applied in increments (one pea size gently rubbed over a treatment area at a time) to cover all affected treatment areas.  
The amount of study drug used will be monitored by weighing each newly dispensed study drug container and weighing each returned study drug container at all applicable study visits. 
Be sure to wash your hands after you apply the product (unless the study doctor has 
instructed you to treat your palms).  
Reminders:  
• On study visit days please wait until after your study assessments are 
completed before application of the study drug or any approved moisturizers. Any retraining can be provided by site staff, if needed.  
• Avoid contact with the eyes, inside the nose, mouth and all mucous membranes.  
• THE TEST MATERIAL SHOULD BE USED ONLY BY THE PERSON FOR WHOM IT WAS PRESCRIBED and it should be kept out of the reach of children or others of limited capacity to read or understand. 
Store this at room temperat ure 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) with excursions permitted between 15°C 
to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).  
Containers of test material must be returned to the study facility, even if they are empty.  
Be sure to complete the study drug diary calendar each day to document applications and also note 
any missed doses; and bring the completed diary to each study visit. 
Continue to use the same study doctor approved  non- medicated  cleansers, moisturizers and 
sunscreens throughout the study.  Avoid or minimize unnecessary sun exposure.  Also for additional 
ultraviolet protection , use protective clothing , such as long sleeved shirts and broad brimmed hats , as 
needed . 
It is important that you inform the stud y site about any medications (ie , prescriptions, over -the-
counter medications, street drugs, or herbal medications) that you have taken during the study. 
If you have any questions or have a potential research -related side effect or injury you may contact

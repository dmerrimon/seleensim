Sublingual Estradiol Versus Oral Estradiol in Transgender Women  
Protocol Summary  
Primary aim. To establish the pharmacokinetics of sublingual estradiol versus oral 
estradiol.  
Secondary aim. To compare estradiol by LC -MS/MS to estradiol by immunoassay.  
Design: To illuminate the pharmacokinetic parameters of sublingual estradiol in transgender 
women, a pilot crossover study will be cond ucted. Ten participants, transgender male -to-female 
patients who are naïve to hormone therapy, will be recruited from the Medical College of 
Wisconsin’s Inclusion Health Clinic.  
Methods: Each participant will be dosed with 1 mg oral estradiol. Blood will be drawn via a 
percutaneous intravenous catheter at hours 0,1,2,3,4,6,8. A wash -out period of at least one 
week will allow for complete clearance of the exogenous oral estradiol before testing the 
pharmacokinetics of sublingual estradiol 1 mg on the same t en patients in the same manner. 
Estradiol and estrone by LC -MS/MS will be measured , as well as estradiol by immunoassay . 
These will be sent to ARUP.

11 2 Background 
2.1.1  Device Preclinical Experience  
 
G-Tech Medical has developed a noninvasive wireless patch system that measures 
electrical activity from the gastrointestinal smooth muscles on the abdominal surface.   
 2.1.2  Device Clinical Experience 
 
This technology has been studied as part of several non- significant risk IRB approved 
studies in both adults and pediatric populations to evaluate the patterns of gastrointestinal 
myoelectrical signals following surgery.
20–22 The studies demonstrate that  signals measured 
by the G -Tech Wireless patches correlate with clinical markers of postoperative recovery 
such as time to feeding and time to flatus following pancreaticoduodenectomy and general 
abdominal surgeries respectively. The study in patients undergoing 
pancreaticoduodenectomy procedures was conducted in collaboration with researchers at 
Stanford University.20 The study demonstrated that measurement of gastric activity  
beginning immediately after pancreaticoduodenectomy with the G -Tech Wireless Patch 
System, based on the measured spectral peak near 3 cpm, c ould d istinguish patients with 
shorter or longer times to diet readiness. The study demonstrated the potential utility of the G-Tech Patch System in providing objective data to identify patients who are progressing as 
well as, or better than expected, and those who are at risk for delayed gastric emptying.  In 
another open, prospective study , researchers  examined the use of the G -Tech Wireless 
Patch System in predicting time to first flatus  by looking at colonic myoelectrical activity 
following general abdominal s urgeries .
21 Patients with early flatus had stronger early colonic 
activity than patients with late flatus. At 36 h post -surgery, a linear fit of time to flatus vs 
cumulative colonic myoelectrical activity predicted first flatus as much as 5 days (± 22 h) before occurrence.   
 
 
2.2 Background/prevalence of research topic  
 Gastrointestinal recovery after any visceral surgery is a complex dynamic process with 
multiple factors ranging from complexity of the surgery, degree of bowel handling and preoperative comorbidities affecting whether the recovery happens over few days, or is a 
slow prolonged affair lasting weeks.
1 Delays in the gastrointestinal recovery process or ileus 
is accompanied by distention of the abdomen, pain, nausea, vomiting and the inability to 
tolerate oral feeding.2,3 Interventions to alleviate the ileus /distention include insertion or 
reinsertion of a nasogastric tube, instating nil per os  and, if necessitated, parenteral

12 nutrition.4  All of these factors contribute not only to patient discomfort, but extend length of 
stay (LOS), increase hospital resource utilization and thereby add to overall costs.5–7   
 
Clinically, the markers of gastrointestinal recovery are noted by passage of flatus, defecation 
and the ability to tolerate solid food without significant nausea and vomiting.8 Passage of 
stool or flatus - considered a surrogate for intestinal and anastomotic continuity - is often 
used as the trigger to start stepwise dietary orders with the patient’s ability to tolerate each step marking their readiness for the subsequent meal.  Fast -track  and Enhanced Recovery 
After Surgery (ERAS)  programs that promote early feeding in advance of these clinical 
markers , along with opioid sparing techniques and use of minimally invasive procedures 
have been shown to be safe and beneficial for many patients by demonstrating earlier recovery and shorter length of stay.
9–11 However, it has also been shown that, for as many 
as 25% of cases, the strategy does not work as noted earlier, with the need for  reinsertion of 
the nasogastric tube and reinstating nil per os status.  In a recent study of 513 consecutive 
colorectal patients who were on an ERAS protocol, 128 patients (24.7%) needed postoperative reinsertion of nasogastric tube at the 3.9±2.9 postoperative day.
9 This 
suggests that, while early postoperative feeding is beneficial to patients in whom recovery is on track, it does not work in cases where patients  are not ready for it.   
 
At present, there is no reliable measurement that can predict gastrointestinal recovery/diet readiness for patients in advance of these clinical markers that may allow for interventions or fast-track programs to facilitate timely recovery. Auscultation for return of bowel sounds, long 
part of the standard of care, is controversial in its usefulness to indicate recovery. Bowel 
sounds have shown to have poor correlation with flatus/defecation and have proved 
unsuccessful in guiding diet interventions.
12,13  
 
Smooth muscle electrical activity on the other hand is directly related to gastrointestinal 
function and motility. Researchers have previously shown a 1:1 correlation between 
electrical and mechanical (contractile) events in the colon with internally placed electrode-strain gauge force transducers.
14–16 Electrical activity in the colon has been reported across 
a wide range of frequencies ranging from 0 to 40 cycles per min (cpm)).17 Condon et. al have 
documented the progressive return of colonic electrical related to resolution of postoperative 
ileus and clinical recovery following surgery.18,19 These measurements have been performed 
using electrodes placed internally during surgery, a major impediment towards broader use 
of such technology.

13 3 Rationale/Signific ance 
3.1 Problem Statement  
GI functional recovery after surgery is unpredictable and contributes to increased length of 
stay and postoperative readmissions for ileus.  
 
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact  
The purpose of the Phase 1 study  is to determine i f the my oelectrical measurements made 
by the G -Tech Wireless Patch System correlate with clinical markers of postoperative 
recovery such as passage of flatus/bowel movement, oral tolerance of diet and discharge 
readiness.  Subsequently the data will be studied to establish which information in the signals 
is important in determining when to feed patients  and possibly discharge them.  
 
These pilot prospective, open clinical studies  suggests that myoelectrical activity, measured 
on the abdominal surface with a noninvasive wireless patch system, carries predictive value 
in determining time to feeding and time to flatus following open abdominal surgery. Having 
such information in advance of clinical measures could facilitate timely interventions, be it 
early feeding or delaying feeding as dictated by the patient’s unique recovery profile.  The G-
Tech Wireless P atch System would provide a unique insight into the process allowing for a 
tailored protocol that could improve patient satisfaction and optimize recovery. The system  
could also enable feedback on the impact to the overall gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity 
of medications, particularly opioids, used for pain management that are known to inhibit 
gastrointestinal function by disrupting the normal recovery patterns o f colonic motility.23–25 
While it remains to be seen, in addition to predicting time to flatus/bowel movement early on, 
the ability to continue monitoring the patient may allow one to predict onset of secondary complications, such as wound infections or anastomotic leaks, that are associated with ileus.  
Although not part of this protocol, given the wireless noninvasive nature of the system the patients could be discharged home with the patches, whereby they would serve as a remote monitoring tool. This could be particularly useful in cases where the patients may have been 
discharged early and may be at a high risk for readmission. The system would then send updates/alerts to the care team for management and potentially avoid preventable 
readmissions.  
 
 
3.2.1  Potential Risks  
 
The risks associated with the G -Tech Patch System are related with the use of the G -
Tech Patch (electrical risks, skin allergy or chemical) and the export  of the data  
(anonymized data sent to G tech) .

19 Data analysis algorithms process the uploaded data to measure and report myoelectrical 
motor activity levels for the stomach and intestines. These measurements will be made 
available to the study investigators to identify correlations between return and patterns of 
myoelectrical activity with time to feeding and discharge. Patients do not have 
independent access to either the raw data or calculated results except as shared with 
them by t heir physician.  
 
 
 
 6.1.2  Device Administration and Schedule  
The G -Tech patches will be placed on patient post -operatively following surgery either in the 
Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) or in their hospital room, within 4 hours of being 
transported out of the operating room. Research staff will activate three (3) G -Tech patches 
and pair them with the G -Tech App on an iPhone 7 (provided). The patches will be 
periodically sending the data to the paired iPhone 7, which will remain by the patient’s 
bedside until discharge. The G -Tech Patches are intended to run continuously for up to 6 
days  and have been shown to run continuously for up to 14 days in pilot testing. The patient , 
caregiver  or staff member shall record activities such as first solid meal, first fla tus, first 
bowel movement on the easy -to-use iPhone app during the patients stay. The inpatient 
physician- led team will also remind the patient to enter information into the app daily. The 
recorded events and gut myoelectrical activity are transferred wirelessly via the paired iPhone to the cloud.  The Patches shall be replaced as needed. All p atches are removed 
before patient is discharged.

6.3.2  Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained using the documents reviewed and approved by the Yale 
IRB of the participant or their legally authorized representative. The process will be managed 
with the patient by a non -clinician member of the study team to avoid undue influence or 
coercion. The patient will be able to review the electronic informed consent document in the place and time of their own choosing.  
 
6.3.3  Screening  
Patients will be treated according to standard of care. The study team will perform a daily 
review of postings by colorectal surgeons included on this proposal (Longo, Reddy, Pantel, 
Mongiu, and Leeds).  Eligibility criteria used to review these postings will be accessible in the 
patient’s electronic medical recor d.  
 
6.3.4  Enrollment  
Patients will be recruited by a non -clinician member of the study team by telephone. This 
device study represents low -risk. Informed consent will be obtained preoperatively  by 
telephone. Patients will verbally hear a scripted consent by a member of the study team and 
be asked for their assent. If they agree, they will be electronically emailed a unique single-use REDCap link to complete the e- consent which will include the scripted paragraph heard 
earlier as well as all necessary consent components.   
6.3.5  On Study Visits  
Electronic informed consent – Average read time 10 minutes. Patients will be consented in

6.3.6  End of Study and Follow -up 
End of study will be discharge of the patient and removal of patches, or early withdrawal by 
patient or clinician request.  
30-days after discharge each patient’s electronic medical record will be reviewed for 
documentation of primary and secondary end points and entered into a REDCap database.  
6.3.7  Removal of subjects  
During the study, it is possible that study subjects may be withdrawn from the study.  If a 
withdrawal is related to the study procedure causing an adverse event, a Study Termination Form will be completed for each subject withdrawal.  Factors that may lead to a withdrawal 
from the study may include, but are not limited to the following:  
 
Subject Withdrawal  
At any time, a study subject may voluntarily withdraw from the study.  This withdrawal will not 
affect their future medical treatment or benefits.   
 
Physician Decision/Medical Decision  
Should a physician decide that the requirements of the protocol are detrimental to the health 
and welfare of the study subject, the study subject may be withdrawn from this study.  The reason for the decision will be documented in the case report form. If the subject is found to not be wearing the device in its proscribed fashion and the data cannot be interpreted in its intended form, a member of the study team will complete a Study Termination Form and 
review with the prinicipal investigator upon withdrawal.

27 provided the required power to detect significant difference between early and late oral 
tolerance diet groups. The increase sample size shown here is to observe myoelectric 
differences between right colon, left colon, and rectum resections. 
 
6.4.3  Planned Analysis  
6.4.3.1  Primary Analyses  
The primary endpoint is to determine if there is  a correlation between the measured motor 
activity metrics of the various GI organs with measures of recovery, and to mathematically 
characterize the correlation in a manner that leads to predictive ability.  The study  is 
retrospective without intention to  treat.  Data analysis is performed by the staff of G -Tech 
Medical located in Mountain View, CA using proprietary software developed specifically for 
this purpose.  Data is accessed on a secure cloud server to which it was uploaded by the 
mobile app connected to the patches.  
Data analysis consists of extracting the myoelectric motor activity measured by the patches 
in ten- minute time segments and assigning them to an organ or organs.  The motor activity 
at any one time (instantaneous) and the cumulative activity up to that point in time will be 
examined for correlation to parameters associated with recovery rate such as time to first 
flatus, time to first solid meal, time to discharge, etc.  This will be done across all time points to find the earliest time that offers predictive value.  The specific final analysis approach 
taken will depend on the findings of this pilot study. 
In the study2 with c olonic  myoelectric activity measurements  after open abdominal surgery 
an inverse correlation was found between cumulative colon signal strength and time to first flatus which was approximately linear and was best characterized by the root mean square (RMS) deviation of the residuals from a linear fit, in units of hours.  The optimal time for this 
analy sis was found to be at 36 hours after surgery.  
 
Similarly in the study
1 with patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure, a 
correlation was found between cumulative signal strength of the stomach and time to first full 
meal that was also inverse but not well represented by a linear or other fit.  In this case the 
analysis involved assigning patients to one of two groups, early and late feeders.  The 
stomach activity data were then tested for predictive value against these groups.  Patients with st ronger signals were more likely to be in the early feeding group and vice versa.  A 
statistical analysis was performed using a receiver -operator characteristic approach that led 
 
pancreaticoduodenectomy for diet “readiness”. American Journal of Physiology- Gastrointestinal and Liver 
Physiology, 315(5), pp.G743- G751.

determination of the optimal time, which was again at approximately 36 hours.  
 
6.4.3.2  Secondary Objectives Analyses  
In addition to the analysis above, electronic medical record review will allow for the rate of 
ileus, readmission, and first bowel movement to be further correlated with the processed 
myoelectric signal.  
6.4.3.3  Safety  
Anticipated and unanticipated adverse device events will be monitor through hospitalization and 
30-days after surgery based on the definitions above. Descriptive statistics will be reviewed with 
the study team and the manufacturer.

Research Study Summary:  
• We are asking you to join a research study.  
• The purpose of this research study is to evaluate electrical signals made by your 
intestines that tell us how you are recovering after surgery . 
• Study procedures will include: small medical -grade patches placed on your skin that 
monitor your intestines and send the information to a smartphone.  
• No additional  visits are required.  
• There are some risks from participating in this study . You may experience a skin reaction 
to the patch if you already have had reactions to other skin adhesives. Data about your 
recovery is shared in a non- identifiable way with the device manufacturer. 
• The study may have no benefits to you, but the data collected may help others with a 
similar surgery in the future.  
• Taking part in this study is your choice. You can choose to take part, or you can choose 
not to take part in this study.  You can also change your mind at any  time.  Whatever 
choice you make, you will not lose access to your medical care or give up any legal rights or benefits.  How we care for you will not change based on your decision to 
participate.  
• If you are interested in learning more about the study, plea se continue reading,
 or have 
someone read to you t he rest of this document. Take as much time as you need before 
you make your decision.  Ask the study staff questions about anything you do not 
understand. Once you understand the study, we will ask you if you wish to participate. If 
you agree, this form will need to be signed to participate. 
 
Why is this study being offered to me? 
We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have a planned surgery 
involving your intestines, colon, or rectum. We are looking for  200 participants 18 years old 
or older to be part of this research study.

Who is paying for the study? 
This study has no external funding and is being supported by internal funds.  
 
Who is providing other support for the study?  
The medical device is being provided free of charge by the manufacturer.  
 
What is the study about?  
The purpose of this study is to record the electrical signals that naturally occur in your digestive 
tract and motility patterns in individuals who undergo surgery.   Patients who have surgery 
have the potential to experience delayed recovery of their bowel movements or passing gas . 
Delayed recovery, or  ileus, causes the intestinal contents to back up because the bowels do 
not move in a rhythmic way that is needed.  The symptoms resulting from this include painful 
distended abdomen, nausea, vomiting , and dehydration.  A device, the G -Tech Wireless Patch 
System (WPS)  has been developed by a company, G -Tech Medical, Inc. , which measures the 
electrical activity from your intestines.  The device uses adhesive to adhere to your skin and 
it is placed on your stomach or abdomen to measure the natural electrical activity .  The 
purpose of the study is to determine if the measurements made by the G -Tech Wireles s Patch 
System correlate with clinical markers of gastrointestinal  recovery such as passage of flatus  
or your first bowel movement, oral tolerance of diet , and discharge readiness.  
 
This study is solely for obtaining patterns in various individuals to determine if the myoelectric 
signals measured by the G -Tech Wireless Patch System correlate with rate of gastrointestinal 
recovery following surgery.    
 
What are you asking me to do and how long will it take?  
The device will be placed post -operatively within  4 hours of your surgery . The patches will 
typically remain on until discharge. You will be asked to return the patches prior to 
discharge. While you are an inpatient, you may shower with the patches in place if the surgical team has approved of showering after surgery.  
 
What are the risks and discomforts of participating?   
A potential risk in this study is the adhesive on the patch may cause mild irritation and leave 
temporary red or pink areas or possibly glue marks on your skin, which should go away on 
their own a few days after the patch is removed.    
 
How will I know about  new risks or  important  information about the study?

38 We will tell you if we learn any new information that could change your  mind  about taking 
part in this study.   
 
What if there are unexpected findings from the study related to my participation?  
We do not anticipate findings that would directly relate to your care as the meaning of the 
data is not yet fully understood and the primary purpose of this study. If the results suggest a 
long- term relevance of the data to your current or future health status, we will communicate 
these findings to you.  
 
How can the study possibly benefit me?  
There are no direct benefits to you for  participating in this study .  
 
How can the study possibly benefit other people?  
The results of this study will help the future development of technology and to potentially 
help future patients by optimizing their post -operative care and decrease their length of stay 
in the hospital.  
 
Are there any costs to participation?  
You will not have to pay for taking part in  this study. There will be a few minutes of time each 
day for the first 6 days of your inpatient recovery that require your attention with study staff.  
 
Will I be paid for participation?  
This study is conducted without compensation for participants.  
 
How  will you keep my data safe and private?  
We will keep information we collect about you confidential. We will share it with others if you agree to it or when we have to do it because U.S. or State law requires it .  
 
When we publish the results of the research or talk about it in conferences, we will not use 
your name. If we want to use your name, we would ask you for your permission separately 
from this consent .   
 
We will also share data with other researchers for future research but we will not use y our 
name or other identifiers. We will not ask you for any additional permission.

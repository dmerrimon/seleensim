 2. Key definitions  
Episode of care: An episode of care is an element or part of the care or treatment pathway 
which is being studied or measured. For the purpose of this study, an episode of care will 
constitute all healthcare professional (HCP) activities involved in the preparation  and 
adm inistration of a single dose of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase alfa  and 
agalsidase beta, including ERT (and pre -medication) preparation, pre- and post -
administration assessment , pharmacy and clinic activities , and any follow up activities . 
 
Caregiver : in the context of this study a care giver  is defined as  an individual aged 18 years or 
over who has a personal relationship with and provides informal (unpaid) care, support or 
assistance to someone diagnosed with Fabry Disease , and accompanies them to the hospital 
or treatment centre for ERT administration  on one or more occasion during the study data 
collection period . For example , this may be a parent, spouse/ partner, son/ daughter, other 
relative, neighbour or friend.

 4. Abstract  
Title  A multi -country time and motion study to describe the experience of 
clinicians, patients and their caregivers  during the treatment of Fabry 
Disease  with Enzyme Replacement Therapy with agalsidase alfa and 
agalsidase beta   
Rationale for study  
 Enzyme replacement  therapy (ERT) with agalsidase alfa (Replagal ®, 
Shire  or biosimilar ) or agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme ®, Sanofi Genzyme  or 
biosimilar ) is the current mainstay of treatment for patients with Fabry 
Disease (FD). Both ERT preparations need to be administered as an 
intravenous (IV) infusion every two weeks. Migalastat (Galafold® , 
Amicus  Therapeutics ), an orally -administered treatment for patients 
with FD with amenable mutations, is now approv ed in a number of 
countries .  
As oral therapies for FD become available, there is a need for 
comprehensive information about the burden of current t reatments 
from the perspective of both patients and their caregivers and 
healthcare providers, to enable them to make fully informed decisions 
about the most appropriate treatment strategy.  There is currently a 
paucity of data on the true resource burden associated with use of 
existing ERT and the wider impact of attendance for ERT on health -
related quality of life (HRQoL)  and work productivity.  
The present study will address these evidence gaps by generating 
robust real world data to quantify the current burden of ERT for the 
treatment of FD across four countries. The study will utilise a time and 
motion methodology to measure the total healthcar e profession al 
(HCP) time associated with a  single  episode of ERT administration, with 
patient - and caregiver -reported outcomes including HRQoL, 
wellbeing , levels of fatigue, work productivity and the strain of 
providing care, to be collected directly from  patients with FD  and their 
caregivers .  The data may be utilised by Amicus Therapeutics  in 
submissions to Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies, and will

 be useful for HCPs to inform future treatment decisions and ongoing 
patient management.  
Research question 
and h ypothesis  What is the total HCP time associated with the preparation and 
administration of a single dose of ERT in patients with FD and the 
patient and caregiver time and costs associated with an ERT 
attendance? What is the impact of FD on patients’ HRQoL , wellbeing , 
levels of fatigue  and work productivity? What is the burden of care 
provision  for the caregivers of patients with FD and the impact on their 
work productivity?  
 
This is a descriptive study and there is no a priori  hypothesis to be 
tested.  
Objectives  
 Primary objective  
To quantify the total time spent by HCPs in the preparation and 
administration of a single dose of ERT (with agalsidase alfa  and 
agalsidase beta) in patients with FD. 
 
Secondary objectives  
1. To quantify the total patient time , costs (i.e. out of pocket 
expenses)  and work -related absence associated with attendances 
for the administration of a single dose of ERT (with agalsidase alfa  
and agalsidase beta) in patients with FD. 
2. To quantify the total caregiver time , costs (i.e. out of pocket 
expenses)  and work -related absence associated with 
accompanying a patient with FD for the administration of a single 
dose of ERT (with agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta).  
3. To describe patient -reported HRQoL (measured by the 12 Item 
Shor t Form Survey [SF -12]), wellbeing (measured by the World 
Health Organization -5 Wellbeing Index [WHO -5]), levels of fatigue 
(measured by a bespoke Fatigue Likert scale)  and work productivity 
(measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Index [WPAI]  
quest ionnaire ) in patients with FD treated with ERT.  
4. To describe work productivity (measured by the WPAI  for 
caregivers [WPAI:CG] ) and the strain of care provision (measured

 by the Caregiver Strain Index [CSI]) in caregivers of patients with FD 
treated with ERT .  
Study design  This is an international, non -interventional research study of adult 
patients with FD and their caregivers . The study will comprise a 
prospective time and motion evaluation and a cross -sectional 
evaluation of patient  and caregiver -reported outcomes . Patients’ 
demographic characteristics will be collected from hospital medical 
records.   
For the cross -sectional evaluation of patient and caregiver -reported 
outcomes, patients with FD and their caregivers will be asked to  
complete a series of questionnaires, to include validated measures of 
HRQoL, wellbeing and work productivity  (for patients) and work 
productivity and the strain of care provision (for caregivers). Patients 
and caregivers will also complete a bespoke questionnaire to evaluate 
the total time associated with attending the hospital or treatment 
centre for a single E RT administration visit, and time away from work. 
In addition, patients will also be asked about their level of fatigue using 
a bespoke Likert scale. With the exception of the work productivity 
questionnaire  and Fatigue Likert scale , the study questionnair es will 
be completed at a single point in time, when the patient attends the 
hospital or treatment centre for administration of ERT. The work 
productivity questionnaire (which has a recall period of seven days, 
excluding the day of completion) will be comp leted twice; the first 
work productivity questionnaire will be completed 1 -7 days after 
receiving a dose of ERT ( ideally within 2 days ), to capture a seven day 
period that includes an ERT administration visit and the second 
questionnaire will be completed on the day the patient attends the 
hospital or treatment centre to receive their next dose of ERT (to 
capture a seven day period that does not include ERT administration).  
The Fatigue Likert scale will be completed three times; during an ERT 
administration  visit, on the evening of the visit and the next day.

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   13 
 Separate patient consent will be obtained for the time and motion 
evaluation and for the cross -sectional evaluation of patient -reported 
HRQoL, wellbeing , levels of fatigue  and work productivity; thus, 
patients  who do not wish to complete the study questionnaires will 
remain eligible for the time and motion study (and vice versa), 
provided that consent has been obtained.  
Setting  Patients with FD who are receiving ERT and their caregivers will be 
identified and recruited from approximately 12 specialist centres in 
four countries (  Taiwan , Turkey, Brazil and Japan).  
Participants  The target sample size for the time and motion evaluation undertaken 
as part of this  study is 240 ERT episodes, including 60 ERT episode s (30 
for agalsidase alfa and 30 for agalsidase beta) in each participating 
country . Ideally, a  maximum of two ERT administration episodes will 
be observed per patient ; as such, at least  30 patients  are expected to 
be enrolled in each  country .  For countries with limited FD patient 
numbers, a review of episodes of care observed will be completed on 
an ongoing basis.  It may be determined that it is possible to observe 
three episodes per patient in these circumstances, however only two 
episodes will be observed per patient where ver possible . 
For the questionnaire evaluation , approximately 120 patients and 20 
caregiver s will be expected to fill questionnaire sets  (approxim ately 30 
patients’ and 5 caregivers’ questionnaire sets per count ry). 
Patient i nclusion criteria  
• Patients aged 18 years old or over at time of consent . 
• Patients with a documented diagnosis of FD. 
• Patients who have received ≥ 4 dose s of ERT (with agalsidase 
alfa or agalsidase beta) for the treatment of FD. 
• Patients who present to the participating hospita l(s) or 
treatment centre(s) for administration of a dose of ERT (as part 
of their routine treatment) during the data collection period.

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   14 
 Patient exclusion criteria  
• Patients aged <18 years at time of consent  
• Patients who are unable or unwilling to give consent for study 
participation.  
• Patients whose ERT preparation and administration takes place 
exclusively in the home setting  with no HCP involvement in 
preparation of the infusion . 
• For the time and motion evaluation:  Patients whose ERT is 
administered by a HCP who does not consent to be observed.  
Caregiver inclusion criteria:  
• Aged 18 years of age or over at time of consent.  
• Self-identifies as a caregiver of a patient with FD for whom 
written informed consent has been obtained for inclusion in the 
study.  
Caregiver exclusion criteria  
• Caregiver (and/ or the patient with FD whom they support or 
care for) is unable or unwilling to give cons ent for study 
participation.  
Staff inclusion criteria (for time and motion study):  
• Members of the whole  care team responsible for administering 
agalsidase alfa  and agalsidase beta to patients with FD.  
• Staff who have given written consent to be observed during the 
provision of care.  
Participant selection  
Consecutive eligible patients (and their caregivers) presenting at the 
participating centres during the prospective recruitment period will be 
included in the study until the required sample size (number of ERT 
episodes) is reached. For patients who are el igible to be observed 
more than once (for the time and motion study), initial consent for 
observation of up to three  episodes of care will be obtained, and will 
be confirmed verbally by their HCP before the second episode of care.

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   15 
 Each patient and caregiver will only be asked to complete one set of 
questionnaires  (with the exception of the work productivity 
questionnaire  [which will be completed twice] and the fatigue Likert 
questionnaire [which will be completed three times], as described 
above ). 
Data source(s)  Patients’ demographic and clinical data will be sourced from patients’ 
medical records and other systems within the main (specialist) 
participating FD centres  and extracted into electronic case report 
forms (eCRFs) .   
For the time and motion component of the study, prospective data 
relating to HCP time associated with the preparation and 
administration of a single dose of ERT will be captured by direct 
observat ion of HCPs  by an independent external researcher  or a 
member of the patients’ care team , during the episode of care  and 
recorded on a paper case report form (CRF) which will then be 
transcribed into an eCRF .  
Patient - and caregiver -reported outcomes will be reported directly by 
patients and caregivers using anonymised -coded  paper -based 
questionnaires  which will be tran scribed  into an Excel database  by 
central data managers . 
Study time  period (s) It is anticipated that the prospective recruitment / data collection 
period for this study will be approximately 4 -5 months, starting from 
the date on which the relevant approvals to conduct the study are in 
place. A maximum of three  episodes of care per p atient during the 
data collection period will be included. Consenting patients with FD 
and their caregivers will be asked to complete the study 
questionnaires at the time points described above . 
Study endpoints  Primary endpoint: Summary measures of the total time spent by HCPs 
in the preparation and administration of a single dose of ERT in patients

7. Rationale and background  
Fabry disease (FD) is a rare inherited lysosomal disorder caused by deficiency  or dysfunction 
of the enzyme α-galactosidase A , which l eads to an accumulation of globotri aosylceramide 
(Gb3) within the lysosomes of many cell types  leading to cellular dysfunction and multi -organ 
disease1. FD is associated with a number of  characteristic clinical signs and  symptoms 
includ ing neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal complications, headaches, impaired sweating, 
vertigo, hearing impairment, angiokeratomas  and cornea verticillata2.  Over time, FD can lead 
to irreversible organ damage and is a cause of premature renal failure, heart disease , 
cerebrovascular events and death3. As X-linked disorder, male sufferers of FD tend to be more 
severely affected  than females4. Patients with FD are widely reported to have r educed health 
related quality of life (HR QoL) compared with the general population5,6 due to the debilitating 
symptoms and damage to vital organs.  Increasing age, classical FD phenotype, more severe 
disease and pain have been identified as major contributors to reduced HRQoL6.

 Enzyme replacement therap ies (ERT) with agalsidase alfa (Replagal ®, Shire) and with 
agalsidase beta ( Fabrazyme ®, Sanofi Genzyme ) currently represent two treatment  options  for 
patients with FD and have been shown to reduc e substrate levels in several cell types. In 
addition there are reports of reductions in the severity of neur opathic pain , stabili zation of  
renal and cardiac function and delay in the occurrence of serious complications7–10. However, 
both ERT preparations need to be administered as  an intravenous (IV) infusion every two  
weeks  and therefore lifelong ERT places a considerable burden on patients, their caregivers 
and healthcare services .  ERT administered in the hospital or clinic setting  requires frequent 
visits for IV infusions , which many patients find s tressful  and inconvenient ; furthermore, 
hospital -based treatment often takes place in a specialist FD centre, which may be a 
considerable distance from the patient ’s home11,12.  In some countries ERT can be 
administered in the patient’s home under certain circumstances (for example, if the patient 
has stable disease and experienced no adverse reactions during hospital -based infusion)  and 
this is generally perceived to be more convenient than hospital -based therapy11–13, can 
improve treatment compliance14 and may help to reduce the burden on healthcare services . 
However, even home -based ERT administration can cause disruption to a patient’s daily 
activities and usually requires a healthcare professional  (HCP)  to supervise the infusion. To 
mitigate risk of adverse effects associated with ERT, patients are also frequently administered 
pre-medications with ant ihistamines and low -dose corticosteroids, which can be an added 
burden to patients.  
Therapeutic options for FD have expanded over the past few years, with the development of 
orally -administered medicines such as Migalastat (Galafold®, Amicus Therapeutics)  which has 
received regula tory approval in several countries. In this context,  there is a need for 
comprehensive  information about the burden of standard -of-care  ERT treatments from the 
perspective of both patients  and their care givers  and healthcare providers, to enable them to 
make fully inform ed decisions about the most appropriate treatment strategy.  There is 
currently a paucity of data on the true resource burden associated with use of existing ERT 
and the wider impact of attendance for ERT on HRQoL and work productivity. Although data 
are available about the overall frequency and cost of ERT attendances15,16, there have been 
no published data on the total time and cost involved for patients , caregivers  and HCPs. In

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   20 
 addition, t he impact of receiving ERT on work productivity has been described in market 
research17 and qualitative research18 but has not been formally quantified.  
The present study will address these evidence gaps by generating r obust real world data to 
quantify the current burden of ERT for the treatment of  FD across fou r countries. The study 
will utilize a time and motion methodology to measure the total HCP time associated with an 
episode of ERT administration , with patient - and caregiver -reported outcomes including 
HRQoL, wellbeing , work productivity and caregiver strain,  to be collected directly from 
patients with FD  and their caregivers .  The data may be utili zed by Amicus Therapeutics  in 
submissions to Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies, and will be useful for HCPs to 
inform future treatment decisions and ongoing patient management.  
8. Research question s and objectives  
8.1 Research question s  
What is the total HCP time associated with the preparation and administration of a single 
dose of ERT in patients with FD and the patient and caregiver time and costs (out -of-pocket 
expenses) associated with an ERT attendance? What is the impact of FD on patients’ HRQoL , 
wellbeing, levels of fatigue  and work productivity ? What is the b urden of care provision for 
the caregivers of patients with FD and the impact on their work productivity ?  
8.2 Hypothesis  
This is a descriptive study and there is no a priori  hypothesis to be tested.  
8.3 Primary objective  
To quantify the total time spent by HCPs in the preparation and administration of a single 
dose of ERT (with agalsidase alfa  and agalsidase beta) in patients with FD. 
8.4 Secondary objectives  
• To quantify the total patient time , costs (i.e. out of pocket ex penses)  and work -related 
absence associated with attendance s for the administration of a single dose of ER T (with 
agalsidase alfa  and agalsidase beta) in patients with FD.

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   21 
 • To quantify the total caregiver time , costs (i.e. out of pocket expenses)  and work -related 
absence associated with accompanying a patient with FD for the administration of a single 
dose of ERT (with agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta).  
• To describe patient -reported HRQoL  (measured by the 12 Item Short Form Survey [SF -12]), 
wellb eing  (measured by the World Health Organization -5 Wellbeing Index [WHO -5]), 
level s of fatigue (measured by a bespoke Fatigue Likert scale)  and work productivity 
(measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Index [WPAI]  questionnaire ) in patients 
with FD treated with  ERT.  
• To describe work productivity (measured by the WPAI -CG) and the strain of care provision 
(measured by the Caregiver Strain Index [CSI]) in caregivers of patients with FD  treated 
with ERT.   
9. Research methods  
This study has been designed and will be conducted according to the requirements of the 
European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP; 
http://www.encepp.eu/index.shtml ) and I nternational Society for Pharmacoepidemiology 
(ISPE; https: //www.pharmacoepi.org/resources/guidelines 08027.cfm ) guidance, as 
appropriate.  
9.1 Study design  
This is an international,  non-interventional research study of adult patients with FD and their 
caregivers . The study will comprise a prospective time and motion evaluation and a cross-
sectional evaluation of patient - and caregiver -reported outcomes (including HRQoL , 
wellbeing , levels of fatigue  and work -productivity  [for patients with FD ]; work productivity 
and the strain of care provision [for caregivers ]). Patients’ demographic characteristics will be 
collected from hospital medical records. No changes to routine patient management will be 
made for the purposes of any part of this study and there is no requirement for additional 
visits or investigations.   
Separate patient consent will be obtained for the time and motion evaluation and the cross -
sectional evaluation of patient -reported HRQoL, wellbeing , level s of fatigue  and work 
productivity; thus, patients  who do not wish to complete the study questionnaires will remain  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   22 
 eligible for the time and motion study (and vice versa), provided that consent has been 
obtained.   Caregivers will consent to completion of the study questionnaires.  
A prospective design for  collection of patient -centred outcomes data was selected since it is 
unlikely that these will be documented in medical records. A prospective design is the only 
appropriate method for collecting time and motion and caregiver -reported outcomes data.  
Based on the rarity of FD, the broad eligibility criteria and the number and types of 
participating centres, the results of this study should be generalisable to the wider patient 
population with FD treated with ERT with agalsidase alfa  or agalsidase beta  in rou tine clinical 
practice in the participating countries.  
9.1.1 Prospective time and motion study  
Patients with FD attending the hospital or treatment centre for administration of a  single dose 
of ERT (with  agalsidase alfa  or agalsidase beta ) during the prospective recruitment period will 
be observed by an independent researcher or a member of their care team for the duration 
of the ir episode of care. The observer will record the HCP time associated with all activities 
relating to the preparation and administration of ERT (including the pre -infusion clinical 
assessment  and post -administration documentation ). It is possible that a single patient may 
present to the hospital or treatment centre for administration of ERT m ultiple times within 
the recruitment period (when they return for follow -up treatment), but repeated observation 
of the same patient will ideally be capped at two episodes of care per patient, to minimise 
bias from multiple observations of patients with atypical  resource use.  For countries with 
limited FD patient numbers, a review of episodes of care observed will be completed on an 
ongoing basis.  It may be determined that it is possible to observe three episodes per patient 
in these circumstances, however  only two episodes will be observed per patient where ver 
possible.   For patients who are eligible to be observed more than once, i nitial consent for 
observation of up to three  episodes of care will be obtained, and will be confirmed verbally 
by their HCP before the second or third episode of care  is observed .

 9.1.2 Cross sectional evaluation of patient - and caregiver -reported outcome measures  
Patients with FD and their caregivers will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires , to 
include validated measures of HRQoL, wellbeing and work productivity  (for patients) ; and 
work productivity and the strain of care provision (for caregivers).  
Questionnaires were  selected based on their ease of use, short time required for completion 
(in order to minimise the burden on patients ), availability in the required languages , and the 
fact that they have been previously validated in a similar context to our study:   
• HRQoL  will be assessed using the SF -12 version 2. The SF -12 is a shorter version of the 36 
item Short Form Survey (SF -36) that uses 12 questions to measure functional health and 
wellbeing from the patients’ point of view. It is made up of 8 domains: physical fu nctioning, 
bodily pain, general health, vitality, physical  role, role emotional, social functioning and 
mental health19. These 8 domains form 2 subscales: physical component summary and 
mental component summary. The SF -12 was chos en for the present study as it was used 
in a recent registry of patients with FD20 and is less burdensome for patients to complete 
than the longer SF -36. It has a short completion time (approximately 5  minutes) and is 
available in all 4 languages of the study countries.  
• Patients’ general  wellbeing will be assessed using the WHO -522. It consists of 5 items and 
the timeframe for responses is based on the previous 2 weeks. The 5 items relate to feeling 
cheerful, calm, active, rested and being interested in l ife. The WHO -5 was selected to 
assess the impact of FD and its treatment on patients’ well -being. It is quick and easy to 
complete (<5 minutes) and score.  
• The impact of FD on patients’ work lives will be assess ed using the WPAI. The WPAI 
consists of 6 items. The WPAI was chosen for the present study as it is quick to complete 
(<5 minutes) and is available in all 4 languages of the countries  selected in this study . 
Caregiver -reported outcomes will be evaluated us ing the following validated questionnaires 
addressing work productivity and the strain of care provision:  
• The impact of caring for a patient with FD on caregivers’ work lives will be assessed using 
the WPAI  specific to caregivers  (WPAI:CG)24. The WPAI :CG consists of 6 items and was 
chosen for the present study as it is quick to complet e (<5 minutes) and is available in all 
4 languages of the study countries.  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   24 
 • The strain of providing care for a patient with FD will be assessed using the CSI. The CSI 
consists of 13 items and measures the strain of care provision in five domains (financial,  
physical, psychological, social and personal)23. It takes app roximately 5 minutes to 
complete.  
Patients and caregivers will also complete a bespoke questionnaire to evaluate the total time 
associated with attending the hospital or treatment centre for a single ERT administration 
visit, costs (i.e. out of pocket expe nses) and time away from work. In addition, patients will 
also be asked about their level s of fatigue using a single -item bespoke Likert scale. Bespoke 
questionnaires will be designed specifically for the purpose of the study.  
It is estimated that it will  take approximately 25 -30 minutes in total for patients to complete 
their questionnaires (including the second WPAI) and 15 -20 minutes for caregivers to 
complete their questionnaires (including the second WPAI :CG). 
Patient questionnaires will be presented in the following order: bespoke F atigue Likert scale  
(first completion) , SF-12, WHO -5, bespoke patient questionnaire (to be started during the ERT 
visit and finished at home) , bespoke Fatigue Likert scale second and third completion  (to be 
completed on the evening of the ERT administration visit and the next day), WPAI first 
completion (to be completed at home between 1 and 7 days after the ERT infusion [ideally in 
first 2 days]), WPAI second completion (to  be completed on the day of the patient’s next ERT 
administration visit) . Caregiver questionnaires will be presented in the following order: CSI, 
bespoke caregiver questionnaire (to be started during the ERT administration visit and 
finished at home) , WPAI :CG first completion (to be completed at home between 1 and 7 days 
after the ERT infusion), WPAI:CG second completion (to be completed on the day of the 
patient’s next ERT administration visit) .  
The full schedule for  completion of the study questionnaire s for patients and caregivers is 
provided in Table 3 below.

9.2 Setting  
Patients with FD who are receiving ERT and their caregivers will be identified and recruited 
from approximately 8-12 specialist centres across  four  countries ( Taiwan , Turkey, Brazi l and 
Japan). The number of sites needed to achieve the required sample size may vary between 
the participating countries; this will be determined by the study management company (in 
consultation with Amicus Therapeutics ), depending on the number and size  of potentially  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   26 
 eligible study sites in each country.  It is anticipated that 2-3 sites  will be required in each 
country.  
The participating  centres will be  specialist hospitals or treatment centres with experience of 
treating patients with FD with ERT ( agalsidase alfa or  agalsidase beta or both), interest in 
taking part in the study and likely availability of the required number of eligible patients /ERT 
episodes  during the recruitment peri od.  
In some  of the participating countries , the preparation and administration of ERT takes place 
exclusively in the hospital setting ; in these countries the study will be conducted solely within 
the hospitals (or infusion centres affiliated to the hospitals) from wh ich the patients  and 
caregivers  are recruited. In other countries , ERT preparation and administration can take 
place in both hospital s and community  healthcare centres  (i.e. primary care treatment 
facilities) . In these countries, p atients who receive ERT in primary care  (and their caregivers) 
will still be identified and recruited from the ir main (specialist)  hospital, but the time and 
motion component of the study (observation of ERT preparation and administration) and 
distribution  of patient - and caregiver - reported outcome measures and questionnaires will 
take place at their community healthcare centre (from which the relevant approvals to 
conduct the study will also be obtained). In some cases, patients may attend their community 
healthcare centre for the ERT infusion to be set up, and return home to start/deliver the 
infusion; these patients (and their caregivers) will still be included in the study, and the total 
HCP/patient and caregiver time recorded as for other epis odes  while the patient attends the 
community healthcare centre.   Patients will capture the infusion time themselves by 
completing the bespoke questionnaire provided.                                                                                                                                                                                           
It is not routine practice in the countries of study for ERT preparation and administration to 
take place exclusively in the home setting, or for HCPs to attend the patient’s home to assist 
with the infusion, although this may occur in exceptional circumstances (for example, if the 
patient themselves is a trained HCP). For this reason, patients who prepare and administer 
their ERT exclusively in the home setting w ill be excluded from the study, as resource use is 
likely to be atypical.

 9.3 Study time  periods  
It is anticipated that the prospective recruitment / data collection period for this study will 
be approximately 4 -5 months, starting from the date on which the relevant approvals to 
conduct the study are in place . Ideally, a  maximum of two episodes of care per patient during 
the data collection period will be included  for the time and motion evaluation  (except in 
exceptional cases where it is  determined that it is required  to obs erve three episodes per 
patient due to a limit ed number of avai lable patients/episodes for observation) . Patients with 
FD and their caregivers will be asked to complete the study questionnaires once during the 
data collection period, when the patient attend s the hospital or treatment centre for 
administration of ERT ; the exception is the work productivity questionnaire, which will be 
completed on two occasions  and the bespoke Fatigue Likert scale, which will be completed 
on three occasions  (as described above) . Separate patient consents will be obtained for the 
time and motion evaluation and cross -sectional questionnaire completion so patients will 
have the option to take part in only one or both parts of the study, according to their 
preference.  
9.4 Study population  
The source population for this study is adult patients with FD, recruited from four  countries 
(Taiwan , Turkey, Brazil and Japan)  who attend the participating hospitals , treatment centres 
or community healthcare facilities for administration of ERT (as part of their routine 
treatment) during the data collection period , and their caregivers . It is anticipated that 
approximately 60 episodes of care (30 with agalsidase alfa and 30 with  agalsidase beta) pe r 
country , ideally up to a maximum of two episodes per patient  (except in exceptional cases 
where it is  determined that it is required  to obs erve three episodes per patient due to a 
limit ed number  of available patients/episodes for observation) , will be included in the time 
and motion study, and approximately 30 sets of patient  questionnaires and 5 sets of care giver 
questionnaires per country (in total) will be completed.   
Patients and caregivers fulfilling the following criteria will be eligible for inclusion in the study:  
9.4.1 Selection  criteria  for patients  
Patient inclusion criteria  
• Patients aged 18 years old or over at time of consent . 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   28 
 • Patients with a documented diagnos is of FD. 
• Patients who have received ≥ 4 dose s of ERT (with  agalsidase alfa  or agalsidase beta ) for 
the treatment of FD. 
• Patients who present to the participating hospital(s) or treatment centre(s) for 
administration of a dose of ERT (as part of their routine treatment) during the data 
collection period.  
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded:  
• Patie nts aged <18 years at time of consent  
• Patients who are unable or unwilling to give consent for study participation.  
• Patients for whom ERT preparation and administration takes place exclusively in the home 
setting.  
• For the time and motion evaluation:  Patients whose ERT is administered by a HCP who 
does not consent to be observed.  
9.4.2 Selection  criteria  for caregivers  
Caregiver inclusion criteria:  
• Aged 18 years of age or over at time of consent . 
• Self-identif ies as a care giver of a patient with FD for whom written informed consent has 
been obtained for inclusion in the study.   
Caregivers who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded:  
• Caregiver (and/ or the patient with FD whom they support or care for) is unable or 
unwilling to give consent for study participation . 
9.4.3 Selection  criteria  for staff (for time and motion study)  
Staff inclusion criteria (for time and motion study ): 
• Members of the whole  care team responsible for preparing and administering agalsidase 
alfa and agalsidase beta to patients with FD.

 9.5 Patient identification, sampling and recruitment  
Adult p atients with FD who are receiving treatment with ERT  will be identified from  local 
databases and pharmacy records by members of the whole  care team at each centre and 
assessed for eligibility in line with the inclusion criteria. Patients will be approached by a 
member of their ca re team , given information about the study and invited to consent to 
participate . Patients may be approached in advance of their next scheduled attendance for 
ERT administration (by telephone and/or post)  or in person, at a routine hospital visit. If 
patients do not wish to complete the study  questionnaire s they are still eligible for the time 
and motion study  (and vice versa) , provided that consent for the relevant component of the 
study has been obtained. For patients who are eligible to be observe d more than once  (for 
the time and motion study) , initial consent  for observation of up to three  episodes of care will 
be obtained, and  will be confirmed verbally  by their HCP before the second  and third  episode 
of care.  Each patient will only be asked to complete one set of questionnaires  (with the 
exception of the work productivity questionnaire, which will be completed twice  and the 
bespoke Fatigue Likert scale, which will be completed three times ), even if they contribute 
more than one episode of care to the time and motion study . 
Caregivers will only be invited to participate in the study if the patient whom they care for 
also consents to study participation. Caregivers will be approached for consent when they 
attend the hospital or tre atment centre with the patient for their ERT administration visit.  
Consecutive eligible patients  (and their caregivers) presenting  at the participating centres 
during the prospective recruitment period will be included in the study until the re quired 
sample size is reached . It is anticipated that patient and caregiver recruitment will take place 
over a 4 -5 month period, starting from the date on which the relevant approvals needed to 
conduct the study are in place.   
Prior to commencement of data collection, HCPs at the participating centres (and community 
healthcare facilities, where relevant) who are involved in the administration of ERT will be 
identified and asked to provide consent to be observed in their provisio n of care.  Consent 
from HCPs will be confirmed by the observer verbally before each episode of care.

 9.7 Data source  
Patients’ demographic and clinical data will be sourced from patients’ medical records and 
other systems within the main (specialist) participating FD centres.   
For the time and motion component of the study, prospective data relating to HCP time 
associat ed with the preparation and administration of a single dose of ERT will be captured 
by direct observation of HCPs during the episode of care  by an independent external observer 
or a member of the patients’ care team .  
Patient - and caregiver -reported outcom es will be reported directly by patients and their 
caregivers using anonymised -coded  paper -based questionnaires. Questionnaires will be given 
to consenting patients and caregivers by members of the patients’ whole  care team during an 
ERT administration vis it. If the ERT infusion takes place in a hospital or treatment centre , it is 
anticipated that the validated questionnaires (with the exception of the first work 
productivity questionnaire) will be completed by the patient or caregiver during the ERT 
infusion and returned to centre staff in sealed envelopes for forwarding to the study 
management company , before the y leave the clinic . The first work productivity questionnaire 
will be completed by the patient or caregiver at home between 1  and 7 days  after date of the 
patient’s ERT infusion.  The bespoke questionnaire (which requires the patient or caregiver to 
document the time of leaving the clinic and the time to return to home/work) will also be 
completed by the patient or caregiver after leaving the clinic and  returned to the centre 
(together with the first work productivity questionnaire) at a later date , either in person (at 
the patient’s next ERT administration attendance) or  by post ( using a pre -paid envelope ). 
Alternatively, their responses to the first work productivity questionnaire , the bespoke 
questionnaire and the bespoke Fatigue Likert scale may be collected over the telephone 
during call with a member of the patient’s care team , or following a reminder call from a 
member of the patient’s care team to fill in the questionnaires .  If part of the episode of care 
takes place in the patient’s home , it is likely that all study questionnaires will be completed 
by the patient or caregiver at home and returned to the centre as described above.

 9.8 Study  size 
This study aims to recruit sufficient patients to record 30 episodes per treatment per country. 
Given this, the numb er of patients recruited will range from 15 to 30 per treatment per 
country. To evaluate the value of the sample estimates of the population that this sample size 
will allow for, it will be assumed pessimistically that each patient will have one measurement; 
the estimates once the study is carrie d out will therefore have higher precision than 
calculated be low.  
The anticipated length of time for pre and post -administration activities and infusion for each 
treatment utilised estimates from the research of Guest et al.17 alongside clinical opinion 
sourced from sites in the countries of study; it was estimated that pre -administration 
processes would always take between 10 -30 minutes, post -administration processes would 
take between 15 -30 minutes, infusion of agalsidase alfa takes between 40 to 60 minutes and 
infusion of agalsidase beta would take between 90 to 1 80 minutes . To anticipate the precision 
of estimates given the sample size above, it was estimated that these times would follow a 
normal distribution within these ranges (as a result, the mean could be estimated by taking 
the middle value of the range and the standard deviation roughly approximated accordingly).  
It is important to account for the fact that Fabry disease  is rare and that the sample collected 
will represent a large proportion of the total population with disease . For instance, in the US , 
it was estimated that there were only approximately 7700 patients in total out of a population 
of about 323 million in 2016, which suggests that only 0.0024% have the disease. The 
estimated number  of Fabry disease patients in other countries can be c alculated from the 
prevalence of the disease in the US, by multiplying the expected proportion of the population 
with the disease (assuming that the prevalence is similar in the US to other countries)  with 
the estimated total population  (Brazil, Japan , Tai wan  and Turkey therefore could have an 
estimated patient population of about 5015 , 3033 , 573 and 1934  patients respectively  based 
on estimates of total population of 210 million, 12 7 million , 24 million  and 8 1 million patients 
respectively24). Accounting for this, the estimated precision of estimates of time at different 
sample sizes for the largest and smallest countries in the study by population can be seen in 
the table below.

The higher the number of patients available to sample from the more precise the estimates 
of time taken for each activity will be, yet even at a worse -case scenario, 95% confidence 
intervals should be sufficient to describe the burden associated with ERT administration . 
Estimates taken from  countries where the sample size represents a higher proportion  of the 
total population with the disease, such as  Taiwan  will also be slightly more precise . 
Therefore, the target sample size for the time and motion evaluation undertaken as part of 
this study is 240 ERT episodes, including 60 ERT episodes (30 for agals idase alfa and 30 for 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816

 agalsidase beta) in each participating country. Ideally, a  maximum of two ERT administration 
episodes will initially be observed per patient  (except in exceptional cases where it is 
determined that it is required to observe three epis odes per patient due to a limit ed number 
of available patients/episodes for observation) , and at least 30 patients a re expected to be 
enrolled in each country.   For countries with limited FD patient numbers, a review of episodes  
of care  observed will be co mpleted on an ongoing basis.  I t may be determined that  it is 
possible to observe three episodes per patient in these circumstances, however only two 
episodes will be observed per patient  where ver possible .    
For the questionnaire evaluation, approximately 120 patients and 20 caregivers will be 
expected to fi ll questionnaire sets  (approximately 30 patients’ and 5 caregivers’ 
questionnaire sets per county ). 
 
9.9 Data management  
9.9.1 Data collection  
Patient demographic data will be collected using a n anonymised -coded  standardised  eCRF 
designed specifically for the study. Patients will be identified in all study records by a unique 
study code to link multiple study  records for each participant (if applicable) and preserve 
patient confidentiality. Data will be collected by members of the care team  at each centre or 
external researchers (to be confirmed in each country prior to study commencement) using 
an electronic data capture (EDC) system through eCRFs.  
For the prospective time and motion component of the study, trained external observers who 
are independent of the care process will attend the hospital or treatment centre and observe 
consenting patients’ episodes of care. Alternatively, episodes of care may be observed by 
trained members of the patients’  care team at each site , who are not perfor ming the tasks 
that are being observed . Data will be collected about the procedures involved in the 
preparation and administration of ERT with agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta,  the job roles of 
HCPs involved and the time taken to complete the activities  (start and stop time for each 
activity) ; this will be measured from the start of the first activity related to ERT preparation / 
administration (e.g. start of the pre -infusion clinical assessment) until completion of the last 
activity related to ERT prepar ation / administration (e.g. completion of the post -infusion 
documentation). The time taken to prepare and dispense the relevant medication will also be

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   48 
 collected by observation of pharmacy or nursing staff (as appropriate). Data for the time and 
motion co mponent of the study will be collected using a n anon ymised -coded  standardised 
paper -based CRF designed specifically for the study. The anonymised -coded data will then be 
transcribed into the eCRF by an appropriate member of staff.  
Data management for eCRFs will be carried out using MACRO™, a data management system 
which has a secure web -based data entry interface and is fully validated and compliant with 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Inf ormation Governance standard 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 11. The MACRO™ system has restricted access , role -based  permissions 
for data entry management and analysis and maintains an audit trail of all changes to data 
and activity in the system  in line with 21 CFR Part 11. Members of the whole  care team and 
external researchers will be trained in data entry into the eCRFs by study management staff 
from Open Health . Entry to MACRO™ will be restricted (by password protection) to only those 
members  of staff directly involved with the study.  
Consenting patients and caregivers will be given the relevant paper -based patient - and 
caregiver -reported outcome measures to complete either during the visit to the hospital or 
treatment centre for administratio n of ERT  or at home after leaving the clinic (as described 
above) .  Completed questionnaires will be handed back or posted (using a pre -paid envelope) 
to the hospital or treatme nt centre staff  or, alternatively , responses to the questionnaires 
completed by patients and caregivers after leaving the clinic (bespoke questionnaire , second 
and third bespoke fatigue Likert scale  and first WPAI questionnaire) may be collected over 
the telephone during a call with a member of the patient’ s care team.  The hospital or 
treatment centre staff will forward the completed questionnaires to the study management 
company for entry into a bespoke study database in Microsoft Excel ™. Entry to the study 
database will be restricted (by passwo rd protecti on) to only those members of s taff directly 
involved with the study .  
Data will be prepared for analysis using R statistical software version 3.4.1 , Stata ™ (StataCorp 
LLC) version 14 and/or Microsoft Excel ™. Da ta management and handling of data will be 
conducted according to the study -specific data management plan (DMP).  
9.9.2 Data analysis  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   49 
 A detailed description of study analysis and reporting will be provided in a separate statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) to be finalised before data collection is compl eted. Analyses will be carried 
out by Open Health  using R statistical software, Stata ™ (StataCorp LLC)  version 14  and 
Microsoft Excel ™. Data will be analysed separat ely for each participating count ry and by ERT 
treatment (agalsidase alfa /agalsidase beta) . 
The planned statistical analyses are summarised below.  
This study is designed to be descriptive in nature; there is no a priori  hypothesis to be tested 
and therefore no comparisons between patient subgroups or treatments will be made. 
Distributions and descriptive statistics of central tendency (medians and arithmetic or 
geometric means) and dispersion (standard deviation [SD], interquartile range [IQR], range) 
will be presented for quantitative var iables. Categorical variables will be described with 
frequencies and percentages; where appropriate, distributions, modes, medians, IQR and 
range will be reported. Where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) will also be 
presented for means and es timates of proportions.  Ordinal variables will be evaluated using 
either frequencies and percentages or medians and IQR or both depending on the number of 
possible values for the variable.  
Analysis for validated instruments will adhere to the licensed scoring manual. Item and 
domain scores (if relevant) will be presented.  
All percentages will be reported to the nearest whole number; therefore, in reporting study 
results in tables, figures and associated text, percentages may not add up to 100% due to 
rounding. For total group/subgroup sizes of less than 10, percentages will not be reported, 
except under exceptional circumstances.  Consideration will be given during data analysis as 
to whether reporting any of the planned analyses may identify ind ividuals from combinations 
of variables occurring in very small groups; to preserve participant anonymity such results 
may be suppressed in the study report and any materials intended for publication.  
9.9.3 Missing data  
Where dates are ambiguous because of missing day and/or months, standard imputation will 
be applied: where day is missing the 15th of the month will be assumed; where both day and 
month are missing the 1st July will be assumed.  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   50 
 For other missing data, the affected analyses will be  conducted using only the results of those 
patients/episodes with data available and the number included in each analysis will be stated.  
The number of patients or caregivers with data missing will be reported for each study 
variable.  
9.9.4 Subgroup and se nsitivity analyses  
The primary endpoint (and secondary endpoint, if numbers are sufficient) analyses will be 
conducted overall and repeated with stratification of the sample by  country and by  type of 
ERT (agalsidase alfa / agalsidase beta) . If numbers are sufficient, analyses may be conducted 
by severity of FD (mild / moderate / severe  [to be determined using the patients’ baseline 
information, as described above] ). 
No sensitivity analyses are planned.  
9.9.5 Interim analyses  
No interim analyses are planned.  
9.10 Quality control  
All staff collecting data for the study (site staff and/or external observers) will be provided 
with data collection guidelines  and will receive training in the requirements of the study 
protocol and correct  data collection. T his will ensure  consistent completion of the eCRF for 
demographic information, paper CRF for time and motion data collection, and administration 
of paper questionnaires to patients and caregivers.    
Data collection for the prospective time and motion stud y will be performed by trained 
external observers from the study  management company  or by members of the patients’  care 
team at each site , who will also receive training  in the time and motion study procedures . The 
observers will record start and stop times for each task on paper CRFs. It is recommended 
that 2 timing devices are used in case of failure of one of the devices.  For the purposes of 
quality control, each data collector will transcribe the first 3 c ompleted CRFs into the eCRF 
within 1 business day of the data collection and the entered data will be reviewed by project 
management or data management staff from the study management company . If errors or 
inconsistencies in the data are noted, additional training will be provided to the observers.  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   51 
 This pilot exercise will also be used to confirm that the database and CRF have been designed 
appropriately and that the data collection methodology is feasible .   
Data collection progress will be monitored by l ocal Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) on an 
ongoing basis and support will be available throughout the entire study period to observers 
and site study staff as required.  
Patient demographic data and d ata submitted for the time and motion component of th e 
study will be checked for completeness and accuracy by the Open Health  data management 
team using agreed manual and programmed validation checks, which will be specified in the 
study DMP. Missing values may occur during collection of observational data ( e.g. due to 
stopwatch failure). The frequency of these missing values will be tabulated as part of the data 
analysis but no queries will be raised. Other queries related to out -of-range values, 
inconsistent responses and any other data issues will be raise d with each site by the data 
management team at the study management company , and resolutions documented.  Study 
centres will be required to co -operate with the data management team in the resolution of 
these queries.  
No queries will be raised on patient - or caregiver -reported data.  
9.11 Limitations  of the research methods  
• Patient and caregiver consent is a requirement of this study; this may introduce 
selection bias and result in a study sample that may not be representative of the wider 
patient and caregiver population of interest.  
• Centres will be selected on the basis of interest in taking par t in the study and 
experience in treating patients with FD with ERT. It is acknowledged that these cen tres 
may not be representative of current wider clinical practice  in the countries  of study.  
• For patient - and caregiver -reported outcomes, the data will rely on the completeness 
of the answers provided by participants, which will not be queried or otherwise 
followed up to clarify inconsistencies or omissions  and may be subject to reporting 
bias. 
• A limitation of asking patients to complete questionnair es during their ERT infusion is 
that they may feel more anxious and/or tired when they are attending the hospital to 
receive treatment than at other times; consequently, the descriptions of patient -
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   52 
 reported  HRQoL and general wellbeing obtained in the study  may be an overestimate 
of the overall impact of FD.  
• This is a descriptive study and n o analyses to control for  confounding will be carried 
out. For ethical reasons, time and motion data will not be stratified by individual staff 
member, although the performance of staff may be a factor in any observed 
variability. Experience levels of s taff performing tasks observed in the study may vary 
between centres and may not reflect the experience level  of staff performing the same 
tasks outside the study centres. There are also likely to be differences between the 
participating countries in local clinical protocols, healthcare settings and care 
processes, which may introduce variability in the data collected.  
• It is acknowledged that the time and motion evaluation may  not capture the full 
burden of ERT administration since first infusions (which are expected to take longer  
than subsequent infusions ) are exc luded from the study; this is because the longer 
first infusion represents only a one -off burden at the start of long -term (potentially 
lifelong) treatment .     
• It is also acknowledged that Q oL data could be impacted by ERT  episodes that are 
close in timing to each other.  
10. Other aspects  
10.1 Review of study results  
Analysis of the primary endpoint , the total time spent by HCPs in the prep aration and 
administration of a single dose of ERT in patients with FD, will be independe ntly reviewed by 
a member of the Data Analysis team at Open Health  who was not involved in the analysis of 
the final study data. No additional analysis checks will be carried out.  
It is anticipated that s tudy results will be presented to investigators  to enable a preliminary 
discussion of the results of the study,  at a meeting to be planned after completion of the data 
analysis and before the study report is prepared.  
10.2 Study Amendments and Study Termination  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   53 
 Amendments to the study must  be made only by prior agreement between the Amicus 
Therapeutics  and Open Health . The Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC)/Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB) must be informed of all amendments and give approval for substantial 
amendments. The local Principal I nvestigator is responsible for obtaining approval from the 
IEC/IRB , and the local Clinical Research Organisation ( CRO ) supporting them will ensure a copy 
is forwarded  to Amicus Therapeutics . 
Open Health , Amicus Therapeutics  and Principal Investigators reserve the right to terminate 
participation in the study according to the study contract. Open Health  will notify the IEC/IRB 
in writing of the study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the notification 
to Amicus Therapeutics . 
11. Protection of human subjects  
This study will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidance regarding patient 
protection including patient privacy, and consistent with the ethical principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki24, the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR )25 and any other relevant local regulations . This study has bee n designed to minimise 
the data collected to that which is required for the planned analyses. The data collected will 
not include any direct identifiers. Data will be transferred to, and held securely by, Open 
Health at their offices within the UK during t he conduct o f this study , supported as needed by 
their local partners  (refer to section 0).  
11.1 Ethical and regulatory approvals  
IEC/IRB approvals, competent authority and local management approvals for the conduct of 
this study and the sharing of anonymised -coded patient and caregiver data will be sou ght 
according to applicable local regulations .  
11.2 Ethical considerations  
This is an observational study involving a prospective time and motion study, completion of 
questionnaires by patients with FD and their caregivers and collection of demographic data 
from medical records; there will be no changes to patient management and no additional 
visits are required for the study. Only anonymised -coded data will be collected.  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   54 
 A pa rticipant  information sheet will be provided to patients and caregivers identified as being 
eligible for study participation by the patient’s whole  care team , explaining the above  
components of this research study. Only patients providing written informed consent (for one 
or both components) will be included in the study and no data collection will take place until 
written informed consent for the relevant com ponent of the study has been provided.  
Caregivers will only be included if the patient with FD for whom they provide care or support 
has also consented to join the study.  HCPs at the participating centres will give consent to be 
observed in their provision  of care for the time and motion study.  
Patient - and carer -reported outcome data will be collected prospectively for those providing 
informed consent. Participation requires patients to complete a  ~25-30 minute series of 
questionnaire s related to the impac t of FD on HRQoL , wellbeing , level s of fatigue  and work 
productivity, which some may find upsetting. As most patients will complete the validated 
questionnaires during an ERT infusion, their HCPs will be able to provide support in the event 
that they do experience any distress. There will be no direct benefits of participation in the 
study but patients will be provided with a name and contact detail s for study -related queries.  
Patients and caregivers will be able to withdraw from the study at any time without any 
impact on the  patient’s clinical care.   
11.3 Participant privacy  
The Data Controller for this study is Amicus Therapeutics . Data  will be collected in 
anonymised -coded format and no personally identifiable information on any participant will 
be collected or removed from the hospital s or treatment centres participating in the study in 
order to preserve patient confidentiality. Pa rticipants wi ll be assigned a study -specific unique 
identification number which will be referenced in a study log. This identification log will not 
leave the participating centre location and will be the responsibility of the principal 
investigator at that study centre. Anonymised -coded participant data wil l be processed for 
the purposes of the research study described in this protocol and will be shared with Amicus 
Therapeutics , Open Health,  Klinikos , Zeincro  and IQVIA within the European Economic Area 
(EEA) and ,  intellim Holdings Corporation and Clinical Trial & Consulting  based outside the EEA  
for the purposes of this research  study . Companies located outside the EEA will maintain 
anonymised -coded data in accordance with the recognised EU Model Clause Agreement to 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   55 
 safeguard participant anonymity. Particip ant data will be retained for the archive period 
specified in section  11.4 . Participants will be advised of their rights in respect of their data, 
including the right to raise any concerns or  complaints related to this research study with the 
applicable local data protection regulator.  
11.4 Study Documentation and Archive  
Consist ent with ENCePP/ISPE/GDPR guidance, the study documents and anonymised -coded 
data will be archived securely by Open Health  on behalf of Amicus Therapeutics  for a period 
of three years in the UK after the end of the study (defined as the date of the final s igned 
Study Report) . After this time, the electronic patient -level study data will be removed of 
unique study codes (i.e. completely anonymised) and transferred securely to Amicus 
Therapeutics for extended archiving  in line with their  standard archive peri od for non -clinical 
trials .  All other study documents will, w ith Amicus Therapeutics  approval, be securely 
destroyed. The duration of archiving of study  data will ensure that any queries arising from 
peer review of any ensuing publications can be addresse d by reference to the source data if 
required.  
12. Management and reporting of adverse events / adverse reactions  
No patients will have received treatment with any Amicus Therapeutics medicinal products 
as part of this study, therefore it is not anticipated that Adverse Events (AEs), as defined 
below, will be required to be reported for study patients.   
However, any AEs reported by an HCP in relation to patients that have received an Amicus 
Therapeutics product in the course of normal clinical practice will be reported in line with the 
guidance below.  These events will be summarised in the safety reporting section of  the final 
study report.  
Sites will be advised that any untoward medical occurrence in a patient in this study following 
administration of a non -Amicus Therapeutics medicinal product should be reported as an AE 
to the authority marketing the product by the  patient’s HCP as per their local regulatory 
requirements.  
12.1 Definitions  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   56 
 Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment . 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR):   
As per the definition found in the WHO Technical Report 498 [1972], an adverse drug 
reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses 
normally used in man for prophy laxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for modification of 
physiological function  
Product Complaints  (PCs) : 
Product Quality Complaint (PQC) – Any communication that alleges deficiencies related to 
the drug product as a result of manufacturing, packagin g, or distribution and calls into 
question the identity, strength, quality, potency, purity, tampering and/or counterfeiting of 
that marketed drug product . Product Quality Complaints (PQCs) can involve reports of 
product defects, such as product appearanc e, packaging issues, taste/odour etc. PQCs can 
also contain adverse events e.g., lack of efficacy (failing to produce the expected 
pharmacological action for the approved indication).  
Non -Product  Quality Complaint:  
A complaint that does not directly relate  to product quality, purity, strength, potency, safety 
or effectiveness, such as a service complaint . 
Product Safety Events:  
Post marketing Safety Events collectively refer to:  
• All reports of AEs (non -serious and serious)  
• AEs associated with product complaints, or counterfeit products  
• Exposure during pregnancy and lactation (including paternal)  
• Reports of overdose, misuse, abuse, drug interaction  
• Medication error  
• Off-label use with or without an AE  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Occupational exposure  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent  
Clinical trial safety events refer to:

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   57 
 Events specified to be collected and reported to Amicus pharmacovigilance  (or designee) 
within the study protocol. This may include, but is not limited to serious adverse events, 
pregnancies, and overdose reports . 
Serious Adverse Event:    
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward occurrence that at any 
dose results in any of the following:  
• Life-threatening AE: (an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• Death  
• Inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically significant: (events that may not be life -threatening, result in death, or 
require hospitalization but may be co nsidered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition above).  
Special Situations (SS):   
Circumsta nces where the report does not include an AE per se , but nevertheless needs to be 
reported to Amicus Therapeutics.  These circumstances include as per GVP module VI (use in 
a paediatric or elderly population, overdose, off -label use, abuse, misuse, medicat ion error, 
lack of therapeutic effect /lack of effect (LOE), occupational exposure, falsified medicinal 
product, suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a product, drug interactions 
(including drug/food, drug/device, and drug/alcohol interactions , drug/food interactions), 
unexpected therapeutic effect, or worsening of an existing condition  
Unexpected Therapeutic Effect:  a beneficial therapeutic effect of a Product aside from the 
use for which it had been given  
12.2 Reporting Procedures for Adverse  Events  
12.2.1 Reporting Time -Frames  
OPEN VIE shall report all potential AEs, SSs, and all PCs to Amicus within 24 hours of receipt 
of the event  and no later than 1 business day . Reporting responsibilities are the same for all

PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   58 
 AEs, irrespective of the seriousness of the event or whether or not it was caused by the 
product. All SSs, and PCs should be reported, whether or not there is an associated AE .  
12.2.2 Reporting methodology  
AEs, SSs, and PCs should be reported via email to  PhV.Migalastat SO@quintiles.com  . 
12.3 Reconciliation  
At the end of the study  (defined as after all  study data is entered into the eCRF) , IQVIA will 
email a report of cases received at IQVIA during the  study to OPEN VIE. OPEN VIE is required 
to review the listing of cases and respond to IQVIA within 1 business day, confirming either 
that the list is correct or highlighting any discrepancies b etween the listing received from 
IQVIA and OPEN VIE records. Should OPEN VIE note that case reports are missing from the list 
provided by IQVIA, OPEN VIE will forward the missing report(s) within 1 business day via email 
to IQVIA at PhV.Migalastat SO@quintiles.com . IQVIA will follow up any discrepancies to 
resolution.  
13. Plans for disseminating and c ommunicatin g study results  
Study results will be submitted for presentation at appropriate national and/or international 
conferences  and may also be submitted for publication to appropriate peer reviewed 
journals ; the primary endpoint will be reported in the first publication arising from this study.  
The study will be reported according to the requiremen ts of STROBE (Strengthening the 
reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) as specified in the appropriate checklist 
for the study design27. 
Authorship of any publications arising from the study will follow the guidelines proposed by 
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (2015)30. All authors will meet the 
criteria for authorship, and al l people who meet t he criteria will be authors  and all authors 
will agree to be accountable for the study . Potential conflicts of interest will be disclosed.  All 
authors will have:  
(1) made substantial contributions to conception or design or acquisition  of data, or analysis 
and interpretation of data; AND  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6795C198-9C5E-4BD5-B7CD-E0A51CCCF816
PT_Fabry TM_FINAL v4 0_23Mar2020   59

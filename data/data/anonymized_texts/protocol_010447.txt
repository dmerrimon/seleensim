Investigators:  Approximately 70 Investigators  
Study centers:
  Approximately 70 study centers  globally  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective : 
The primary objective of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK)  of SAIT101  (proposed 
rituximab biosimilar)  versus  rituximab licensed in the European Union (hereafter designated  MabThera®, 
brand  name in EU) versus  rituximab licensed in the United States (hereafter designated  Rituxan®, brand  
name in US) in patient s with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Secondary Objectives : 
The s econdary objectives of the study are to compare the safety, additional  PK, pharmacodynamics (PD) , 
efficacy, tolerability , and immunogenicity of SAIT101 versus  MabThera® versus Rituxan® in patient s with 
rheumatoid arthritis ( RA).   
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group study to compare the P K, P D, safety , 
efficacy, tolerability , and immunogenicity of SAIT101 versus  MabThera® versus  Rituxan® in patient s with 
RA. This study consists of Part A  up to  24 weeks  followed by Part B up to Week 52 that also collects 
transition data  in patient s eligible for a second  course of treatment .  
It is planned to randomize approximately 282 patient s. 
The regular study duration per individual patient  will be 52 weeks from the start date of the first course.  
Overview of Study Design  
Part A  - First Course : Patient s will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one course of SAIT101  
(n=94) versus Rituxan® (n=94) versus MabThera® (n=94). 
Part B  - Second Course :  
Eligible patient s in the SAIT101 arm will receive the second course of SAIT101  treatment at Week 24 and 
Week 26.   
Eligible patient s in the MabThera® arm will receive the second course of MabThera® treatment at Week 
24 and Week 26.   
Eligible patient s in the Rituxan® arm will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAIT101  or Rituxan® 
treatment at Week 24 and Week 26.  
Study Population  
Patient s with RA who have had an inadequate response to at least 3  months’ treatment (according to the 
approved treatment and dosage) or intolerance  (at Investigator's discretion and/or experience of severe 
adverse event [AE] or toxicity such as infusion related reaction, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis or severe 
toxicity ) to anti-tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) therapy.

Screening and Baseline  
All the Screening assessments should be performed within 30 days prior to randomization on Day 1 (Visit 
2, Baseline), except in patient s who require prophylaxis of latent tuberculosis or a washout of current anti -
TNF medic ation or other biologic and non-biologic disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug (DMARD ) 
treatment (except methotrexate [ MTX ]).  For these patient s the Screening Period may be extended to allow 
for the washout required, but will not exceed 60 days.  In these patients all Screening asses sments must be 
performed within 30 days prior to randomization with the exception of the informed consent and chest X -
ray. 
Treatment Regimen    
Each patient  will receive first course which includes two intravenous (i.v.)  1,000  mg study drug infusions: 
one on Day  1 (Visit 2) and the second on Day  15 (Visit  5). Patient s will receive an anti -pyretic and an 
anti-histamine, e.g.,  paracetamol and diphenhydramine  or equivalent , 30 to 60  minutes before each 
infusion, plus 100  mg i.v. methyl prednisone  within  30 minutes prior to each infusion.  
Patient s with an inadequate response (<50% improvement from Baseline in both the swollen and tender 
joint counts) at Week 24 (Visit 12), will be eligible to receive the second  course of two 1,000  mg i.v. 
infusions (one at Week 2 4 and the second infusion  at Week 26 [14 days later ]) of study drug . 
On Day 1 and Day 15 (first and second infusion s) blood PK samples and PD (CD19+ B -cell) samples  will 
be collected before and 3 hours after the start of infusion and immediately  (within 10 minutes)  before and 
1 hour after the end of infusion , at 48 hours after the start of each infusion (Days 3 and 17 ). 
The PK /PD samples will also be taken at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 to estimate elimination.  
Blood PD samples will be  additionally  collected simultaneously at Weeks 36 and 52 . 
The main efficacy variable change from baseline in DAS 28 (Disease Activity Score) will be evaluated on 
completion of 2 4 weeks of study assessments.  
• All patient s will be followed up for up to 52 weeks  from the start date of the first infusion . 
• Patient s will attend the study center  approximately every 12 weeks during Part B , from the start date 
of the second  course of infusions . Patient who are not eligible for the second course of study treatment  
will also attend all visits until week 52.  SAIT101 Arm (n = 94)

data of all patients . The investigators and patients will remain blinded to treatment assignment 
during the post Week 24 follow -up period .  
• An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be assigned for this study. The DSMB 
will review available study data at pre -specified time points as outlined in the DSMB charter . 
• Investigators will be instructed to monitor the patient s throughout the study to detect the first 
symptoms or neurologic al signs suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML,  i.e., 
cognitive or visual disorders, hemiparesis, confusion or behavior  disorders).  If the patient s develop 
new neurological signs or symptoms they should be evaluated for PML. Neurological w arning signs 
include: major changes in vision, unusual eye movements; loss of balance or coordination; an d 
disorientation or confusion. Any patient  who is suspected of developing PML will be discontinued 
from the study treatment and the AE will be followed  closely, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Number of patient s: Approximately 282 patient s will be randomized into the study, at 
approximately 70 investigative centers . 
Diagnosis and  main criteria for 
inclusion:  Male and female patient s aged between 18 and 80  with severe RA

The PK analysis will be p erformed on the PK Analysis Set . The PK parameters, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-, AUC 0-
d15, Cmax after the second infusion on Day 15  and Ctrough before the second infusion on Day 15 will be 
consid ered the co-primary PK endpoints.  All other PK endpoints will be regarded as secondary . 
The statistical analysis of the log e-transformed primary endpoints will be based on an analysis of variance 
model. The difference in least squares means between each of the three pairs  (SAIT101  vs. MabThera®, 
SAIT101  vs. Rituxan®, and MabThera® vs. Rituxan® )  and the associated 90% confidenc e interval ( CI) 
will be determined.  Back transformation will provide the ratio of geometric means and 90% CI for this 
ratio. Equivalence will be concluded if the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means of each of the three 
pairs  for primary endpoints  are completely contained within the accep tance interval of 0.8 to 1.25.  
Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), minimum, median, and 
maximum) will be used to summarize serum concentration data by treatment at ea ch planned sampling 
time point.  Concentra tions that are below the lower limit of quantification will be assigned a value of 0 
for the purposes of computing descriptive statistics. Serum PK parameters calculated from the 
concentration -time data will also be summarized by treatment using descriptiv e statistics.  
Plots of the mean and individual serum rituximab concentrations over time for SAIT101 and MabThera® 
or Rituxan® will be provided following i.v. infusion s.  
Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Observed, change from Baseline, and percent change from Baseline in CD19+ B cell counts, depletion 
incidence for CD19+ B cell counts , time needed to B cell depletion , duration of CD19+ B cell depletion  
and IgG, IgM, IgA, CRP levels  will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Efficacy Analyses  
The change from Baseline in DAS28 at Week 24 will be considered the main  efficacy endpoint.  
Two-sided 95% CI for the difference between SAIT101 and MabThera® in DAS28 change from Baseline 
at Week 24 will be computed from an analysis of covariance using Bas eline DAS28 as covariate and 
treatment as model factors. Equivalence will be concluded if the 95% CI for the mean difference for main  
endpoint is completely contained with the equivalence margin of -0.6 to 0.6. Both of the per protocol (PP) 
set and full an alysis set (FAS) will be considered as the efficacy analysis  population and no missing data 
will be imputed for the efficacy analyses in FAS . 
Continuous variables will be summarized using N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  
Safety Analyses  
All reported terms for AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA) . No statistical testing will be performed for AEs. For  all AE and SAE tables, patient s will be 
counted at most once for each Preferred T erm (PT) and each System Organ Class (SOC) . Adverse events 
will be summarized by the number and percentage of patient s experiencing events by SOC , PT and 
severity.  
Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory measurements will be summarized descriptively by visit. 
Other safety variables will be summarized and listed.  
Immunogenicity Analyses  
Incidence of HACA and neutralizing antibody and summary of c ounts of antibodies per patient  at prior 
first dose on Day 1 and at Week 1, 2, 4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 52 will be summarized overall and by treatment 
group.  
Interim Analysis  
Interim Analyses of 10 patients per group ( 30 patients in total) of safety data collected up to Week 4 and 
20 patients per group ( 60 patients in total) of safety data collected up to Week 12 are planned.

The study will be unblinded at Week 24 and an interim CSR will be prepared based on the 24-week da ta 
of all patients. The investigators and patients will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the post 
Week 24 follow -up period .  
Sample Size 
A percentage co -efficient of variation (CV%) ranging from 26.3 to 37.3% for the five co -primary 
parameters is assumed for this study based on a recent study in RA patient s treated with rituximab.  
When the evaluable sample size in each group is 84, a three group design will have 81% power to reject 
both the null hypothesis that the ratio of test to standard geometrics means is below 0.800, and the null 
hypothesis that the ratio of test to standard geometrics means is above 1.250 (i.e., that the test and standard 
are not equivalent), in favor of the al ternative hypothesis, that the means of the two groups are equivalent, 
assuming that the expected ratio of means is 1.000, the CV% for the standard is 0.330, that data will be 
analyzed in the log scale using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and that each one s ided test is made at the 
5% level. Each of the 15 hypotheses tests (five co -primary endpoints × three pairwise  compar isons ) are 
powered at  98% to  99.0% to yield 81% study -wide power.  
Approximately 282 patient s (94 patient s per group) will be randomized in order to yield a minimum of 
84 patient s per group  to account for a presumed 10% withdraw al.  
This 94 patients in SAIT101 group and MabThera® group will provide 96% probability of declaring the 
equivalence in FAS  with each  one sided test at the 2.5% level , accounting for a presumed 1.0 standard 
deviation of DAS28 from the REFLEX study, and the equivalence margin of -0.6 to 0.6 chosen as the half 
of a clinical meaningful improvement of 1.2 in DAS28. Considering 18% withdraw from the REFLEX 
study, approximately 77 patients per group will provide approximately 91% probability of declaring the 
equivalence in the PP set.

1.1 Background  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized  by 
inflammation in the synovium of joints, which is associated with progressive joint 
destruction, and depending on the severity, may be accompanied by systemic 
manifestations including lung disease, rheumatoid nodules , and effect s on the 
cardiovascular s ystem.  If left untreated, RA may lead to severe functional disabilities, and 
therefore a considerable reduction in quality of life for the patient .1,2 The prevalence of RA 
is relatively constant in many populations, at 0.5  to 1%, but can vary with factors such as 
gender, race and smoking status .3 
B lymphocytes (B cells) are  thought to contribute considerably to the pathogenesis of RA. 
B cells contribute to the formation of immune complexes and complement activation in 
affected joints as they are the  primary source of rheumatoid factors (RFs)  and anti-cyclic 
citrullinated peptide (anti -CCP)  antibodies. They are highly efficient antigen -presenting 
cells and therefore contribute to the auto -immune response through downstream activation 
of T cells via co -stimulatory molecules. B cells respond to, and produce, chemokines and 
cytokines that promote lymphocyte infiltration into joints, formation of ectopic lymphoid 
structures, angiogenesis, and synovial hyperplasia that characterize  the pathology observed 
in the rheumatoid joint .4  
Traditionally, RA has been treated with a combination of anti -inflammatory agents and 
disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). While therapeutic opt ions have 
improved  with the introduction of biologic  DMARDs,  neutralizing  cytokines such as tumor 
necrosis fac tor (TNF) and interleukin -1 (IL -1) which have been shown to both control signs 
and symptoms of joint inflammation and retard p rogression of joint destruction,  targeting 
other mediators and pathways might improve the overall response rate. Although TNF - 
antagonists and other biologic therapies represent an important advance in the management 
of patient s with RA, there remains a significant unmet medical need fo r effective novel 
therapies given the significant non -responder rates and well -documented systemic 
toxicities of the traditional treatments.  
1.2 Overview of SAIT101  
SAIT101 is a proposed biosimilar product rituximab  being developed by  Archigen Biotech . 
Similar  to rituximab,  SAIT101 has 1,328 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 
145 kDa with a similar glycan profile to rituximab , and is a  genetically engineered chimeric 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  22 Confidential  human/mouse glycosylated monoclonal antibody specific to  the human antigen CD20 
expressed on lymphocytes. SAIT101 consists of human IgG1 heavy  and kappa light chain 
constant regions, and murine heavy and light chain variable regions,  which is similar  to 
rituximab .4,5,6,7 It is produced by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  cell suspension culture and 
purified by various affinity and ion exchange chromatography steps  that include specific viral 
inactivation and removal procedures.  
SAIT101 has been demonstrated to be similar to MabThera® (rituximab licensed in the 
European Union) and Rituxan® (rituximab licensed in the United States) in the extensive 
similarity studies using state -of-art techniques. Quality and in vitro characterization studie s 
have been performed to date.  
An in vitro stu dy confirmed that SAIT101 has similar pharmacological actions to rituximab , 
resulting from its binding to CD20 -positive antigen. In vivo efficacy studies using murine 
xenograft models confirmed similar profiles of tumor suppression activity for SAIT101, 
MabThera® and Rituxan®. 
Pharmacokinetics  (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies in cynomolgus monkeys have 
also shown similarity of PK/PD profiles between SAIT101 and rituximab . Furthermore, 
the single - and repeat -dose toxicity studies confirmed that SAIT101  did not show any 
toxicity at dose levels  up to 10 times higher than the clinical dose (~10 mg/kg). The single -
dose toxicity, repeat -dose toxicity, toxicokinetics and immunogenicity profiles of  SAIT101 
were similar to MabThera® and Rituxan®. 
Clinical Data of SAIT101  
The first clinical study with SAIT101 began in May 2011. S101 -NKR -001 was a 
first-in-human Phase I study conducted in 14 centers in Korea aimed to compare and assess 
PK and PD profiles, and preliminary efficacy and safety of SAIT101 compared to 
MabThera®, after intravenous (i.v.)  infusion of MabThera® or SAIT101. As of 
26 September 2011, a total of 24 diffuse large B  cell ly mphoma patient s had been 
randomized  to receive either SAIT101 ( proposed rituximab biosimilar) or MabThera® 
(rituximab, Roche) in combination with the chemotherapy regimen, CHOP 
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, v incristine, and prednisone ). 
Kim et al reporte d that t he ratio of geometric least square (GLS) mean (90% confidence 
interval, CI) of SAIT101 versus MabThera® were 0.92 (0.78  to 1.09) for AUC last and 0.93 
(0.78  to 1.13) for C max. The LS means change from baseline of B -cell (%) in SATI101 and 
MabThera® group were -7.7% and -8.0% respectively and the difference between two 
groups was 0.3% (90%CI, -0.9 to 1.4). The safety and efficacy profile of SAIT101 were 
not significantly differ ent from  MabThera®.9

27APR2017  23 Confidential  1.3 Comparator drug: Rituximab  
Rituximab is a genetically engineered recombinant chimeric human/murine antibody 
directed against the CD20 antigen. Following binding of CD20, rituximab triggers a 
cytotoxic immune response against CD20 -positive cells.  
Rituximab was initially developed by IDEC Pharmaceuticals.  Based on its safety and 
effectiveness in clinical studies , rituximab  was approved under the trade name Rituxan® 
by the US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) in 1997 to treat B  cell non -Hodgkin’s  
lymphomas  (NHL)  resistant to other chemotherapy regimens.  Rituximab, in combination 
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristi ne and prednisone  (CHOP ) chemotherapy, 
is now a standard therapy in the initi al treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 
many other B cell lymphomas.  It has been approved as a therapeutic agent for patient s with 
NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and  RA.10, 11 
Rituxan® was co -developed and marketed in the US (under the brand name Rituxan®) by 
Biogen Idec and Genentech (now a part of Roche). It is marketed outside the US by Roche 
under the brand name MabThera®. 
Antigen CD20 is a hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a m olecular weight of 
approximately 35 kDa located on pre -B and mature B lymphocytes.  The antigen is 
expressed on more than 90% of B cell NHL, but is not found on hematopoietic  system 
cells, pro -B cells, normal plasma cells , or other normal tissues. CD20 regu lates early step s 
in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions 
as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize  
upon antibody binding.  Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation.  
B cells are believed to play a role in the pathog enesis of RA and associated chronic 
synovitis.  In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the 
autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of RF an d other 
autoanti bodies, antigen presentation, T -cell activation and/or pro -inflammatory  cytokine 
production.  
The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc  
domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis.  Possible mechanisms of  
cell lysis include complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody -dependent  cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

27APR2017  24 Confidential  1.3.1  Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Rituximab  
In one of the Phase IIa double bl ind studies  conducted in RA patient s to evaluate the PK 
of rituximab, it was found that the mean areas under the plasma concentration –time curves 
for rituximab were si milar across treatment groups (rituximab alone, r ituximab in 
combina tion with cyclophosphamide and r ituximab in combination with methotrexate  
[MTX] ). The mean terminal half -life (t1/2) of 19 to 22 days was observed in r ituximab after 
the second infusion. Systemic clearance of rituximab was slow at 242, 226, and 221  mL/d 
in all 3 tre atment groups . The volume of distribution  (VD) of rituximab at steady state was 
low at 4.28 to 4.74 L and similar to normal plasma volume in all treatment group s. These 
data indicate that the PK characteristics of rituximab are not discernibly altered when  it is 
administered in combination with either cyclophosphamide or MTX . This observation is 
supportive of the contention that rituximab does not require dose adjustment s when 
administered  with either cyclo phosphamide or MTX .12 
1.3.2  Clinical Data of Rituximab  
In one  of the recent (2006) RA studies  conducted in 520 patient s to determine  the efficacy 
and safety of rituximab alo ng with MTX  in patients with active RA who had an inadequate 
response to anti -tumor necrosis factor (anti -TNF) therapies , it was found that patient s who 
received two 1,000 mg infusions of rituximab the Disease Activity Score (DAS)  improved 
-1.9 when compared with MTX alone ( -0.4%; p <0.0001 ) and met the American College 
of Rheumatology  (ACR)  20% improvement criteria ( achieved an ACR20 response) at 
Week 24, 51% when  compared with placebo  (18%; p <0.0001) .13, 14 
In another long-term safety study (2010) , it was observed that rituximab was well tolerated  
over time and multiple courses. Overall, the findings indicate d that there was no evidence 
of an increased safety risk or increased reporting rates of any types of AEs with prolonged 
exposure to rituximab .15

2.1 Study  Rationale  
SAIT101, as a proposed biosimilar of rituximab in pharmaceutical form, strength and 
administration route, is expected to play an importan t role in the treatment of RA. The 
substitution of rituximab by SAIT101 is expected to provide similar  efficacy, PK, PD, 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenici ty in patient s with  RA. The dose selected for this 
study is based on the clinically e ffective dose of rituximab.  
This study is to evaluate similarity in terms  of PK, PD, safety , efficacy, tolerability , and 
immunogenicity  between SAIT101 and rituximab and also to provide a benefit and risk 
profile of SAIT101.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the International Co uncil for  
Harmonization  (ICH) guidelines, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and  with all applicable and 
current regulatory requirements.

3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a multi cente r, randomized , double -blind, parallel group study to compare the  PK, 
PD, safety , efficacy, tolerability , and immunogenicity of SAIT101 versus  MabThera® 
versus  Rituxan® in patient s with  RA. This study will take place globally across 
approximately 70 study centers  in order to randomize approximately 282 patient s. The 
study consists of Part A from baseline for PK and efficacy analysis, followed by Part B 
from Week  24 to 52 for safety follow -up that also collects transition data.  
Patient s with  RA who have had an inadequate response to at least 3  months’ treatment 
(according to the approved treatment and dosage) or intolerance ( at Investigator's 
discretion and/or experience of severe adverse event [AE] or toxicity  such as infusion 
related reaction, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis or severe toxicity ) to anti -TNF therapy . All 
the Screening assessments should be performed within 30 da ys prior to randomization  on 
Day 1 (Visit 2, Baseline) , except in patient s who require prophylaxis of latent tuberculosis 
or a washout of current anti -TNF medication or other biologic and non -biologic DMARD 
treatment except MTX. For these patient s the Screening period may be extended to allow 
for the washout required, but will not exceed 60 days . In these patients all Screening 
assessments must be performed within 30 days prior to randomization  with the exception 
of the informed consent and chest X -ray (see Section  3.2.5). 
In Part A , patient s will be randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio  to receive one course of SAIT101 
(n=94) versus Rituxan® (n=94) versus MabThera® (n=94).  
At Week 24, patient s will be evaluated for a second course of the infusion.    
In Part B, e ligible patient s in the SAIT101 arm will receive the second course of  SAIT101 
treatment at Week s 24 and 26. Eligible patient s in the MabThera® arm will receive the 
second course of  MabThera® treatment at Week 24 and 26 . Eligible patient s in the Rituxan® 
arm will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAIT101  or Rituxan® treatment at Week s 
24 and 26 . Patient s will be followed up  for safety till Week  52. 
For each course of infusion, patient s will receive  two infusions of  1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) 
SAIT101 or Rituxan® or MabThera® for i.v. infusion  for the treatment.  
Patient s will continue to take their usual prescribed concomitant medications as allowed 
by the protocol. It is mandatory that doses of all RA medications (MTX, steroids and non-
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs [ NSAID ]) taken during the first 24 -week period must 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017

anti-histamine, e.g.,  paracetamol and diphenhydramine  or equivalent , 30 to 60 minutes 
before each infusion, plus 100  mg i.v. methyl prednisone  (or its equivalent)  at least 30  
minutes prior to each infusion . 
The study design  for individual patient s is schematically detailed in  Figure 1 . 
At each visit, blood PK and PD samples should be taken at the same time of day as the start 
of the first infusion, within a window of ± 10 minutes o f the determined time points of 
Days 1 , 3, 8, 15, 17 and ±  3 hours at all other time points. All patient s will be followed up 
for safety up to 52 weeks from the start date of the first infusion .

Standard arthritis  assessments  and safety assessments will be performed. A disease activity 
score based on a 28 joint count (DAS28) will be calculated by the study personnel at 
regularly scheduled visits. At least one experienced, independent joint assessor, blinded to 
other study asse ssments as well as the dosing regimen, will be identified at each study 
center  to perform the swollen and tender joint counts.  
A provision is made for patient s to initiate “rescue therapy ” with the use of one 
non-biologic DMARD  after Week 16 of the study ( see Section 3.2.6 ).

during Part B . Patient who are not eligible for the second course of study treatment will 
also attend all visits until week 52.  
Patient s may return for unscheduled visits if their medical conditio n requires immediate 
attention.  
To prevent missing data in important supportive efficacy and safety analysis, p atients who 
discontinu ed study treatment , will also attend all visits until week 52 .  
The primary safety concerns associated with rituximab are progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) , anaphylactic reactions, hepatitis reactivation , and severe 
mucocutaneous reactions .  Patient s will be monitored carefully for these during the study .  
Any patient  who is suspected of developing PML, anaphylactic reactions, hepatitis 
reactivation, and severe mucocutaneous reactions  will be discontinued from the study 
treatment and the AE will be followed clo sely, at the discretion of the I nvestigator.  
3.2 Treatments  
3.2.1  Test Product and Comparator , Dose and Mode of Administration  
SAIT101 is a sterile, clear to opalescent and colorless  or a pale yellow, preservative -free 
solution for i.v. infusion . The formulation of SAIT101 is  similar  to MabThera® or 
Rituxan®.  
Each patient  will be randomized  on Day  1 to receive one of three possible treatments ( study 
drug): 
• SAIT101:  1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) -Test product ; 
• Rituxan®: 1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) -Comparator ; 
• MabThera®: 1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) -Comparator . 
All patients received premedication with 100 mg i.v. methylprednisolone (or its 
equivalent), an antipyretic and an antihistaminic (e.g. acetaminophen and 
diphenhydramine) per the accepted infusion protocols for rituximab  prior to study drug 
infusions to de crease incidence rate and severity of acute infusion -related reactions . 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  32 Confidential  Since hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to 
withholding anti -hypertensive medications 12 hours prior to the infusion.  
The Day 1 infusion  rate (both week 0 and week 24 ) of SAIT101 or MabThera® or Rituxan® 
will start at 50 mg/hour; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in 50 mg/hour 
increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/ hour. If there has been no infusion 
related reaction on Day 1, t he Day 15 infusion  (both  first and second  course s) can be 
infused at 100 mg/hour and increased by 100 mg/hour increments at 30 minute intervals, 
to a maximum of 400  mg/hour.  
The recommended infusion rates are presented in Table 1.

***Allowed window for infusion rate time: For each time point: ± 5 minutes (e.g. when start 50 mg/h for 
first course: 25~35 minutes  can be allowed).  
In the event that a patient  experiences an infusion -related react ion or an adverse drug 
reaction (ADR ), the infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate (e.g., from 100  mg/hour 
to 50 mg/hour). Once the infusion -related reaction or ADR has resolved, the Investigator 
should wait an additional 30 minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate. If 
tolerated, the rate may be increased to the next closest rate on the patient ’s infusion 
schedule. Please refer to the following examples : 
(Example 1) An infusion -related react ion or an ADR  at a rate of 50 mg/h  → change rate 
to 25 mg/h  → reaction resolved → additional 30 minutes  at a rate of 25 mg/h → change 
back to 50 mg/h .

to 150 mg/h  → reaction resolved → additional 30 minutes  at a rate of 150 mg/h  → change 
back to 200 mg/h . 
Drug infusions will take place under the close supervision of an experienced physician, 
and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available . 
Although the study drug may be administered on an outpatie nt basis, patient s may be 
hospitalized for observation at the discretion of the Investigator, and such instances of 
planned hospitalization will NOT be recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE).    
Any drugs that are used to manage hypersensitivity reaction s or ADRs, including  but not 
limited to epinephrine, antihistamine , and corticosteroid, should be immediately available 
in case of emergency.  
Attention should be given to the development of anaphylaxis during infusion  of the study 
drug. When an anaphylactic reaction is suspected during infusion of the study drug:  
• Discontinue the study drug.  
• Apply a tourniquet close to the infusion site in order to slow systemic absorption of 
the study drug.  Do not block artery flow.  
• Perform appropriate airway ma nagement.  
• If required, administer antihistamine, epinephrine, or other drugs.  
• Closely monitor the patient  and document the observations.  
Patient s who experience a moderate to severe infusion -related reaction (fever, chills or 
hypotension), should have thei r infusion interrupted immediately and should receive 
aggressive symptomatic treatment, such as glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators 
or oxygen, as per local practice. Depending on the severity of the infusion reaction and the 
required intervention s, patient s should either have their infusion temporarily interrupted or 
be discontinued from the study  treatment . The infusion should not be restarted before all 
the symptoms have disappeared, and then it should be restarted at half the rate. If the patie nt 
tolerates the reduced rate for 30 minutes then the infusion rate may be increased to the next 
closest rate on the patient ’s infusion schedule. If the subject does not tolerate the reduced 
rate for at least 30 minutes or, if the same severe ( NCI-CTCAE Grade 3) infusion reaction 
occur s for a second time,  the patient  can be discontinued from the study  treatment .

27APR2017  34 Confidential  At the end of each infusion, the i.v. line is recommended to remain in place for at least 
1 hour to allow infusion  of i.v. drugs if necessary. If n o AE occurs during this time, the i.v. 
line may be removed.  
3.2.2  Study Drug Administration (Part A)  
First Infusion (Day 1  of First Course ) 
The first infusion rate  of SAIT101 or MabThera® or Rituxan® will be 50 mg/hour; after the 
first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in 50 mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a 
maximum of 400 mg/ hour (see Table 1). 
Second Infu sion (Day 15  of First Course ) 
Patient s who experienced infusion -related reactions to the first infusion should receive 
study drug  as per the initial infusion schedule, with the rate of infusion not exceeding half 
that associated with the prior reactions. I f this reduced rate is tolerated for 30 minutes, then 
the infusion rate may be increased to the next closest rate following the infusion schedule.  
Patient s who miss the allocated day (Day 15 ± 1 day) for the second infusion (the first 
infusion will be  admi nistered following randomization  on Day  1) will be contacted and 
another visit arranged as soon as practically possible in order to ad minister study drug . 
Such cases will be considered  protocol deviations (see Section  3.13). 
If a patient  experiences a new infection or other AE between the Day 1 and Day  15 
infusions of any treatment , the Day 15 infusion should be delayed until the  infection or AE 
has completely resolved and the Investigator considers it safe to resume treatment. A 
maximum delay of 15 days from the scheduled date of the second infusion is permitted. 
Patient s who have a delay of >15 days in receiving the second infus ion due to an AE or 
otherwise will be discontinued from the study  treatment .

Patients with  active  rheumatoid arthritis (<50% improvement from Baseline  in both the 
swollen and tender joint counts)  who have been followed up during Part A will be provided 
with continued (or additional) treatment of rituximab.   
Before subsequent dose, absolute neutrophil count must be ≥1.5  × 109/L and platelet counts 
must b e ≥75  × 109/L. If the Absolute Neutrophil Count  (ANC ) value  and platelet count  are 
marginally lower , re-testing at an unscheduled visit may be performed at the discretion of 
the Investigator within the 4 -week period between Week 20 and Week 24. In case Vis it 11 
is missed, all safety evaluations including ANC value  and platelet count  must be completed 
as an unscheduled visit for patient  to be eligible for second course of infusion.  
Eligible patient s in the SAIT101 arm will receive additional SAIT101 treatment at Week  24 
and Week 26. Eligible patient s in the MabThera® arm will receive additional MabThera® 
treatment at Week 24 and Week 26. Eligible patient s in the Rituxan® arm will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAIT101  or Rituxan® treatment at Week 24 and Week 
26. 
Patient s who develop an infusion reaction during the second course of treatment should be 
managed as described in Section  3.2.1 . 
Patient  who are not eligible for the second course of study drug  will also attend all visits 
after Week 24.  
3.2.4  Dosage Modification  
Dose modification of rituximab  is not permitted during this study.  In the event of an 
infusion -related reaction, the rate of infusion may be adjusted (see Section 3.2.1 ). Patient s 
who experience a life -threateni ng event, as considered by the I nvestigator, during an 
infusion of study drug  should have their infusion stopped and no furth er infusions sh ould 
be administered .

27APR2017  36 Confidential  3.2.5  Allowed Concomitant Medication  
It is mandatory  that all doses of all RA medications  (MTX, steroid s and NSA IDs) taken 
during the first 24 -week period  (Part A) must remain stable.  
Patient s will continue to take their usual prescribed co ncomitant medications as allowed 
by the protocol, including MTX ( 7.5 to 25 mg/week ) and folic or folinic acid, from their 
usual  source , according to local standards and availability .  
All patient s should also continue to receive if there is any bac kground oral corticosteroids 
(≤10 mg/day prednisone  or equivalent) or NSAIDs. During the 4 weeks (for oral 
corticosteroids) or 3 weeks (for NSAIDs) prior to Day 1, the dose s must remain  stable.   
If clin ically required for safety reasons, modifications to doses of MTX, corticosteroids 
and NSAIDs will be allowed. The I nvestigator must use the procedures outlined below in 
making modifications to these medications and document all changes and the reason for 
the changes should be documented in the patient ’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Methotrexate : Dose of MTX should remain stable throughout the study . Reductions for 
MTX dose or a change of route of administration may be performed after visit at Week  24 
for safety  reasons  only.  
Lower doses of MTX (<10 mg/week) are only permitted if patient s have a documented 
evidence of intolerance to higher doses of MT X. 
If dose reduction is a result of intolerance, such intolerance must be recorded as an AE and 
the dose modification recorded in the eCRF.  
Oral corticosteroids: If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids (other than 
intra-articular or parenteral corticosteroids), the dose must not exceed 10 mg/day 
prednisone  or equival ent. The dose should remain stable from 4 weeks prior to 
randomization throughout t he study . From Visit 12 at Week  24, reductions in these 
treatments will be allowed  only for safety reasons . Increases in corticosteroids for treatment 
of RA are not allowed over the study period and should be avoided. To treat non -RA 
conditions, increased doses of oral corticosteroids, up to 40 mg of prednisone  daily (or 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  37 Confidential  equivalent), for 2 we eks or less will be permitted. The corticosteroid dose should be tapered 
down to the previous level as rapidly as medically possible.  
NSAIDs:  Patient s may be treated with NSAIDs, up to the maximum recommended dose, 
(including cyclooxygenase -2 inh ibitors) throughout the study . The choice and doses of 
NSAIDs used to treat patient s are at the discretion of the I nvestigator. Patient s on NSAIDs 
at Screening  should continue at a stable dose from 3 weeks prior to randomization 
throughout the study . The dose and type of NSAID may be changed after Visit 12 at W eek 
24 of the study. Aspirin may be taken to reduce cardiovascular risk, but should not exceed 
350 mg/day.  NSAIDs or other analgesics for treatment of conditions other than RA may 
be used for short periods not exceeding 7  days.  
3.2.6  Rescue Therapy  
From Week  16, patient s who have less than a 20% improvement in both tender and swollen 
joint counts compared to Baselin e (<ACR20) may receive “rescue” treatment with one 
non-biologic DMARD. The patient  will be discontinued  from the study treatment and t he 
choice of DMARD is at the discretion of the Investigator, but could be hydroxychloroquine 
or sulfasalazine. Patient s receiving “rescue ” medication attend all visits until week 52 . 
The following medications are not permitted for use as “rescue”  treatment: azathioprine, 
mycophenolate mofetil, cyc lophosphamide , cyclosporine  or any  biologic agent . Any 
patient  requiring medication mentioned above,  should be discontinued from study 
treatment but will  attend all visits until week 52.

• The most recent IM/intra -articular steroid injection should be 6 weeks  prior  to Day 1.  
• If receiving current treatment with NSAIDs at the time of Screening, the patient  must remain on a 
stable dose for at least 3 weeks prior to Day 1.  
• Patient s are willing to receive oral folic or folinic acid or equivalent during the entire study  
(mandatory co -medication for MTX treatment) , according to local standards and availability . 
5 Men and women of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception during the 
course of the treatment period and for at least 12  months after the last infusion of study drug.  A man or 
women is of childbearing potential if, in the o pinion of the investigator, he or she is biologically capable 
of having children and is sexually active.  Examples of highly effective contraception include:  
• combined (estrogen  and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition 
of ovulation 1: 
– oral 
– intravaginal  
– transdermal  
• progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 1:  
– oral 
– injectable  
– implantable 2 
• intrauterine devic e (IUD) 2 
• intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS) 2 
• bilateral tubal occlusion 2 
• vasectomised partner 2,3 
• sexual abstinence 4 
1 Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraception method.  
2 Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user 
dependency.  
3 Vasectomise d partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole 
sexual partner of the study participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical 
assessment of the surgical success.  
4 In the context of this guidance sexu al abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if 
defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  40 Confidential  study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
6 Female patient s of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening 
(Visit  1) and a negative urine pregnancy test at each applicable visit thereafter. Females will be 
considered to be of non -childbearing potential if they fulfill one of the following criteria at Screening:  
• Postmenopausal  defined as amenorrheic  for at least 12 mon ths following cessation of all exogenous 
treatments  
• Documentation of irreversible surgical sterili zation by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or

immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  
 
3.4.4  Patient  Withdrawal  
All patient s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice to further treatment. If the withdrawn 
patients meet the PK data set, then those patients can be included in the PK analysis .  
Patient s will be withdrawn from the study in the following circumstances:  
• The patient  withdraw s consent to contribute additional outcome information or is lost 
to follow -up despite reasonable efforts to make contact with the patient   
Adverse events will be followed up as detailed in Section  5.10. Investigators are 
encouraged to discuss the patient ’s case with the Sponsor p hysician or rep resentative to 
agree upon appropriate action.  
3.5 Measures to Minimize /Avoid Bias  
The treatment groups will be blinded to minimize  any bias that could be introduced  by 
knowle dge of the treatment by either I nvestigator or patient , which is especially important 
given that many of the efficacy and safety measures are subjective. Potential bias will be 
further minimized  by identifying at least one experienced, blinded, jo int assessor at each 
study center  who will be independent of the rest of the study team. This person will perform 
the swollen and tender joint counts without access to any other study -related outcomes. 
The parallel group design takes into account the progressive nature of RA.  
3.5.1  Blinding  
This will be a double -blind study. Patient s, Investigators, the joint assessor and other site 
personnel will remain blinded throughout the entire Study Period  except for the study 
pharmacist or designee . The study will be unblinded at week 24 to facilitate th e primary 
analysis although investigators and patients remain blinded to treatment assignment during 
the post week 24 follow -up period.  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  43 Confidential  The interactive voice / web response system ( IXRS) will be used to manage randomization  
to treatment groups in a blinded manner. This includes maintaining the blind for those 
patient s who are eligible to receive a furt her course of study drug . 
To ensure blinding of the treatments, the SAIT101, Rituxan® and MabThera® should only 
be managed by  the pharmacist or designee from the time of reception till the time the 
prepared infusion is dispensed to the blind study team.  
The SAIT101 , Rituxan® and MabThera® solutions will be provided in a blinded manner to 
the blinded Investigator’s  team.  Patient s will receive the i.v. drug infusions in the same 
manner regardless of the treatment group they are randomized  to. All details will be 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
3.5.2  Randomizatio n 
Patient s will be assigned a unique patient  number at Screening. The patient  number will be 
used to re gister the patient  using the IXRS and the patient  will then be randomized  (in a 
1:1:1 ratio) to either  SAIT101, Rituxan® or MabThera®.  
Eligible patient s in the SAIT101 arm will receive the second course of  SAIT101 treatment 
at Week s 24 and 26. Eligible patient s in the MabThera® arm will receive the second course 
of MabThera® treatment at Week s 24 and 26 . Eligible patient s in the Rituxan® arm will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAIT101  or Rituxan® treatment at Week s 24 and 26 . 
This randomization  will occur according to a computer -generated randomization  scheme. 
This will randomize  patient s at study level . If patient s are withdrawn the patient  number 
will not be re -used.  
At the time of study drug  infusion  the Investigator or designee will contact the IXRS and 
a Medication ID  will be provided. These codes will indicate which vials should be allocated 
to the patient . Further details on using the I XRS system are presented in the IXRS manual.  
3.5.3  Unblinding Procedure  
The IXRS will be used to break the blind and details on how to do this are provid ed in the 
IXRS manual. Investigators are strongly discouraged from requesting that the blind be 
broken for an individual patient , unless there is a patient  safety issue that requires 
unblinding and would change patient  management. If the blind is broken, it may be broken  
only for the patient  in question  and the patient  must b e discontinued from the study  
treatment . If time permits, before requesting that the blind be broken for an individual 
patient , the Investigator should discuss the situation with the Sponsor or design ee via phone 
or e-mail. The Sponsor  or designee  must be notified immediately if a patient  and/or 
Investigator is unblinded during the course of the study along with the reason for breaking 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  44 Confidential  the blind.  Pertinent information regarding the circumstances of unblinding of a patient ’s 
treatment code must be documented in the patient ’s source documents and IXRS . This 
includes who performed the unblinding, the patient (s) affected, the reason for the 
unblinding,  the date of the unblinding and the relevant study drug  information.  The 
Investigator should ensure that the appropriate measurements are taken at the study center  
to maintain the blinding of the study.  
3.5.4  Unblinding for Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis o f 10 patients per arm ( 30 patients in total) of safety data collected up  
to Week 4 and 20 patients per arm (60 patients in total) of safety data collected up  to 
Week 12 are planned. Safety data will be handled by unblinded study team in CRO for 
interim analysis (see Section 6.9).  The study wi ll be unblinded at W eek 24 and an interim 
CSR will be prepared based on the 24 -week data of all patients. The investigators and 
patients will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the post Week 24 fol low-up 
period.  
For review  purposes, the DSMB members will be unblinded to treatment assignment (see 
Section 3.6.7 ).

e Neurological examination for signs and symptoms of PML.  
f Blood pressure measurement can be performed prior to drug infusion. To be measured after the patient has been in a sitting/ly ing down position for at least 5 
minutes.  During all infu sions of study drug , vital signs will be  assessed  at the following time p oints:  pre -infusion (within 10  minutes prior to the start of the 
infusion); at the start of infusion (within 30 minutes after the start of the infusion); and at the end of infusion (within 1 0 minutes from the end of the infusion).  
Additional readings may  be taken at the discretion of the Investigator in the event of an infusion -related reaction.  
g Posterior -anterior and lateral chest X -rays (or chest radiographs in accordance with local requirements) should be obtained and reviewed by the Investigator 
or designee. If chest radiographs taken within the past 3 months show no clinically significant abn ormality, and there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of 
pulmonary disease that would exclude the patient  from the study, then a chest radiograph does not need to be repeated. Chest X -rays may be repeated at any

analysis. Patients receiving rescue therapy prior to Week 24 would not be eligible for 
second  course of infusion . 
• Patient s who meet any of the following specific safety discontinuation criteria , 
however can be included for the PK analysis : 
− Patient s who develop severe infusion -related reactions, especially sev ere dyspnea, 
bronchospasm or hypoxia, should have the infusion interrupted immediately to 
receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. In all patient s, the infusion should not 
be restarted on the same day until complete resolution of all symptoms. At this time, 
the infusion may be initially resumed at the discretion of the Investigator  at not 
more than one -half the previous rate. If the same ADRs occur  for a second time, 
the infusion should be permanently discontinued.  
− Active TB  
− Invasive fungal infection or opportunistic infection including, but not limited to, 
listeriosis, legionellosis or pneumocystis.  
− Hepatitis B virus reactivation, in some cases re sulting in  fulminant hepatitis, or 
hepatic failure

− PML. Neurological warning signs inc lude: major changes in vision, unusual eye 
movements; loss of balance or coordination; and disorientation or confusion  
− Cancer: any malignant lesion. Patient s with basal cell and squamous cell 
carcinomas of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix  uteri that has been excised 
and cured, may be continued on the study at the discretion of the Investigator.  
− Pregnancy in a female participant  
− Patient  lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts to make contact with the patient  
− Patient s who have a delay of >15 d ays in receiving the second infusion due to an 
AE or otherwise  
• Judgment by the Investigator or Sub -investigator that study treatment discontinuation 
is necessary for reasons other than those described above.  
To prevent missing data in important supportive efficacy and safety analysis, patients who 
discontinued study drug, will also attend all visits until week 52.  
3.8 Screen Failures  
A screen failure patient  is a patient  who provided written informed consent (i .e., the patient  
signs an informed consent form [ ICF]), but fail ed to meet all the i nclusion criteria or who 
meets  any of the exclusion criteria or withdraw s consent prior to randomization . The reason 
for screen failure will be documented in the source document s. 
Patient s are only allowed to be re -screen ed once and it should be performed in consultation 
with the Sponsor or representative.  
Laboratory tests if marginally abnormal may be repeated once at the discretion of the  
Investigator  during the S creening period if the patient  does not meet the criteria the first 
time.  If the patient  fails the laboratory criteria a second time, they will be considered a 
screen  failure.  Re-testing may only be done at the central laboratory  except for ESR . 
3.9 Re-screening  
Re-screening may be required if a patient  has not met all the eligibility criteria . Patient s are 
only allowed to be re -screened once and it should be  performed  in consultation with the 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  68 Confidential  Sponsor or representative . Each patient  must give written informed cons ent before re -
screening occurs.  
3.10 Definition of Completed Patient s 
In this study, patient s who complete at least the first course of study drug in Part A  and 
undergo the tests and assessments at Week 52  will be defined as study completers.  
3.11 Definition of Patients Lost to Foll ow-up 
Lost to follow -up is defined  as a patient  who stops attending study visits and study 
personnel are unable to contact the patient . 
To prevent lost to follow -up, several approaches should be  implemented to retain patients 
who fail to actively maintain contact with the investigator (e.g., telephone calls to friends 
or family members, emails, offers for transportation to the clinic, etc.).  
If a patient  is lost to follow -up, every possible effor t must be made by the study center  
personnel to contact the patient  and determine the reason for withdrawal . The measures 
taken to follow up must be documented.  
3.12 Treatment Compliance  
The administration (dose, frequency and dates) of all concomitant medicati ons (including 
new medications taken during the study and investigational product) should be recorded in 
the appropriate sections of the eCRF from Visit  1. 
The infusion schedule  consists of  two 1,000 mg i.v. drug infusions of either SAIT101 or 
MabThera® or Rituxan® (the first on Day 1 and the second on Day 15) with the possibility 
of a further course of two 1,000 mg infusions (see Section 3.2.1). The study drugs  will be 
administered  at the study center . This should guarantee that ful l compliance was achieved, 
provided the patient  attended the appropriate visits. Patient s who miss the allocated day for 
the second of their two infusions will be contacted and another visit arranged as soon as 
practically possible in order to administer t he missed do se of the study drug . 
The prescribed dosage, timing, and mode of administration of the study drug may not be 
changed. Any departures from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Patient s exhibiting poor compliance as assessed by att endance to appointments for their 
drug infusions should be counseled  on the importance of good compliance to the study 
dosing regimen.

27APR2017  69 Confidential  3.13 Protocol Deviations  
This study  is intended to be conducted as described in this protocol. In the event of a 
significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake  (e.g., 
violation of the informed consent process, study drug  dispensing or patient  dosing error,  
treatment assignment error, patient  enrolled in violation of eligibility criteria or 
concomi tant medication criteria), the I nvestigator or Sub-investigator  must contact the 
Sponsor  at the earliest possible time.  This will allow an early joint decision reg arding the 
patient ’s continuation of study treatment . This decision will be documented by the 
Investigator  and confirmed by the S ponsor.

4.1 Measures Regarding Patient s Being Treated  or Scheduled for 
Treatment at a nother Department or Hospital  
When o btaining informed consent, the I nvestigator or Sub-investigator  will confirm with 
the patient  whether they are being treated or are scheduled for treatment at another 
department or hospital and note any drugs that they are using. If the patient  is being treated 
by another physician (receiving treatment at another department or medical institution) , the 
Investigator  or Sub-investigator will contact the treating physician and inform them of the 
patient ’s participation in the study  and provide information on the study drug . In addition 
to obtaining and recording the information on the medications pres cribed at the other 
department or hospital, the appropriateness of the patient ’s study  participation or 
continuation in the study will be decided.

Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  72 Confidential  Table 5 List of Medications Permitted During the Study  
Treatment  Restriction  
Methotrexate  Patient s must be taking MTX at a dose of 7.5-25 mg/week (oral or 
parenteral) throughout the study and for at least 12 weeks prior to study 
entry. Patient s receiving a lower dose of MTX (<10 mg/week) should be 
doing so as a result of a documented evidence of intoleran ce to higher doses 
of MTX. The d ose and route of administration should remain stable from 4 
weeks prior to randomization and where possible, throughout the entire 
study period.  
Folic or folinic acid  Patient s must be taking oral folic or folinic  acid or equivalent during  the 
entire study (mandatory co -medication for MTX treatment), according to 
local standards and availability . The dosing regimen is at the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
Antipyretics  Patient s will receive an anti pyretic, e.g., parace tamol  or equivalent , 30 to 60 
minutes before each drug infusion.  
Antihistamines  Patient s will receive an anti histamine, e.g., diphenhydramine or equivalent, 
30 to 60 minutes before each drug infusion.  
Oral corticosteroids  If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids at the time of 
Screening (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) , the dose must remain 
stable during the 4 weeks prior to Day  1. Increases in corticosteroids for 
treatment of RA are not allowed over th e study period and should be avoided 
(see Section 3.2.5). 
Reductions in the dose of corticosteroids will be allowed as clinically 
required only for safety reasons.  
Intravenous or 
intramuscular 
corticosteroids  Use of  i.v. or intramuscular corticosteroids for RA will be considered 
worsening of a patient ’s condition from Baseline and should be recorded as 
an AE in the eCRF.  
The only exception will be the administration of 100  mg i.v. 
methylprednisone or equivalent withi n 30 minutes before each infusion as 
part of the study procedures.  
Intra -articular 
corticosteroids  Injection of intra -articular steroids during the study period is discouraged, 
but may be used in a limited fashion. Joints inject ed within 8  weeks prior to 
Week 24 and Week 52 will cause the exclusion of the joint from the 
subsequent efficacy analysis and therefore should be avoided. No more than 
1 joint per 24 -week period may be injected during the study period. No 
single injection should exceed 40 mg of triamcinolone (or equivalent) and 
the total dose of intra -articular corticosteroid may not exceed 80 mg of 
triamcinolone (or equivalent) during any 52-week period.  
Inhaled/topica l/ophthalmic 
steroids  Limited uses of these preparations are allowed during the study.  
NSAIDs  Patient s may be treated with NSAIDs, up to the maximum recommended 
dose, (including cyclooxygenase -2 inhibitors) throughout the study. The 
choice and doses of NS AIDs used to treat patient s is at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Increases in the NSAID dose are not allowed over the study 
period and should be avoided. After Week 24, dose adjustments may be 
made only for safety reasons, and if absolutely required t o treat disease 
flares, according to the Investigators’ normal practices. Dose adjustments in 
NSAIDs cannot be made within 24  hours of a study visit. Aspirin may be 
taken to reduce cardiovascular risk, not to exceed 350 mg/day.

27APR2017  74 Confidential  5 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.1 Adverse Event  (AE) 
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigation 
patient  administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have 
a causal relationship with this treatment. ” 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or d isease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
5.2 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
A SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• results in death;  
• is life-threatening.  The term “life -threatening event” refers to an event in which the 
patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to  an event which  
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ; 
• requires inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization : Hospital 
admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not 
considered AEs if the il lness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the 
study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.  
Hospitalizations required purely for the purposes of performin g study procedures are 
not SAEs;  
• results in pe rsistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity;  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect , which includes ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous 
abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, or neonatal death.  In addition, infant death after 1 
month should be reported as a SAE when the investigator assesses the infant death as 
related or possibly related to exposure to investigational product ; 
• any other medically or scientifically significant event that, although it may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization , endangers the 
patient  or requires that appropriate measures be taken to avoid any of the events listed 
above ( e.g., bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment, blood dyscrasia or 
convulsion not requiring hospitalization , drug dependency or abuse).  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  75 Confidential  5.3 Adverse Drug Reactions  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as a noxious and unintended response to a 
medicinal product related to any dose.  
AEs which meet all of the following criteria:  
• Serious  
• Unexpected (i.e. is not consistent with the cu rrently applicable Investigator Brochure 
list of AEs)  
• There is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between 
the event and the medicinal product  
will be classified as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) and 
should be reported to the relevant ethics committee and to the relevant Health Authorities 
for expedited reporting in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
5.4 Adverse Event of Special Interest  (AESI)  
An AE of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the study drug and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by the Investigator t o the Sponsor and/or Quintiles IMS. An AESI may be 
serious or non -serious.  The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these 
events in order to characterize and understand them in association wi th the use of this study 
drug. All AESIs must be reported in an expedited manner s imilar to SAEs (i .e., non -serious 
AESIs also must follow serious timelines).  
The following will be considered AESIs in this study:  PML , hepatitis reactivation, 
mucocutaneous reactions, infusion reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and serious infections.  
5.4.1  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  
The Investigator is required to monitor the patients throughout the study for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML. Typical 
symptoms are diverse, and include cognitive or  visual disorders, hemiparesis, confus ion, 
and behavioral disorders. If a patient develops new or worsening neurological signs or 
symptoms, he/ she will be evaluated for PML. Neurological warning signs include:  
• Major changes in vision, unusual eye movements.  
• Loss of balance or coordination.  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  76 Confidential  • Disorientation or confusion.  
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded.  
Consultation with a neurologist should be consi dered as clinically indicated. If any doubt 
exists, f urther evaluation, including an MRI scan (preferably with contrast), cerebrospinal 
fluid testing for John Cunningham viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and repeat 
neurological assessments, should be considered.  
The Sponsor must be notified of any suspected PML cases within 24 hours of awareness 
according to the procedure outlined in the Site Manual. If any patient reports PML during 
the study, the patient must be discontinued  from study treatment  and followed up until 
resolution at the discretion o f the Investigator.  
5.4.2  Hepatitis Reactivation  
If a patient develops reactivation of HBV while on rituximab, the patient should be 
managed as outlined in Section 3.2.7.  
5.4.3  Serious Infections  
Serious infections are defined as infections requiring i.v. antibiotics or meeting the 
definition of an SAE.  
5.4.4  Mucocutaneous Reactions  
Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, can occur in pa tients treated with 
rituximab. These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, 
lichenoid dermatitis, v esiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epiderm al necrolysis. The onset 
of these reactions has been variable and includes reports with onset on the fi rst day of 
rituximab exposure. Rituximab should be discontinued in patients who experience a severe 
mucocutan eous reaction. The safety of re -administration of rituximab to patients with 
severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined.  
5.4.5  Infusion Reactions  
An acute onset infusion reaction generally occurs within 24 hours of infusion  of the study 
drug. Rituxim ab can cause severe, including fatal, infusion reactions. Severe reactions 
typically occur during the first infusion with time to onset of 30  to 120 minutes. Rituximab -
induced infusion reactions and sequelae include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, 
hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  77 Confidential  myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, an aphylactoid events, or 
death.  
Medical management (e.g. , glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen) for 
infusion reactions must be instituted as needed. Depending on the severity of the infusion 
reaction and the required interventions, rituxi mab may be temporarily or permanently 
discontinue d. Resume infusion at a minimum 50% reduction in rate after symptoms have 
resolved. Closely monitor patient s with pre -existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions . 
Infusion reactions should be reported in the eC RF as AEs, or SAEs if it meets the 
seriousness criteria, with the event ter m “infusion -related reaction”. The signs and 
symptoms of the infusion reaction should be described in the  appropriate part of the eCRF. 
Please refer also to Section 5.4.6 (Anaphyla xis). 
5.4.6  Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is a serious  allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death . 
Diagnostic criteria are outlined in Table  7.  
Table  7 Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or  flushing, swollen lips /tongue /uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respiratory compromise (e .g., dyspnea, wheeze/ bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory 
flow ( PEF), hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced blood pressure  or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e .g., hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient  
(minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin /mucosal tissue (e .g., generalized hives, itch /flush, swollen 
lips/tongue /uvula)  
b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze /bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced blood pressure  or associated symptoms (e .g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e .g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced blood pressure  after exposure to known allergen for that patient  (minutes  to several hours):  
a. Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure  (age specific) or greater t han 30% decrease in 
systolic blood pressure  
b. Adults: systolic blood pressure  of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline  
 
As with the treatment of any critically ill patient , the treatment of anaphylaxis begins with 
a rapid assessment  and maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation.  When a patient  
fulfills any of the 3 criteria of anaphylaxis  outlined above, the patient  should receive 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  78 Confidential  epinephrine  immediately because epinephrine is the treatment  of choice in anaphylaxis. 
There undoubtedly will be  patient s who present with symptoms not yet fulfilling  the criteria 
of anaphylaxis yet in whom it would be  appropriate to initiate therapy with epinephrine, 
such as a  patient  with a history of near -fatal anaphylaxis to peanut  who ingested peanut 
and within minutes is experiencing  urticaria and generalized flushing. Subsequent 
interventions  are determined on the basis of the clinical course and  response to epinephrine.  
Anaphylaxis  should be reported in the eCRF as AE or SAE if it meets the seriousness 
criteria, with th e event term “ anaphylaxis ”. The signs and symptoms of the anaphylaxis  
should be described in the appropriate part of the eCRF.  
5.5 Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy in a female patient should be reported to the Sponsor from the time the 
patient signed the ICF until 12 months after the last infusion of study drug . Pregnancy 
reports should be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy by the Investigator as per the reporting procedure outlined in the Site Manual.  
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a male patient participating in the study should be 
reported to the Investigator and the Sponsor following the same procedure for p regnancy 
in the female patient. The partner should be counseled, the risks of continuing the 
pregnancy discussed, as well as the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the 
pregnant female should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. The pregnan t partner 
will need to sign an Authorization for “Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Information” (a sort of specific consent form) to allow for follow -up of her pregnancy.  
Although pregnancy is not an AE, all pregnancies must be followed until 6 to 8 weeks 
after the estimated date of delivery to determine their outcome. The pregnancy outcome 
will be notified to the Sponsor by submitting a follow -up pregnancy report form. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the SAE criteria then the Investigator shoul d report this 
case according to the SAE reporting process (Section 5. 9). 
5.6 Overdose  
An overdose of SAIT101 or MabThera® or Rituxan® is defined as an infusion of >1,000 
mg during a single infusion in this study.  
In case of overdose, the patient must be manage d for any AE caused by overdose as per 
standard of care at the site or symptomatically and the case discussed with the Clinical 
Research Organization and Sponsor medical advisor for decision on treatment 
discontinuation of the patient.  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  79 Confidential  When an overdose is  reported during the course of the study, the patient should be 
monitored closely and evaluated by the Investigator to determine whether the patient 
experiences any AE or SAE as a result of the overdose.  
Overdoses will be reported as protocol deviations. I f the overdose is associated with an 
AE/SAE, the site should follow the AE/SAE reporting procedures described in Section 5 
of this protocol and as per the eCRF completion guidelines.  
5.7 Changes in Clinical Laboratory Assessment Results  
It is the responsibilit y of the Investigator or Sub -investigator to review the results of all 
laboratory tests as they become available. For each abnormal laboratory test result, the 
Investigator or Sub -investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal (i.e., clinically 
significant) change from Baseline for that individual patient. This determination, 
however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal value is 
observed. The Investigator or Sub -investigator may repeat the laboratory test or conduct 
addit ional tests to verify the results of the original clinical laboratory tests. If this 
laboratory value is determined by the Investigator or Sub -investigator to be a clinically 
significant change from Baseline for that patient, it is considered to be an AE.  
5.8 Recording of Adverse Events  
Relationship  
The causal relationship of the study drug  to all AEs occurring after the start of study drug  
infusion  will be assessed as one of the following two categories.  
1. Unrelated (AE f or which relationship to the study drug can be ruled out) . A reasonable 
possibility of the AE occurring is considered highly unlikely f or one of the following 
reasons:  
• Occurrence of the event can be expected based on the patient ’s underlying disease, 
concurrent illness, or medical history.  
• Occurrence of the event can be expected based on the patient ’s age, gender , or other 
characteristics.  
• There is no apparent temporal relationship between study drug  infusion  and 
occurrence of the event.  Example: Occurrence of an AE after a considerable leng th 
of time has elapsed since comp letion or discontinuation of study drug  infusion . 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  80 Confidential  • A causal relationship is considered highly unlikely from the status of study drug  
infusion  and the course of the event.  Example: An AE that recovers without  
treatment while continuing study drug infusion  (excluding cases in which the 
patient  becomes accustomed to the  condition through continued study drug  
infusion ). 
• The event is considered to be the effect of a concomitant drug.  
• The event is considered to be  incidental (accident, incidental symptom, etc).  
Example: Occurrence of a femoral fracture resulting from a traffic accident . 
• A causal relationship of study drug  infusion  can be medically ruled out for some 
other reason.  
2. Related (AE for which relationship to the study drug  cannot be ruled out) . A reasonable 
possibility of the AE occurring is considered likely f or one of the following reasons:  
• Occurrence of the event can be expected from the pharmacological or  toxicological 
action of the study drug . Examples : Occurrence of pancytopenia when an effect on 
the hematopoietic system has been observed in non -clinical studies, or occur rence 
of dehydration with a  study drug  that has a diuretic action.   
• The same event was previously observed in non -clinical studies or clinical studies. 
Example: Occurrence of an event that was observe d at a high incidence in P hase I  
studies.  
• A temporal relationship between study drug  infusion  and occurrence of the event is  
suspected.  Example: Occurrence of allergic dermatitis se veral days after the start of 
study drug  infusion . 
• A causal relationship is suspected from the outcome of the event following 
discontinuat ion or dose reduction of the study drug . Example: Rapid recov ery of 
nausea following discontinuation o f study drug infusion .

other reason.  
Severity  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  81 Confidential  AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale. The intensity of an adverse experience is defi ned as 
follows.  
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.  
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
 
5.9 Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events  
After the patient has signed the ICF, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused 
by a protocol -mandated procedure should be reported (e.g., SAEs related to invasive 
procedures such as biopsies).  The I nvestigator or Sub-investigator  will periodically assess 
patient s for the occurrence of AEs and record AE information offe red spontaneously by 
patient s. To avoid bias in eliciting AEs, patient s should be asked the following non -leading 
question:  "How have you felt since yo ur last visit?"   
The Quintiles IMS must be notified of any SAEs within 24 hours  of awareness according 
to the procedure outlined in the Site Manual.  
5.10 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Any AEs will be followed up to resolution. Resolution means that the patient  has returned 
to a Baseline  state of health or the  Investigator does not expect any further improvement 
or worsening of the AE.  
5.11 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Au thorities 
and Investigators  
Investigators will be notified by the Sponsor or Quintiles IMS of all SAEs that require 
prompt submission to their IRB or IEC.  Investigators should provide written 
documentation of IRB/IEC notification for each report to the Spo nsor or Quintiles IMS.  
The Sponsor or Quintiles IMS will ensure that SAEs are reported to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities in accordance with the local regulations.  
All contact details and detail instructions for SAE reporting will be provided in the site 
manual, and SAE form completion instruction.

27APR2017  82 Confidential  6 STATISTI CS 
6.1 Sample Size  
The PK parameters reported from a recent study with rituximab in patients with RA 
revealed a percentage coefficient of variation (CV%) ranging from 26.3% for C max to 
37.3% for AUC 0-∞.12 
When the evaluable sample size in each group is 84, a three group design will have 81% 
power to reject both the null hypothesis that the ratio of test to standard geometrics means 
is below 0.800, and the null hypothesis that the ratio of test to standa rd geometrics means 
is above 1.250 (i.e., that the test and standard are not equivalent), in favor of the 
alternative hypothesis, that the means of the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the 
expected ratio of means is 1.000, that data will be analyze d in the log scale using analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) and that each one sided test is made at the 5% level. Each of the 
15 hypotheses tests (five co -primary endpoints × three pairwise compar isons (i.e., 
SAIT101 vs. MabThera®, SAIT101 vs. Rituxan®, MabThera® vs. Rituxan®)) are powered 
at 98% to 99.0% to yield 81% study -wide power.  
Approximately 282 patients (94 patients per group) will be randomized in order to yield a 
minimum of 84 patients per group to account for a presumed 10% withdrawal.  
This 94  patients in SAIT101 group and MabThera® group will provide 96% probability of 
declaring the equivalence in FAS  with each one sided test at the 2.5% level , accounting for 
a presumed 1.0 standard deviation of DAS28 from the REFLEX study13, 14, and the 
equiv alence margin of -0.6 to 0.6 chosen as the half of a clinical meaningful improvement 
of 1.2 in DAS28 .16 Considering 18% withdraw from the REFLEX study, approximately 77 
patients per group will provide approximately 91% probability of declaring the equivale nce 
in the PP set  with the same above assumption . 
6.2 Statistical Methods  
Categorical variables will be summarized  by the number and percentage of patient s in each 
category. Continuous variables will be summarized  using N, mean, standard deviation ( SD),

AUC 0-, AUC 0-d15, Cmax after the second infusion on Day 15 and Ctrough before the second 
infusion on Day 15 will be considered the primary PK endpoints. All other PK endpoints  
will be regarded as secondary.  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  85 Confidential  The statistical analysis of the log e-transformed primary endpoints will be based on an 
analysis of variance model.  Covariates may be added to the planned analysis.  The 
difference in least squares means between each of the three pairs (i.e., SAIT101 vs. 
MabThera®, SAIT101 vs. Rituxan®, MabThera®  vs. Rituxan®) and the associated 90% CI 
will be determined. Back transformation will provide the ratio of geometric means and 
90% CI for this ratio. Equivalence will be concluded if the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric 
means of each of the thre e pairs  for each primary endpoint  are completely contained within 
the acceptance interval of 0.8 to 1.25.  
Descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, %CV, minimum, median, and maximum) will be used 
to summarize  serum concentration data by treatment at each plann ed sam pling time point. 
Concentrations that are below the lower limit of quantitation will be assigned a value of 0 
for the purposes of com puting descriptive statistics. Serum PK parameters calculated from 
the concentration -time data will also be summarize d by treatment using descriptive 
statistics (N, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, minimum, median, 
maximum).  
Plots of the mean and individual serum rituximab concentrations over time for SAIT101 
and MabThera® and Rituxan® will be provided following i.v. infusion s. 
6.4 Efficacy Analysis  
The continuous efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) using treatment (SAIT101 and MabThera®) as model factor and Baseline 
DAS28 as covariate. The Difference be tween SAIT101 and MabThera® in DAS28 change 
from Baseline at Week 24 and the associated two -sided 95% CI will be determined . 
Equivalence will be concluded if the 95% CI for the mean difference for main efficacy 
endpoint is completely contained with the equ ivalence margin of -0.6 to 0.6. Both of the 
per protocol (PP) set and full analysis set (FAS) will be considered as the efficacy analysis 
population and the equivalence will be concluded only if the analyses of both PP set and 
FAS meet the equivalence crit eria defined above. No missing data will be imputed for the 
efficacy analys es in FAS.  The possibility of a treatment -by-baseline interaction may be 
explored as exploratory analyses. In addition, sensitivity analyses will be performed to 
assess the effect o f missing Week 24 data and detailed in the SAP.

will constitute the patient ’s eCRF.  
2. An eCRF will be created for all patient s who provide consent to participate in the 
study . However, no data will be collected in case of scr een failure.  
3. Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs 
of the data management and biostatistics departments of the Sponsor (or an appropriate 
company designated by the Sponsor to perform these activities). Patient data will be 
captured in an eCRF and reviewed by the monitor to check adherence to the protocol 
and to detect any data inconsistency or discrepancy.  
4. The Investigator or Sub-investigator  will ensure that the clinical data are reported in 
the eCRF in accordance to the study protocol and eCRF completion guidelines created 
by Cl inical and/or Data Management.  
5. Forms should be available during periodic visits by study monitors to enable review 
for completeness and acceptability. Any correction to the data entered into the eCRF 
must be carried out by the Investigator  or study personnel . 
6. When data is entered into eCRFs from study centers , an automatic preliminary logical 
check will be applied. Addi tionally monitors and clinical data managers will review the 
eCRF for accuracy and can generate queries to the study personnel  for resolution. The 
Investigator or Sub-investigator  will make corrections as necessary.  These changes 
may be made either on the initiative of the site personnel  or in response to monitoring 
or data queries. Any changes to written data must be made using GCP corrections and 
any change to electronic data should be made in a system which can provide an audit 
trail.

27APR2017  101 Confidential  12 PUBLICATION POLICY  
The Sponsor supports the efforts of health authorities to increase the transparency of 
medical research conducted in human patient s and will register and maintain  the 
information of clinical studies on a public registry program such as www.clinicaltrials.gov . 
The Sponsor is committed to the public disclosure of the results from clinical studies 
through posting on public  clinical study data banks such as www.clinicalstudyresults.org . 
The results summary will be posted to the public clinical study data bank within one year 
after study completion, defined as the last patient ’s last visit, whether or not the results are 
favorable  to the study drug . For studies involving products whose development program is 
discontinued before approval, the Sponsor wi ll post the results within one ye ar after such 
discontinuation. The Sponsor will comply with the guidelines of regulatory authorities with 
regards to public registration and disclosure of clinical study data. 
The Sponsor has no objection to publication by the Investigator  of any information 
collected or generated by the Investigator , whether or not the results are favorable  to the 
study drug . However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of confidential information 
or unprotected inventions, the Investi gator  will provide the Sponsor an opportunity to 
review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure (poster presentation, invited 
speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc.) before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.  
If the study is part of a multi -center  study, the Investigator  agrees that the first publication 
is to be a joint publication covering all centers . Results from subsets should not be 
published in advance or without clear reference to the entire primary data . Authors will be 
the Sponsor, C oordinating Investigator  and those who have made the most significant 
contribution to the  overall success of the study. This contribution will be assessed, in part 
but not entirely, in terms of number of patient s enrolled and will be revie wed at the en d of 
the study by the Sponsor. In the event of any disagreement in the content of any publication, 
both the Investigator ’s and the Sponsor’s opinion will be fairly and sufficiently represented 
in the publication.  
An external CRO or laboratory involved in the conduct of the study has no publication 
rights regarding the study . 
If the Investigator  wishes to independently publ ish/present any results from the study , the 
draft manuscript, abstract or presentation must be submitted in writing to the Sponsor  for 
comment at least 60 days prior to submission. Comments will be given within 60  days from 
receipt of the draft manuscript.  The Investigator  will comply with requests from the 
Sponsor to delete references to its confidential information (other than the study results) in 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  102 Confidential  any paper, abstract or presentation. If any patent action is required to protect intellectual 
property right s, the Investigator  agrees to withhold publication or presentation to allow 
sufficient time for the Sponsor.  
Publication of study results is also provided for in the Clinical Study Agreement between 
the Sponsor and the institution.    
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  103 Confidential  13 AMENDMENT POLICY  
The Investigator  will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent 
from the Sponsor and subsequent approval by the IRB/IEC. Any permanent chang e to the 
protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific study  centers , must  be 
handled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment to the protocol that appears indicated 
as the study  progresses will be fully discussed by the Investigator (s) and the S ponsor. If 
agreement is reached regarding the need for an amendment, it will be written by the 
Sponsor. The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB/IEC 
identi fied with this responsibility. Except for “administrative” or “non -substant ial” 
amendments, Investigator s must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments befo re 
implementing the change(s). Administrative amendments are defined as amendments that  
have no effect on the safety of the research patient s, scope of the investigation,  conduct or 
management of the study , quality , the scientific value  of the study , or the quality or safety 
of the study drug used in the study . A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to patient s should be implemented immediatel y, and the IRB/IEC should 
be notified  according to the provisions specified by each IRB/IEC . The Sponsor will ensure 
protocol amendments are submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies.  
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the IRB/IEC, the Investig ators and/or the 
Sponsor , the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study  design  and/or 
increases the potential risk to the patient , the currently approved written ICF will require 
similar modification. In such cases, repeat informed consent will be obtained from patient s 
enrolled in the study  before expecting continued participation.

factor  Demonstrati on of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any 
method for which the  result had been positive in <5% of normal control 
patients.  
Radiographic changes  Radiographic changes typical of rheumatoid  arthritis on posteroanterior 
hand and wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or unequivocal 
bony decalcification localized in or most marked adjacent to the involved 
joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify).  
*For classification purposes, a patient shall be said to have rheumatoid arthritis if he/she has satisfied at 
least 4 of these 7 criteria. Criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least 6  weeks. Patients with

A representation and example is given below:
Protocol Number:  AGB  001  Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  114 Confidential    Based on the DAS28 score, disease activity is classified as : 
≤ 2.6 Remission  
>2.6 ≤ 3.2 Low disease activity  
>3.2 ≤ 5.1 Moderate disease activity  
>5.1 High disease activity  
 
EULAR response Criteria:  
Based on the DAS, response criteria have been developed, the EULAR response criteria. 
The EULAR response criteria include not only change in disease activity but also current 
disease activity.  To be cl assified as responders, patie nts should have a significant change 
in DAS (at least >0.6 from Baseline ) and also low current disease activity. Three categories 
are defined: good, moderate, and non -responders.

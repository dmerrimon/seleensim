STUDY  SITE  
 
 
 
OBJECTIVE  To determine  the potential  of a test material to  
induce  comedones.  
 
 
 
 
 
STUDY  DESIGN  A single  center,  evaluator  blinded, randomized  
study  to test the potential  of comedogenicity  of 
test products.  
The backs  of volunteers  with a propensity  to 
comedone  formation are patched  with  the test 
material three  times  a week  for a four-week  
period.  At the last visit,  a follicular  biopsy  is 
performed  on each  site of each  subject,  
Microcomedones  on the slides  are counted  and 
the product  categorized  as to comedogenic  
potential.”  
STUDY  POPULATION  Males  and Females  aged  18-45 years  old who  
meet  the eligibility  criteria of the study.  
 
SAMPLE  SIZE Enroll  up to 18 volunteers  satisfying the  
inclusion and exclusion  criteria.  15 subjects  
completing  the study  is sufficient.  
INVESTIGATIONAL  STUDY  MATERIALS  Test  Material (TM) information  will be provided  
in protocol addendum  for each  test panel.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
DOSE  AND  MODE  OF APPLICATION  Test materials  and Negative  Control will be 
applied  with  occlusive  or semi -occlusive   
patches.  The patch  type  may  be changed  if 
irritation develops.  Occlusive  patches  consist  of 
a non-woven  cotton pad (e.g.,  Webril®) covered  
by Blenderm tape and  held  securely  to skin on 
all sides  with a porous,  hypoallergenic  tape  (e.g.,  
Micropore®).  Semi -occlusive  patches  consist  of a 
non-woven  cotton pad (e.g.,  Webril®)  covered  
and held securely  to skin on all sides  with a  
porous,  hypoallergenic  tape  (e.g.,  Micropore®).  
Patches  are placed  on the back  no closer  than  2 
cm apart.  The cotton pads  used  for the patches

 are approximately  4 cm2 in area,  and are dosed  
with a quantity  of test material as follows  
(unless  otherwise  instructed by  the Sponsor):  
Liquids  and fragrances  approximately  100 μl; 
Creams,  lotions,  petroleum,  etc. approximately  
100 μl; Paper  or other  solid materials  will cover  
the pad area.  
 
 
STUDY  DURATION  The study  will consist  of approximately  13 visits:  
Visit  1 (Screening/Baseline),  Visit 2 through 12:  
Patching and Grading, Make -up visit,  and Visit  
13 (Grading and Follicular  Biopsy collection  visit)  
 
 
 
 
METHODOLOGY  Skin sites  on the back  in the interscapular region  
will be utilized  as application sites.  The test 
material(s)  and negative  control  will be assigned  
to specific sites  for each  subject  be assigned  to 
specific  site for each  subject  according to  a 
randomization scheme  and will be applied  
repetitively  under  occlusive/semi -occlusive  
patches  for a period  of 28 days.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
SAFETY  AND  ADVERSE  EVENTS  Any Adverse  Event  (AE) (including Serious  
Adverse  Events  (SAE)  related  or unrelated  to the 
test material(s)  or study  participation  must  be 
documented as required  (occurrence  date,  site, 
outcome,  and assessment  of causality,  severity,  
and relatedness).  
 
SAEs  must  be reported immediately  and relevant  
supportive  documentation must  be                 
sent  to the Study  Manager  or designee  within  24 
hours  of the site becoming  aware  of the event.

1 BACKGROUND  
The  human   comedogenicity   test  has  been   shown   to  be  a  predictive   method   for  assessing   the 
comedogenic  potential  of products  intended  for use on skin.  
2 RATIONALE  
This human  comedogenicity  test panel(s)  is being  conducted  on product(s)  making  the claim  of “non - 
comedogenic”.  
3 OBJECTIVE(S)  
The objective  of this protocol  is to  evaluate  the comedogenic  potential  of the test material(s)  using the 
back  of human  volunteers.  
4 OVERALL  STUDY  DESIGN AND  PLAN  DESCRIPTION  
A single  center,  evaluator  blinded,  randomized,  four-week  clinical  test panel(s).  This human  
comedogenicity  test panel(s)  is being  conducted  in order  to assess  the comedogenic  potential  of the 
test material(s)  and determine  if the test material(s)  induce  microcomedones  under  repetitive  patch  
test conditions.  The target  population  for each  test panel  is adult  men  and women  (age  18 through  45 
years),  who  are acne -prone  and have  large  pores  on the back  and/or  a history  of acne  vulgaris  on the 
face  or back.  Subjects  will be patched  on the upper  back  with  test material  dosed  patches  and an 
undosed  occlusive  patch  (negative  control)  every  Monday,  Wednesday,  and Friday  for 4 consecutive  
weeks.  Each  test site will be graded  for irritation  after  each  patch  removal.  After  12 full patching  
sessions,  a follicular  biopsy  will be collected  from  the test material  and control  sites,  and graded  for 
microcomedones.

5 STUDY  DURATION  
Each  test panel  will consist  of 13 subject  visits:  Screening/Baseline  (Visit  1) will  be completed  on either  
a Monday,  Wednesday  or Friday,  and Visit  2 will be completed  48-72 hours  post  Visit  1. Visits  3-13 will 
occur  48-72 hours  post  each  subsequent  visit,  i.e., Monday,  Wednesday,  and Friday  for four consecutive  
weeks.  
As necessary,  a subject  may  complete  a make -up patching  visit.  Make -up visit will be conducted 48 -72 
hours  post  Visit  12. Subject will return  to site for Visit  13 for the collection  of Follicular  Biopsies.  
Visit  13 will be conducted  48-72 hours  post  Visit  12 or post  make -up visit  if applicable.  
Note:  72-hour  exposure  time  is only  applicable  for visits  conducted  on Friday  and/or  to allow  for site 
closed  days.  
 
 
6 SUBJECT  SELECTION  AND  ENROLLMENT  
Each  study panel  can fulfill  its objective  only  if appropriate  and required  number  of subjects  is enrolled.  
The following  eligibility  criteria  are designed  to select  subjects  for whom  protocol  procedures  are 
considered  appropriate.  All relevant  medical  and non-medical  conditions  should  be taken  into 
consideration,  in addition  to the inclusion/exclusion  criteria  below,  when  deciding  if a particular  
individual  is suitable  for this protocol.  The inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  will be reviewed  for each  
subject  and confirmed  by the Principal  Investigator  (PI) or a medically  qualified  individual  (MD/DO)  at 
Visit  1 in order  to determine  subject  eligibility  for the relevant  test panel.  
Prior  to any review  of personal  data,  Informed  Consent  documents  should be  signed.  
 
 
6.1 INFORMED  CONSENT  
The Informed  Consent  Document (ICD),  will be read  by the subject  or explained  to the subject  by the PI 
or designee.  The PI or  designee  must  ensure  that each  study  subject  is fully  informed  about  the nature  
and objectives  of the study  and possible  risks  associated  with  participation.  After  understanding  and 
agreeing,  the subject  will express  his/her  consent  to the subject’s  participat ion in the study  by signing  
the ICD.  
No subject  will be evaluated  without  a signed  ICD, which  should  be kept  by the PI as part of the Site 
Master  File. The ICDs  of subjects  who  are not enrolled  in the study  will also be part of the Site Master  
File. 
One copy  of the signed  ICD must  be given  to the subject;  the subject  will remain  free to withdraw  this 
consent  at any moment  without  any negative  consequence  to the subject.  
The ICD must  be approved  by the Sponsor  and the IRB must  be in compliance  with  ICH GCP,  local  
regulatory  requirements, and legal  requirements.  
In addition  to the ICD, an IRB approved  Supplemental  Consent  form  may  be completed  if the subject  
has indicated  that they  have  previously  had eczema  and would  like to participate  in the study.  See 
exclusion  criterion  VIII.

not start  using  any new  personal  care  products  (e.g.  makeup,  cleanser)  or change  their  currently  used  
brands  during the  study.  
6.4 CONCURRENT  MEDICATION  
If a subject  is taking  any medication  during  the course  of the study or within  2 weeks  prior  to the study,  
it must  be recorded  on the Concomitant  Medication  Form  or equivalent.  The minimum  information  
required  is the name  of the medication.  If this medication  is linked  to the treatment  of an IP-related  AE, 
dose  and duration  of the treatment  should  be specified.  Medications  excluded  are indicated  in the 
Subject  Exclusion  criteria ; the use of any excluded  medications  during  the study  will result  in 
discontinuation of the subject.  
 
 
6.5 SCREENING  FAILURE  
All individuals  who  signed  ICD and withdraw  their  participation  or fail to meet  all of the screening  criteria  
during  the initial  evaluation  will be considered  a “screening  failure. ” These  subjects  will be replaced  
(note:  screening numbers  will not  be reused) and their  data  will not be considered  in the final  report.  
 
 
7 SAMPLE  SIZE DETERMINATION  
A sufficient  number  of subjects  will be screened to enroll  as many  as 18 qualified  subjects  to ensure  
completion  of 15 subjects  per test panel.  
8 INVESTIGATIONAL  STUDY  MATERIALS  
8.1 IDENTITY  OF INVESTIGATIONAL  STUDY  MATERIALS  
The test material(s)  will be manufactured  and packaged  by the Sponsor.  The ingredient  list and Safety  
Attestation  letter  for each  product  will be provided  to the PI for review  and submission  to the IRB. The

8.2 RANDOMIZATION  
Upon  qualification  and enrollment,  each  subject  will be sequentially  issued  a subject  number  starting  
with  “001”.  Once  a subject  number  has been  assigned  to a subject,  it cannot  be reassigned  to another  
subject.  The subject  numbers  will be used  to randomly  assign  the test material(s)  and control  to the 
specific  test sites  for each  subject  according to  a randomization scheme  created by the site. 
The site will create  the randomization  scheme  for each  test panel  prior  to the initiation  of the test panel.  
8.3 BLINDING  PROCEDURE  
This study  will be evaluator -blinded, so  the PI or delegated evaluator  conducting  the NACDG  grading  
evaluations  will not know  the placement  of the TM and control  patched  test sites.  The PI or  delegated  
evaluator  should not  participate  in product(s)/patch  application and should not  have  access  to the 
randomization.  
 
In the event  that the PI/evaluator  believes  an un-blinding  is necessary  and circumstances  allow,  the 
PI/designee  will contact  the Study  Manager  who  will consult  with the DPR to determine  whether  
unblinding is needed. If it is  determined  that the blind  should  be broken,  the PI/evaluator  will contact  
the designated  site represen tative  to obtain  information about  the individual  subject’s  randomization.  
The time,  date,  and reason  for the un-blinding should be noted  in the subject’s  source  document  and 
documentation should be  provided  to the Sponsor.  
 
If there is a medical  emergency  and the PI/evaluator  deems  it necessary  to know  the randomization  
urgently  for the subject’s  proper  medical  care,  then  the PI/evaluator  may  break  the blind immediately  
by contacting the designated  site representative.  The PI/designee  should promptly  document  and 
explain to  the Study  Manager  any premature  un-blinding.  
 
The PI/evaluator  may  assist  with  data  entry/review/analysis  after  individual  subjects  complete  all test 
procedures.  This will not  be documented as premature  un-blinding.  
 
8.4 STUDY  MATERIAL  STORAGE  AND  ACCOUNTABILITY  
The PI or designee  must  ensure  that deliveries  of test material(s)  from  the Sponsor  are correctly  received  
by a responsible  person  and that the test material(s)  is stored  in a secure  area  under  recommended  
storage  conditions.  The test material(s)  will be secured  in a locked  room  or cabinet  that is only  accessible  
to authorized  site personnel  and kept  at 59 - 86°F  (15 -30°C).  Temperature  should  be recorded  at least  
daily.  The PI must  maintain  adequate  records  documenting  the receipt,  use, loss,  or other  disposition  of 
the investigational  product  on the Investigational  Product  Accountability/Dispensing  Log or site 
equivalent  
At the end  of the study,  investigational  test material(s)  (used  and/or  unused)  may  be destroyed  by the 
site following  its Standard  Operating  Procedure  (SOP)  and in compliance  with  applicable  regulations,  
institutional  policy,  and any special  instructions  provided  by the Sponsor,  or they  may  be returned  to 
the Sponsor  depending on the product  classification.  
When  product  is destroyed  on-site, the destruction  must  be properly  documented  and documentation  
provided  to the Study  Manager  and/or  designee.  
In case  of return  to Sponsor,  all containers  must  be returned  to  
.

8.5 PRODUCT  QUALITY  COMPLAINTS  
A Product  Quality  Complaint  (PQC)  is any written,  electronic,  or oral communication  that alleges  
deficiencies  related  to the identity,  quality,  durability,  reliability,  or safety  of a product,  including  its 
labeling,  delivery  system  or packaging  integrity.  It also includes  device  malfunctions.  Any PQC  discovered  
during  the initial  inventory  should  follow  the instructions  provided  on the receipt  letter;  no PQC  form  
should  be filed  for issues  identified  when  opening  or unpacking  a shipment.  Subsequently,  any 
observation  of a PQC  requires  immediate  notification to the Study  Manager  via a completed PQC  form  
and telephone  call. The PI or designee  should  complete,  sign,  and forward  a copy  of the PQC  form  to 
the Study  Manager.  
In addition,  PQC  information  must  be included  on the Investigational  Product  accountability   and 
reconciliation  Form  or equivalent  in the comments  field.  The Study  Manager  listed  can assist  you or 
answer  questions  related to  this process.  To aid in the  initial  conversation and understanding of a PQC,  
the site staff  may  be asked  to photograph the  issue  and send it to the Study  Manager.  
 
 
8.6 APPLICATION  OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL  PRODUCT  
Test  materials  will be applied  using occlusive  or semi -occlusive  patches.  The patch  type  may  be 
changed  during the  study  if irritation develops.  Occlusive  patches  consist  of a non-woven  cotton pad  
(e.g.,  Webril®)  covered  by Blenderm tape  and held securely  to skin on all sides  with a porous,  
hypoallergenic  tape  (e.g.,  Micropore®).  Semi -occlusive  patches  consist  of a non-woven cotton pad  
(e.g.,  Webril®)  covered  and held securely  to skin on all sides  with  a porous,  hypoallergenic  tape  (e.g,  
Micropore®).  Open patches  consist  of a non-woven  cotton pad (e.g.,  Webril®)  held to the skin on 2 
opposing sides  by a strip  of hypoallergenic  tape  (e.g.,  Micropore®).  The pad is open  
on 2 sides  like a Band -Aid ®. 
 
Patches  will be placed  on the upper  back,  to the right  and left of the spine.  Patches  will not be applied  
closer  than  2 centimeters  (cm)  to each  other.   The cotton  pads  used  for the patches  are approximately  
4 cm2 in area,  and will be dosed  with a quantity of test material as follows  (unless  otherwise  instructed  
by the Sponsor):  
• Liquids  and fragrances  approximately  100 microliters  (µL) 
• Creams,  lotions,  petroleum,  etc. approximately  100 µL 
• Paper,  powder  or other solid materials  a sufficient  amount  to cover  the pad a rea 
 
Patches  will be applied  starting at the lower  edge  of the patch  and pressing  from below  to let air 
escape.  The patch  will be secured by  gently  rubbing the  tape  (especially  the corners)  to ensure  good  
adherence.

Note:  72-hour  exposure  time  is only  applicable  for visits  conducted  on Friday  and/or  to allow  for site 
closed  days.  
 
Site Irritation  / Reaction Grading  
 
At visits  2 through  13 (and  makeup  visit if applicable),  the designated  test sites  will be  graded  for 
irritation/reactions  using the  North  American Contact  Dermatitis  Group (NACDG)  gradin g scale.  
Sites  will be adequately  illuminated using lighting provided  by a 60-watt  incandescent  blue  day light  
bulb.  
 
NACDG  Grading Scale

0 No  reaction  
+0.5  Macular  erythema  
+1 Indurated  erythema  
+2 Erythema,  infiltration and vesicles  
+3 Bullous  reaction or ulcer  
If irritation  develops  as indicated by  the NACDG  score,  the patch  type  may  be changed  or patch  
applications  may  be skipped for specific  sites.  Skipping  a patch  application should  be documented  as a 
protocol  deviation.  This may  also have  an impact  on the follicular biopsy  process  at the final  study  
visit.  Any changes  made  to the patch  type,  application  schedule,  or biopsy  procedures  will be 
documented in the appropriate  source  documents.  
 
9.2 STUDY  INSTRUMENT(S)  
Follicular Biopsies:  
Follicular  biopsies  will be collected  from  each  patch  site at Visit  13 or make -up visit for each  subject.  The 
following  procedures  will be followed  for follicular biopsy  collection:  
• The test sites  will be gently  cleansed  with  warm  soapy,  water  and patted  dry. 
• A glass  slide  containing  a drop  of cyanoacrylate  glue  will be held  against  each  site until  it has 
dried.  
• The slide  will then  be removed  slowly,  so as to extract  follicles  and their  contents.  
• The specimen  slides  will be stored  in labeled  slide  boxes  until  graded.  
• The specimens  collected  using  the cyanoacrylate  follicular  biopsy  technique  will be evaluated  
by a trained   grader  using  a stereomicroscope  (magnification   ratio  of 0.8).  Hyperkeratotic  
follicles  (microcomedones)  will appear  as cylindrical  horny impactions  surrounding  extracted  
vellus  hairs.  
 
Specimens  will be graded  using  a 5-point  global  assessment  scale  as follows:  
0 None  (0%,  No microcomedones)  
0.5 Slight  (1-24%  Smallish  horny  masses)  
1 Mild  (25-49%  Smallish  horny  masses)  
2 Moderate  (50-74%  Moderately  sized horny  masses)  
3 Severe  (75-100%  Larger  globoid  microcomedones)  
 
The results  from  the microcomedone  grading  of the follicular  biopsies  will be recorded  using  the 
Stephens  Electronic  Data  Capture  (EDC)  system,  if available,  which  documents  the identity  of the 
evaluator/technician  as well as the time  and date  of all entries,  or all corrected  entries.  Subject  data  can 
also be provided  by Stephens  at the Sponsor’s  request.  Paper  grading forms  will be completed  if EDC is  
unavailable.  Any test site with  a NACDG  grading  score  of 2 or greater  may  not receive  a follicular  biopsy,  
which  will be noted in the appropriate  source  documents.  
 
9.3 SUBJECT COMPLETION/WITHDRAWAL

Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  19/33  
  
9.3.1 Subject  Completion  
Subjects  are considered  to have  completed  the study  when  all study  procedures  have  been  completed  
as designated  by the protocol.  Completion  should  be noted  in the source  documents  and Screening  and 
Enrollment log.  
9.3.2 Subject  Withdrawal  
When  an individual  who has signed  the ICD is not enrolled  in the study  or withdraws/is  withdrawn  
prior  to completing  the study,  the reason is to be documented  in the source  documents,  Screening  
and Enrollment log,  and in the final  study  report. Reasons  for subject  withdrawal  may  include:  
 
• Screen  Failure (e.g.  fails to meet  inclusion/exclusion criteria, chooses  not to enroll,  etc.)  
• Participant  is determined  to be ineligible  after  enrollment  
• Subject’s  choice  to withdraw  
• Investigator  terminated  (e.g.  noncompliance,  etc.)  
• Adverse  Event  / SAE (must  be reported  in accordance  with  the reporting  requirements  
defined  in the Adverse  Event  Reporting Section.  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Other  
 
 
Subjects  may  withdraw  from  the trial at any time  at their  request,  or they  may  be withdrawn  at any time  
at the discretion  of the Sponsor,  PI, or designee  for safety,  behavioral,  or administrative  reasons.  If a 
subject  does  not return  for a scheduled  visit,  3 documented  attempts  will be made  to contact  the subject  
in order  to establish  the reason  for withdrawal,  and the outcome  will be documented.  The PI or designee  
should  inquire  about  the reason  for withdrawal,  request  that the subject  return  for a final  visit,  if 
applicable,  and follow -up with the subject  regarding  any unresolved  adverse  events.  
Should  a subject  withdraw  from  the trial and also withdraw  consent  for disclosure  of future  information,  
no further  evaluations  should  be performed  and no additional  data  should  be collected.  The PI and staff  
may  retain  and continue  to use  any data  collected before  such withdrawal  of consent.  
Additional  subjects  may  be enrolled  in a test panel  to compensate  for early  subject  withdrawal  
10 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  PLAN.  
The per-protocol  (PP) population  will be the primary  population for  comedogenicity  analyses.  The PP 
population  will include  all subjects  who received  treatment  and completed  the study  in general  
accordance  with  the protocol. Only  the data  of completing subjects  will be analyzed.  Subjects  may  be 
removed  from  the analysis  in the case  of an AE, SAE,  non-compliance,  or Investigator  discretion.  The 
reason for  any subjects  excluded  from  the analyses  will be documented in a note  to file and included  
in the study  report.  
 
Demographic  data  and baseline  characteristics  will be summarized  for all subjects  who are enrolled  in 
the study.  For continuous  variables,  descriptive  statistics  including number  of subjects  (N), mean,  
median,  standard deviation (SD),  minimum  (MIN)  and maximum  (MAX)  values  will be  presented.  For 
categorical  variables,  the frequency  and percentage  of each  category  will be provided.  
 
A descriptive  statistical  summary  will be provided  for the global  assessments  of microcomedone  data  
from  biopsies  for the test material and control  sites.  The descriptive  statistical  summary  includes  the 
number  of observations  (N), mean,  median , standard  deviation  (SD),  minimum (MIN),  and maximum  
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-161115154122 -SACT - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  20/33   
  
(MAX).  
 
In addition,  microcomedone  scores  will be analyzed  using  a mixed -effects  model,  where  the test 
Material/negative  control  is a fixed  effect  and the subject  is a random effect.  Each test product  will be 
compared to the negative  control  within  the model  frame.  A test material  will be considered  positive  
for comedogenicity  if it has a mean  microcomedone  value  of 1.0 or greater,  and is statistically  greater  
than  the mean  microcomedone  value  for the negative  control  site. 
 
All statistical  tests  will be 2-sided  at significance  level  alpha=0.05.  P-values  will be reported  to 3 
decimal  places  (0.000).  No multiple  testing  corrections  will be considered in the study.  Statistical  
analyses  are performed  using  SAS software  version 9.30  or later  series  (SAS  Statistical  Institute).  The 
results  will be sent to the Sponsor  along the raw data  in a Microsoft  Excel  document at the completion  
of the study.  
 
A test material  is considered negative  for comedogenicity  as long  as it satisfies  1 of the following  2 
conditions:  the microcomedone  mean  score  is less than 1.0 and/or  the mean score  is not greater  than  
the control  with  p-value  < 0.05.  
 
11 MANAGEMENT  OF INTERCURRENT  EVENTS  
11.1 AMEN DMENTS  TO THE PROTOCOL  
Neither  the PI nor Sponsor  will modify  this protocol  without  obtaining  the concurrence  of the other.  The 
party  initiating  a modification  will confirm  it in writing.  Amendments  must  be approved  by the Sponsor  
and IRB prior  to implementation.  
Note  that submission  of administrative  change/non -substantial  amendments  to regulatory  authorities  
and/or  IRB/IECs  for approval  prior  to study  implementation  is determined  after  consultation  with  the 
local regulatory  representative  and/or  IRB/IEC  policy  and may  vary  by country/region.  
The only  circumstance  in which  an amendment  may  be initiated  prior  to IRB approval  is where  the change  
is necessary  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazards  to the subjects.  In that event,  the PI must  notify  
the IRB and the Sponsor  in writing within  3 working days  after  the implementation.  
 
 
11.2 PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS  
Protocol  deviations  should  be avoided  whenever  possible. When  a protocol  deviation  occurs,  it must  be 
captured on a Deviation  Log. 
The PI or designee  will also contact  the Study  Manager,  Contact  with the Study  Manager  will be made  
as soon as possible  in order  to discuss the  situation and agree  on an appropriate  action. If it is 
determined  that the subject  safety/well -being was affected,  the IRB/IEC,  if any, will also be  notified.  
The final  report  will describe  the deviation from  the protocol  and the circumstances  requiring it. 
 
 
11.3 ADVERSE  EVENT REPORTING  
11.3.1 Introduction  
Timely,  accurate,  and complete  reporting and analysis  of safety  information  from  clinical  studies  are

agencies  worldwide. The  Sponsor  has established  procedures  in conformity with  regulatory  
requirements  to ensure  appropriate  reporting of safety  information.  
 
11.3.2 Definitions  
11.3.2.1 Adverse Event  (AE)  
An AE is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a clinical  study  subject  temporally  associated  with the 
clinical invest igation,  whether  or not the event  has a causal  relationship to  the subject’s  participation  
in the trial.  It is therefore  any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including an abnormal  finding),  
symptom,  or disease  that occurs during the  trial. This  can include  any occurrence  that is new  in onset,  
an aggravation of severity/frequency  of a baseline  condition,  or abnormal  results  of diagnostic  
procedures,  including laboratory  test abnormalities.  
 
Examples  of AEs  include  but are not limited  to: 
Abnormal  test findings,  
Clinically  important  symptoms  and signs,  
Changes  in physical  examination findings,  
Hypersensitivity,  and 
Progression/worsening of underlying  disease.  
Any change  in existing  medical condition (Medical  History)  would be  considered  an AE and  recorde d 
appropriately.  
 
Additionally,  they  may  include  the signs  or symptoms  resulting from:  
Investigational  product  overdose,  
Investigational  product  withdrawal,  
Investigational  product  abuse,  
Investigational  product  misuse,  
Investigational  product  interactions,  
Medication  errors,  
Investigational  product  dependency,  
Exposure in utero , and 
Study  related  procedure.  
 
The criteria for  determining whether  an abnormal  objective  test finding should be  reported as an AE  
are as follows:  
Test  result is associated  with  accompanying symptoms,  and/or  
Test  result requires additional  diagnostic  testing  or medical/surgical intervention,  and/or  
Test  result leads to  a discontinuation from  the study,  significant  additional  concomitant  
treatment,  or other  therapy,  and/or  
Test  result is considered  to be an adverse  event by the PI or the Sponsor.  
 
Merely  repeating an abnormal  test,  in the  absence  of any of the above  conditions,  does  not constitute  
an AE. Any abnormal  test result that  is determined  to be  an error  does  not require  reporting as an  AE. 
 
Expected  AE 
All investigational  products  have the potential  to cause  some  uncomfortable  effects  or other  reactions.  
Signs  and symptoms  of erythema,  edema,  scaling/dryness,  itching,  burning,  stinging,  and tingling  are 
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test

Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  22/33  
  
considered  clinical  endpoints  if they  are mild  in nature  and should  not be reported  as AE. These  
conditions  may  or may  not resolve  over  time.  Symptoms  that are persistent  and moderate  to severe  in 
nature,  or that involve  elevation  (e.g.  edema,  papules,  vesicles,  spreading)  will be considered  adverse  
events  (AEs).  The Investigator  or designee  will have  the final  authorization  to determine  if a reaction  will 
be considered an AE.  
If a subject  is discontinued  due to worsening of a sign or symptom  (including worsening  of the signs  
and or symptoms  recorded  as part of the evaluations),  then  it should  be recorded  as an  AE. 
 
Treatment  Emergent  AE (TEAE)  
TEAE  is defined  as any event  not present  prior  to the initiation  of the IPs. Note  that AEs will be 
summarized  for all subjects  who signed  the ICD, differentiating TEAEs.  
AEs are considered  serious  and require  expedited reporting if they  meet  the definition  of a Serious  
Adverse Event  (see part below).  
 
11.3.2.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is an  AE (untoward  medical  occurrence)  that fulfills  at least  one of the following  criteria:  
 
• results  in death;  
• is life-threatening (immediate  risk of death);  
• requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization;  
• results  in a persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to 
conduct  normal  life functions;  
• is a suspected transmission  of any infectious  agent  via a medicinal  product  (medically  
significant)  and should be  reported  as an SAE in the  category  “Other  medically  important  
conditions ”; 
• results  in a congenital  anomaly/birth defect;  
• is another  medically  significant  event  (i.e. a medically  significant  condition that  may  jeopardize  
the subject  or require  medical  or surgical intervention  to prevent  any of the previously  listed  
outcomes).  Medical  and scientific  judgment should be  exercised  in deciding  whether  expedited  
reporting is appropriate  in situations  other  than those  listed  above.  Examples  of                    
such medical  events  include  allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive  treatment  in an  
Emergency  Room or at  home,  blood dyscrasia,  or convulsions  that do not result  in 
hospitalization;  or development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse, or malignancy).  
 
11.3.2.3 Severity  
The severity  of all AEs must  be evaluated  by the PI or, if the PI does  not have  a medical  background,  by a 
medically  qualified  individual  (MD/DO).  The severity  classifications  are: 
• Severe  – Extreme  distress,  causing significant  impairment of functioning or incapacitation;  
interferes  significantly  with  subject's  usual  function;  prevents  normal  everyday  activities.  
• Moderate  – Sufficient  discomfort  is present  to cause  interference  to some  extent  with  
subject's  usual  function  or normal  everyday  activity.  
• Mild  – Awareness  of symptoms  that are easily  tolerated,  causing minimal  discomfort  and not  
interfering with  subject's  usual  function  or normal  everyday  activities.  
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-161115154122 -SACT - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  23/33  
  
Note  the distinction  between  the severity  and the seriousness  of an  AE. A severe  event  is not 
necessarily  a serious  event.  For example,  a headache  may  be severe  (interferes  significantly  with  
subject's  usual  function)  but would not  be classified  as serious  unless  it met one of the criteria for  
SAEs,  listed  above.  
 
11.3.2.4 Causality  Assessment  
An AE (serious  or non-serious)  is consider ed “study -related” if the causality  assessment  is possible,  
probable,  or very  likely.  The PI or, if the PI does  not have  a medical  background,  a medically  qualified  
individual  (MD/DO)  determines  the causality  by using  the following  definitions:  
 
• Not related – an AE that is not related  to the participation in the study.  
• Doubtful  – an AE for which  an alternate  explanation is more likely  (e.g.  concomitant  drug),  or 
the relationship in time  suggests  that a causal  relationship is unlikely.  
• Possible  – an AE that might  be a result  of participation  in the study.  An alternative  explanation  is 
inconclusive  and the relationship  in time  is reasonable  so a causal  relationship  cannot  be excluded.  
• Probable  – an AE that might  be a result  of participation in the study.  The relationship in time  is 
suggestive  (e.g.  confirmed  by the challenge).  An alternative  explanation is less likely.  
• Very  Likely  – an AE that is listed as a possible  adverse  reaction and cannot  be reasonably  
explained  by an alternative  explanation.  The relationship in time  is very  suggestive  (e.g.  
confirmed  by dechallenge  and rechallenge).  
 
11.3.3 Procedures  for Reporting  Adverse Events  
All AEs will be reported  from  the time  a signed  and dated ICD is obtained  until  completion  of the 
subject’s  last study  procedure  or visit (or termination  if the subject  terminates  early  from  the study  for 
any reason).  
AEs that occur between  end of study  and 30 calendar  days  after  completion of the study  will only be 
reported  to the Sponsor  if they  are serious.   SAEs  are reportable  beyond  this period if the event  is 
considered  study -related.  The Sponsor  will evaluate  any safety  information that  is spontaneously  
reported  by the PI beyond  the time  frame  specified  in the protocol.  
Subjects  are encouraged  to report  AEs spontaneously and in response  to questioning during the  visit 
(e.g.  if they  have  had any  side effects/issues  or changes  in their health). For  each  AE reported by the 
subject  or observed  by the study  team,  the study  team member  should notify  the PI, Study  Physician,  
or designee,  who will collect  information about  the event.  
All AEs, regardless  of seriousness,  severity,  or presumed  relationship to  study  procedures,  must  be 
recorded  using medical  terminology  on the Sponsor  provided  AE form  and then  entered  into the 
Electronic  Data  Capture  (EDC),  Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database.  These  events  must  then be 
entered  into the Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database  within  5 business  days  of the site’s  awareness.  
The DPR review  of AEs/SAEs  in Medidata  Rave  AE Universal Database  will be conducted within 5 
business  days  of each  entry  into Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database  in order  to escalate  any 
potential  safety  signal  to the Department Head.  
Whenever  possible,  diagnoses  should be  given  when  signs  and symptoms  are due to a common  
etiology  (e.g.,  cough,  runny  nose,  sneezing,  sore  throat,  and head  congestion should  be reported as 
“upper  respiratory  infection”).  The PI or, if the PI does  not have  a medical  background,  a medically  
qualified individual  (MD/DO)  designee,  must  record or  confirm  their  opinion concerning the  
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-161115154122 -SACT - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  24/33  
  
seriousness,  severity,  and relationship  of the AE to the study.  All measures  required for AE 
management  must  be recorded  and reported according to Sponsor  instructions.  
The PI or designee  must  also report  AEs to the appropriate  IRB unless  otherwise  required and 
documented by the IRB. 
If a SAE occurs,  in addition  to the above  reporting procedures,  the Site will immediately  notify  the 
Study  Manager  and Study  Director  by telephone or encrypted  e-mail  (see Appendix  III for Contact  
Information)  
 
Subsequent to a telephone  or encrypted  e-mail report  of an SAE,  a Clinical  Trial  SAE Report  Form  
(provided  to the study  site at the initiation  of the study)  must  be completed  by the investigational  staff  
with as  much  information as  possible  (however  at a minimum,  the subject  identification number,   
name  of investigational  product  [if applicable],  SAE description,  investigator’s  assessment  of causality,  
and name  of site personnel  reporting event are  required), signed  by the PI (or the medically  qualified  
designee),  and securely  transmitted  to the Study  Manager  and Study  Director  within 24  hours  of 
becoming aware  of the event.  
This timeframe  also applies  to additional  new  information (follow -up) on previously  forwarded SAE  
reports.  
In the rare event  that the Investigator’s  site does  not become  aware  of the occurrence  of a SAE 
immediately  (e.g.,  if an  outpatient  study  subject  initially  seeks  treatment  elsewhere),  the Investigator’s  
site is to report  the event  immediately  after  learning  of it as described  and document  the time  of the 
study  site’s  first awareness  of the SAE.  
 
The Study  Manager  or designee  will notify  the DPR within  1 calendar  day of SAE information  receipt.  The 
DPR will request  more  information  as necessary.  The Study Manager  or designee  will send  an e-mail  
appropriate  document  to Sponsor’s  OCMS  group  per local  procedures  within  the following  timelines:  
 
• fatal/life -threatening reports:  within  2 calendar  days  from  regulatory  clock  start date  
• other SAEs  and pregnancy  exposure  reports:  within 3 calendar  days  from  regulatory  clock  start  
date  
For all SAEs,  the PI is obligated to  pursue  and provide  information  to the Sponsor  in accordance  with  
the timeframes  for reporting specified above.  In addition,  the PI may  be requested by  the Sponsor  to 
obtain  specific  additional  follow -up information in an  expedited  fashion.  This information  may  be 
more  detailed than  that captured on the AE Form.  In general, this  will include  a description  of the SAE 
in sufficient  detail  to allow  for a complete  medical  assessment  of the case  and independent  
determination of possible  causality.  Information  on other  possibl e causes  of the event,  such as 
concomitant  medications  and illnesses,  must  be provided.  
In the case  of a subject  death,  a summary  of available  autopsy  findings  (if available)  and death  
certificate  should be collected if permission is obtained from  the subject’s  family.  
For a hospitalization,  a copy  of the hospital  discharge  summary  should  be requested.  If obtained,  
these documents  (with  subject’s  personal  identifiers  redacted)  should be  securely  submitted  as soon  
as possible  to the Sponsor  or its  designated  representative.

11.3.4 Monitoring  and Resolution  of Adverse Events  
11.3.4.1 Non -Serious  AEs 
All study -related  AEs will be followed  until  resolution,  until  a stable  clinical  endpoint  is reached,  or at 
least  30 days  post -study  withdrawal/completion.  This information  will be captured in the source  
document and entered  into Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database.  
 
11.3.4.2 Serious  AEs (SAEs)  
The PI or, if the PI does  not have a medical background,  the medically  qualified designee  (MD/DO)  will 
monitor  SAEs  until  resolution or until  one of the conditions  in 11.3.4.3  is met.  The information  will be 
captured in the  source  document and entered  into Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database.  The 
PI/designee  will also document  follow -up information on an updated  Clinical Trial  SAE form,  which  will 
be reviewed  by the PI or medically  qualified individual  designee  and sent  securely  to the Study  
Manager  or designee.  The Study  Manager  or designee  will forward  the document(s)  to the DPR and 
Study  Director  or designee,  and to OCMS  per local  procedures.  
 
11.3.4.3 Resolution  
The PI will be required  to assess  the outcome  of each  AE as  one of the following:  
Resolved;  
Not Resolved;  
Fatal;  
Resolved  with sequelae;  
Resolving;  
Unknown.  
 
Serious  AEs that have not  been resolved  by the end of the study,  or that have not  been resolved  upon  
discontinuation of the subject’s  participation in the  study,  must  be followed  until  any of the following  
occurs:  
the event  resolves  
the event  stabilizes  
the event  returns  to baseline,  if a baseline  value  is available  
the event  can be attributed  to factors  unrelated to study  conduct  
when  it becomes  unlikely  that any additional  information can be obtained  (subject  or 
healthcare  practitioner  refusal  to provide  additional  information,  lost to follow -up after  
demonstration  of due diligence  with follow -up efforts).  
 
11.3.5 Exposure In Utero  
For investigational  products  within clinical  studies,  an exposure  in utero  (EIU) occurs  if: 
• A woman is exposed  to the investigational  product  at any time  between her last menses  
prior  to conception  through the  delivery  of the baby.  
If any study  subject  becomes  or is found to  be pregnant  during the  study  subject’s  participation,  the PI 
must  report  the pregnancy  to the Sponsor  on a Pregnancy  Notification Form  (to be provided  by the 
Sponsor  when applicable).  Initial notification  via telephone  to the Sponsor’s  study  team  contact  must  
occur immediately  upon the Investigator  site’s  awareness  of the pregnancy.  The Pregnancy  
Notification Form  must  then  be sent  to the Sponsor  within 24 hours  of the site’s  awareness.  The 
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-161115154122 -SACT - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  26/33  
  
information  submitted should  include  the anticipated  date  of delivery  (see below  for information to  
document termination  of pregnancy).  
Follow -up is conducted  to obtain  pregnancy  outcome  information on all EIU reports.  The PI will  follow  
the pregnancy  until  completion  or until  pregnancy  termination (i.e.,  induced  abortion)  and then notify  
the Sponsor  of the outcome.  The PI will provide  this information  as a follow -up to the  initial  Drug  
Exposure  During  Pregnancy  Collection Form  A and/or  End of Pregnancy  Collection Form  B (provided  by 
the Sponsor  when  applicable). The  reason(s)  for an induced  abortion should be  specified.  An EIU 
report  is not created  when  an ectopic pregnancy  report  is received  since  this pregnancy  is not usually  
viable. Rather,  a SAE case  is created  with  the event  of ectopic  pregnancy.  
The PI should follow  the procedures  for reporting SAEs  if the outcome  of the pregnancy  meets  the 
criteria for immediate  classification as  a SAE (i.e., spontaneous  abortion,  stillbirth,  neonatal  death,  or 
congenital  anomaly  [including that  in an aborted fetus,  stillbirth,  or neonatal  death]). In the case  of a 
live birth,  the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed  at the time  of birth  (i.e.,  no minimum  
follow -up period  of a presumably  normal  infant  is required before  an End of Pregnancy  Collection  
Form  B can  be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus  can be assessed  by gross  visual  
inspection,  unless  pre-abortion test  findings  are suggestive  of a congenital  anomaly.  
Additional  pregnancy  outcomes  that are classified  as SAEs  and should be  reported  as such  include:  
 
“Spontaneous  abortion” includes  miscarriage  and missed  abortion;  
All neonatal  deaths  that occur  within  1 month  of birth,  without  regard  to causality;  
Any infant  death  after  1 month  that the PI assesses  as possibly  related  to in utero  exposure  to 
the investigational  product.  
 
12 ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
The privacy  information such  as the ICD and health  related questionnaire  of the subjects  will be kept  
confidential during the  study  and clearly  separated from the TMF.  
 
12.1  STUDY  SUBMISSION TO INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  BOARD/ INDEPENDENT ETHICS  COMMITTEE  
OR HEALTH  AUTHORITIES  
This study  (protocol,  ICD, recruiting material  [advertisements, phone  script,  etc.],  and all addenda)  will 
be reviewed  and approved  by an Institutional  Review  Board/Independent Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC)  
contacted by  the Study  Site.  
Details  of the IRB/IEC  for this study  are in Appendix  I. 
It is the  responsibility  of the PI to have  approval  of the study  protocol,  protocol  amendments,  ICD(s),  
and other  relevant  documents,  e.g.,  advertisements,  if applicable  from  the IRB/IEC.  
The study  will not be activated,  subjects  will not be recruited, consented, or receive  test materials  
until  such time  as the IRB/IEC  as approved  the required documentation.  In addition,  the IRB/IEC  will 
review  the study  before  any significant  change  in the  protocol  is initiated. After  each  review,  the 
IRB/IEC’s  approval  letter  will be  forwarded  to the Sponsor.  
All correspondence  with  IRB/IEC  should be  retained  in the SMF. Copies  of IRB/IEC  approvals  should be 
forwarded  to the Sponsor  and will  be filed  in the  TMF.

source  documents  to confirm  that the data  recorded  is complete  and accurate.  The PI and institution  
will allow  the Sponsor’s  monitor(s)  or its designee  and appropriate  regulatory  authorities  direct  access  
to source  documents  to perform  this verification.  If there  are any issues  noted, the  PI will be notified.  
Any contact  concerning  this study  should  be made  with  the Study  Manager  or the Study  Director  (see 
Appendix  I). 
The study  site may  be subject  to review  by the IRB/IEC,  and/or  to quality  assurance  audits  performed  
by the Sponsor,  and/or  to inspection by appropriate  regulatory  authorities.  
It is important  that the PI and his/her  relevant  personnel  are available  during  monitoring  and possible  
audits or inspections  and that sufficient  time  is devoted  to the  process.  
 
 
15 SPONSOR  DISCONTINUATION  CRITERIA  
Premature  termination  of this clinical  trial may  occur  because  of a change  in opinion of the IRB/IEC,  
investigational  product  or study  safety or at the discretion  of the Sponsor. If a trial is prematurely  
terminated  or discontinued,  the Sponsor  will promptly  notify  the PI. After  notification,  the PI or  
designated staff  must  contact  all participating subjects  within  10 business  days  (phone,  voicemail,  or 
certified  letter),  as applicable. As directed by  Sponsor,  all trial materials  must  be collected, all CRFs  
completed  to the greatest  extent  possible,  and termination reported  to the IRB/IEC.  
 
16 FINAL  REPORT  
The draft  report  will be submitted  to the Sponsor  for review  and changes  and may  be made  to the  
draft  report  at the Sponsor’s  request.  Upon  Sponsor’s/study  team’s approval,  the report  will be 
finalized  and forwarded  to the Sponsor.  
The final  report  will include  (but is not limited  to) the following  information:  study  design and protocol,  
subject  population demographics  statistical  methods  used,  results,  description  of adverse  events (if 
any),  discussions,  and conclusions.  
 
17 CONFIDENTIALITY  
All the information,  data  and results  of the study will be confidential. Every person  having  access  to 
these data will be informed  of this confidentiality.  
Medical  information  concerning the  subjects  obtained  by the investigator  during  the recruitment  and 
admission will  be handled confidentially.  
 
18 PUBLICATION  
The publication  agreement,  if any, between  the Sponsor  and the site is detailed in the clinical  trial 
agreement.

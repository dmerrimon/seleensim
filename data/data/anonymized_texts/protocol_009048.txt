Phase 3  
Methods:  
 
The study will have a 7-day screening period for each patient followed by  a 12-week participation 
period. A total of  171 subjects with knee pain  and decreased function  due to severe osteoarthritis 
of the knee (KL IV) will be enrolled.  In order to reduce the potential for bias in reporting 
outcome s, subjects wil l be randomized 6:1 (Ampion  intra-articular injection or saline intra -
articular injection).  Study visits will include: Screening visit, Baseline, a 24 -hour, post -injection 
follow up call, Week 2 phone visit, Week 6, Week 10 phone visit, and Week 12 for  a total of 7 
visits.  Screening, Baseline, Week 6 and Week 12 are in -office visits.  
The clinica l effect s of Ampio n treatment on OA pain , function and PGA  will be ev aluated during 
in-clinic visits at 6 and 12 weeks, and telephone contacts at 2 and 10 weeks, u sing the Western 
Ontario and McMaster  Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC®), and the Patient’s Global 
Assess ment of disease severity (PGA).  
 
The WOMAC® is a validated osteoarthritis scoring syst em and sets the standar d for the 
subject response . In order not to bias the collection of data, only questions from  the 
validated WOMAC scale and PGA will be asked of  subjects.  
 
Clinical be nefit will be established by evaluation of OMERACT -OARSI using the WOMAC  5-
point Likert scale and PGA as assessments durin g the in-office visits and phone visits. Sa fety will 
be asses sed by recor ding adverse  events (po st-injection and at all follow up contacts), physical 
examination and vitals ( Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12), and laboratory tests (Screening and Week 12).

WOMAC A, 5 -point Likert pain subscale);  
7. Moderate to moderately -severe  OA function in the study knee (rating  of at least 1.5 on 
the WOMAC C, 5 -point Likert Function subscale);  
8. WOMAC A, 5 -point Likert pain sub scale <1.5 in the contralateral  knee;  
9. Ability  to discontin ue NSAID use at Screening visit and/or 72 hours prior to the 
Baseline visit and for the dura tion of the clinical study (low -dose Aspirin (81 mg) is 
allowed during the study);  
10. No analgesia (including  aceta minophen) ta ken 24  hours pri or to an efficacy measure;

Criteria for Evaluation:  
 
Efficacy:  
WOMA C Osteoarthriti s Index 3.1, 5-point Liker t scale Patie nt 
Global Assess ment 
 
Safety: 
Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events (post -injection and at all follow -up 
contacts), change in laboratory analysis ( Screening  to Week 12), physical examination and 
vitals (Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12).  
 
Clinical Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
- Evaluate improvement of OMERACT -OARSI response of a single 4 mL Ampion intra -
articular injection  from Baseline  to Week 12  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
- Evaluate improvement in  the composite endpoint of pain and function (WOMAC A and 
C) from Baseline to  Week 12  
- Evaluate i mprovement in PGA from Baseline to Week 12  
- Evaluate improvement in the composite endpoint of pain and function (WOMAC A and 
C), compared to saline from all single -injection Ampion studies  
Statistical Methods:   
For the primary endpoint evaluating th e proportion of patients who are OMERACT -OARSI 
responders , the following hypothesis will be tested.  
 
 H0:π ≤ π0 versus H A:π > π0      
 
 Where π 0 is the hypothesized value for the proportion of responders.  The value will be 30% 
in this study.   This test will be tested using an exact binomial test.   That is, given the sample 
size of n, the number of responders X, and the value of π0 =0.30, then probability that X or 
more events would be observed will be calculated as the p -value.  Since this is a one -sided 
test, the alpha level will be 0.025.  
 
Blinding and Randomization  
 
Subjects will be assigned in a 6:1 ratio  to treatment by a randomization schedule developed 
and maintained by an independe nt statistician. Ampion and  saline  will be provided in blinded

 study vials labeled with the appropriate information and packed into patient kits.  Each patient 
kit will conta in labeled vials, blinded for drug content, syringes, needles and rescue 
medication.   
The Sponsor, the investigator, and all study staff having a role in the day -to-day conduct of the 
study will remain blinded to treatment.  
A comprehensive presentation of  the data management and statistical analysis plan will be 
approved by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. prior to unblinding of study data.

1 INTRODUCTION  
 
HSA has a long history of clinical use as a co lloid replacement therapy, dating back over  
60 years.  Currently, HSA is approved for the  indications of hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia, 
prevention of central volume depletion after paracentesis du e  to cirrhotic ascites, ovarian 
hyperstimulation, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute nephrosis, hemolytic 
disease of the newborn and burns.  In addition to its effects on oncotic pressure, HSA  has 
pharmacological effects including decreased inflammation ( Qu inlan 2005) , decreased 
va
scular permeability ( Evans 2002) and no adverse effect on cardiac safety ( Vincent JL, 
2004). 
 
Ampion™, the < 5 kilodalton (kDa) ultrafiltrate of 5% human serum albumin (HSA), is  
being developed to provide relief for the pain of severe osteoarthritis of the knee. There ar e  
no currently F DA approved drugs for th e indication of pain from  se ve re (KL 4) osteoarthritis 
of the knee for which Ampion is indicated. Ampion is a heterogeneous solution that contains 
se
veral known small molecules and unknown components that may act synergistically. The 
indi
vidual contribution(s) of the unknown components to the biologic activity of Ampion 
may not be quantifiable since over 1200 peptides an d proteins h ave been identified in 
commercial HSA preparations [ Gay, 2010].  
 
B
ar-Or et al found that commercial preparations of HSA are heterogeneous in term s of 
post
translational modifications, including C- and N-terminal truncation, cysteinylation, 
g
lycation and nitrosylation (Bar-Or D, 2005). An important modification is the cleavage of 
the two N-terminal amino acids Aspartate (D) and Alanine (A). This occurs by the action of a 
naturally occurring dipeptidase (Bar-Or 2013) present in plasma and also bound to or 
a
ssociated with leukocytes and endothelial cells ( Ohnuma 2006 ), and activated during the 
FDA required heat-treatment of commercial preparations of HSA. After cleavage, th e 
dipeptide under
goes cyclisation to form a diketopiperazine (aspartylalanyl diketopiperazine 
[
DA-DKP]). DA-DKP  is found in the  low molecular weight fraction (< 5000 Da )  of 
commercial lots of HSA at concentrations ranging from approximately 100 μM.in vitro 
studi
es and its action in human subjects suggest that it is an active ingredient in the 
pharmacological effects of HSA and of Ampion™. Other components, such as N-acetyl 
tryptophan and its metabolites and sodium caprylate present in HSA and Ampion, act 
s
ynergistically with DA- DKP on numerous molecular pathways involved in infla mm ation, 
nociceptive and neuropathic pain, vascular permeability and the resolution of inflammation 
in 
various cell types including synoviocytes, chondrocytes, PBMC, macrophages, memory T 
c
ells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells (T ho mas, GW 2016) (Fredrick ED 2016) 
(Bar-Or 2015) ( Shimonkevitz 2008 ) (Bar-Or 2006) (Bar-Or 2005)

1.2 BACKGROUND TO THE DISEASE  
 
Osteoarthritis (OA) remains a leading contributor to global disability, with both hip and knee 
OA accounting for over 17 million years lived with disability ( Cross 2014). OA is the most 
c
ommon form of arthritis and affects up to 38 million adu lts in the US alone. OA is caused 
by inflammation of the soft tissue an d  bony structures of th e  joint which worsens over tim e 
a
nd leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage, narr owing of the joint space, synovial 
membrane thickening, osteophyte formation and increased density of subchondral bone. 
The
se changes eventually result in chronic pain and disability and deterioration of the joint 
despite drug therapy may require eventual surgery for total joint  replacement. OA of the 
knee is defined in stages as noted by Kellgren Lawrence grading: Grade 0 (normal knee; no 
osteophytes or joint space narrowing), Grade 1 (possible osteophytic lipping and doubtful 
na
rrowing of joint space), Grade 2 (definite osteophytes an d possible narrowing of joint 
space), Grade 3 (moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space and some 
sc
lerosis, and possible deformity of the bone ends) and Grade 4 (large osteophytes, marked 
na
rrowing of joint space, severe sclerosis, an d definite deformity of bone ends). 
 
Patients with severe OAK, defined radiologically as KL grade 4, have few treatment options 
for
 pain management. Even with r eported di ff iculties in managing symptoms, including pain, 
a large number of KL 4 patients do not discuss pain or OA during consultations. Many 
pa
tients perceived that they just had to put up with pain until their joint replacement because 
ther
e was nothing else that could be done ( Mc Hugh 2007). The net result is that the patients 
c
ontrol their pain by limiting their activity, and this can progress to the  point of losin g the 
a
bility to ambulate in the community.  There is a consequent loss of the benefits of activity 
a
nd the cond itioning that this provides, leading to a deterioration of health in general, 
including both physical and psychological effects (Cisternas 2016). D ifficult- to-treat pain 
conditions, such as severe OAK, are a challenge for both medical and surgical doctors and 
pa
tients. There is no doubt that patients with chronic pain in general suffer from an unmet 
ne
ed, as FDA agreed stating that there is an unmet medical need among patients with severe 
osteoarthritis . 
 
The
 pain associated with osteoarthritis is now thought to be multifactorial. The pathogenesis of 
pain from OA is comprised of both nociceptive and neuropathic pain pathways resulting from 
severely damaged cartilage, exposed subchondral bone, joint innervation, and less defined 
pathways including the synovium. A recent publication in  January 2016 ( A kinci 2016)  noted 
that the balance between nociceptive and neuropathic pain shifts towards neuropathic pain as 
the severity of the condition increases. The multifactorial nature of the pain of osteoarthritis 
may make pain control more difficult, particularly in patients with severe OA (KL4)  
 
The presence of synovitis in KL 4 patients indicates active ‘inflammatory’ disease process. 
The
se findings were supported with a linear observation of an increasing trend correlated with 
the severity of synovitis related to advancing KL grades. Additionally, KL 4 patients have 
be
en shown to have lesions that fluctuate with pain, (i.e., fluctuating bone marrow lesions 
a
nd synovitis) related to a high grade of cartilage loss in KL 4 patients (Guermazi 2015). 
The
se findings were further supported using a unique in vivo imaging technique that detected 
activated and not resting macrophages ( Kraus 2016) . In a patient cohort that included patients 
Ampion™  Version 1. 3 09 November  2017  
Clinical Study Protocol: AP -003-C Confidential    
16 
  
with severe (KL 4) OAK, the quantity of knee-related activated macrophages was 
statis
tically associated with more severe knee pain and radiographic severity of knee OAK. 
 
The
se data demonstrated that greater macrophage mediated inflammation is a cause of more 
severe pain in KL 4 OAK an d provides a rationale whereby Ampion, demonstrated in vitr o 
with anti- inflammatory and anti-macrophage activity, may mediate sympto m atic relief in this 
patient group. These data further demonstrate the  need  to examine patients by disease 
se
verity and supply treatment options for severely diseased patients ( Gue rmazi 2015). 
A
mpion has shown anti-inflammatory activity in vitro against macrophages, monocytes, and 
im
mune cells.  
When the clinical trials of Ampion were designed, it was assumed that the vehicle for the 
product, saline, would have little to no effect in reducing pain, stiffness, or improving physical 
function.  This control was determined not to be a true placebo, but rather turned out to be 
active treatment.  
The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) and Standing Committee for 
Clinical Trials Response Criteria Initiative Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) 
committee, in concert with the international rheumatology community, worked to develop a 
uniform core set of outcome measures for osteoarthritis. While the committee initially 
developed two sets of responder criteria to present the results of changes after treatment in three 
symptomatic domains (pain, function, and patient’s global assessment) as a single variable for 
clinical trials, the committee ultimately worked to create a simplified set of responder criteria, 
Scenario D, which captured the criteria for response.  
In the original plan, for each domain, a response was defined by both a relative and an absolute 
change, with different cut-offs with regard to the drug, the route of administration and the OA 
localization. The formal OMERACT-OARSI scenarios defined a responder as  
a. having achieved a high degree of improvement in pain or a moderate degree of 
improvement in 2 of the 3 response domains (pain, function, global assessment) 
(scenario A) OR  
b. a s having achieved a high degree of improvement in either pain or function, or a 
moderate degree of improvement in 2 of the 3 response domains (scenario B) 
The composite index permits presentation of results of symptom modifying clinical trials in OA 
based on individual patient responses (responder yes/no). The use of composite indices was still 
somewhat controversial in that the original OARSI criteria did not account for multiplicity of 
comparisons, however OMERACT-OARSI worked to rectify this and their conclusions were 
presented at the OMERACT 6 conference.  
OMERACT and OARSI established a task force aimed at evaluating: (1) the variability of 
observed placebo and active treatment effects using the OARSI responder criteria; and (2) the 
possibility of proposing a simplified set of criteria. Because individual study endpoints in 
studies of NSAIDs in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis were highly correlated, 
OMERACT-OARSI evaluated six different scenarios to determine whether a simplified set of 
criteria could be developed. The conclusions of the task force were presented and discussed 
during the OMERACT 6 conference, where a simplified set of responder criteria (OMERACT-
OARSI set of criteria) was proposed. Scenario D was chosen by the members, indicating the 
importance of having both a relative change and an absolute change as part of the criteria for 
response.

 The criteria for a responder using the Likert Scale, where the 20-point change on the VAS scale 
is the same as a 1-point change on the Likert Scale and, similarly, the 10-point change in the 
VAS scale is the same as a 0.5-point change on the Likert Scale, are defined as: 
 
1. Hig h improvement in pain or in function ≥ 50% and absolute change in Likert pain scale 
of ≥1 OR 
2. I mprovement in at least two of the 3 following: 
a. pain ≥ 20% and absolute change in Likert score ≥0.5 
b. func tion ≥ 20% and absolute change in Likert score ≥0.5 
c. patient’s global assessment ≥ 20% and absolute change in Likert score ≥0.5 
 
1.3 PREVIOU S HUMAN EXPER IENCE  
 
In addition to the extensive clinical experience with HSA, Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has 
com
pleted multiple clinical studies to evaluate the tre atm ent effect of Ampion in subjects 
with OAK. These studies are summarized in Section 1.5.  
 
1
.4 PRECLIN ICAL DATA  
 
1.4.1 Pharmacology Studies  
 
In vitro pharmacology studies demonstrated that a low molecular weight fraction 
(< 3000 da
ltons [Da]) of more than five commercial preparations of HSA, an d a cyclized 
dipeptide contained in that fraction, Asp- Ala diketopiperazine (DA-DKP) have a range of 
a
nti-inflammatory properties, which may be expected to ameliorate the symptoms of 
infla
mmation, including pain, in man ( B ar-Or et al 2006). These studies showed  reduced 
inflammatory cytokine production from human T lymphocytes in vitro vi a  modulation  of 
signal transduction through increased expression of Rap-1, an d inhi bition of macrophage 
activation. In addition, DA -DKP enhanced integrity of human endothelial cell junctions in 
the tr
ansendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay, which would result in decreased 
va
scular permeability to the influx of inflammatory cells in vivo. No pharmacokinetics 
studi
es were performed as the pl asma levels of the constituents of the < 5000 Da preparation, 
including
 DA-DKP, after intra- articular injection of a therapeutic dose in man or in 
laboratory animals are anticipated to be below the limits of detection. For more information, 
consult the Investigator Brochure.

1.4.2 Toxicity and Safety Studies  
 
HSA and other components of serum albumin preparations are spec ies specific an d may be 
e
xpected to be immunogenic if repeatedly injected into non-human species, even at very low 
concentrations.  For this reason, it wa s  not possible to  perform  for mal toxicological studies in 
animals. 
 
1.5 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
 
 
Ampio has conducted multiple clinical studies to evaluate the treatment effect and safety of 
Ampion in subjects with OAK. Ampion has been administered across 6 clinical studies as a 
sing
le intra articular (IA) injection or as three IA injections ad m inistered every two weeks. 3 
single-dose pivotal Phase 3 studies, 2 multi-dose studies, and 1 multiphase single-dose phase 
1b st
udy have been completed.  An overview of the efficacy studies is provided in the Ta ble 
1.5.1 
 
For the clinical deve lopment program, all studies were conducted in subjects with moderate 
to moderately severe pain due to OA of th e  knee. Patients were required to have x-ray 
fin
dings demonstrating KL gr a de 2, 3, or 4. All studies enrolled patients with KL 4. In 
addition, eligible subjects had at least moderate pain at Baseline (defin ed as a score of at least 
1.5 on th e  WOMAC Index 3.1, 5-point Likert pain subscale at screening) in the study knee, 
whic
h was to have been symptomatic for greater than 6 months with a clinical diagnosis of 
OA confirmed by radiological evidence. The clinical effects of treatment on OA pain were 
evaluated during clinic visits, wi th phone cal l  follow-ups at intermittent times.

CONCLUSIONS  
 
Clinical efficacy observed in previous single-injection studies suggest that Ampion safely 
re
lieves pain du e  to severe,  KL 4, osteoarthritis of the knee, the most severe form of OAK, 
for
 which there is no FDA approved treatment alternative. While opioids ca n treat pain, and 
tot
al knee replacement can excise the affected tissues, the ability to treat OAK pain and 
inflammation locally is an unme t medical need.  Currently, when KL 4 patients are treated 
for
 OAK, they are receiving treatment using intra-articular therapy (such as 
viscosupplementation) that were not studied, nor required in th eir  device approvals to 
demonstrate efficacy in the KL 4 population (Rutjes 2012). Without surgery, with only a 
sing
le intra-articular injection of Ampion, KL 4 patients are able to achieve clin ica lly 
meaningful pain relief.

2 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY 
 
This is a phase 3 randomized study is to confirm the efficacy of an intra- art icular injection of 
Amp
ion™ and is designed to follow on from the completed single-injection Ampion studies. 
This s
tudy explores the clinical impact of Ampion-treatment in patients with severe OA 
using
 criteria developed by OMERACT-OARSI ( Pham 2004 ).  
 
The appropriateness of a within-patient multi-component endpoint is generally determined by 
clinical considerations, and as such, the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria, which evaluates 
pain, function and patient global assessment, and has been deemed clinically meaningful for OA 
trials, remains an endpoint in this clinical investigation. 
 
In addition to evaluating response to treatment (Y/N), the study will evaluate a composite 
endpoint of pain and function, as well as improvement in PGA, using OMERACT-OARSI 
criteria. Analysis of Ampion response to saline from previously conducted single-injection 
Ampion s
tudies will also be evaluated.   
 
Ampio plans to evaluate patients who complete study AP-003-C in an open label extension 
st
udy. The protocol for the open-label extension study will be submitted under separate cover.

3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 STUD Y DESIGN OVERVIEW  
 
A confirmatory, randomized, ph ase 3 study with a 7-day screening period for each subject 
followe
d by a 12-week participa tion period. A total of 171 subjects with knee pain and 
de
creased function due to severe os teoarthritis (KL 4) will b e e nrolled in a 6:1 randomization 
sc
hema: 4 mL Ampion intra-articular injection: 4 mL saline intra-articular injection.  Study 
visits will include: Screening visit, Baseline, a 24-hour, a post- injection follow-up phone call, 
W
eek 2 phone visit, Week 6, Week 10 phone visit, and Week 12 for a total of 7 visits.  
Screening, Baseline, Week 6 and W eek 12 ar e in-office visits. 
 
The clinical effects of Ampion treatment on OA pain will be evaluated during in-clinic visits 
a
t 6 and 12 weeks, and telephone contacts at 2 and 10 weeks, using the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC®) and the Patient’s Global Assessment of 
disease severity (PGA). 
 
The WO MAC® is a validated Osteoarthritis scoring system an d sets the  standard for  the 
subj
ect response. In order not to bias the collection of data, only questions from the 
va
lidated WOMAC scale and PGA will be asked of subjects. 
 
Clinical benefit will be established by evaluation of the OMERACT-OARSI response using 
the
 WOMAC and PGA scales as assessed during the in-office visits an d phone visits. Safety 
w
ill be assessed by recording adverse events (post-injection and at all follow-up contacts), 
ph
ysical examinations, vitals (Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12), and laboratory analysis (Screening 
and Week 12). 
 
3.2 STUD Y OBJECTIVES 
 
3.2.1 Primary Objective  
 
The primary trial objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a single intra-articular 
inj
ection (4 mL) of Ampion. 
3
.2.2 Secondary Objective  
 
The secondary trial objectives are to evaluate the safety of a single intra-articular injection (4 
mL) of Ampion. 
3.3 SAFETY MONITORING COMTTEE  
 
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be established to re view the safety of Ampion 
as the study progresses. The SMC will consist of independen t clinicians not involved in the 
clinical trial.  The SMC will be primarily responsible for reviewing any serious Adverse 
Event (SAE) and other clinically important safety findings (e. g., discontinuations due to 
 
AE
s) that may occur during the s tudy.  A charter will be dev eloped to detail the SMC review 
responsibilities, the frequency of meetings, and data evaluation plans.

5 STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 
 
Subjects will be randomized into the  study 6:1 to receive an IA injection  of 4 mL Ampion™ 
or 4
 mL saline on Visit 2, Day 0 (Baseline). Telephone contact will be made with the subject 
24 hour
s after the IA injection. The subject will be followed fo r  12 weeks and the  clinical 
effects of treatment on OA pain will be evaluated during clinic visits at 6 and 12 weeks, and 
during telephone contacts at 2 and 10 weeks, using the WOMAC osteoarthritis Index 3.1 
(pa
in subscore, stiffness subscore and function subscore) an d an overall global severity 
a
ssessment (Patient’s Global Assessment [PGA]). Safety will be assessed by recording 
adve
rse events (through 24 hours post-dose and at all follow up in - clinic visits and telephone 
contacts), vital signs (Baseline, and Weeks 6 and 12), recording prior and concomitant 
m
edications including start/stop dates, indication, dose an d frequency (through 24 hours 
post
-dose and at all follow up in-clinic visits and telephone contacts), physical examination 
(B
aseline and Weeks 6 and 12), and laboratory tests (Screening and Week 12). The 
assessments and procedures performed at each subject visit or contact are described in 
S
ection 5. 1 and in Table 6.1 .

Laboratory Assessments 
Blood will be collected at Screening and Week 12 and analyzed by a local lab. Reference 
ranges must be available to evaluate lab values during the course of the study. 
 
See Table 6.1  for full schedule of assessments and procedures 
 
 
 
6.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMEN TS 
 
Note: Efficacy questionnaire questions will be asked “with reference to study knee” i. e. to 
obtain scores specific for the treated knee. 
 
6.1
.1 WOMAC® Osteoarthritis Index ( Bellamy 1988 ) 
 
WOMAC Index 3.1 (sections A-C), using the 5-point Likert scale, should be com pleted by 
subjects at Screen ing, pre-dose and  pre-aspiration as applicable on Day 0 and at Weeks 2,  6, 
10 and 12. All subjects are required to take at least 5  minutes to complete the  questionnaire. 
Subjects are asked about their pain, stiffness, and function in the knee (study  joint) due to 
arthritis during the last 24 hours. 
 
S
ubjects respond to each subscale by using a 5-point Likert score (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 =  
moderate, 3  = severe, 4 = extreme). 
 
6
.1.2 Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Severity (PGA)  
 
The PGA should be completed by subjects at Screening, pre-dose and pre-aspiration as 
applicable on Day 0 (prior to injection), and at Weeks 2, 6, 10  and 12. 
 
S
ubjects are asked the following question: “Considering all the ways in which your arthritis  
affects you,  please indicate how you are doing.” 
 
Subjec
ts respond by using a 5-point adjectival Likert score (0 = very well, 1 = well, 2  = fair,  
3 = poor, 4  = very poor). 
 
6.2 SAFETY  PARAMET ERS 
 
Based on results of previous studies of a single intra-articular injection of Ampion™ < 5 kDa  
ultrafiltrate of 5% HSA  in adults with OA of the knee in which  no clinically significant 
diff
erences between active and saline were found, safety will be assessed by recording 
a
dverse ev e nts, vital signs, results of physical examination, recording prior and concomitant 
medications and safety labs.

.2.2 Clinical laboratory tests  
 
Subjects in the will undergo a blood draw at Screening and  Week 12. Bloo d draws should be 
done after subject meets all other inclusion/exclusion criteria at Screening; Blood draws 
should be
 done at Week 12 after al l  WOMAC an d PGA assessments are completed.  All 
clinically significant values will be followed up at the Investigator’s discretion . Blood 
laboratory results must be reviewed and compared to reference ranges throughout the study to 
evaluate for potential adverse events. Blood draws will be performed in co m pliance with 
standard laboratory procedures.  
 
The following analysis will be conducted by the local laboratory: 
 
Serum biochemistry: Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, urea, creatinine, 
creatine kinase, urate, phosphate, total calcium, cholesterol, albumin, globulins, protein, total 
bil
irubin, conjugated bilirubin, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate 
de
hydrogenase (LD). 
 
Hematology: Hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean cell volume (MCV), mean 
cell hem oglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelets, white cell 
count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.

7 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
 
7.1 EARLY DISCONTINUATIO N OF THE STUDY  
 
It is agreed that for reasonable cause, either the investigator or the Sponsor may terminate 
thi
s study, provided a written notice is submitted at a reasonable time in advance of intended 
termination; if by the investigator notice is to be submitted to Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
a
nd if by the Sponsor, notice will be provided to each investigator. 
 
If a severe local reaction or drug-related SAE occurs at any time during the study, the Safety 
Monitoring Committee will review the case immediately. 
 
The study will be immediately suspended and no additional Ampion treatments administered 
pending
 review and discussion of al l  appropriate study data by th e  SM C  if 1 or more subjects 
de
velop any of the following adverse events deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to A mpion by the Investigator and/or Medical Monitor, based upon close temporal 
re
lationship or other factors: 
 
• Death 
• Anaphylaxis (angioedem a, hypotension, shock, bronchospasm, hypoxia, or 
re
spiratory distress) 
• Induction of autoimmune arthritis 
• Hepatic failure 
• Aplastic anemia. 
 
The study will not be restarted until all parties have agreed to the course of action to be taken 
and the IRB/EC has been notified. 
 
7.2 EARLY DISCONTINUATION OF INDIV IDUAL SUBJECTS  
 
Subjects are to be withdrawn from the study fo r  an y  of the following reasons: 
 
• Withdrawal of informed consent 
• Subject is lost to follow up. 
 
Subjects will also be withdrawn at any time if the investigator concludes that it would be in 
the subject’s best interest for any reason.  Protocol violations do not lead to subject 
withdrawal unless they constitute a significant risk to the subject’s safety. 
 
S
ubjects can voluntarily withdraw from the trial for any reason at any tim e. They are to be 
considered withdrawn if they state an intention to  withdraw, fail to return for visits, or 
be
come lost to follow up for any reason. Subjects withdrawing from the study because of an 
AE should be followed for at least 30 days, resolution of th e  AE or until no further 
i
mprovement is expected, whichever co m es first.

8 TREATMENT  
 
Eligible subjects will be randomized (6:1) to a single 4 mL Am pion i ntra-articular injection 
or a single 4 mL saline injection i nto the study knee. 
 
Subjects will be randomized to an assigned subject number after confirmation of 
e
ligibility, just prior to treatment. 
 
8.1 DOSIN G AND ADMINISTRATI ON OF STUD Y MEDICATION  
 
Appropriately trained site personnel should ad m inister the study treatment. 
 
I
f both knees are osteoarthritic, then at Screening the Investigator should select the knee that 
best satisfies the requirem ents for the study (see inclusion criteria 6 - 7) as the study knee.  At 
the time of dose administration, the study knee should be treated with received 
investigational product in accordance with the randomization schedule.  The other knee 
sho
uld receive standard of care. 
 
Aspira
tion of the study knee should only occur if an effusion is present. Aspiration and 
volu
me of aspiration should be noted on the study source notes/eCRF. The study treatment 
should be administered as an injection into the knee joint space under sterile prep conditions, 
(i.e
. prior to injection, th e  knee should be cleaned with an antiseptic).   
 
The
 recommended procedures is to administer the injection into the knee joint space with the 
sub
ject in th e  seated position with the treatment knee flexed at 90° . The area of injection is 
inferior lateral to the patella; lateral level of the  join t line.   
 
The Principal Investigator may determine whether anesthesia of the treatment area with a 
topical anesthe sia or nothing is appropriate. Injection of lidocaine prior to th e  Ampion 
in
jection is no t  allowed.   
 
The needle should be passed through the fat pad to the firm su rface of the intercondylar 
notch. Following th e  withdrawal of th e  needle, it is recommended that fingertip pressure be 
applied to the injection site, and then a sterile dressing (BandAid) is used to cover the 
i
njection site. Injection should proceed easily.  
 
The recommended needle for this injection is a 25-gauge needle that is 1.5 inches long. 
 
F
ailure to easily inject should be documented as a potential non-inter-articular injection. The 
injector and date of administration should be recorded in the study source notes/eCRF. 
 
Subjects should be advised to abstain from submersing their knee in water for at least 24 
hours (swimming pool, baths, lakes, ect.).  Showering is acceptable. 
 
8.2 DRUG STORAGE AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
Study drug should be stored at room temperature (59º – 77ºF or 15º – 25ºC) in a secure area 
with re
stricted access and temperature monitoring.  A temperature monitor calibration must 
be provided to the CRO prior to receiving study drug.

9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
9.1 DEFINIT ION OF AN ADVER SE EVENT  
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesired medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investi
gation subject receiving a phar m aceutical product and which does not necessarily have 
a
 causal relationship with this treatment. An AE ca n therefore be any unfavorable sign and 
unintended sign (including an abno rmal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to th e  study drug. 
 
Asse
ssment of severity of an AE will be rated according to categories listed in T AB LE 9.1. 
 
TABLE 9.1 DEFINITIONS OF AE S EVERI TY 
 
Grade  1 (MI LD): 
The symptom is barely noticeabl e to the study subject and does  not influence performance or functioning. 
Concomitant medication is not ordinarily indicate d for relief of mild AE s. 
Grade 2 (MODERATE):  
The symptom is of sufficie nt severity to make the study subject uncomfortable and to influence  performance 
of daily activities.  Concomitant medicatio n may be indica ted for relief of moderate AEs. 
Grade 3 (SEVERE):  
The sy mptom  causes sev ere disco mfort, sometimes of such severity  that the study subject cannot continue in 
the study. Daily activities are significantly impaired or prevented by the symptom. Concomitant medication 
may be indica ted for relief of sever e AEs.  
 
Determination of the relationship between the AE and the study drug will be made using the 
guidelines
 presented in  TABLE 9.2. 
 
TAB
LE 9.2 G UIDE LINES FOR DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIP (IF ANY) 
BETWEEN ADVERSE EVENT AND THE STUDY DRUG  
 
Unrelated  The adverse event is unlikely to have been caused by study drug. 
Possib ly related  It is unclear  whether the adverse event may have  been caused by study drug. 
Related  The adverse event is likely to have  been caused by study drug. 
 
 
9.2 DEFINIT ION OF A SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose 
tha
t: 
 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) 
• Requires in-patient hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons) or 
prolonga
tion of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persis tent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Ampion™  Version 1. 3 09 November  2017  
Clinical Study Protocol: AP -003-C Confidential    
41 
  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are  not life-threatening, or do not 
re
quire hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to preven t one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events include 
a
llergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
d
yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Hospitalizations for elective surgery or other medical procedures that ar e  not related to a 
tre
atment-emergent AE are not considered SAEs. 
 
9.3 RECORD ING OF ADVERSE EVEN TS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
 
Recording and reporting of adverse events should be in accordance with the  FDA fina l 
“Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
BA/BE Studies” of December 2012. 
 
Any AE is to be recorded in the eC R F. In order to avoid  vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions, the  AE should be rec orded in standard medical terminology rather than the 
subject’s own words.  Whenever possible, the investigator should combine signs and 
symptom s that cons titute a single diagnosis. 
 
The existence of an AE may be concluded from a spontaneous report of the subject; from the 
ph
ysical examination; or from special tests e.g., laboratory assessments, where applicable, or 
othe
r study-specified tests (source of AE). 
 
The
 reporting period begins from the time that the subject receives IA injection at the 
B
aseline visit through subject’s Final Visit at 12 weeks. An y  events continuing at study exit 
will
 be followed for 30 days or to resolution, o r until no improvement is expected, whichever 
com
es first. Any SAE occurring after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a 
c
ausal relationship to the investigational drug is suspected. If the subject begins a new 
ther
apy, the safety reporting period ends at the time the new treatment is started, however, 
death must always be reported when it occurs during the 12-week study period, irrespective 
of inter
vening treatment. 
 
Each AE is to be evaluated fo r  duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the 
investigational drug.  The action taken and the outcom e must also be re cor ded. 
 
9.3.1 AE Follow up 
 
All AEs occurring during the study ar e  to be followed up in accordance with good medical 
practice until they are resolved, stabilized or judged no longer clinically significant o r, if a 
chronic condition, until fully characterized.  Any AEs that are considered drug-related 
(possibly
 related, definitely related) must be followed  for 30 days, or to resolution, or until no 
i
mprovement is expected, whichever occurs firs t. 
Ampion™  Version 1. 3 09 November  2017  
Clinical Study Protocol: AP -003-C Confidential    
42 
  
9.3.2 Overdose  
 
No information on treatment of overdose of Ampion is currently available. However, it is 
comm
on medical practice to administer 5% HSA, the sole starting material of Ampion, in 
multiple infusions until hemorrhage is controlled thereby resulting in higher systemic 
concentrations of the significant components of Ampion.  
 
In the  case of overdose, the subject should be followed as for an AE and approp riate 
supportive medical treatment instigated. 
 
9.4 SERIOU S ADVERSE EVEN T REPOR TING 
 
9.4.1 Reporting Requirements  
 
Unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions ar e  subject to expedited reporting to FDA. 
ALL
 SAEs must be entered in t o th e  eCRF within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by 
st
udy personnel. It is important that the investigator provide his/her assessment of 
re
lationship to study drug at the time of the initial report. Entry of an SA E  into  the eCRF 
trigg
ers an automatic alert to the CRO safety team. The  following information must be 
re
ported: 
 
• Protocol number 
• Site and/or Investigator number 
• Subject number 
• Demographic data 
• Brief description of the event 
• Onset date and time 
• Resolution date and time, if the event resolved 
• Current status, if event not yet resolved 
• Any concomitant treatment and medication 
• Investigator’s assessment of whether th e  SAE wa s  related to Inv estigative product or 
not. 
 
The CRO Safety Associate will con tact the site for cla rification of data entered onto the 
eCRF, or to obtain missing information.  In the event of questions regarding SAE reporting, 
the site may contact the appropriate individual as in Section 9.4.2. 
 
9.4.2 SAE Information  
 
Ampio Pharmaceuticals Inc., or their designee CR O, is responsible for submitting reports of 
AEs associated  with the  use of the drug that are both serious and  unexpected  to FDA 
a
ccording to 21 CFR 312.32 and the final guidan ce (2012). All investigators participating in 
ongoing clinical studies with the study medication will receive copies of these reports for 
pro
mpt submission to their Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Et hics committee (EC).

10 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
10.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This section describes the rules and conventions to be used in the  presentation an d analysis of 
the data.  A comprehensive presentation of the data management and statistical analysis plan 
will be approved by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., prior to stu dy com pletion. 
 
10.1.1 Statistical and Analytical Plan:  
 
This is a randomized, confirmatory study in subjects with severe OA (KL 4) of the knee. 
Subjects will be followed over a 12-week treatment period to assess the efficacy of 
Ampion™ on cha
nges in pain, stiffness and function, and patient satisfaction (PGA) and to 
assess the safety of Ampion™ by monitoring adverse events. 
 
A wit
hin-patient, multi-component endpoint, OMERACT-OARSI responder analysis, 
evaluating pain, function, and PGA, will be used as primary analysis for this study. 
The saline group in this study is designed to maintain a blind the study is not powered to 
make inference about patients receiving saline; therefore, the results from patients receiving 
saline will be summarized but no comparisons or inferences will be made. 
 
10.2 STATISTICAL OBJECTIVES  
 
The primary statistical objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a single intra-articular injection 
of Ampion. Efficacy will be evaluated by the percentage of patients who are considered an 
OMERACT
-OARSI responder at 12 weeks after a single 4 mL Ampion™ intra-articular 
inj
ection at Baseline. 
OMERACT-
OARSI response is evaluated by: 
A patient in this study will be considered a responder for the purpose of efficacy analysis if the 
following criteria is met. 
1) The patient has:  
a. a percent improvement in pain (WOMAC pain) from baseline of ≥50% and an 
absolute change in pain from baseline of ≥ 1 point; or  
b. a percent improvement in function (WOMAC function) from baseline of ≥50% and 
an absolute change in function from baseline of ≥1 point.   
Meeting one of the above criterion designates the patient as a responder.  If the patient does 
not m
eet this criterion, then the patient must meet the criterion below to be considered a 
re
sponder. 
2) The patient demonstrates improvement in at least 2 of the following: 
a. Improvement in pain (WOMAC pain) over baseline of ≥20% and a 0.5-point 
absolute change in pain 
Ampion™  Version 1. 3 09 November  2017  
Clinical Study Protocol: AP -003-C Confidential    
44 
 b. Improvement in function (WOMAC function) over baseline of ≥20% and a 0.5-
point absolute change in function 
c. Improvement in patient global assessment (PGA) over baseline of ≥20% and a 0.5-
point absolute change in PGA 
The second statistical objectives are to: 
 
˗ Eva luate the improvement in the composite endpoint of pain and function (WOMAC A 
and WOMAC C) from Baseline to Week 12  
- Evaluate the improvement in patient global assessment (PGA) from Baseline to Week 
12  
- Eva
luate improvement in the composite endpoint of pain and function (WOMAC A and 
C) compared to saline from all single-injection Ampion studies. 
 
The composite endpoint of pain and function (WOMAC A and WOMAC C) will be evaluated 
using a “controlled” OMERA CT-OARSI responder criteria, defined as: 
 
 I mprovement in pain and function (WOMAC A and WOMAC C) over baseline of 
≥20% and a 0.5 point absolute change 
Improvement in patient global assessment will also follow OARSI’s recommendation for a 
clinically meaningful improvement, defined as: 
 
 Improvement in patient global assessment (PGA) over baseline of ≥20% and a 0.5 
point absolute change in PGA 
 
10.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
 
10.3.1 Safety Analy sis Population:  
 
The safety analysis population is defined as al l  subjects wh o  receive study medication 
(Ampion or sa
line). Subjects w ill be analyzed as treated. 
 
1
0.3.2 Intent-to-treat Population:  
 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) analy sis population is defined as all subjects who are randomized, 
re
gardless of whether or not they have received the  investigational product, or have a post- 
baseline vi sit. All efficacy analys es will be performed in the ITT population. Subjects will 
be analyzed as treated. 
 
1
0.3.3 Per Protocol Population:  
 
The per protocol analysis population is defined as all subjects included in the ITT analysis 
who met all entry criteria, completed the Week 12 visit, and had no major protocol 
viola
tions. All efficacy analyses will be rep eated in the per-protocol population . These 
analyses will be supportive of the ITT analysis. Subjects will be analyzed as treated. 
 
1
0.3.4 Hypotheses Tested  
 
For the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients who are responders according to the 
OMERACT-OARSI criteria, the following hypothesis will be tested. 
Ampion™  Version 1. 3 09 November  2017  
Clinical Study Protocol: AP -003-C Confidential    
45 
  
H0:π ≤ π 0 versus H A:π > π 0      
 
Where π 0 is the hypothesized value for the proportion of responders.  The value will be 30% 
in this study.  This test will be tested using an exact binomial test.  That is, given the sample 
siz
e of n, the number of responders X, and the value of π 0 =0.30, then probability that X or 
more
 events would be observed will be calculated as the p-value.  Since this is a one sided 
test, the alpha level will be 0.025. 
 
The primary hypothesis and these secondary hypotheses will be tested in a hierarchical 
manner with the primary first and the secondary hypotheses in the order listed.  Using this 
approach, there is no adjustment necessary in the overall significance level.  All testing will 
be
 conducted using an overall significance level of 5%.  If the tests are one sided, the 
significance level will be 2.5%. 
 
The secondary endpoints are represented by the proportion of patients who are responders as 
identifie
d by the following response criteria: 
 
- Improvement in pain and function (WOMAC A and WOMAC C) over baseline of 
≥20% and a 0.5 point absolute change 
 
- Improvement in patient global assessment (PGA) over baseline of ≥20% and a 0.5 point 
absolute change in PGA 
 
- Improvement in pain and function (WOMAC A and WOMAC C) over baseline of 
≥20% and a 0.5 point absolute change compared to saline  
The hypotheses for the first two secondary endpoints are identical and are: 
 
H0:π
 ≤ 30%  versus H A:π  > 30%      
 
These will be tested using the exact binomial test. 
 
The hypothesis for the third secondary endpoint will be tested as: 
 
H0:πA ≤ π HS versus H A: πA > π HS 
 
W
here π A is the response rate from Ampion in this study and π HS is the response rate of the 
sa
line control from previous single-injection Ampion studies.  This will be tested using 
Fisher’s exact test. 
 
10.3.5 Exploratory Endpoints  
 
None 
 
10.3.6 Definition of Study Visits  
 
This clinical trial has a total of  7 study visits, including telephone contacts, during the 12-
we
ek study (see Table 6.2).  The time on study for each subject observation will be defined 
relative to Day 0/Baseline, the day of the initial dose. For  analysis, the  Baseline measure is 
the la
test measure prior to initiation of treatment.

46 
 10.3.7 Number of subjects to receive study drug 
 
A total of approximately 171 subjects (146 Ampion; 25 Saline) will be enrolled in the study 
to a sing
le (1) intra-articular injection of 4 mL Ampion or 4 mL saline (6:1). 
 
Since the sample size for adequate power of th e  primary and second secondary hypotheses 
is a
lmost identical given the anticipated results of previous studies, the sample size for this 
study is based on the following hypothesis.  
 
H0:π
 ≤ 30%  versus H A:π > 30%     
 
A sample size of 146 patients yields a greater than 90% power of rejecting the null 
hypothesis when the anticipated proportion under the alternative hypothesis is 45%.

0.3.8 Disposition of subjec ts 
 
Disposition of subjects, including study completion status and response to therapy as 
m
easured by WOMAC A, WOMAC C and PGA subscores, will be summarized by age 
group, race, an d  gender fo r each of th e  analysis populations. 
 
10.3.9 Interim analys is 
 
There will be no interim analysis. 
 
1
0.3.10 Blinding and randomization  
 
All subjects will be randomized 6:1 to receive Ampion 4 mL or saline 4 mL as an intra-
a
rticular injection in the study knee. 
 
A comprehensive presentation of the data management and statistical analysis plan will be 
approved by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. prior to final analysis to adjust for any changes to 
the protocol or unexpected issues in the  study conduct an d data that affect the planned 
a
nalysis. 
 
10.3.11 Data presentation  
 
10.3.11.1 Demograp hic and Baselin e Char acteristics:  
 
Demographic (e.g., age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and Baseline characteristics (e.g., weight, 
height, prior injection of another intra-arterial therapeutic for OA of the knee) summarized 
using
 descriptive statistics, overall and by treatment group fo r the ITT analysis population. 
 
10.3.11.2 Medical His tory and Physical Examination:  
 
The number and percent of subjects with past and current medica l disorders at the t ime of 
ra
ndomization will be presented overall for the ITT analysis populati on. Results of any 
abnormalities documented from the abbreviated physical examination at Baseline and Week 
12, will
 be summarized overall for the safety and ITT analys is populations. 
 
10.3.11.3 Concomitant Medicati ons or Treatments:  
 
The number and percent of subjects receiving conco mitant medications or treatments prior to 
a
nd during the study and at the final visit will be tabulated an d  presented overall for  the ITT

 analysis population.  Concomitant medications/treatments will be summarized using 
de
scriptive statistics an d will be presented by type of drug (WHO DRUG classification) 
ove
rall for the safety and ITT analysis populations. 
 
1
0.3.11.4 Safety data:  
 
Safety data will be evaluated by changes in vital sign measurements, physical exam, 
labor
atory analysis, and the frequency and severity of AEs. Concomitant m edication will 
be recorded for safety. 
 
Adverse events: 
 
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have enrolled in the 
stud
y. All AEs considered related, or possibly related to Ampion™, will be followed until 
the e
vent resolves or s tabilized without further change. Subjects will b e followed for the 
occurrence of AEs until 12 weeks after the first dose of study medication. 
 
Investigators are required to document all AEs occurring during the clinical trial, 
c
ommencing with the first day of treatment through th e  en d  of study. AEs should be 
properly documented on the appropriate CRF pages. 
 
The severity of AEs (mild, moderate, severe), relatedness (related, possibly related, 
unre
lated) along with the duration, action taken, and outcom e (e.g., study withdrawal) will 
a
lso be recorded.  In addition, event s meeting the criteria of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
must
 be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours on the SAE reporting form s. 
 
10.4 MISSING DATA 
 
All data collected under this study protocol will be included in the assessment of subject 
safety.  Missing or incomplete AE data will assume greatest relationship to study drug and/or 
severity. 
 
For the primary effectiveness endpoint (WOMAC A, WOMAC C, and PGA), missing Week 
12 values will be imputed when the ITT analysis population is used. Worst Observation 
C
arried Forward (WOCF) will be selected as the primary method of imputing missing 12 
Week data. Alternate imputation methods employed will include multiple imputations ( SAS 
PROC MI an d SAS PROC MIANALYZE) an d Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). 
These sens itivity analyses will be conducted for the primary effectiveness endpoint, to ensure 
that the primary method of imputation chosen is robust with respect to imputation method 
u
sed.

11.7 COLLECTION, MONITORI NG AN D AUDITING STUDY 
DOCUMENTATION, AND DATA STORAGE  
 
11.7.1 Collection of Dat a and Monitoring Procedures  
 
This study will use a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant electronic data capture system (eDC). An 
elec
tronic case report form (eCRF) is used for data recording. All data requested on the 
e
CRF must be entered and all missing data must be accounted for. 
 
The data will be checked for completeness and correctness as i t i s entered by th e  real- time 
onl
ine checks applied by the eDC system. Off-line checks will also be run to perform any 
additional data review required.  Discrepancy reports will be generated accordingly and 
tra
nsferred to the study center for resolution by the investigator or his/her designee. 
 
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross–check of the 
e
CRF against the investigator’s records by the study monitor (source document verification), 
and the maintenance of a study drug–dispensing log by the inves tig ator. 
 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Sponsor 
re
presentative will review the protocol and case report form s with the investigators and their 
staff.  During the study a monito r will visit the site regularl y to check the completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries on the  case report form s, the a dherence to the 
protocol and to Good Clinical Pract ice and the  progress of enro llm ent. The monitor will 
e
nsure during on-site visits that study medication is being stored, dispensed and accounted 
for according to specifications. Key trial personnel must be available to assist the monitors 
dur
ing these visits. 
 
The
 investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospital or clinical records, to 
confirm their consistency with the case report form entries.  No information in these records 
about the identity of the subjects will leave the study center. Monitoring standards require 
full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion

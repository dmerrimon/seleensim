study conduct and oversight may require 
implementation of temporary or alternative 
mechanisms eg, phone contact, virtual visits, 
online meetings, use of local clinic or 
laboratory locations, and home visits by skill ed 
staff. Implementation of such mechanisms 
may differ country by country, depending on 
country regulations and local business 
continuity plans. Additionally, no waivers to 
deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to 
COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) w ill be

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Protocol title:  A randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled, mult i-center, parallel 
group study  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with 
prurigo nodularis who are inadequately controlled on topical prescription 
therapies or when those therapies are not advisable   
Short title:  Study  of dupilumab for the treatment of patients with prurigo 
nodularis, inadequately controlled on topical prescription therapies or when those 
therapies are not advisable  
LIBERTY -PN PRIME 2 (PRurigo Nodularis Itch Minimization Evaluation  2) 
Rationale:  
Prurigo nodularis  (PN) is a skin disease characterized by multiple, intensely itchy skin eruptions 
in symmetrically distributed areas of the extremities ( 1). The main symptom is prolonged, 
repetitive and uncontrollable rubbing, scratching and uncontrollable itching which leads to 
hyperkeratotic eroding papules and nodules on the skin.  It is difficult to treat and entai ls a high 
disease burden . Approximately 50% of patients have either past or current history of  atopic 
dermatitis  (AD) or other atopic disorders  (2). While case reports  suggest that dupilumab may 
successfully treat patients with PN regardless of a preexisting atopic background  (3, 4, 5, 6, 7), it 
remains unclear to wh at extent Type  2 cytokines play a role in the pathogenesis in those PN 
lesions not associated with atopy  (8). 
There are no United States (US ) Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) or Europea n Medicines 
Agency (EMA ) approved targeted therapies indicated for the treatment of PN , whether atopic or 
non-atopic forms . Topical corticosteroids  (TCS ) and topical  calcineurin inhibitors  (TCI ) are often 
used initially.  While there is a mechanistic rationale for their use, no rigorous clinical studies 
confirming their efficacy  were identified .  
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal IgG4 ant ibody that inhibits interleukin ( IL)-4 and IL -13 
signaling by specifically binding to the IL -4Rα subunit shared by the IL -4 and IL -13 receptor 
complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL -4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL -4 and IL -13 
signaling through the Type II receptor.  
Dupilumab has shown clini cal efficacy in multiple diseases with underlying Type 2 inflammation 
such as AD, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  (CRSwNP ), and eosinophilic 
esophagitis  (EoE).  
Recently, case series were published that suggest dupilumab may also be effective in the 
treatment of PN (3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 12 Type  2 cytokine involvement is implicated  to some extent  in all forms of PN. It is postulated that 
dupilumab may pl ay a fundamental role in pruritu s based upon its ability to block IL4R activity at 
the level of the sensory dorsal root ganglion  (9). The present  protocol  will evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of dupilumab in PN .

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 14 Dupilumab  
• Formulation:  dupilumab 300  mg: a 150  mg/mL dupilumab solution in a pre-filled syringe 
to deliver 300  mg in a 2 mL injection . 
• Route of administration:  subcutaneous (SC)  injection . 
• Dose regimen : 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W ) after an initial loading dose of 600  mg 
(2 injections of  300 mg) on Day 1 . 
Placebo  
• Formulation: identical formulation to the active 300  mg formulation without dupilumab, in 
a pre -filled syringe to deliver placebo in a 2 mL injection . 
• Route of administration: SC  injection . 
• Dose regimen: 1 injection Q2W after an initial loading dose (2 injections) on Day 1 . 
Noninvestigational medicinal products  
Participants will be required to apply moisturizers (emollients) once or  twice daily for at least 
5 out of the 7 consecutive days immediately before Day 1 and continue until Week  36. 
If participants are on a stable regimen of low to medium  potency TCS or TCI at  the screening  
visit, they can continue their topical steroid application once daily without tapering fro m 
Screening to Week  24. If specific lesions resolve, the participant can stop applying steroids to 
those sites but are permitted to continue applying to persistent lesions. If participants are on stable 
regimens of high potency or superpotent steroids , participants should decrease potency to medium  
potency TCS and continue to apply daily from screening to Week  24. Occlusion is not al lowed 
from Screening to Week  24. 
Participant s can be rescued with high potency  or superpotent  TCS/TCI as needed throughout the  
study.  
Post-trial access to study medication  
The sponsor does not plan to provide post-trial access to the study medication.  
Statistical considerations:  
• Randomization  
- The participant s will b e randomized to d upilumab or placebo  in 1:1 ratio with 
stratification factors of documented history of atopy (atopic or non -atopic),  stable use 
of TCS/TCI (yes or no),  and country /territory code . Number of participants with active 
mild AD upon study entry  will represent up  to 10% of the atopic participant s. Both t he 
atopic and the non-atopic PN population  will be capped  at 60% of the total enrolled 
population .

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 15 • Sample size calculation  
- The primary endpoint is  the proportion of participant s with a WI-NRS  reduction  of 
≥4 from baseline to  Week  12. Assuming a response rate of  in placebo 
and d upilumab respectively, 56 participant s/arm will provide 90%  power to detect the 
difference of  between dupilumab and placebo  with Fisher exact test at 2 -sided 
level of 0.05. Assuming 15% drop out during the 12 weeks of treatment, the target is  to 
randomize 75 participant s/arm to allow for up to 10% of atopic  patients having active 
mild AD upon study entry . 
• Primary analysis  
- The analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the intent -to-treat (ITT ) 
population defi ned as all randomized participant s analyzed according to the treatment 
group allocated by randomization regardless if treatment kit is used or not.  
- The primary analysis o n WI -NRS  reduction ≥4 at Week  12 will be conducted by using 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH ) test stratifying by stratification factor s (documented 
history of atopy [atopic or non -atopic ], stable use of  TCS/TCI [yes or no ], and region 
[countries combined ]) and covariate of baseline anti -depressant use (yes or no) . For 
participants discontinuing the study treatment before Week  12, their off -study 
treatment values measured up to Week  12 will be included in the analysis. Participants 
taking selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications (details of selection 
will be specified in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]) prior to Week  12 or have 
missing data at Week  12 will be cons idered non -responders.  
- Sensitivity analyses using alternative methods will be performed to handle missing 
data and/or data collected after participant s taking selected prohibited medications 
and/or rescue medications. A subgroup  analysis will be performed  excluding 
participants with a current diagnosis of AD. More details of the sensitivity  and 
subgroup  analyses will be specified in the SAP . 
• Analysis of secondary endpoints  
- Secondary efficacy endpoints that measure binary responses will be analyzed in the 
same fashion as the primary endpoint.  
- Time -to-event secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the Cox 
proportional hazards model, including treatment, stratification factors (countrie s 
combined to region ), and covariate of baseline anti -depressant use (yes or no ). The 
hazards ratio, its 95% confidence interval and p -value will be reported. Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be also provided . 
- Continuous secondary efficacy e ndpoints will be analyz ed using a hybrid method of 
the worst observation carried forward (WOCF ) and multiple imputations. Data of  
participants  taking s elected prohibited medications  and/or  rescue medications will be 
set to missing  after the medication usage, and the worst postbaseline value on or before 
the time of the medication usage will be used to impute missing endpoint value (for 
participants  whose postbaseline values are all missing, the baseline will b e used to 
impute). Participants  who discontinue the treatment prematurely are encouraged to 
follow the planned clinical visits and in th ose participant s who did not take the selected  
prohibited medications  and/or rescue medications , all data collected afte r treatment

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 16 discontinuation will be used in the analysis. For these participants , missing data may 
still happen despite all efforts have been tried to collect the data after treatment 
discontinuation . For participants  who discontinue due to lack of efficac y, all data 
collected after discontinuation will be used in the analysis, and  a WOCF approach will 
be used to impute missing data if needed. For participants  who discontinued not due to 
lack of efficacy , a multiple imputation approach will be used to imput e missing 
endpoint value , and this multiple imputation will use all participants  excluding 
participants  who have taken the selected prohibited medications and/or rescue 
medications prior to timepoint of endpoint of interest  and excluding patients who 
disco ntinue due to lack of efficacy . Each of the imputed complete data will be 
analyzed by fitting an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model with treatment group, 
stratification factors (countries combin ed into region) , baseline anti -depressant use 
(yes or no),   and relevant baseline measurement as covariates in the model. Statistical 
inference obtained from all imputed data will be combined using Rubin’s rule . 
- The safety variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
- Antidrug antibodies  variables including treatment -emergent ADA will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by treatment group.  
• Multiplicity considerations  
- The multiplicity procedure is proposed to control the overall Type -I error rate for 
testing  the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints. Detailed hierarchical 
testing procedure will be defined in the study SAP. The study is considered positive 
when the primary endpoint achieves statistical significance.  
• Planned d atabase lock date  
- A primary database lock will be performed when all randomized participant s have 
completed their 24-week  treatment phase.  
- The database will be updated at the end of the study for all participant s to include the 
post-treatment follow -up inf ormation and updates for the events previously ongoing at 
the time of the primary lock.  
• Unblinding plan  
- The unblinding plan will be detailed in  the SAP or in a separate unblinding plan .

Dupilumab is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL -13 signaling by 
specifically binding to the IL -4Rα subunit shared by the IL -4 and IL -13 receptor complexes. 
Dupilumab inhibits IL -4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL -4 and IL -13 signaling 
through the Type II receptor. Blocking IL -4Rα with  dupilumab inhibits IL -4 and IL -13, key 
cytokines that drive Type  2 inflammatory responses, including the release of proinflammatory 
cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE.   
Dupilumab is approved by major regulatory agencies for use in AD and in asth ma in adults and 
adolescents, and in the US  for CRSwNP  in adults.  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Prurigo nodularis  is a skin disease characterized by multiple, intensely itchy skin eruptions in 
symmetrically distributed areas of the extremities ( 1). It is difficult to treat and entai ls a high 
disease burden . 
Dupilumab has  shown efficacy in multiple diseases with underlying Type 2 inflammation such as 
AD, asthma, CRSwNP  and EoE. In light of the published research suggesting a principal role for 
Type 2 cytokines in the pathogenesis of PN  (see Section  2.2), the Sponsor proposes that selective 
and simultaneous inhibition of IL -4 and IL -13 signaling such as that achieved with dupilumab 
treatment may provide clinical benefit in relieving the signs and symptoms of PN, especially in 
the high unmet need population of patients inadequately treated with, or ineligible for, TCS.  
Recently, case series were published that suggest that dupilumab may a lso be effective in the 
treatment of PN (3, 4, 5, 6). Type  2 cytokine involvement is implicated in all forms of PN.  This is 
consistent with a recent case series of nine patients without an atopic history who benefitted  from 
dupilumab treat ment  (7).   
The primary hypothesis  of the  study is that dupilumab will be effective in reducing itch and the 
secondary hypothesis is that it will reduce and  promot e the healing of lesions of PN, in patients 
who are inadequate responders to topical prescription therapies or when tho se therapies are not 
advisable . 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Prurigo nodularis  is a skin disease characterized by multiple, intensely itchy skin eruptions in 
symmetrically distributed areas of the extremities ( 1). The main symptom is prolonged, repetitive 
and uncontrollable rubbing, scratching and uncontrollable itching which leads to hyperkeratotic 
eroding papules and nodules on the skin.  A broadly accepted definition  for chronic prurigo  has 
been published by the  European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV ) (10). The 
convened experts agreed  that chronic prurigo should be used as an umbrella term for the range of 
clinical manifestations (eg , papular, nodular, plaque or umbilicated types). Prurigo  nodularis  is

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 24 considered a distinct disease defined by the presence of chronic pruritus for ≥6 weeks, history 
and/or signs of repeated scratching and multiple localized/generalized pruriginous skin lesions 
(whitish , hyperpigmented,  or pink papules, nodules  and/or plaques).  
Pathophysiological studies in PN patients reveal increased dermal nerve fiber density and changes 
in many types of skin cells. These skin cells cause inflammation and pruritus (severe, constant 
itching) through the release of cytokine IL -31, tryptase, prostaglandins, eosinophil cationic 
protein, histamine, and neuropeptides, such as substance P, calcitonin gene -related peptide and 
nerve growth factor  (11). The itch caused by primary dermatoses or systemic disorders is 
postulated to cause an itch scratch cycle which leads to neuronal hypersensitization. This neuronal 
hypersensitization is the final common pathway which drives th e symptomatol ogy of PN ( 1). 
Fukushi et al. studied 22 PN skin biopsies and found that 86% of them showed activation of 
STAT6, a marker for Type 2 inflammatory pathway activ ation downstream of the Type  2 
cytokin es IL-4 and IL -13 (12). Consistent with this, IL -4 and IL -5 messenger RNA  expression is 
upregulated in the skin of PN patients ( 13). Importantly, these two studies did not mention  
whether these skin biopsy specimens came from patients with or without atopy. The etiology of 
the profound pruritus in this disease is thought to be driven by high Type  2 inflammat ion driving 
activity at the level of the sensory neuron. Human sensory neurons in skin that transmit the 
sensation of itch are known to express IL - 4Rα, IL-13Ra1, and IL -31RA  (14). On testing for 
functional stimulation, IL -4 was shown to enhance responsiveness to ot her pruritogens like 
histamine ( 14). These findings support that Type  2 cytokines may play a principal role in the 
pathogenesis of PN.  
Due to  the central manifestation of itch, PN carries a  significant burden of disease ( 10, 15). The 
effect on quali ty of life due to PN has been reported to be higher than other common skin 
disorders like AD and psoriasis (16). Patients report chronic sleep loss due to constant itching; 
constant burning, stinging, and pain at affected area; and chronic depression, anxiety, anger, 
disgust, and shame; and hence overall experience a great impact on their quality of life. According 
to a 5 year cross -sectional study on 909 adult PN patients in the John Hopkins hospital system 
(15), PN is a key contributing factor to mood d isorders such as anxiety and depression. Of all 
patients with chronic pruritus, 70% have some type of psychiatric comorbidity, and the severity of 
depression in patients with chronic pruritus correlates with intensity of itch. The concomitant 
psychologic c omponent of PN likely contributes to the challenging nature of treating this disease.  
Data on the epidemiology of PN are limited. Most studies show a predominance of older patients 
with a median age of more than 50 years ( 2, 10, 15). Prurigo nodularis is only occasionally 
observed in younger patients, in whom it is often associated with atopic conditions (17). 
There are no FDA or EMA approved targeted therapies indicated for the treatment of PN , whether 
atopic or non -atopic forms; the lesions of atopic and non -atopic PN are clinically 
indistinguishable and treatment options remain the same. Topical corticosteroids and TCI are 
often used initially.  While there is a mechanistic rationale for their use, no rigorous clinical 
studies confirming their efficacy  were identified . Anecdotal feedback obtained from 
derm atological experts indicate variable, modest efficacy. For thicker lesions, TCS is also 
administered intralesionally. Lesional cryotherapy is another available topical treatment; case 
reports indicate temporary relief. Antihistamines and antileukotrienes a re occasionally used; their 
efficacy, however, is not supported by well conducted, randomized clinical trials and is rated low

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 25 by patients ( 18). Phototherapy, in particular narrowband  ultraviolet B ( UVB ), is occasionally 
added in patients not responding to topical pharmacotherapy. While some improvements with 
phototherapy have been reported, they re main usually partial and complete remissions are 
uncommon.  
Oral immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and cyclosporine have been used off -label with 
some success as reported based on case reports and retrospective ( 18). Use of cyclosporine in 
PN is limited by commonly recognized toxicities including hypertension, impaired renal and 
hepatic function, and potential for increased susceptibility to infections and cancer, particularly 
skin cancer, due to decreased cancer immunosurveillance  (19). Methotrexate has well established 
toxicities, in particular, myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. In addition, the broad 
immunosuppression caused by all these drugs carries an increased risk of developing serious 
bacterial, fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections.  
Neuromodulatory agent s such as gabapentin and anti -inflammatory agents such as thalidomide 
have been used in PN with varying degrees of success ( 18), but have also  considerable adverse 
effects. Adverse effects of thalidomide include peripheral neuropathies, sedation, dizziness and 
teratogenicity, while adverse effects of gabapentin include headache, sedation and dizziness.  
Overall, despite the use of multiple treatm ents, many patients with PN remain uncontrolled, and 
some of the available therapies are associated with serious potential adverse reactions. Given the 
lack of targeted treatments and the suboptimal efficacy associated with currently available 
therapies, t here remains a significant unmet need in patients with PN.   
Dupilumab has shown efficacy in multiple diseases with underlying Type  2 inflammation such as 
AD, asthma, CRSwNP,  and EoE. The most compelling data suggesting that PN is driven by 
Type  2 inflammat ion are the many case series of PN patients successfully treated with dupilumab. 
Recently, five case series were published that suggest that dupilumab may also be effective in the 
treatment of PN: Mollanazar et al. (4 patients, 3 of those without history o f AD) (3), Beck et al. 
(3 patients) ( 4), Rambhia et al. (2  patients) ( 5), Calugareanu et al. (one patient) ( 6), and Zhai et al. 
(9 patients, all without history of AD) ( 7). These case series reported major improvements in 
treatment -refractory cases of PN after treatment with dupilumab 300  mg Q2W (after an i nitial 
loading dose of 600  mg). These published ca se reports show rapid and substantial effects of 
dupilumab on itch, and somewhat less well documented effects also on lesions in patients with PN 
refractory to standard treatment . 
2.3 BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSM ENT  
Dupilumab solution for injection is currently authorized : 
• In over 40 countries worldwide including the US, European Union (EU ) (Centralised 
Procedure), and Japan for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled 
moder ate-to-severe AD. In the US and EU , it ha s also been authorized for use in 
adolescent patients (≥12 years) with inadequately controlled moderate -to-severe AD.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 26 • In the US for use in moderate -to-severe  eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma , in 
the EU for severe Type  2 asthma in adults and adolescents, and in Japan for use in adults 
and adolescents (≥12 years) with sever e or refractory bronchial asthma,  
• In the US  for use in adults with inadequate ly controlled CRSwNP.  
Dupilumab has shown clinically relevant benefit in several Type  2 driven immunological 
disorders such as AD, bronchial asthma, CRSwNP, and EoE. In asthma and AD indications, 
studies were also conducted in adolescents and similar benef it to adults was observed.  
While the mechanism of PN is not well -known, there is some evidence of a Type  2 immunologic 
signature in prurigo nodule skin biopsy specimens and activation of Type  2 transcription factors 
STAT3 and STAT6 in the epidermis ( 12, 13). Therefore, it is hypothes ized that dupilumab may 
show significant clinical benefit in the treatment of PN. This hypothesis is supported by a series of 
case reports that show dupilumab treatment resulting in a significant reduction in pruritus in 
19 PN patients  (3, 4, 5, 6, 7). 
No tissue targets or specific hazards to humans were identified in nonclinical general and 
reproductive toxicology studies.  
Dupilumab has an extensive safety database. As of the 28 March 2019 ( data lock point ), 
8798  subjects were enrolled into the development program for dupilumab and are included in the 
safety population treated: 242 as healthy volunteers, 4227 from AD studies, 3377 from asthma 
studies, 782 from CRSwNP studie s, 53 from EoE studies, 117 from grass allergy and peanut 
allergy studies. The number of subjects exposed to dupilumab in clinical studies was 7781 (218 in 
healthy volunteer studies, 3931 in AD studies, 3073 in asthma studies, 470 in CRSwNP studies, 
26 in EoE studies, and 63 in grass allergy and peanut allergy studies).  Based on the sales figure 
retrieved from Intercontinental Marketing Services Health and using the World Health 
Organization’s defined average daily dose for dupilumab of 21.4  mg, the cumulat ive post 
marketing exposure to dupilumab is estimated to be 38 816 patient years (01 January 2017 
through 31 December 2018).  
Dupilumab was generally well tolerated in all populations tested in clinical development 
programs. The adverse drug reactions ( ADR s) identified to date for dupilumab include injection 
site reactions, conjunctivitis, oral herpes, conjunctivitis allergic, conjunctivitis bacterial, herpes 
simplex, blepharitis, dry eye, eye pruritus,  and eosinophilia.  These ADRs occur with relatively 
low frequency with dupilumab treatment, and were generally mild or moderate, transient, and 
manageable. More significant serious allergic reactions were very rare. Importantly, no increased 
overall infect ion risk was observed in patients treated with dupilumab.  
Systemic hypersensitivity has been established as an important identified risk with dupilumab.  
As protein therapeutics, all monoclonal antibodies are potentially immunogenic. Rare serious and 
syste mic hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the dupilumab program including 
serum sickness/serum sickness -like reaction in the adult AD program and anaphylaxis related to 
dupilumab in th e adult asthma clinical trials.   
It is hypothesized that dupi lumab in patients with PN will have a favorable safety profile as 
observed across other Type  2-driven immunological disorders.

3.1 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS   
The st udy endpoints will include both  assessments of itch and assessments of the PN lesions. As 
discussed in Section  2.2, the severe itch observed in this disease, the fact that lesions are typically 
observed in areas that are within reach for scratching , and the importance of itch-scratch cycles in 
the pathophysiology of the disease support itch as a reasonable primary endpoint. This choice is in 
line with the study design  publicly available for other drug classes such as NK1 -antagonists (20). 
Amongst standard measurement instruments for evaluation of chronic pruritus, NRS  assessing 
worst itch in the past 24 hours features high reliability and concurrent validity and is a popular 
choice for all patients due to its simple format (21, 22, 23, 24). The proposed WI-NRS  is currently 
being u sed in Phase 3 trial assessing serlopitant efficacy in PN ( 20). A similar pruritus NRS 
(peak  pruritus) has been validated for AD. Additional validation work covering PN as additional 
indication will be conducted  in the context of the current study . The primary assessment will be a

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 30 responder analysis based on an at least 4 point s improvement of the WI-NRS at Week  12, similar 
to the assessment widely used in AD studies , and similar to the value proposed for assessment of 
clinical improvement in the WI -NRS as measures of response in the Phase 2 trial assessing 
serlopitant efficacy and safety in PN, and currently used in the Phase  3 trial ( 20). The itch 
response occurs typically faster than the lesion response but since improvement of both may occur 
prior to Week  12, responder analyses  assessments will be performed at earlier time points as well, 
starting at Week  2 for itch, and Week  4 for lesions. A key secondary endpoint will be the 
responder analyses of itch improvement of at least 4 points at Week  24. 
As another key secondary endpoint, PN lesions will be assessed by an IGA PN -Stage, which is a 
scale that measures the approximate nu mber of nodules. The estimated number of lesions 
correlates well with increasing DLQI scores (ie , worsened quality of life), and demonstrates very 
good inter -rater reliability and test -retest reliability ( 25). The IGA scale  is widely used in several 
dermatological indications (eg, as Physician Global Assessment [ PGA ] in psoriasis). A modified 
PAS will be used as an exploratory measure. Both instruments are PN -specific and have been 
developed by experts in the field. These are the only two disease -specific instruments currently 
available for the lesion assessment . The validation of both  instruments for use in PN will be 
conducted in the context of the Phase 3 trials .  
Secondary e ndpoints will also include  HRQoL  assessments using  the skin-disease specific DLQI 
in recognition of the significant impacts on quality of life experienced by patients with PN. Even 
though not validated in PN specifically, the DLQI is well established and widely used to assess 
HRQoL in patients with skin  conditions in clinical trials ( 26).

following IMP treatment groups:  
• Dupilumab 300  mg 
• Matched placebo  
Duration of study period (per participant)  
• Screeni ng period (2 -4 weeks)  
• Randomized IMP intervention  period (24 weeks)  
• Follow -up period (12 weeks ) 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  FOR STUDY DESIGN   
This study is a multi -center, 24 -week treatment , double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study 
to evaluate the use of dupilumab in patients with PN inadequately controlled on topical prescription 
therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Based on mechanistic data (see  Section  2), 
Type  2 inflammation may play a principal role in the path ogenesis of PN in all patients.  
The double -blind design  intends to mitigate potential bias and placebo control is necessary to 
assess the net effect of active dupilumab treatment.  
The patient population to be studied in this trial is intended to include patients with underlying 
systemic medical conditions know n to be associated with PN. Given that better control of severe 
manifestations of underlying systemic illnesses can confound the primary itch endpoint, we will 
enroll 40% to 60 % of non -atopic PN patients that have medically well -controlled systemic 
conditi ons. Since the literature suggests that approximately 20%-60% of PN patients have a 
history of atopy (defined as having a medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivits, 
asthma, or food allergy), our study design will require that the remaining PN patients have a 
history  or a current diagnosis  of atopy. Because active AD can confound the primary endpoint, we 
will exclude moderate -to-severe AD patients and will institute a cap of up to 10% of the atopic 
patient  subgroup having active mil d AD . It is the goal of this design to mirror the overall PN 
patient population consistent with real -world estimates of overall prevalence while trying to 
minimize potential confounders on the primary endpoint.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 32 The primary endpoint, WI -NRS, is a validated measurement of the highest PN burden, ie, extreme 
itching.  
Dupilumab treatment has shown clinical efficacy prior to Week  24 in all Phase 3 trials examined 
across all indications. In addition, available biomarker data of disease response, including TARC an d 
eotaxin -3, plateau after Week  16 but before Week  24 in prior AD trials, including the 52 -week  AD 
study (R668 -AD-1224; CHRONOS). The Sponsor considers that a 24 -week  treatment period is an 
appropriate duration to observe dupilumab’s effect in PN to ensure  an adequate evaluation of PN 
lesions as the effect on pruritus is expected to plateau by Week  12 similar to that observed in the 
atopic dermatitis studies. Weeks  12 to Week  24 will then allow for evaluation of the maintenance of 
effect on pruritus. The du ration of the 12 -week  follow -up period is based on the time expected for 
drug concentration to reach zero  (below the lower limit of quantification) in most patients after the last 
dose of dupilumab. This follow -up period will allow assessment of the need f or chronic treatment with 
dupilumab for this disease by an assessment of return of PN symptoms post -treatment . 
The study will not include adolescents because PN  is rare in adolescent patients . 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE  
The selected dosing regimen is dupilumab 300  mg Q2W  with a loading dose of 600  mg.  
This dose regimen is expected to achieve serum concentrations that saturate the target -mediated 
clearance pathway rapidly with the  loading dose and  maintain saturation thereafter . The PK  of 
dupilumab is  consistent across populations of patients with AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and EoE, as 
well as healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the sources of variability of dupilumab PK identified in 
each p opulation and the magnitude of the covariate effects indicate that body weight is the most 
influential factor, whereas other covariates identified as being statistically significant have no 
meaningful impact on dupilumab PK. The immunogenicity of dupilumab  is also comparable in 
these populations (see IB).  
Dosing regimens of 300  mg Q2W after a loading dose of 600  mg were used in the PN case 
studies, which resulted in marked improvement in itch within three months and subsequently 
a notable improvement of th e skin lesions  (see Section  2).  
The 300  mg Q2W  dose, with loading dose, is the approved dose for AD and  is an approve d dose  
for asthma in the US  and the EU . 
Therefore, based on the totality of the data, dupilumab 300  mg Q2W (with loading dose) regimen 
is adequate for patients with PN and a further dose ranging study is not necessary to select 
a Phase  3 dose regimen.

Not applicable.  
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES   
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention/entered in the stud y. A minimal set of 
screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants 
to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT ) publishing requirements and 
to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, 
screen failure reasons, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  
In the case of technical malfunction of equipment, the patient may  be rescreened. Patients who 
fail the exclusion criteria may be rescreened once during the open screening period of the study. 
Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant number versus the one received for the 
initial screening.  
There is no  requirement for a waiting period between the screen -failure date and the rescreening 
date. The interactive response technology (IRT ) report will flag rescreened patients. Patients that 
are rescreened must sign a new consent form and all Visit 1 procedures must be repeated.  
If certain dynamic laboratory tests do not meet the eligibility criteria at screening, these laboratory 
assessments may be repeated, at the discretion of the Investigator, if it is judged to be likely to 
return to acceptable range for study inclusion within the screening visit window prior to Day 1. 
There is no need to screen fail such participants if the test finally meets the eligibility criteria.

a Subcutaneous injection sites should alternate between the upper thighs, 4 quadrants of the abdomen or the upper arms, so that  the same 
site is not injected twice during consecutive administrations. Injection in the upper arms can only be done by a trained person (parent/legally 
authorized representative/caregiver trained by Investigator or Delegate) or health care professional but not the participant themselves.  
IMP: investigational medicinal product; NIMP : noninvestigational medicinal product . 
The Investigator or delegate will train the patient (or caregiver) how to prepare and inject IMP at 
Visit 2. He/she will inject the first of the two injections. The participant  (or caregiver) will  
perform the second injection under the supervision of the Investigator or delegate. Patient should 
also be trained  by the site staff  to recognize potential  signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity  
reaction  in order to self -monitor at home for at least 30 mi nutes (or longer per country specific or 
local site -specific requirements) following injection. In case of hypersensitivity symptoms the 
patient should contact healthcare provider/emergency. The training must be documented in the 
participant ’s study file.  
When the participant has a study visit, the IMP will be administered following clinical procedures 
and blood collection. Patients should be monitored for at least 30 minutes. The monitoring period 
may be extended as per country specific or local site -specific requirements.

Participants who prefer to have a healthcare professional administer the IMP may choose to have 
injections administered at home by a nurs e or at the study site . 
Between the protocol -scheduled on -site visits, interim visits may be required for IMP dispensing. 
As an alternative to these visits, dupilumab 300  mg or matching placebo may be supplied from the 
site to the participant via a Sponsor -approved courier company where allowed by local regulations 
and approved by the participant . 
6.1.1  Noninvestigational medicinal products   
Starting from the screening visit, participant s will be instructed to use their daily moisturizer, if it 
is not containing any compound with known anti -itch effect (such as menthol, polidocanol, 
pramoxine, lidocaine, prilocaine, capsaicin, naltrexone, N -palmitoylethanolamine, etc). It is not 
authorize d changing emollients or moisturizers or applying products for itching relief during the 
course of the study.  
Participants will be required to apply moisturizers (emollients) once or twice daily for at least 
5 out of the 7  consecutive days immediately befo re Day 1 and continue until Week  36. All types 
of moisturizers are permitted, but patients may not initiate new treatment with prescription 
moisturizers or over -the-counter moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or 
during the interve ntion period. Patients may continue using stable doses of such moisturizers if 
initiated before the screening visit.  
If participants are o n a stable regimen of low  to medium potency TCS or TCI at the screening 
visit, they can continue their topical steroid  application once daily without tapering from 
Screening to Week  24. If specific lesions resolve, the participant can stop applying steroids to 
those sites but are permitted to continue applying to persistent lesions. If participants are on stable 
regimens of high potency or superpotent steroids, participants should decrease potency to medium 
potency TCS and continue to apply daily from screening to Week  24. Stable regimen for TCS is 
maintaining the same medicine (low to medium potency TCS), and maintaining the same 
frequency of treatment (once or twice daily) used from 2  weeks prior to screening. Stable regimen 
for TCI is maintaining the same medicine of TCI and the treatment frequency (once or twice 
daily) used from 2  weeks prior to screening. If participan t’s prior regimen was applying once 
daily, the participant will maintain daily application during study and for participants who had 
twice daily prior to screening, participation will maintain twice daily regimen during study. 
Ifspecific lesions resolve, t he participant can stop applying steroids to those sites but are permitted 
to continue applying to persistent lesions.  Occlusion is not allowed from Screening to Week  24. 
It is recommended that patients use triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream or fluocinolon e 
acetonide 0.025% ointment for medium potency, and hydrocortisone 1% cream for low potency. 
If rescue with TCS is needed, it is recommended that patients use either betamethasone 
dipropionate 0.05% optimized ointment for high potency TCS or clobetasol pro pionate 
0.05%  cream for super high potency TCS. If patients have tolerance issues with any of these 
steroids or if they are not commercially available in some countries, they may substitute with 
products of the same potency from the list provided by the Sp onsor .

not applied (ie, do not use moisturizers and TCS on the same areas at the same time during the 
day).  For example, if TCS are applied in the evening, moisturizers will not be used in the evening 
on areas treated with TCS, but will be applied to those areas in the morning.  On areas not treated 
with TCS, moisturizers will be applied twice da ily - morning and evening.  
Rescue therapy is described in Section  6.5.1 . 
6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING /STORAGE/ACCOUNTABIL ITY  
6.2.1  Storage and handling   
1. The Investigator  or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention  received and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention . 
2. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention  and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention . All study intervention  must be 
stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area 
in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator  
and authorized site staff.  
3. The Investigator , institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention  accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
6.2.2  Responsibilities   
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of  an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc)  must be promptly noti fied to the Sponsor . 
Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure (see Section  8.3.6). 
A potenti al defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor . In this case, the Investigator  will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor , in order to recall the IMP  and eliminate potentia l hazards.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator  supply IMP  to a third party (except for  direct -to-
patient [DTP ] shipment, for which a courier company has been approved by the Sponsor ), allow 
the IM P to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP  in any 
other manner.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIM IZE BIAS: RANDOMIZAT ION AND BLI NDING   
All participants will be centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using an IRT. Before 
the study is initiated, the telephone number and call -in directions for the IVRS and/or the log in

a new ICF must be signed. In such case, a new patient  number will be assigned by IRT.  
Methods of assigning patients to treatment group  
The randomized intervention kit number list is generated centrally by Sanofi and IMPs are 
packaged in accordance with this list. The randomization and intervention allocatio n are 
performed centrally by an IRT. The IRT generates the participant randomization list and allocates 
the intervention number and the corresponding intervention kits to the participants according to it.

Randomization will be stratified by the following factors:  
• documented history of atopy ( atopic  or no n-atopic ) 
- Atopic: Patients with a physician -documented history of atopic comorbidities def ined 
as AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivits, asthma, or food allergy, or a current

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 44 Randomization code breaking during the study  
The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment 
assignment is warranted (eg, in case of available antidote). Participant safety must always be the 
first consideration in making such a de termination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding 
a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the 
participant.  If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified 
within 24  hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be 
recorded in the source documentation and case report form ( CRF ), as applicab le. 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE   
Investigator or his/her delegate must ensure that IMP will be administered to each participant 
according to the labeling instructions.  
IMP a ccountability:  
• Intervention units  are returned by the participant at each visit. In case of DTP process, the 
intervention units can be returned by the carrier (if defined in the contract) . 
• The Investigator counts the number of remaining kit/pre -filled syri nge, and fills in the IMP 
accountability and inventory forms . 
• The Investigator or his/her delegate records the dosing information on the appropriate 
page(s) of the eCRF . 
• The monitor in charge of the study then checks the eCRF data by comparing them with th e 
IMP which he/she has retrieved and source documents . 
Participant compliance with study intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be 
assessed by counting returned kit/pre -filled syringe . Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage 
regime n should be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY   
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded along with:  
• Reason for use.  
• Dates of administration including start and end dates.  
• Dosage information including dose and frequency.  
The concomitant use of non-sedating antihistamine administration is allowed during the study 
except for treatment of AD or PN, but dose change of non -sedating antihistamine is not allowed 
both from Week  11 to Week  12 and from Week  23 to Week  24.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION /WITHDRAWAL     
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION    
7.1.1  Definitive discontinuation   
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant  to permanently discontinue study 
intervention. If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will remain in the 
study to be evaluated for  safety . See the So A (Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of 
discontinuation of study intervention.  
The participants may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if he or she decides to do so, at any  
time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the investigator’s decision. All efforts should 
be made to document the reason(s) for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented 
in the eCRF.  
Participants must be permanently withdrawn from the study treatment for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on  behalf of a prospective participant to the patient’s 
participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research).  
• If, in the investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
participant’s well -being.  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor.  
• If they are treated with the specific prohibited medications mentioned in Section  6.5. 
• If they miss more than 2 consecutive IMP doses . 
• In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the investigator or the Sponsor.  
• Any code broken at the requested of the investigat or.  
• Pregnancy . 
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (see Section  10.8).  
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.  
• Any opportunistic infection or other infections whose nature or course may suggest 
an immunocompromise d status (see Section  10.9).  
• Serum A LT >3 ULN and Total Bilirubin > 2 ULN (see  Section  10.6).  
• Serum ALT >5 ULN if baseline ALT ≤2 ULN or ALT >8 ULN if baseline ALT >2 ULN 
(see Section  10.6).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 48 If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline 
in QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula [QTcF ] after enrollment ), the Investigator  or 
qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in 
participant management is needed. This re view of the ECG printed at the time of collection must 
be documented. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE.  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation  within a reasonable timef rame as assessed by the Investigator  before making a 
decision of definitive discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned participant.  
Handling of participants after  definitive  intervention  discontinuation  
Participants will be followed -up according to the  study procedures specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed -up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last.  
Participants who discontinue the study intervention prematurely (prior to completing the 24 -week 
treatment period) will perform, as soon as possible, the early termination visit with all assessments 
normally planned for the EOT Visit (Visit 6), to assure a complete clinical assessment in close 
temporal proximity to the premature termination of study treatment is available.  
In addition, and to allow assessment of participant outcomes over the stipulated study period, 
patients will be asked and encouraged to complete all remaining study treatment visits, and 
participate in all assessments according to the visit schedule with a ±3 day window. Under 
exceptional circumstances when a participant cannot come to the site for a scheduled visit, 
a phone contact can be made. During the phone contact, at lea st information about AEs, 
concomitant medication and status of PN should be collected.  
All cases of definitive  intervention  discontinuation must be recorded by the Investigator  in the 
appropriate pages of the eCRF when considered as confirmed.  
7.1.2  Temporary di scontinuation   
Temporary intervention  discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator  because of 
suspected  AEs.   
In addition, the following conditions will be causes for tem porary discontinuation of study 
intervention:  
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment  
• Any laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment discontinuation criteria as per 
Section  10.6 
Temporary intervention  discontinuation decided by the Investigator  corresponds to more than 
1 dose not administered to the participant . Following a temporary interruption or missed dose, the 
treatment should be reinitiated at the next scheduled administration, maintaining the planned dose . 
If more than  2 consecutive IMP doses have been missed, the study treatment will be permanently  
disco ntinued (see Section  7.1.1 ).

Reinitiation of intervention  with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator  will have considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was 
unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to  Section  5). 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/ WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY   
• A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator  for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons.  This is expected to be uncommon . 
• At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit 
should be conducted, as shown in the SoA  (Section  1.3). See SoA for data to be collected 
at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that 
need to be completed.  
• The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and 
from the study at that time.  
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor  may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
• If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the Investigator  must document this in the site study records.  
If participants no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain  in the study.  
The Investigator s should discuss with them key visits to attend. The value of all their study data 
collected during their continued involvement will be emphasized as important to the public health 
value of the study.  
Participants who withdra w from the study intervention  should be explicitly asked about the 
contribution of possible AEs to their decision, and any AE information elicited must be 
documented.  
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator  in the appropriate screens o f the 
eCRF  and in the participant ’s medical records. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented.  
In addition, a participant  may withdraw his/her consent to stop participating in the study. 
Withdrawal of c onsent for intervention  should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for 
follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non -participant  contact follow -up, 
eg, medical record checks. The site should document any case of withdrawal of consent.  
Participants who have withdrawn from the study cannot be  rerandomized  (treated) in the study. 
Their inclusion and intervention  numbers must not be reused.

A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required  study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator  or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to  the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s 
medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from  the study.  
• Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole a re handled as part of 
Section  10.1.

waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  
(see Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed t o confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator  will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures  conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count)  and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA  (see Section  1.3). 
• Patient -Reported Outcome questionnaires including NRS should be completed by the 
participant s before the consultation and/or clinical tests, in a quiet place. The 
questionnaires should be completed by the participant s themselves, independently from 
their p hysician, the  study nurse or any other medical personnel and without any help from 
friends or relatives . 
• In light of the public health emergency related to Coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID -19) 
(or in case of any other pandemic requiring public health emergency), the continuity of 
clinical study conduct and oversight may require implementation of temporary or 
alternative mechanisms eg, phone contact, virtual visits, online meetings, use of local 
clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled staff. Implementation of such 
mechanisms may differ country by country, depending on country regulations and local 
business continuity plans. Additionally, no waivers to deviate from protocol enrol lment 
criteria due to COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) will be granted. All temporary 
mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures are to be documented 
as being related to COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) and will remain in effect only  for 
the duration of the public health emergency .

kept at the site during the study.  
8.1.1  Worst -itch numeric rating scale   
Worst -itch numerical rating scale (WI -NRS) is a PRO  comprised of a single item rated on a scale 
from 0 (“No itch”) to 10 (“Worst imaginable itch”). Participant s are asked to rate the intensity of 
their worst pruritus  (itch) over the past 24 hours using this scale.   
Participant s will complete the WI -NRS daily according to the SoA  (see Section  1.3). The 
assessment tool is provided in  Section  10.7.1 . 
8.1.2  Investigator’s global assessment  for prurigo  nodularis   
Investigator’s global assessment for prurigo  nodularis  (IGA  PN) is a  clinician -reported outcome  
(ClinRO ) that allows clinicians to assess the activity of PN (IGA PN -A) using a 5 -point scale 
from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe); and the stage of the disease (IGA PN -S) using a 5 -point scale from 
0 (clear) to 4 (severe).  
Clinicians will complete the IGA  PN as described in the SoA  (see Section  1.3). The assessment 
tool is provided in Section  10.7.2 .  
8.1.3  Prurigo activity score   
The PAS is a ClinRO  measur ement. The original PAS questionnaire Version 0.9 consists of 
7 items, developed by expert clinicians in PN ( 25). The items of the PAS evalua te the pruriginous 
lesions in terms of:  
• Type (visible lesions: Item 1a; predominant lesions: Item 1b);  
• Estimated number (Item 2);  
• Distribution (Item 3, 4);  
• Size (biggest lesion: Item 6a; representative lesion: Item 6b).  
Other items evaluate the represent ative body area and exact number of lesions (Item 5), the 
activity in terms of percentage of pruriginous lesions with excoriations/crusts on top (reflecting 
active scratching; Item 7a) and the percentage of healed pruriginous lesions (reflecting healing of  
chronic prurigo ; Item 7b).  
A 5-item simplified version of the PAS will be used in the current study.  In particular, 
Item 3 (lesion distribution) and Item 6 (lesion monitoring) of the original PAS were removed, and 
the response options slightly modified and refined .

the previous week. The items cover symptoms, leisure activities, work/school or holiday ti me, 
personal relationships including intimate, the side effects of treatment, and emotional reactions to 
having a skin disease. It is a  validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials 
(26). Response sca le is a 4 -point L ikert scale  (0 = “not at all” and 3 = “very much”) for 
nine items. The remaining one item about work/studying asks whether work/study has been 
prevented and  then (if “No”) to what degree the skin condition has been a problem at work/study; 
the item is rated on a 3 -point L ikert scale ( “Not at all ” to “A lot ”). Overall scoring ranges from 
0 to 30, with a high score indicative  of a poor  HRQoL.  
Participant s will  complete t he questionnaire a t time points according to SoA  (see Section  1.3).

8.1.8  Euroqol 5 dimensions questionn aire  
The Euroqol -5 dimensions (EQ -5D) is a standardized PRO measure of health status developed by 
the EuroQOL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and 
economic appraisal  (30). The EQ -5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ v isual 
analog scale ( VAS ). The EQ -5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimens ion has 
5 levels of perceived problems: “no problem”, “slight problems”, “moderate problems ”, “severe 
problems ” and “inability to do the activity ”. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health 
state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of 
the 5  dimensions; this results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level for that dimension. The 
digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5 -digit number describing the respondent’s health 
state. The EQ  VAS recor ds the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS  where the 
endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health state (100)” and “worst imaginable health state (0)”. 
This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the 
individual respondents.  
Participant s will complete the questionnaire as described in the SoA  (see Section  1.3). The 
assessment tool is provided in Section  10.7.6 .

is not available.  
• Body weight (kg) will be measured at screening (Visit 1) , EOT, and EOS visits. Height 
will be measured at screening visit (Visit 1). Height and weight  should be measured with 
indoor clothing but without shoes.  
8.2.3  Electrocardiograms   
• Single  12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section  1.3) using an 
ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rat e and measures PR, QRS, QT, and 
QTcF intervals. Refer to Section  7 for QTcF withdrawal criteria and any additional QTcF 
readings that may be necessary.  The ECG should be re corded after 10 minutes  of rest in 
the supine position.  
8.2.4  Clinical safety laboratory assessments   
• See Appendix 2 ( Section  10.2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and 
to the So A (see Section  1.3) for the timing and frequency.  
• The Investigator  must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE sectio n of the CRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by the Investigator  to be more severe than expec ted for the 
participant's condition.  
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 12 weeks  after the last dose of study intervention

clinically significant by the Investigator  or medical monitor.  
- If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable 
by the Investigator , the etiology should be identified a nd the Sponsor  notified.  
- All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in  Appendix 2 ( Section  10.2), 
must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA  
(see Section  1.3). 
- If laboratory values fr om non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the Investigator  (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the result s must be recorded in the CRF.   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS  AND SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENTS   
Adverse event of special interest  
An AESI  is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor ’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
Investigator  to the Sponsor  is required. Such events may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added, modified or 
removed during a study by protocol amendment.  
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be inform ed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described in Section  10.3, even if not fulfilling a s eriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding pages in the CRF (to be sent) or screens in the eCRF.  If an SAE or any AESI of 
anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment, 
or severe injection site react ions lasting longer than 24 hours, occurs in a participant , blood 
samples should be collected for determination of functional dupilumab concentration, and ADA 
assessment at or near the onset and completion of the occurrence of the event, if possible.  
• Anaphylactic reactions  
• Systemic hypersensitivity reactions  
• Helminthic infections  
• Any severe  type of conjunctivitis or blepharitis  
• Keratitis  
• Clinically symptomatic eosinophilia (or eosinophilia associated with clinical symptoms)  
• Pregnancy of a female subj ect entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in 
a female partner of a male subject entered in a study with IMP/NIMP;  
- Pregnancy occurring in a female participant  entered in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male participant  entered in  the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE 
only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 57 - In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.  
- Follow -up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female partn er of a male 
participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined .  
- Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAE s. 
• Significant ALT elevation  
- ALT >5 x ULN in participants with baseline ALT ≤2 x ULN;  
OR 
- ALT >8 x ULN if baseline ALT >2 x ULN  
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP  
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the participant  and defined as at least 
twice  the intended dose during an interval of less than 11 days. The circumstances 
(ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and 
symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms.  
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with any NIMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the particip ant and defined as at least 
twice  the maximum prescribed daily dose , within the intended therapeutic interval. 
The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the 
overdose form.  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). 
Adverse events  will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a care giver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for fo llowing 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention  or study procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the  study intervention  (see Section  7). 
8.3.1  Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information   
All AEs, serious or non serious,  will be collected from the signing of the ICF  until the EOS visit  at 
the time points specified in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
All SAEs and AESI  will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). The 
Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24  hours of it being available.  
Investigators  are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study participa tion. 
However, if the Investigator  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has 
been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study 
intervention  or study participation, the Investigator  must promptly notify the Sponsor .

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 58 8.3.2  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs   
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports  are provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SA Es. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method t o inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/ AESI/ SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  At the pre -specified study end -date,  all SAEs  and 
nonserious AESI  (as defined in Section  8.3) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in  Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). 
8.3.4  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by the Investigator  to the Sponsor  of a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of 
a study intervention  under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agen cies about the safety of a study intervention  under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor  will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB )/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC ), and Investigator s. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected seriou s adverse 
reactions (SUSAR ) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor  policy and 
forwarded to Investigator s as necessary.  
• Adverse events that are considered expec ted will be specified in the reference safety 
information . 
• An Investigator  who receives an Investigator  safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor  will review 
and then file it along  with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.3.5  Pregnancy   
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants  and female partners of male participants  
will be collected after the start of study intervention  and until  the outcome has been 
determined.

learning of the pregnancy an d should follow the procedures outlined in  Appendix  4 
(Section  10.4). 
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneou s abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
8.3.6  Guidelines for reporting product complaints   
Any defect in the IMP/NIMP/device m ust be reported as soon as possible by the Investigator  to 
the monitoring team that will complete a product complaint form within required timelines.  
Appropriate information (eg, samples, labels or documents like pictures or photocopies) related to 
product  identification and to the potential deficiencies may need to be gathered. The Investigator  
will assess whether or not the quality issue has to be reported together with an AE or SAE.  
8.4 TREATMENT OF OVERDOS E  
Overdose is an AESI (defined in Section  8.3). No antidote is available for dupilumab. Sponsor 
does not reco mmend specific treatment  for an overdose . 
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator /treating physician should:  
1. Provide symptomatic care.  
2. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.  
3. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until 
dupilumab can no l onger be detected systemically . 
4. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis as soon as possible  if requested by the Medical 
Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis).  
5. Document appropriately  in the CRF.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by the Investigator  in consultation with  the 
Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.

Note: In the event of  any SAE , any AE of severe injection site reaction lasting longer than 
24 hours, or any AESI of  anaphylactic reaction  or systemic allergic reaction  that is related to IMP 
and require treatment, PK and ADA  samples will be collected at or near the onset of the event  for 
any additional analysis if required or for archival purposes.  The exact date and time of sample 
collection m ust be recorded and entered into the database by the central laboratory. An 
unscheduled systemic drug concentration page in the eCRF must be completed as well. If 
necessary for safety monitoring, additional PK and ADA samples may be collected after the EOS  
Visit until resolution of AE.  
Specifically for PK, any changes in the timing or addition of time points for any planned study 
assessments must be documented and approved by the relevant study team member and then 
archived in the Sponsor and site study fil es, but will not constitute a protocol amendment. The 
IRB/IEC will be informed of any safety issues that require alteration of the safety monitoring 
scheme or amendment of the ICF.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 62 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES  
The statistical hypotheses for comparing dupilumab to placebo on the primary endpoint of the 
proportion of participants with WI -NRS reduction  of ≥4 (minimally important difference) at 
Week 12 are as follows:  
• Null hypothesis H0: No treatment difference between dupilumab and placebo  
• Alternative hypothesis H1: There is a treatment difference between dupilumab and 
placebo  
The statistical hypotheses to be tested on secondary endpoints can be specified similarly to those 
on the primary endpoint.  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMIN ATION   
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participant s with WI-NRS reduction of ≥4 from 
baseline to  Week  12. By assuming the response rate is  in placebo and dupilumab 
respectively, 56 participant s/arm will provide 90% power to detect the difference of  between 
dupilumab and placebo with Fisher exact test at 2 -sided level of 0.05. Assuming 15% drop out 
during the 12 weeks of treatme nt, the target is to randomize 7 5 participant s/arm  with a cap of up 
to 10% of participants  in the atopic population having active mil d AD . 
Approximately 15 0 participant s will be randomized 1:1 . This corresponds to approximately 
75 participants that will be randomly assigned to each intervention arm. 
The sample size calculation was performed using SAS  9.4 power procedure.  The assumption s 
were based on the effect of d upilumab versus placebo in WI -NRS reduction ≥ 4 at Week  16 
observed  in patients with moderate to severe AD as seen in studies of R668 -AD-1334 (Solo1) and 
R668 -AD-1416  (Solo2).  
Participant s will b e randomized to d upilumab or placebo  in 1:1 ratio with stratification factors of 
documented history of atopy ( atopic  or no n-atopic, see definition in Section  6.3), stable use of 
TCS/TCI (yes or no), and country /territory code . Both th e atopic and the  non-atopic PN 
popul ation will be capped at 6 0% of the total enrolled population.

of the WOCF and multiple imputations.  
Data of  participants  taking s elected prohibited medications  and/or rescue 
medications will be set to missing  after the medication usage, and the worst 
postbaseline value on or before the time of the medication usage will be used to 
impute missing endpoint value (for participants  whose p ostbaseline values are all 
missing, the baseline will be used to impute).  
Participants  who discontinue the treatment prematurely are encouraged to follow 
the planned clinical visits and in th ose participant s who did not take the selected  
prohibited medica tions  and/or rescue medications , all data collected after 
treatment discontinuation will be used in the analysis. For these participants , 
missing data may still happen despite all efforts have been tried to collect the data 
after treatment discontinuation . For participants who discontinue due to lack of 
efficacy, all data collected after discontinuation will be used in the analysis, and a 
WOCF approach will be used to impute missing data if needed. For participants 
who discontinued not due to lack of effica cy, a multiple imputation approach will be 
used to impute missing endpoint value , and this multiple imputation will use all 
participants  excluding patients who have taken the selected prohibited 
medications and/or rescue medications prior to timepoint of e ndpoint of interest  
and excluding participants who discontinue due to lack of efficacy .  
Each of the imputed complete data will be analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model 
with treatment group, stratification factors (documented history of atopy [atopic  or 
non-atopic ], stable use of TCS/TCI [yes or no ], and  region [countries combined ]), 
baseline antidepressant use (yes or no) , and relevant baseline measurement as

from baseline through Week  24 Adverse event incidence tables will present by SOC (sorted by internationally agreed 
order), and PT sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and 
percentage (%) of participant s experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the sam e event 
in the same participant  will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment phase. 
The denominator for computation of percentages is the safety population within each 
treatment group.  
Proportion of participant s with at least one TEAE, treatm ent emergent SAE, TEAE leading 
to death, and TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation will be tabulated by 
treatment group. In addition TEAEs will be described according to maximum intensity and 
relation to the study intervention. Serious AEs an d AEs leading to study discontinuation  that 
occur outside the treatment -emergent period will be summarized separately.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 75 10.3 APPENDIX 3: ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFI NITIONS AND PROCEDUR ES FOR 
RECORDING, EVALUATIN G, FOLLOW -UP, AND RE PORTING   
DEFINITION OF AE  
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention , whether or n ot considered related 
to the study intervention . 
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention . 
Events meeting  the AE definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the me dical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigator  (ie, not related to progression of underlying 
disease) . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New cond itions detected or diagnosed after study intervention  administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequel ae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention  or a concomitant medication.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action ” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments . 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT meeting the AE definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findin gs or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
Investigator  to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol  01 
EFC16460  - dupilumab  20-May-2020  
Version number:  1 
 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 76 • Situations in which an un toward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen . 
DEFINITION OF SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical oc currence that, at any dose:  
a) Results in death  
b) Is life -threatening  
The term “ life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment  that would not have been appropriate in the physi cian’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or  was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment  of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
- The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
- This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accide ntal trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f) Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in decidi ng whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the participant or may require medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 77 - Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment  in 
an emergency room  or at home for allergic bronc hospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
RECORDING AND FOLLOW -UP OF AE AND/OR SAE  
AE and SAE r ecording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigat or to review all  
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator  will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor’s representative  in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor’s representative . In such case, care should be taken to ensure that the patient's 
identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the study are properly mentioned on any 
copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor . 
• The Investigator  will attempt to establish a di agnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of int ensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event tha t causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
inten sity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as “ serious ” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Assessment of causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention  and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility ” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than  that a relationship cannot be ruled 
out.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 78 • The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine whether or not the  relationship  is 
causal . 
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention  
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Invest igator  must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to  the Sponsor’s representative . However, it is 
very important that the Investigator  always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor’s

• The Investigator  may change his/her o pinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator  is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the Sponsor’s 
representative  to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as  
possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator  will provide the Sponsor’s representative  with a copy of any 
post-mortem findings including histopathology . 
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
REPORTING OF SAES  
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via an electronic data collection tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor’s representative  will be the 
electronic data collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data col lection 
tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the elec tronic system as soon as it becomes available.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 79 • After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken 
off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE f rom a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken 
off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or 
to the  Sponsor’s representa tive by telephone.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the protocol . 
SAE reporting to the Sponsor’s representative via paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the  Sponsor’s repres entative . 
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone 
is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace th e need for the Investigator  to complete 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the protocol . 
10.4 APPENDIX 4: CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDAN CE AND COLLECTION OF  PREGNANCY 
INFORMATION   
DEFINITIONS:  
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
- Documented hysterectomy  
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study entry.

3. Postmenopausal female  
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12  consecutive  months without an 
alternative medical  cause.   
- Females on hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) and w hose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use one  of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective 
contraception methods if they wish to conti nue their HRT during the study.  
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE  
Female participants of childbearing potential are  eligible to participate if they agree to use 
a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described below.  
 
Contraceptivesa allowed during the study include:  
Highly effective m ethodsb that have low user dependency  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
- Intrauterine device (IUD)  
- Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)b 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP  and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception 
should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.)  
Highly effective m ethodsb that are user dependent  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition o f ovulationc 
- oral 
- intravaginal  
- transdermal  
- injectable  
• Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
- oral 
- injectable  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual inter course 
during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant .) 
a Contraceptive u se by men or women  should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those 
participating in clinical studies.  
b Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  Typical use failure rates differ from those when used consistently and 
correctly.  
c If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable contraceptive methods  are limited to 
those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of act ion.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 81 COLLECTION OF  PREGNANCY INFORMATION:  
Male participants with partners who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study. This 
applies only to male participants who receive  dupilumab . 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor wi thin 24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally, the follow -up will be n o longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female participants who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of 
a participant 's pregnancy. The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the 
neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow -up will  
not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• Any pregnancy complication or el ective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as 
an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be 
reported as such. Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to 
the study intervention by the I nvestigator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in 
Section  8.3.4  of the protocol. While the Investigator  is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention.   
10.5 APPENDIX 5: GENETICS   
Use/Analysis of DNA  and RNA  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study intervention , susceptibility 
to, and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study intervention  may be 
due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; safety , disease etiology; and/or molecular

allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants.  
• DNA and RNA  samples will be used for research rel ated to dupilumab or PN and related 
diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic tests related 
to dupilumab or related drugs and atopic/allergic diseases . Genetic research may consist of 
the analysis of one or more candidate  genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout 
the genome  including whole -exome  sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, and DNA 
copy number variation. Transcriptome  sequencing (or other methods for quantitating RNA 
expression) may also be performed.  
• The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors 
involved in the response to dupilumab  or study interventions  of this class to understand 
study disease or related conditions.  
• The results of genetic analyses will not  be report ed in the CSR .  
• The Sponsor  will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures 
to protect confidentiality.  
• The samples will be retained no longer than 15 years or other period as per local 
requirements.

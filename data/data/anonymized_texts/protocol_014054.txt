 The SHAPE Pilot Study  
1.1 Objectives  and Hypotheses   
The main objective of the SHAPE pilot study is to determine the feasibility of using Habit 
Formation (HF) treatment to increase Physical Activity (PA) (reduction in daily in hours of 
sedentary time), and dietary among prefrail African Americans. This study  will test two 
hypotheses:  
Hypothesis 1 : The SHAPE study will demonstrate good feasibility with  high recruitment  
rate and successfully administrat ing all of measures among  the target population.   
 
Hypothesis 2 : Treatment group participants will demonstrate greater increases in 
primary outcomes ( sedentary time  and dietary quality ) and secondary outcomes 
(prefrailty reduction, lower extremity strengt h, balance, and  quality of life ) at 
intervention completion.   
 
1.2 Background  
Frailty among older African Americans is common, detrimental and costly.  Approximately 50% 
of older adults are pre -frail, 1-2 which makes them 2 -3 times more likely to develop frailty within 
3-7 years than non -frail elders.2-5 Frailty, is de fined as a decline in resilience across one or more 
domains of functioning that reduces an individual’s ability to respond to or recover from 
stressors (e.g., illness or loss of a loved one).6 In the context of frailty, acute social or health 
stressors can trigger a cascade of negative sequelae. Frail older adults are more likely to 
experience premature morbidity (as high as a 50% increase in relative risk), 4 mortality, and 
institutionalization.1-2, 4, 7 -8 African Americans have an especially high risk of becoming frail. 
African Americans are 2-4 times more likely to develop frailty than their European American 
counterparts, to do so at a youn ger ages, and to experience worse outcomes as a result.1, 9-10 
Moreover, correlates of frailty such as having less formal education and lower income,12 living 
in lower quality neighborhoods,12-15 higher rates of comorbid chronic diseases, obesity, and of 
disability are more prevalent in African American populations .16-21 
 
Effective frailty reduction interventions delivered to older African Americans during the 
prefrailty stage could reduce or delay frailty and improve health outcomes among older 
African Americans.  For prefrail older adults, the progression to frailty is neither inevitable nor 
irreversible.  Pre-frail elders can  regain non -frail resilience and are significantly more likely to do 
so than frail elderly.5, 22 -24 Moreover, pre-frailty represents an important, time -limited window 
of opportunity to intervene in the progression to frailty .25 A recent study suggested that 
individual’s spend approximately 7.4 years in the prefrail stage versus only 3.4 in the frail stage 
(before progressing to death or disability).25 Interventions delivered during prefrailty may als o 
require less intensive treatment than those delivered during frailty. Resilience -bolstering 
behaviors such as consuming adequate nutrition and increasing physical activity (PA) levels are 
currently the frontline non -pharmacological treatment for frailty reduction. Adequate nutrient 
intake (e.g., protein, vitamin D, fatty acids and minerals) protects against frailty by improving 
cell metabolism and anabolic signaling.26 PA is considered frailty -protective through the effect 
that it has on attenuating sarco penia,26-27 stimulating muscle protein synthesis,28-29 and 
5 
 increasing muscle strength, and physical performanc.26-27 Thus, intervening to increase physical 
activity and improve dietary quality among older adults during the prefrailty stage has the 
potentia l to reduce prefrailty and significantly improve both current and future health.  
 
A novel, evidence -based habit formation program is used the SHAPE study to improve dietary 
quality and decrease total sedentary time (ST) could reverse prefrailty or delay its progression 
among older adults . The habit formation program consists of 12 treatment sessions over 12 
weeks. In each session, an occupational therapist will deliver educational content, and us e HF 
techniques and behavioral skills to facilitate frailty protective behaviors. The conceptial 
treatment model approach to improve dietary quality and reduced ST among frail older adults  
(Error! Not a valid

approaches are 
effective across a 
range of behaviors, 
easy to implement, 
satisfactory to 
participants, 
tailorable to the 
individuals’ unique 
context, and 
correlated with key 
health outc omes.54, 
63-65  
 
1.3 Study design  
The SHAPE pilot study is a two -armed, single blinded, randomized control trial study  (Figure 2). 
Community dwelling prefrail African Americans  ages 55 and older is the target population to 
account for accelerated aging among African Americans .66 The sampling frame are Afiracan 
American adults who register in  the Healthier Black Elders Center’s  Participant Resource Pool 
(PRP) . The screening, consent, and enrollment procedures will follow a strict IRB -approved  
protocol over 16 weeks . Eighty prefrail A frican Anericans  will be randomized to the treatment 
or control group .

 1.3.2 Phone s creening   
The study coordinator calls potential participants from the participant resource pool ( PRP) 
registry to screen  for exclusion  criteria (a )-(g). If potential participants passed the phone 
screening, the coordinator will schedule consent/baseline evaluation visit  and assign 1 -2 raters 
for the  visit.  
 
1.3.3 Consent visit   
Consenting visits  will take place at participants’ home. R aters should call potential participants 
1 day ahead of time to confirm if they are still available. During the visit, raters will explain and 
help participants understand the SHAPE study procedure. All component s of the consent form 
should be clearly delivered (see 2.3 consenting procedure ). Consent forms must be attained 
before any data collection activities started. Both potential participants and the raters will sign 
two copies of  consent forms , one for the potential participants to keep and one for the lab .  
 
1.3.4 Baseline evaluation  
Ideally, once potential participants consented, raters will immediately start the baseline 
evaluation . However, if the potential participant need ti me to think about joining the study or 
are unwilling to do the baseline evaluation immediately after consent, raters should reschedule 
another time for baseline evaluation visit  (figure 2) .  
 
At baseline evaluation  visit , the raters will 
collect potential participants ’ sociodemographic 
characteristics  and anthropometrics. A series of 
psychometric and performance -based measurers 
will also be conducted for eligibly confirmation  
and primary/secondary outcomes  (table 2 ; see 
1.4.2 for procedure of measurement 
administration ). Most of the measures will be 
conducted in the baseline evaluation visit, except 
for ActivPal activity -tracking  device  (measures  
sedentary time ) and Automated Self -Administered 
24-hour  (ASA24) dietary recall  (measures  dietary 
quality ).  
 
Sedentary time is measured by Community 
Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors  
(CHAMPS)  and the ActivPal  activity -tracking 
device. At baseline evaluation visit, the rater will  
teach potential participants to use the ActivPal 
activity -tracking device. The potential participant 
will wear the ActivPal sensor  for seven 
consecutive days  to collect baseline activi ty data. 
At the end of the tracking period, the rater will schedule an  Figure 3. Breakdown of baseline evaluation by tasks

 ActivPal pick -up visit  to retrieve the tracker from the participant.  
To evaluate potential participants’ dietary quality , the rater will administer two ASA24 dietary 
recalls  in two non -consecutive days . The ASA 24 is a web -based tool that enables multiple, 
automatically coded, self -administered 24 -hour recalls for multiple meals. At baseline 
evaluation visit, raters will log in to the ASA24 system respondent we bsite to go collect  recalls 
of meals dietary from the previous day. A 2nd ASA24 phone follow -up will be  scheduled  two 
days after the baseline evaluation  will be conducted to collect another day of participants’’ 
dietary intake .   
 
After completing co nsent/baseline eva luation visit, all files and too ls should be returned to the 
Fritz  lab in the same day. If raters  need to return the tools overnight, please remember not to 
leave the tools in raters’ car, some tools need to be in certain temperature.  
 
1.3.5 Randomization  and Blinding  
After consent/baselinve evaluation visit. The study coordinator will check participants’ 
eligibility. Randomization was carried out by a coordinator not involved in data collection or 
analysis activities. Data collectors were blinded to arm a ssignment.  
 
Participants will be allocated using a 1:1 ratio via adapted randomization sequences generated 
a priori  by the study statistician, Dr. Hu, using an online tool 
(https://w ww.sealedenvelope.com/simple -randomiser/v1/lists ) to form a randomization table 
with a variable block size  (2,4, or 8) . Randomization sequence concealment will be achieved by 
query of the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system.  
  
1.3.6 Recruitme nt 
Participants are recruited through PRP list from the Healthier Black Elders Center (HBEC) . A 
preidentified list was screened by the center coordinator. Raters cold call people on the list to 
invite potential participants to join our study.  
 
1.3.7 Intervention period  
The treatment group will receive h abit formation intervention for 12 weeks. The HF 
intervention is delivered by an experienced geriatric occupational therapist. The 12-week long, 
intervention is delivered to each participant during 12 f ace-to-face, home based sessions (each 
lasting ~60 minutes) . An initial session (week 2) focuses on welcoming the participant to the 
program, and delivering educational content about prefrailty, frailty protective behaviors, and 
the concept of HF. In prepa ration for the sessions covering ST reduction and MVPA the next 
session (week 3) focuses on pain, its management, and the relationship between pain and 
activity (described below). Weeks 3 -11 include weekly HF sessions focused on ST reduction, 
MVPA and diet ary behaviors (see Table 2 for session content).  A closing session occurs in week 
12 to review program progress and create maintenance plans.  
 
The control group will receive 12 weeks of newsletters focused on general healthy aging 
topics.  Within 4 days of mailing the newsletter, the coordinator will call the participant, verify 
receipt of the newsletter, and ask them if they have any questions about the materials. Phone 
9 
 call will last ~15 minutes. Control condition participants receive no f urther intervention.  
 
1.3.8 Follow -up data collection  
When the 12 -week intervention period is over, the coordinator will assign raters for follow -up 
evaluation. Most of the measures will be re -administered .

 Data analysis plan   
2.1 Data analysis  
Feasibility outcomes such as recruitment, retention, and attendance data were presented by 
descriptive statistics. Differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups were 
tested by independent t tests or chi -square/Fisher’s exact tests. For the  primary and secondary 
outcomes , effect sizes were be represented by Cohen’s D, where 0.2 indicates small, 0.5 as 
moderate, and 0.8 as large effects. As for mechanisms of behavior change, pre and post habit 
formation effect sizes are estimated by Cohen’s D. All statistical analyses were conducted by 
IBM SPSS software, version 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).  
 
2.2 Sample size estimation  
We did not use power analysis to estimate study sample size for determine efficacy. We aim to 
recruit 15 participants in per group suggested for feasibility pilot study .  
 
2.3 Assessments  
Primary outcomes (measured at week 0 and 1 week post intervention). Sedentary Time (ST) 
was measured via the ActivPal wireless activity tracker. ActivPal is a validated tool with a 
commercialized program to generate mean minutes of total ST (min/day), sum of 30 -minute 
bouts ST, and sum of 60 -minunite bouts ST, as well as t he number of 30 -min bout ST and 60 -
munites bout ST per day. Participants wore the ActivPal device on their thigh for seven days 
during their waking hours. Dietary Quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 
and operationalized as the total HE I score generated from the National Cancer Institute’s ASA 
24®.  
 
Secondary outcomes (measured at week 0 and 1 week post intervention). Pre -frailty status was 
measured using the current gold standard, the Cardiovascular Health Study frailty criteria as 
com posite index consisting of the following components: (a) self -reported weight maintenance; 
(b) walking speed (the mean time of two trials for the time taken to walk 15 ft. reported in 
seconds); (c) grip strength, (mean score of grip strength reported in Lb s. of three trials on the 
dominant hand using a calibrated Jaymar dynamometer); (d) exhaustion, measured as a 
response of “All of the time” or “Most of the time” to the following two questions reported on 
a 4 point Likert scale, “I felt that everything I d id was an effort in the last week,” and “I could 
not get going in the last week”; and (e) total Kcals of energy expended over a 7 day period, 
measured via Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) 
questionnaire. Change of all PA and M VPA duration (minutes/week) measured by CHAMPS. We 
also used Activpal to estimate the cumulated MVPA duration. We cumulated MVAP minutes by 
selecting activity intensity greater than 3 METs. Physical Function was measured via the Short 
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) subtests for lower extremity strength and balance. 
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (Kieffer & Reese, 
2002). Participant anthropometry such as weight circumference (inch) was measured by a 
girthometer, h eight (cm) by a stadiometer, and weight (pound) by medical scales. Body mass 
index (BMI) was also calculated based on participant anthropometry. Quality of life was 
measured using the 26 -item validated WHOQOL -BREF. Occupational performance was 
12 
 measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), but only among 
treatment group participants.  Habit Formation was measured using the validated, 4 -item, Self -
Report Behavioral Automaticity Index (SRBAI). The SRBAI measures perceptions of behavioral 
automaticity for an identified behavior. To track habit formation during the intervention, the 
SRBAI was administered to treatment condition participants every 2 weeks from sessions 3 -11 
to assess changes in automaticity for their self -selected habits.   
 Pote ntial Benefits, Risks and Alternatives   
3.1 Benefits  
There will be considerable benefits to the participants enrolled in the proposed study. All 
participants will receive information about how to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and how 
to increase phys ical activity or improve your diet. In addition, participants in the active treatment 
group will receive free health coaching , while participants in the attention control group will have 
a trained research assistant deliver health related  education.  
 
3.2 Risks 
Potential risks of research participation -physical, psychological, financial and legal risks among 
others -are considered minimal. In -home evaluations and assessments of barriers may result in 
fatigue or aggravation. In addition, some questions may tou ch on emotionally -sensitive issues 
that could cause anxiety or other forms of emotional stress. The performance -based testing 
involves observation of everyday activities, which may result in fatigue or embarrassment.   
 
Participants will be told that their involvement in this research study is voluntary and that they 
may choose not to participate or withdraw their consent at any time. Withdrawal from the study 
will not at any time affect the commitment of the clinician to administer care, and there will be n o 
penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled. Participants who undergo 
the study visits will be given the option to reschedule the visit or take a break at any time during 
the study if necessary. There is little legal risk to participating in this research. All research -
related information will be kept confidential and accessible only to authorized members of the 
research team.  
 
3.3 Minimization of Risks  
We are a HIPPA covered entity and comply with all HIPP A regulations. To protect against and 
minimize  potential risks, participants will be carefully screened and evaluated for eligibility by 
research coordinator.  
 
To avoid or minimize symptoms of fatigue, agitation, or emotional distress due to testing, 
participants will be instructed to notify the rater or interventionist if they experience any 
discomfort. They will also be periodically questioned about their toler ance for the 
tests/intervention. Testing and interviews will be terminated if participants develop fatigue, 
agitation, or emotional distress.  
 
An ID number will be assigned to each participant. All data collected from a participant will be 
labeled with th e ID number. All participant electronic and hard -copy data will be kept under 
double -lock protection. All hard copy forms that contain personal identifiers (e.g., name, 
address, phone numbers) will be stored in a separate locked file drawer under double -lock 
protection. No publication or presentation of the study data will uniquely identify or provide 
sufficient information to uniquely identify participants.  
 
13 
 Risks during the home visit will be minimized by having licensed and trained interventionists 
available to monitor safety during intervention .  
 
To guard against unauthorized data access, all shared -use computer systems at the lab are 
protected with passwords, which are changed at 4 -month intervals. Only individuals with a 
particular "need to know" status are given access, and system privileges are carefully restricted. 
All personal computers to be used in the Administrative Unit ar e located within a secure area, 
and the system is locked when not in use. SPSS software packages will be used for data 
management and analysis. Datasets generated from these programs will not contain any HIPPA 
data.  
 
Data will be entered into a REDCap dat abase. REDCap servers are securely housed in an onsite, 
limited -access data center managed by the Wayne State University IT . All data are stored on a 
private, firewall protected network. All users are given individual user IDs and passwords, and 
their acce ss is restricted on a role -specific basis. REDCap was developed specifically around 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act security guidelines and is implemented and 
maintained according to Washington University guidelines. Study data will be collected via 
tablet in the field and managed using REDCap electronic data -capture tools hosted at 
Washington University. REDCap is a secure, Web -based application designed to support data 
capture for research studies.  
 
3.4 Adverse events   
• What is an adve rse event ?  
An adverse event is any reaction, side effect or untoward event that occurs 
during the course of the study. Adverse events are categorized as serious (see 
below) or non -serious, as related or not related to the study intervention, and as 
expect ed or unexpected.  For the purpose of the present trial, clinically insignificant 
events will be excluded from any type of AE documentation. These include colds, flu, 
cuts, scrapes, coughs, headaches, stomach complaints, general fatigue and mild 
symptoms. Behavioral AEs that will be tracked in this trial include increases in 
emotional distress and problems managing everyday activities (functional changes).  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as deaths, life -threatening events, 
permanently or substanti ally disabling events, congenital anomalies, events 
requiring an initial hospitalization or prolonging a current hospitalization, or events 
that require intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. SAEs in this 
trial could include inpatient hosp italization for cardiovascular or other cardio -
metabolic disease related problems.  
• In the visit, if there is an SAE that is emergent, call 911.  
• Document AE in rater’s log in Redcap.  
• Notify Study coordinator  immediatel y if there is an AE or SAE .

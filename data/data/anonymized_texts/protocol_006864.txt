 Phoneme discrimination   
Assessment the spectral discrimination capacity of the aided 
cochlea. Coding spectral differences is the core function of 
the cochlea. Pairs of speech sounds presented at various 
intensity levels to measure auditory discrimination and identification at various intensities through the cochlear implant after surgery, via direct connect.  The cue for 
discrimination is a difference in spectral content between the two phonemes. Hence, if certain contrasts cannot be 
discriminated, this reflects a failure of the cochlea to convey 
the spectral cue.  
Loudness Scaling  Narrowband noise presented at various intensity levels to 
measure sound comfort at various intensities through the 
cochlear implant after surgery, via direct connect.  This test 
assesses the identification of sound on a visual analog scale 
from inaudible to too loud by the recipient.  
Pending Outcome Request  Output from the AI system at the end of each session. A list 
of tests to be completed at the next visit are provided for future optimization of the AI MAP. These may include loudness scaling, audiometry, speech audiometry, and/or 
phoneme discrimination.  
Speech, Spatial, and  
Qualities of Hearing Scale 
(SSQ)  A validated metric used as a self -assessment of hearing in  
everyday life across three hearing domains: speech hearing,  
spatial hearing, and qualities of sound  
3.0 Introduction and background  
The goal of this study is to evaluate recipient outcomes and clinician and recipient acceptance of a new Artificial 
Intelligent (AI) technology . The AI system utilizes novel evaluation measures to provide a standardized approach 
to post -operative programming (also referred to as MAPping). This technique can be utilized as a clinical tool for 
the audiologist to use in modifying programming parameters for  both existing and newly implanted cochlear 
implant recipients.  As mentioned the AI technology is a tool used by an audiologist to provide programming 
modifications in a more consistent manner.  
 
One of the novel evaluation methods is via psychophysical  tests based in auditory hierarchy skills. These include 
detection, discrimination, identification and comprehension of auditory stimulus. Tests will be presented via direct auditory input to the sound processor. This module allows for test measures to be presented in a calibrated 
manner outside of the soundfield through the commercially available wired and wireless programming pods. 
There are several configurations which can be utilized based on clinician and patient preference as well as the 
sound processor type. One of these configurations is  via the commercially available CP910 sound processor, 
Personal Audio Cable, and standard of care Cochlear Nucleus Programming Pod as shown in Figure 1 below .  
The software test module may allow for improved clinician and recipient experience by allowing the 
aforementioned testing to be delivered directly to the recipient’s sound processor outside of a soundfield for both 
newly implanted and existing cochlear implant recipients .

 Additionally, the AI will provide fitting recommendations based on the psychophysical test measures listed above 
and program parameters which will assist the audiologist during cochlear implant programming sessions. The 
recommendations by the AI agent is outcome driven based on data from psychoacoustic tests (Bermejo et al, 
2013, Varenberg et al 2011, Govaerts et al 2010). In current clinical practice patient programs (also referred to as 
MAPs) are often modified based on subjective patient feedback. Programming parameter modifications are made 
in Custom Sound, for Cochlear Nucleus  recipients. The program adjustments can vary based on clinical center 
and audiologist, which may impact patient outcomes in some cases. The AI system provides several advices to 
potentially improve outcomes, based on data across major cochlear implant systems and individual psychoacoustic  data. These Intelligent Agent recommendations can substantially reduce programming time, as it 
may assist the audiologist in implementing test results to modify the recipient’s program (also referred to as a MAP) , Figure 2

 Study Objective  
Group 1 (Newly Implanted): To compare preoperative speech recognition with an appropriately fit hearing aid to 
Cochlear Implant (CI) performance at 6 months post -activation using a CNC Monosyllabic Word Test 
administered in soundfield at 60dBA for the implanted ear.  
 
Group 2 (Existing subjects): To compare performance in subjects using an expert clinician (EC) MAP versus an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) MAP on a CNC Monosyllabic Word score administered in soundfield at 60dBA.  
4.0 Criteria for Subject Selection 
Cochlear Americas expects to enroll a minimum of 30 subjects  for Group 1; and a minimum of 50 subjects in 
Group 2, for  Group 2 at up to 8 North American cochlear implant centers. The duration of the multisite study is 
expected to be up to 2 years,  depending on subject recruitment. Other than meeting the inclusion criteria below, 
subjects will be recruited into the study sequentially to ensure a subject pool representative of the general population of those with hearing loss, with no pre- selection based on age (other than being 12 years -of-age or 
older), ethnicity or gender. To be included in the study, subjects must meet the criteria below.  Group 1 (Newly 
implanted subjects) will  participate in the study for 6  months post -activation. Group 2 (Existing subjects) will 
participate in the study for up to 8 weeks after enrollment. Bilateral cochlear implant recipients may be included in 
the study,  however only one ear will be evaluated.

5.0 Methods and Procedures   
 Device description  
Cochlear implant sound processors to be used in this study may include commercially available Nucleus 5, Nucleus 6, Kanso, or Nucleus 7 series processors.  The subject’s respective sound processor will be programmed 
for take home use with the AI MAP or AI AutoMAP only. Expert clinician MAPs should not be loaded to the sound 
processor for take home use.    
 
 Programming Software Description  
Programming of the sound processor is achieved via the commercially available and FDA approved  Cochlear 
Nucleus Custom Sound (CS) software. In addition, the psychoacoustic tests  will be used to assess  performance 
of the subject and provide the audiologist with programming parameter suggestions . Each clinical site will be 
provided a laptop to complete psychoacoustic testing, in addition to CS  for use in the study .  
 Description of Test Measures  
5.3.1  Consonant -Nucleus -Consonant (CNC)  Word Recognition Test  
The CNC Word Test (Peterson & Lehiste, 1962) is a validated test used clinically and in research to assess the 
speech perception performance of individuals  with hearing aids or cochlear implants on open- set word 
 
    
CONFIDENTIAL

 recognition. The test consists of 10 recorded lists of 50 monosyllabic words  in CD format. For this study, two lists 
will be administered in quiet at a level equal to 60dBA in the soundfield an d scored as total number of words 
correct, which will be expressed as a percentage correct for this study. Subjects will be tested using a  
configuration of speech at 0º azimuth in quiet.  
 
5.3.2  AzBio Sentence Test  
The AzBio Sentence Test (Spahr  et al, 2012) is a validated test used clinically and in research to assess the 
open- set sentence recognition in speech- spectrum noise of adults with hearing aids or cochlear implants. It 
consists of 15 lists of 20 sentences each.  AzBio sentences are spoken by different talkers in a conversational 
style with limited contextual cues that the listener can use to predict or ‘fill in’ unintelligible words. The sentences 
will be presented at a fixed level in speech weighted noise at a fixed signal -to-noise ratio.  Each list includes 5 
sentences from 4 different male and female speakers.  The average level of intelligibility of each list is 85% +/ - 
1%.  Each word in the sentence counts towards the overall score.  Subjects will be tested using a configuration of speech at 0º and noise at 0º azimuth at +10dB SNR.  
 
5.3.3  Psychoacoustic test  battery   
This term is an overarching name for the following tests: Speech audiometry, phoneme discrimination, loudness scaling, and audiometry. All tests are completed via Direct Connect and collect data regarding detection, discrimination and identification of sound through the cochlear implant. Results from these tests are incorporated into recommendations for the AI MAP . Specific tests within the psychoacoustic test  battery to be completed at 
each study visit are based on recommendations through the AI software  
 
5.3.3.1  Speech audiometry  
For this study, 25 CNC words randomly selected from each list  will be administered in quiet at each level equal to 
40, 55, 70 and 85dB SPL  for speech audiometry . Testing will be completed via Direct Connect  and scored as the 
percentage of correctly repeated phonemes. An average phoneme score will be calculated within the test module, 
across the four presentation levels.  
 
5.3.3.2  Phoneme discrimination  
The phoneme discrimination test is performed using up to 20 pre- defined speech sound contrasting pairs (a- r, u-ʃ, 
u-a, u-i, i-a, o-a, i-e, m-z, s-ʃ, e-a, u-o, ə-a, ə-o, ə-e, ə-i, z-s, v-z, ə-u, u-y, y-i). Phoneme pairs have been 
established as linguistically representative and are tested at 70 dB HL in an oddity paradigm (Govaerts et al., 2006). Subjects will be tested via Direct Connect and provide a behavioral response (e.g., hand raise or verbal 
response) if a discrimination  is recorded for the phoneme contrast. Two correct responses are required to be 
considered as correct identification as scored by the Investigator. Training for at least one phoneme pair will be completed for each study visit to ensure familiarity with the test.  
 
5.3.3.3  Loudness scaling  
Loudness scaling testing is completed by presentation of one-third octave narrow band noises centered at 250, 
1000, and 4000 Hz. A 1876 ms duration stimulus will be presented randomly twice at 5dB increments between 30 
and 80dB HL. L oudness  will be  scored on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (inaudible) to 6 (too loud)  by the 
subject  and stimulus will be delivered via Direct Connect . (Varenburg et al. 2011, Govaerts et. al, 2006, Hereeen 
et al., 2012).

 5.3.3.4  Audiometry  
Aided audiometric thresholds via direct connect  will be obtained using narrow band noise and the standard 
audiometric technique (as defined in Appendix A) at the following frequencies 125, 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 
3000, 4000, 6000, 8000 Hz.  
 
5.3.4  Clinician survey  
Clinician  surveys  will be collected, and may be combined with the Site Initiation  Visit. These surveys  will provide 
feedback on current clinical models and practices that are clinic centric  and variable. Additional survey data 
regarding experience with newly implanted and existing subjects will be conducted after experience with at least 5 
subjects . The surveys after subjects experience will focus on overall audiologist  experience. The information 
gathered will provide data regarding clinician perceived acceptance and information learned with use of the AI 
system.    
5.3.5  Participant Questionnaire  
The Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing ( SSQ ) (Gatehouse & Noble, 2004) is a subject self -assessment in 
three categories (speech hearing rating scale, spatial rating scale, and sound qualities rating scale). The SSQ is 
considered a closed- ended and validated self -report assessment of outcome.  
5.3.6  Unscheduled Visit  
If a subject requires an interim clinical visit  for programming,  an Unscheduled Visit Form will be completed. 
Information collected will include reason for visit, activities completed and visit date. Patients may be seen clinically for accessory and device counseling without completion of the Unscheduled Visit Form, however any change in program or MAP settings during these visits will need to be captured.

CAM -CL-111_F  
  
 t-test for non- inferiority. A planned evaluable sample size of 50 subjects with approximately 90% power will be 
provided with no assumed mean difference between AI MAP and EC MAP, and a non- inferiority margin of 10%.  
5.5.3  Justification of Pooling Across Study Sites 
Pooling data from study sites will be done based on the following: all sites will have the same protocol, the 
sponsor will monitor the sites to assure protocol compliance, and the data gathering mechanism (case report forms and data acquisition) will be the same across all study sites (Meinert, 1986).  
5.5.4  Missing Data  
All efforts will be put forth to ensure near complete follow -up, with particular focus on the assessment of the 
primary outcome and occurrence of adverse events. Regular reminders of subject follow -up due dates will be 
provided to participating centers to facilitate scheduling of follow -up visits.  
5.5.5  Additional Statistical Analyses 
Statistical Analysis for this study is addressed in detail in the document entitled “ Statistical Ana lysis Plan for the 
Clinical Investigation of New CI Delivery Models in a Nucleus CI Population study ”.  
5.5.6  Access to Study Documents and Data  Monitoring 
Investigator(s) will provide access to study documentation including source data for the purposes of monit oring, 
audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspections.  
The Sponsor will designate appropriately trained monitors  to review the progress of this study and assure the 
quality and integrity of data accumulated. Clinical monitors, as  represent atives of the Sponsor, have the obligation 
to provide site qualification and initiation visits as well as regular site visits. The study monitors will be employees 
of the Sponsor, Cochlear Americas, or any contracted vendors qualified by experience and training to conduct 
study site monitoring for this investigation.  Study monitors, employed by Cochlear Americas, for this study will be:  
 
      
       
      
       
 
      
       
      
       
 
      
     
                             
       
 
All data generated during this study and the source documents from which they originated are open to inspection 
by the Sponsor or its representative, and other regulatory  agencies.  Upon completion of the study, the clinical 
monitor will conduct a final visit, or close- out of  the site. The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all 
subjects  are accounted for, that  the regulatory records and reports are complete, verify that study device and 
other  supplies have been accounted for and ensure that the Investigator is aware of his/her  responsibilities post -
study.  Data collection is performed using electronic data capture (EDC) on electronic Case Report Forms

 (eCRFs). Site personnel will be trained on the completion of the eCRFs prior to obtaining their own 
Login/Password. Access to clinical study information will be based on an individual’s role and responsibilities. In 
the event that the site requests assistance with data entry from the Sponsor, the Sponsor may assign a non- study 
related team member to assist the site with data entry.    
 Data Storage and Confidentiality  
5.6.1  Confidentiality  
A Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed for each study subject, summarizing all clinical and study data. The CRF contains confidential material. Subjects will only be referred to in the CRF by their subject numbers in order to retain subject confidentiality. Specific instructions to complete the CRF shall be provided to the clinical investigation team as appropriate.  
Copies of the completed CRFs are to be provided to the Sponsor as soon as practical after completion and review. The original CRFs are to be retained by the Investigator for a period of time as determined by local 
regulations.  
5.6.2  Subject Identification  
To maintain confidentiality, the subject’s name will not be recorded on any study document  other than the 
informed consent form. All individuals who provide informed consent (sign the informed consent form) are 
considered consented into the study and will be assigned a unique identifier. A unique alphanumeric code will 
identify the subject throughout the course of the study. For example, US01- ART-0000, where: 
• US = United States  
• 01 = a sequential numeral corresponding the order in which a subject is enrolled into the study for a given 
study site, in this case this would correspond to the first subject recruited into the study for a particular 
site, 
• ART = an abbreviation for the study, in this case “ART” for the Artificial Intelligent  system,  
• 0000 = a unique, numeric study site identification.  
5.6.3  Release of Medical Information  
Subjects will be required to release the exchange of medical information between the Investigator(s) and the 
Sponsor. This requirement will be clearly identified in the Informed Consent form.  
 Transition from Research Participation  
5.1.1  Completed Subjects  
Subjects in Group 1 will be deemed completed after approximately 6 months post -activation, including completion 
of evaluation materials (See Section 3.3). Subjects in Group 2 will be deemed completed after approximately  
eight weeks, including completion of evaluation materials (See Section 3.3). Subjects will continue to receive 
standard clinical follow -up care at their cochlear implant facility after the study.  
6.0 Risk Benefit Statement  
It is possible but not guaranteed that advances to cochlear implant technology will improve performance via 
artificial intelligence programming and clinic models for future recipients. This clinical investigation will help to 
inform the future development of associated clinical  guidance when fitting cochlear implant patients.

 Risk Category  
As determined by the Sponsor, this study has been designated as non- significant risk. The cochlear implant, 
sound processor and physical programming equipment  used in this study  is standard of care and commercially 
available.  
 Potential Risk and Protection Against Risks  
Subjects may experience sounds during mapping that are uncomfortably loud. Mitigation of  the risk  listed above is 
similar to that used during clinical cochlear implant mapping wherein the sound processor is removed from the 
subjects head and/or the stimulation to the sound processor is ceased in Custom Sound.  Risks to newly 
implanted subjects is consistent with commercially cochlear implantation. Risks of cochlear implantation will be 
detailed in the informed consent.  
 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Potential benefit s to subjects may include improved outcomes on speech perception outcomes  due to 
programming technology  and reduced clinical visits with the modified clinic model schedule while in this study. It 
cannot be promised that subjects will receive any medical benefits from being in this study.  
 Alternatives to Participation  
In lieu of study participation, patients may elect to continue standard clinical care for hearing aids if they do not 
pursue cochlear implantation, or pursue cochlear implantation without study participation. If patients receive a cochlear implant outside this study, programming will not be completed with the programming technologies or modified clinic model used in this study. Patients who have been implanted prior to invitation to participate in the study may be seen  for post -operative management  of per standard clinical care at their respective institution .  
7.0  Subject identification, Recruitment, and Consent/Assent  
 Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited into the study sequentially to ensure a subject pool representative of the general 
population of those with hearing loss, with no pre- selection based on age (other than being 12 years -of-age or 
older), ethnicity  or gender  as described in Section 2.0. The identification and recruitment of subjects will protect 
patient privacy and be free of undue influence.  
 Process of Consent  
Prior to recruitment of any subjects into the study, written approval of the investigat ional  plan including clinical 
protocol and informed consent form will be obtained from reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB).  An interview 
(as part of the informed consent process) will be conducted by the surgeon and/or audiologist to inform the 
subject  about rationale for and the details, aims, objectives of the study,  study expectations, evaluation schedule, 
and the risks and benefits of the trial treatment (and alternative treatments), and the extent of the patient’s involvement . Written informed consent shall be obtained from each subject after this explanation. After reviewing 
the Informed Consent Form, the subject  will be given the opportunity to review and ask questions about the 
Informed Consent Form and/or the study prior to signing the Informed Consent Form. The subject will be offered 
the opportunity to take the form home to discuss with family members should they choose to do so. If they sign the Informed Consent Form, the subject twill then be given a copy of the signed Informed Consent Form to take 
home.  The informed consent process is intended to be completed after standard of care surgery for Group 1 
subjec ts, but may be completed pre- operatively if deemed appropriate by the Investigator.  
 
    
CONFIDENTIAL

 The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all patients give written informed consent prior to any study -
related examination or activity. All patients shall sign and date the Informed Consent Form, and a copy of the 
Informed Consent Form shall be given to the patient.  The Sponsor and the Investigator(s) shall avoid improper 
influence on or inducement of the subject, monitor, the Investigator(s) or other parties parti cipating in or 
contributing to the clinical investigation.   
 Subject Capacity  
Adult subjects participating in this study will have the capacity to provide informed consent as assessed by the 
Investigators. The only anticipated exception this is minors, for which assent will be obtained in addition to parental consent.  
 Subject/Repre sentative Comprehension  
Subject/Representative comprehension for participation in this study will have the capacity to provide informed 
consent as  assessed by the Investigators on behalf of themselves or minor subjects. With regard to minor 
subjects, asse nt will be obtained in addition to parental consent.  
 Consent Forms  
The informed consent form provided for this study will meet requirements for specific sections as described in 21 CRF 50.25.  
 Documentation of Consent  
A subject  is not considered enrolled until a properly executed Informed Consent Form has been obtained and 
inclusion/exclusion information has been reviewed and approved by Cochlear Americas, as evidenced by the return of a study approval form signed by a Cochlear Americas representative.
  
 Costs to the Subject  
Costs to subjects in this study include billing newly implanted subjects and/or their insurance company for a Nucleus cochlear implant system and for surgery. The insurance company will be billed for any medical, surgical, or 
audiological  treatment which may be needed after receiving the cochlear implant. Cochlear Americas will not for 
any audiology or medical evaluation conducted before or after surgery. Subjects will not be reimbursed by Cochlear 
Americas for the surgery, programming of the device, or any therapy received.  These services are all standard components of learning to hear with a cochlear implant.  
Tests and procedures that are done only for the study will not be billed to the subject’s insurance company. It is recommended subject’s talk with their insurance company about its payment policy for standard medical care given 
during a research study. If the subject’s insurance company does not pay, they may be billed for those charges. 
Subjects are responsible for, and will have to pay for, transportation to and from the study visits.  
 Payment for Participation  
Subjects in Group 1 and Group 2 will be paid $12.50/hour for study visits completed.  If a subject  withdraw s from 
the study before completing all stud y visits, they  will be compensated $12.50/hour for the study visits which wer e 
completed. In order to receive payment for participation, subjects will need to complete a W -9 form, which is required 
because study payments for time are taxable.  
Additionally, subjects in Group 1 will receive a comprehensive warranty on all parts connected with the system for 5 years following the initial activation of the implant . This is  in addition to the standard warranty on internal and 
external equipment provided by Cochlear Americas.

Appendix A : Procedural considerations 
• Pre-CI (Hearing aid condition) and post -CI (Cochlear Implant condition)  testing may be completed in the 
soundfield using an audiometer, such as a Grason Stadler GSI 61 (Grason Stadler, Inc., Milford, NH, 
U.S.A.) or equivalent, calibrated to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards with 
maximum output for frequencies of 0.5 to 4  kHz of no less than 120 dB HL.   
• Additional test set -up post -implantation for Group 1, or for Group 2 includes testing via direct connect , 
which is described as direct connection to the sound processor via the Personal Audio Cable and 
Programming Pod. Calibration will be completed prior to initiation of any test and will be calibrated 
within the test system.  
• Speech and hearing evaluations completed in t he soundfield will be completed at a minimum, a single-
walled sound booth capable of accommodating a calibrated, 90- degree, speaker orientation.  Stimuli will 
be administered using either insert earphones and/or sound field speakers. Applicable ANSI standards are: ANSI/ASA S3.6 -2004;  ANSI S3.1 -1999 (R 2003).  
• Speech and hearing evaluations completed with Direct Connect testing will be completed in a quiet 
room within the clinical site.  
• Sound field calibration will be completed as recommended by Katz (2002). The sound level meter 
should be set to the “A scale” and “slow” settings.  The sound level meter will be placed in the center of 
sound booth, approximately 1m from the loud speaker face, at the height of which would represent the 
center of an average subjects  head. The calibration noise (test specific, however preferably speech 
spectrum noise) will be administered through the audiometer output to the loud speaker within the 
sound booth. The sound level meter detects the audiometer output through the loud speaker.  With the VU meter on the audiometer set to 0 while, the dial on the audiometer is adjusted until the sound level meter within the sound booth detects the desired output . 
• Pure tone threshold exploration will be completed using the adaptive Hughson & Westlake procedure 
(1944).

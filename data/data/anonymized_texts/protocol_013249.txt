Number of Planned Participants
Approximately 60 to 70 participants will be enrolled in the study to ensure about 60 participants will be treated 
at the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommended dose. 
Study Design
This is a single arm, open -label, m ulti-center phase 2 trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of tucatinib 
in combination with T -DXd for the treatment of participants with previously treated unresectable LA/M HER2+ 
breast cancer w ith or without brain metas tases, who have received prior treatment with a taxane and 
trastuzumab (w ith or w ithout pertuzumab) in the LA/M setting or progressed within 6 months after neoadjuvant 
or adjuvant treatment involving a regimen including a taxane and trastuzumab (w ith or w ithout pertuzumab). 
A SMC will continuously monitor participants for AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), dose modifications, and 
laboratory abnormalities throughout the course of the study.
Safety Lead -in
Ten participants w ill be enrolled, irrespective of cohort, in the safety lead -in portion of the study and receive 
tucatinib 300 mg orally twice daily (PO BID) and T -DXd 5.4 mg/kg via intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of 
each of 21 -day cycle. The participants enrolled in the safety lead -in will undergo the same efficacy, PK, and 
biomarker analyses as all other participants with the exception of an additional PK assessment performed at 
Cycle 1 Day 12. Once 10 participants are enrolled in the safety lead -in, enrollment will be paused until all 
participants ha ve been followed for at least 1 cycle and a comprehensive review of the safety profile by the 
SMC has occurred. The SMC will make recommendations regarding continuing with enrollment if the safety 
and tolerability of the regimen is acceptable. If clinicall y significant safety events are observed at any point 
during the safety lead -in, enrollment will be paused until relatedness has been determined, and review by the 
SMC has occurred. Based on the totality of the safety data, the SMC may recommend proceeding with 
enrollment, evaluation of alternative dosing, or not proceeding with further enrollment. The SMC may also 
recommend expanding the safety lead -in to enroll up to approximately 10 additional participants with continued 
monitoring for safety by the SMC.
Post-safety Lead -in
Follow ing the safety lead -in, enrollment will continue until approximately 60 response -evaluable participants 
have been enrolled at the SMC recommended dose. There will be 2 cohorts in the study, 1 for participants 
without brain metast ases (Cohort A) and 1 for participants with a history of brain metastases (Cohort B), w ith 
approximately 30 participants enrolled into each cohort. All participants, including those in the safety lead -in, 
treated at the SMC recommended dose, w ill be includ ed in the efficacy analysis. Additional optional cohorts 
evaluating the combination of tucatinib and T -DXd in earlier treatment lines for breast cancer, such as the

in other malignancies, such as non -small cell lung cancer, urothelial cancer, gastric/gastroesophageal junction 
cancer, and colorectal cancer.
The incidence of diarrhea, though predominantly low grade, has resulted in dose modificatio ns of tucatinib, and 
prophylactic antidiarrheals have been recommended by the SMC. Antidiarrheal prophylaxis will be 
administered for the first 42 days of study treatment. After this initial 42 -day period, participants may continue 
on antidiarrheal prophyl axis or be sw itched to symptomatic treatment of diarrhea, at the investigator’s 
discretion. Symptomatic management of treatment -induced diarrhea should be based on established guidelines 
(Benson et al, 2004 ; Bossi et al, 2018 ). 
The primary endpoint of the study is confirmed ORR by investigator. Radiographic efficacy ass essments will be 
made by the investigator, according to RECIST v1.1, w ith confirmation required ≥4 weeks from the first 
documentation of response. In addition, images will be collected by an ICR facility for possible future analysis.
Secondary efficacy end points include DOR, PFS, DCR, and OS.
As of Amendment 3, the objectives of the study have been achieved. Therefore, the decision has been made to 
close the study. For participants in long -term follow -up, a last visit or contact will occur prior to the 
participant’s discontinuation from participation in the study. Any participant on treatment with tucatinib with or 
without T -DXd w ill transition to the long -term extension phase (LTEP) of the study. The sponsor will provide 
continued access to study interventi onduring the LTEP for any participant who is still on tucatinib with or 
without T -DXd and receiving clinical benefit based on the investigator’s assessment. Once post -study access to 
study treatment is available, participants will have a last visit or con tact prior to discontinuation from the study.
Investigational Products, Dose, and Mode of Adm inistration
Participants will receive tucatinib and T -DXd in combination at the following doses:
●Tucatinib 300 mg PO BID on Days 1 to 21 of each 21 -day cycle. 
●T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.
Duration of Treatm ent
Participants may continue on study treatment until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, investigator 
or participant decision to discontinue, or study closure. All efforts should be made to continue treatment until 
unequivocal evidence of radiographic progression, per RECIST v1.1, occurs.
Participants assessed as having isolated progression in the CNS per RECIST v1.1, may be eligible to continue 
on study treatment for clinical benefit after undergoing local therapy to CNS disease, with approval from the 
medical monitor.
As of Amendment 3, participants still receiving clinical benefit based on the investigator’s assessment and 
remaining on treatment with tucatinib with or with out T -DXd m ay continue receiving study intervention during 
the LTEP until post -study access to study treatment is available. 
Efficacy Assessments
Disease response per RECIST v1.1 w ill be assessed by the investigator. Response assessments will include 
meas urement of all known sites of unresectable LA/M disease (including at a minimum the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis), preferably by high quality spiral contrast computed tomography (CT), at baseline, every 6 weeks for the 
first 24 weeks, and every 9 weeks there after, irrespective of dose delays. Positron emission tomography 
(PET)/CT (if high quality CT scan included), and/or MRI scan may also be done as appropriate, as w ell as 
additional imaging of any other known sites of disease (eg, photography for skin lesio ns, nuclear bone scan 
imaging for bone lesions). For each participant, the same imaging modality as used at baseline should be used 
throughout the study.

Page 16of 132Contrast MRI of the brain will be required on this same schedule only in those participants w ith prior history of 
brain metastases or brain metastases found on screening MRI. Additional contrast MRIs of the brain may also 
be performed in participants without known brain metastases if there is clinical suspicion of new brain lesions.
Participants who discon tinue study treatment for reasons other than documented PD w ill continue to have 
disease assessments every 9 weeks (±1 week) until the occurrence of disease progression per RECIST v1.1, 
death, w ithdrawal of consent or study closure.
Follow -up for survival and subsequent anti -cancer therapy will occur approximately every 3 months and 
continue until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up, or study closure.
During the LTEP, efficacy assessments will be performed per institutional guidelines and invest igator -
determined usual and customary clinical care.
Pharm acokinetic Assessments
PK assessments of trough levels of tucatinib drug levels will be performed on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 6 prior 
to administration of tucatinib. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, PK assessments of peak levels of tucatinib will be 
performed 2 hours (±15 minutes) after administration of tucatinib. For safety lead -in participants only, an 
additional post -tucatinib dose pharmacokinetic assessment will be performed on Cycle 1 Day 12. 
Biom arker Assessments
Blood samples will be collected at screening, Cycle 3 Day 1 (predose), and at end of treatment (EOT) to assess 
exploratory biomarkers in relation to response, resistance, or toxicity. Biomarker assessments may include an 
exploratory asses sment of HER2 mutations or other genetic alterations as potential biomarkers of response. 
Additional exploratory analyses on archival tissue including but not limited to immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
and next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis may be perfor med to interrogate biomarkers that are associated 
with tumor grow th, survival, and resistance to targeted therapeutics. This assessment may enable the correlation 
of additional biomarkers with treatment outcome and may ultimately guide or refine participan tselection 
strategies to better match tucatinib regimens with tumor phenotype/genotype in the future.
Safety Assessments
Participants will be assessed throughout the study for safety. Safety assessments including physical exam and 
collection of AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be performed at a minimum of once every 3 weeks 
throughout study treatment and 30 days after the last dose of study interventions. Laboratory assessments will 
be performed locally. During Cycle 1, an in -person safety assessment will be performed on Days 1 and 12. 
During Cycle 2, an in -person safety assessment will be performed on Day 1 and liver function tests (LFTs) will 
be collected on Cycle 2 Day 12. An in -person safety assessment will then be performed on Day 1 of each cycle 
throughout the remainder of the study or as clinically indicated. Assessment of cardiac ejection fraction will be 
performed by MUGA or ECHO at screening and at least once every 12 weeks thereafter until study 
discontinuation irrespective of dose delays or interruption, and 30 days after the last dose of study interventions 
(unless done within 12 weeks prior to the EOT visit). 
Participants will be monitored for signs and symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis. In cases where ILD/pneumonitis is 
suspected, treatment wit h T-DXd w ill be interrupted, and the participant w ill undergo evaluation including 
radiographic imaging. Pulmonary consultation should also be considered. Dose modification or discontinuation 
of T-DXd for cases of ILD/pneumonitis will be made as per produc t label.
Only pregnancies and SAEs will be collected by the sponsor during the LTEP. All other assessments, including 
additional safety assessments, will be performed per institutional guidelines and investigator- determined usual 
and customary clinical car e. Pregnancy testing will continue as outlined in the schedule of events for 
participants of child -bearing potential.

1.1.HER2+ Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is the most common form and leading cause of cancer -related death in women 
worldwide ( Bray et al, 2018). In 2020, the estimated number of women that will be newl y 
diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States is 276,480, and there will be 42,170 breast 
cancer -related deaths (Siegel et al, 2020 ). Approximately  15% to 20% of all breast cance rs 
overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (Owens et al, 2004 ; 
Giordano et al, 2014 ; American Cancer Societ y (ACS), 2018) . HER2 is a transmembrane 
tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Tumors that 
overexpress HER2 are more aggressive and historically  have been associated with poorer 
overall survival (OS ) compared to HER2 negative cancers ( Slamon et al, 1987 ) .
1.2.Treatment of HER2+ Breast Cancer
The introduction of HER2 -targeted therapies has led to significant and meaningful 
improvements in disease -free survival, progression- free survival (PFS), and OS in both the 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant and metastatic settings (Slamon et al, 2001 ; Geyer et al, 2006 ; Baselga 
et al, 2012; Verma et al, 2012 ).
1.2.1. Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, and T- DM1
Trastuzumab, a humanized anti -HER2 antibody  that binds to the HER2 extracellular domain, 
was the first anti -HER2 agent approved b y regulatory  authorities for use in the treatment of 
HER2+ breast cancer and remains the backbone of treatment in the periopera tive and 
metastatic setting, usually in combination with a taxane ( Slamon et al, 2001; Vogel et al, 
2002). 
The developm ent of trastuzumab has been followed by  the approval of multiple anti -
HER2 
agents for the management of HER2+ breast cancer. Pertuzumab, a monoclonal antibody  that 
binds to the HER2 receptor at a site different from trastuzumab, in combination with 
trastuz umab and a taxane is the current standard of care in the first -line metastatic setting 
based on data from the CLEOPATRA stud y (Swain et al, 2015) . In addition, pertuzumab is 
approved for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with earl y stage breast cancer (either 
greater than 2 cm in diameter or node positive) and adjuvant treatment of patients with 
HER2+ early  breast cancer at hi gh risk of recurrence (Gianni et al, 2016 ; von Minckwitz et 
al, 2017 ); (PERJETA® Prescribing Information, Genentech, Inc., Dec 2018 ).
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1), an antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) composed of 
trastuzumab, a thioether linker, an d a derivative of the antimitotic agent may tansine, was 
approved for the treatment of patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who 
previously  received trastuzumab and a taxane (prior therapy  for metastatic disease, or 
development of recurrence du ring or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy ), and is 
the current standard of care in the second -line metastatic setting ( Verma et al, 2012 )
(KADCYLA® Prescribing Information, Genentech, Inc., Dec 2018 ). More recently , T-DM1 
showed superior efficacy relative to trastuzumab in the adjuvant therap y management of 
participants w ho had less than a pathological complete remission to neoadjuvant

Minckwitz et al, 2019 )
.
1.2.2. Lapatinib and Neratinib
Lapatinib and neratinib are HER2 targeting t yrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) that have also 
been approved for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. Lapatinib targets both the HER2 
receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and was approved in combination 
with capecitabine in patients with metastatic disease who have progressed following prior 
trastuzumab, anthracy cline, and taxane therapy  (Geyer et al, 2006 ) (TYKERB®Prescribing 
Information, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., Dec 2018). Lapatinib has also been approved 
in combination with letrozole in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive 
metastatic disease (Schwartzberg et al, 2010 ). Neratinib, a pan -Erb inhibitor, was approved 
for the extended adjuvant treatment of patients with high -risk ea rly stage HER2+ breast 
cancer, to follow adjuvant trastuzumab- based therapy  (Chan et al, 2016 ). Neratinib is also 
approved in combination with capecitabine for treatment in the metastatic setting in breast 
cancer patients who have received 2 or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens. Howev er, 
lapatinib and neratinib have been associated with toxicities including diarrhea and rash that 
are likel y associated with EGFR inhibition. As an example, over 40% of participants in the 
neratinib adjuvant ExteNET study  experienced Grade ≥3 diarrhea, and antidiarrheal 
prophy laxis is now recommended with neratinib use (NERLYNX®Prescribing Information, 
Puma Biotechnology , Inc., Jun 2018). Despite these advances, the toxicities associated with 
lapatinib and neratinib limit their ability  to combine with othe r HER2- directed or cy totoxic 
agents. 
1.2.3. Tucatinib
Tucatinib is an orall y (PO)-available, reversible HER2 small molecule TKI. Two key  
features of tucatinib are its potency  and selectivity for HER2 compared to the closel y related 
kinase EGFR. Tucatinib is a po tent inhibitor of HER2 in vitro, and in cellular signaling 
assay s is >1000- fold more selective for HER2 compared to EGFR. The selectivity  of 
tucatinib for HER2 reduces the potential for EGFR -related side effects, such as skin rash and 
gastrointestinal toxi city. This unique feature also differentiates tucatinib from other HER2 
targeting TKIs, such as lapatinib and neratinib, which inhibit both HER2 and EGFR with 
similar potency  and are associated with the aforementioned side effects associated with 
EGFR inhi bition. Furthermore, the limited toxicity  associated with tucatinib allows for the 
potential for combination with other agents.
Recently , based on results from the HER2CLIMB study , tucatinib was approved in the US 
under the trade name TUKYSA, in combinatio n with trastuzumab and capecitabine, for 
treatment of adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, 
including patients with brain metastases, who have received 1 or more prior 
anti-
HER2- based regimens in the metastatic settin g (TUKYSA Prescribing Information, 
Seattle Genetics, Apr 2020). In HER2CLIMB, the addition of tucatinib to trastuzumab and 
capecitabine was found to be superior to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone, with a 
46%
reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (hazard ratio [HR]=0.54 
[95% confidence interval {CI }: 0.42, 0.71]; p<0.00001) in participants previously  treated

Page 32of 132with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T -DM1 (Murthy  et al, 2020 ). The trial also met the 2 key 
secondary  endpoints at interim anal ysis. The tucatinib arm demonstrated an improvement in 
OS, with a 34% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.66 [95% CI : 0.50, 0.88]; p=0.0048) 
compared to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. For patients with brain metastases at 
baseline, the tucatinib arm also demonstrated superi or PFS, with a 52% reduction in the risk 
of disease progression or death compared to those who received trastuzumab and 
capecitabine alone (HR=0.48 [95% CI : 0.34, 0.69]; p<0.00001). L astly, treatment with 
tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in these participants resulted in a 
significantl y higher confirmed objective response rate (cORR) (40.6% [95% CI : 35.3, 46.0]) 
vs. participants treated in the control arm (22.8% [95% CI : 16.7, 29.8]; P=0.00008).
Tucatinib in combination with trastu zumab and capecitabine was generall y well tolerated 
with a manageable safet y profile. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in the tucatinib 
arm included diarrhea, palmar -plantar ery throd ysesthesia sy ndrome (PPE), nausea, fatigue, 
and vomiting. Grade 3 or greater AEs in the tucatinib arm compared to the control arm 
included diarrhea (12.9% vs. 8.6%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (4.5% vs. 
0.5%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (5.4% vs. 0.5%) and increased bilirubin 
(0.7% vs. 2.5%). There was no requirement for prophy lactic antidiarrheals. AEs leading to 
discontinuations were infrequent in both the tucatinib arm and the control arm (5.7% and 
3.0%).
Clinical trials are ongoing to examine the safet y and efficacy of tucatinib when combined 
with other HER2 -directed therapies. A complete summary  of the clinical and nonclinical data 
for tucatinib and its study in human participants is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.2.4. Trastuzumab deruxtecan
T-DXd is an ADC comprised of a humaniz ed IgG1 antibody  directed at HER2 
(fam -trastuzumab), the topoisomerase I inhibitor, Dxd, and a cleavable tetrapeptide linker. 
T-DXd targets HER2 at the cell surface and, upon binding to HER2, is internalized. 
Intracellularly , the tetrapeptide linker is cle aved by  lysosomal cathepsins, releasing Dxd, a 
derivative of exatecan. Dxd inhibits topoisomerase I resulting in antitumor activity  (Modi et 
al, 2020 )
. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted accelerated approval in the US under the trade name 
ENHERTU for treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2+ breast 
cancer who have received 2 or more prior anti- HER2 -based regimens in the metastatic 
setting, based upon data from the DE STINY -Breast01 study  (ENHERTU Prescribing 
Information, Daiichi Sanky o, Dec 2019). In the phase 2 single arm stud y, treatment with 
T-DXd resulted in a cORR of 60.9% (95% CI: 53.4, 68.0) in participants with metastatic 
HER2+ breast cancer previously  treated with T -DM1 (Modi et al, 2020 ).  In contrast to the 
HER2CLIMB study , patients with active brain metastases were excluded; however, the study  
did enroll participants with treated brain metasta ses. I n DESTINY -Breast03, a randomized 
phase 3 study , participants with HER2+ unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer 
previously  treated with trastuzumab and a taxane received either T- DXd or TDM1. The 
median PFS was not reached for T -DXd vs 6.8 month s for T
-DM1 (HR 0.28 [95% CI , 0.22, 
0.37]). The confirmed ORR for T- DXd was 79.1% (95% CI, 74.3, 84.4) (Cortés et al, 2021).

Page 33of 132Common AEs for T-DXd in the DESTINY- Breast01 study  were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, 
alopecia, constipation, decreased appetite, anemia, diarrhea, cough, and thrombocytopenia. 
The most common Grade ≥3 AEs were neutropenia (20.7%), anemia (8.7%), and nausea 
(7.6%) (Modi et al, 2020
). The safet y profile of T- DXd in the DESTINY -Breast03 stud y was 
consistent with what was reported in the DESTINY- Breast01 stud y. In DESTI NY-Breast03, 
similar rates of an y grade and Grade ≥3 drug -related treatment-emergent adverse events were 
reported in the two treatment arms. Treatment with T- DXd may  result in severe or fatal 
interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis. I n studies of T- DXd for MBC, 9% of 
patients experienced ILD and/or pneumonitis; 2.6% of which had fatal outcomes due to ILD 
and/or pneumonitis (ENHERTU Prescribing Information, Daiichi Sanky o, Dec 2019). In 
DESTINY -Breast03, drug -related ILD and/or pneumonitis was reported in 10.5% of 
participants treated with T -DXd; none of which reporte d Grade 4 or Grade 5 ILD and/or 
pneumonitis events. 
1.3.Brain Metastases in HER2+ Breast Cancer
The advances over the past 2 decades in the development of novel therapeutics for HER2+ 
breast cancer have resulted in better control of s ystemic disease. Because of this significant 
improvement, patients live longer (as demonstrated by  increases in PFS and OS) and more 
patients are developing brain metastases. Clinical trials suggest that there is an increased risk 
of first relapse occurring in the central nervous system (CNS) in participants who have 
received trastuzumab -based adjuvant therapy  (Clay ton et al, 2004 ; Olson et al, 2013a ; Olson 
et al, 2013b ), and up to 50% of HER2+ participants with metastatic disease will develop
CNS metastases at some point during the course of the disease (Clay ton et al, 2004 ; 
Goldhirsch et al, 2 013; Pestalozzi et al, 2013 ). The increasing prevalence of CNS metastases 
in participants with HER2+ breast cancer may  be due to several factors ( Lin et al, 2004 ). 
First, HER2+ breast cancer appears to display  a special tropism for the CNS tissue. Second, 
with better control of non -CNS disease, participants may  be living longer, allowing CNS 
metastases to become more of a critical clinical issue. Finall y, the CNS may represent a 
sanctuary  site for HER2+ disease, as large molecules such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab do 
not penetrate the blood -brain barrier to an y meaningful extent at approved doses. The 
evidence suggests that drug blood -brain barrier permeability  is most likely  a function of not 
only P-glycoprotein expression but also the interplay of molecule size, charge, lipophilicity, 
tumor neovasculature anatomy , and plasma protein binding (Gerstner & Fine, 2007 ). 
Treatment for brain metastases usually  includes either surgical resection, radiosurgery , and/or 
whole brain radiotherap y in addition to continuation of systemic anti -HER2 therapy . 
Unfortunatel y, the se treatments often result in significant neurologic toxicities, which may  
impair quality  of life (QoL). Stereotactic radiosurgery  (SRS) has been increasingl y used to 
avoid the neurologic toxicities of whole- brain radiotherapy , but the trade -off for this d ecrease 
in toxicity  has been inferior control of distant brain relapse outside of the radiation fields 
(Chang et al, 2009 ; Brown et al, 2016; Kaidar -Person et al, 2016 ). 
Breast cancer patients with HER2+ brain metastases have a worse prognosis relative to those 
without CNS disease . In population -based registries of HER2+ MBC enrolled at diagnosis, 
evidence of brain metastases leads to a shortened survival relative to participants without 
brain metastases (Brufsky  et al, 2011 ). Among the 377 participants with brain metastases,

Page 34of 132median OS from the date of initial MBC diagnosis was 26.3 months (range: 1.0 to 
60.9 months) compared to 44.6 months (range: 0.5 to 59.7 months) in the 635 participants 
who did not have CNS meta stases ( Brufsky  et al, 2011 ).
Taken together, HER2 -targeting regimens that distribute into the brain are needed. Until the 
recent regulatory  approval of tucatinib in combination with trastuz umab and capecitabine, 
which includes patients with brain metastases, no sy stemic agents had been shown to 
demonstrate benefit in this patient population. Moreover, breast cancer patients with brain 
metastases have historically  been excluded from clinical trials. Development of novel 
combinations for this patient population remains an important medical need, and addressing 
this need will require including these participants in clinical trials.
1.4.Rationale for Combination of Tucatinib with Trastuzumab deruxtec an
Treatment failures in HER2+ breast cancer may  result from primary  or acquired resistance to 
HER2 blockade (Lu et al, 2001 ; Nahta & Esteva, 2006 ; Scaltriti et al, 2007; Pohlmann et al, 
2009) . There is evidence t hat dual targeting of HER2, in particular when further combining 
with a cy totoxic agent, can lead to further improvements in efficacy  in patients with MBC 
(Swain et al, 2015 ; Murthy  et al, 2020 ). Therefore, the combination of tucatinib with T -DXd 
may result in further improvement on the eff icacy  seen with either agent, potentially  through 
overcoming or delay ing the development of resistance through dual HER2 blockade.
1.4.1. Preclinical
Pre-clinical data have shown that the combination of tucatinib with a HER2 directed ADC 
comprised of trastuzumab conjugated with exatecan moieties (T -Ex) results in improved 
anti-tumor activity  in HER2+ breast cancer models. I n HER2+ tumor -
derived cell lines, 
tucatinib in combination with T -Ex can result in additive or sy nergistic activity  (data not 
shown). In additi on, the combination of tucatinib and T -Ex resulted in more effective tumor 
reduction than either drug individually  in the BT -474 cell line- derived xenograft model and 
in 2 HER2+ patient -derived (PDX) breast cancer models ( Kulukian et al, 2020 ).
1.4.2. Rationale for Study
Significant progress has been made in the management of HER2+ breast cancer over the past 
2 decades, with regulatory approval of multiple HER2- targeting agents. Recently , both 
tucatinib (in combi nation with trastuzumab and capecitabine) and T- DXd were approved b y 
the US FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2+ MBC who have received prior 
HER2- directed therap y in the metastatic setting. However, despite these advances, metastatic 
disease remain s incurable, and patients will eventually  progress on currently  available 
therapies. Although tucatinib (in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine) and 
T
-DXd have demonstrated clinically  meaningful improvements in efficacy  for patients with 
MBC, bet ter outcomes may  be achieved by  combining the 2 agents. This is particularl y 
important in patients with brain metastases where the prognosis remains worse when 
compared to patients without brain metastases. Gastrointestinal adverse events such as 
nausea an d/or diarrhea have been observed as an overlapping toxicity  with these 2 agents. 
Additionally , tucatinib is associated with increases in liver transaminases (AST and ALT), 
and T-DXd is associated with decreased blood counts (eg, neutropenia and anemia) and

3.INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1. Summary of Study Design
This is a single arm, open -label, multi -center phase 2 trial designed to assess the safet y and 
efficacy  of tucatinib in combination with T -DXd for the treatment of participants with 
previously  treated unresectable LA/M HER2+ breast cancer with or without brain metastases 
who have received prior treatment with a taxane and trastuzumab (with or without 
pertuzumab) in the LA/M setting or progres sed within 6 months after neoadjuvant or 
adjuvant treatment involving a regimen including a taxane and trastuzumab (with or without 
pertuzumab). 
A Safet y Monitoring Committee (SMC) will monitor participants for AEs, serious adverse 
events (SAEs), dose mod ifications, and laboratory abnormalities throughout the course of the 
study .
As of Amendment 3, the objectives of the stud y have been achieved. Therefore, the decision 
has been made to close the study . For participants in long -term follow -up, a last visit or 
contact will occur prior to the participant’s discontinuation from the study . Any  participant 
on treatment with tucatinib with or without T-DXd will transition to the LTEP of the study. 
The sponsor will provide continued access to study  intervention du ring the LTEP for an y 
participant who is still on tucatinib with or without T- DXd and receiving clinical benefit 
based on the investigator’s assessment. Once post- study  access to study  treatment is 
available, participant will have a last visit or contact p rior to discontinuation from the study . 
Safety Lead -in
Ten participants will be enrolled, irrespective of cohort, in the safet y lead -in portion of the 
study  and receive tucatinib 300 mg PO twice daily (BID) and T -DXd 5.4 mg/kg via

Page 37of 132intravenous (IV) infusio n on Day  1 of each of 21 -day cycle. The participants enrolled in the 
safet y lead -in will undergo the same efficacy , PK, and biomarker anal yses as all other 
participants with the exception of an additional PK assessment performed at Cy cle 1, Day  12. 
Once 10 participants are enrolled in the safety  lead -in, enrollment will be paused until all 
participants have been followed for at least 1 cycle and a comprehensive review of the safet y 
profile b y the SMC has occurred. The SMC will make recommendations regarding
continuing with enrollment if the safet y and tolerability  of the regimen is acceptable. If 
clinically  significant safety  events are observed at any  point during the safety  lead -in, 
enrollment will be paused until relatedness has been determined, and review by  the SMC has 
occurred. Based on the totality  of the safet y data, the SMC may recommend proceeding with 
enrollment, evaluation of alternative dosing, or not proceeding with further enrollment. The 
SMC may  also recommend expanding the safet y lead -in to e nroll up to approximately  
10additional participants with continued monitoring for safety  by the SMC.
Post-
safety Lead- in
Following the safet y lead -in, enrollment will continue until approximately  
60response -evaluable participants have been enrolled at the SMC recommended dose. There 
will be 2 cohorts in the study , 1 for participants without brain metastases (Cohort A) and 1 
for participants with a history  of brain metastases (Cohort B), with approximately  
30 participants enrolled into each cohort. All participants, including those in the safet y 
lead-in, treated at the SMC recommended dose, will be included in the efficacy  analy sis. 
Additional optional cohorts evaluating the combination of tucatinib and T -DXd in earlier 
treatment lines for breast cancer, such as the first- line metastatic setting or 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, may  be added. Optional cohorts may  also be opened in other 
malignancies, such as non -small cell lung cancer, urothelial cancer, gastric/gastroesophageal 
junction cancer, and colorec tal cancer. 
The incidence of diarrhea, though predominantly  low grade, has resulted in dose 
modifications of tucatinib, and proph ylactic antidiarrheals have been recommended by  the 
SMC. Antidiarrheal prophy laxis will be required for all participants follo wing protocol 
amendment 2. Antidiarrheal proph ylaxis will be administered for the first 42 days of study  
treatment. Following this initial 42 -day period, participants may  continue on antidiarrheal 
prophy laxis or be switched to sy mptomatic treatment of diarrhea, at the investigator’s 
discretion. Sy mptomatic management of treatment -induced diarrhea should be based on 
established guidelines (Benson et al, 2004; Bossi et al, 2018 ).
The primary  endpoint of the study  is cORR by  investigator. Radiographic efficacy  
assessments will be made by  the investigator, according to RECI STv1.1, with confirmation 
required ≥4weeks from the first documentation of response. In addition, images will be 
collected b y an ICR facility  for possible future analy sis.
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints include DOR, PFS, DCR, and OS.

Page 38of 1323.1.1. Clinically Significant S afety Events
Clinically  significant safety  events will be AEs or laboratory  abnormalities that occur during 
the safet y lead -in portion that are related to tucatinib or T -DXd, and that are considered 
sufficiently  important to merit a pause of enrollment dur ing the safet y lead -in for 
determination of relatedness and review b y the SMC. Events for which there is an alternative 
clinical explanation (eg, clearl y related to an intercurrent illness or disease progression), will 
not be considered clinically  signific ant safet y events. The severit y of AEs and laboratory 
abnormalities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI ) Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The relationship of AEs to 
study  interventions will be d etermined b y the investigator. 
Occurrence of a clinically  significant safet y event will result in a pause in enrollment while 
the SMC evaluates the events and determines whether to proceed with the study . Participants 
who experience a clinically  significa nt safety event may  continue on study  treatment if 
treatment discontinuation is not required b y protocol dose modification criteria and the 
investigator believes it to be in the participant's best interest. Participants may resume 
treatment at a lower dose (eg, the next lower dose level of tucatinib and/or a reduced dose of 
T-DXd) following recovery  of the AE to ≤ Grade 1 or the baseline grade. 
3.1.2. Safety Monitoring Committee
The SMC will be responsible for monitoring the safety  of participants in the study  atregular 
intervals. In particular, the SMC will evaluate clinically  significant safety  events and other 
safet y data in the safet y lead-in stage; PK data may  also be evaluated, if available. The SMC 
will review data on deaths, study  treatment and study  intervention discontinuations, dose 
reductions, AEs, SAEs, laboratory  abnormalities, and PK data on a regular basis. The SMC 
will make recommendations to the sponsor regarding the conduct of the study , including 
changes to dosing and administration schedule, a nd make recommendations concerning study  
continuation as planned, protocol amendment, or earl y discontinuation of the study  for 
excessive toxicity . 
An SMC Charter will outline the committee’s composition, members’ roles and 
responsibilities, and describe SMC procedures. The sponsor will provide a copy  of each 
SMC recommendation to the investigators.
3.1.3. Stopping Criteria
Reasons for prematurel y terminating the stud y may include but are not limited to the 
following:
The incidence or severit y of AEs in this or o ther studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to participants, either through a safet y review by the sponsor or the SMC. 
Participant enrollment is unsatisfactory . 
3.1.4. End of Study
As of Amendment 3, all participants still in the study  who are not entering the L TEP will 
have a last visit/contact. The study  will end when the last L TEP participant has had their last

clinical benefit based on the investigator’s assessment.
3.1.5. Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups
This is an open -label, single arm study .
3.1.6. Ration ale for Selection of Doses
Selection of the tucatinib dosing at 300 mg PO BID for the current study  was based upon the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) derived from 2 phase 1b studies in HER2+ MBC that 
evaluated tucatinib in combination with T -DM1 (ONT -380- 004), or capecitabine and 
trastuzumab (ONT -
380-005). Moreover, in the pivotal HER2CLIMB study , the combination 
of tucatinib 300 mg PO BID with trastuzumab and capecitabine was found to be well 
tolerated with a manageable safet y profile. The single -agent ap proved dose for T -DXd for 
HER2+ MBC is 5.4 mg/kg IV every  3weeks. Importantly , no major overlapping toxicities 
between tucatinib and T -DXd are expected based on the individual agent safet y profiles. 
Therefore, the proposed starting dose for each agent in 
this study  is tucatinib 300 mg PO BID 
and trastuzumab 5.4 mg/kg IV every  3weeks.
3.1.7. Blinding and Unblinding
This is an open -label, single arm study .

In the absence of progression, participants who discontinue T -DXd may  continue receiving 
tucatinib alone. Participants who discontinue tucatinib may  continue to receive T -DXd alone.
Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study  intervention will remain in the study  
and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The onl y 
exception to this is when a participant specificall y withdraws consent from any  further 
contact with them or persons previously  authorized by  the participant to provide this 
information. A participant also may  choose to withdraw consent from procedures and visits 
but remain on study  for follow -up and further data collection through phone contact, review 
medical records, public records, or other public platforms. The withdrawal of consent should 
be explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal 
is only  from further receipt of study  intervention or also from study  procedures and/or 
posttreatment study  follow up. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or 
dead) is being measured, publicly  available informatio n should be used to determine vital 
status only  as appropriately  directed in accordance with local law.
4.5.1.1. Continuing on Study for Isolated CNS Progression
If a participant is found to have isolated progression in the CNS per RECIST v1.1 (including 
either par ench ymal brain or dural metastases but not skull -based or leptomeningeal 
metastases) and does not have progression of disease outside the CNS, the participant may  be 
eligible to continue on study  treatment after completion of local treatment (radiotherap y or 
surgery ) of any  progressive brain/dural metastases to allow for clinical benefit. L ocal 
treatment must be completed prior to the participant’s next response assessment time point. 
Participants may  continue on study  treatment for clinical benefit after t his PFS event in the 
CNS; however, this requires discussion with and documented approval from the study  
medical monitor. Participants may  continue treatment until either sy stemic progression or a 
second isolated CNS progression. The participant may  continu e on study provided the 
following criteria are met and the participant continues to receive clinical benefit:
The participant is not experiencing an y worsening of cancer -related sy mptoms or 
signs indicating clinically  significant progression of disease. Pa rticipants who are 
clinically  deteriorating (eg, have a decline in ECOG PS, sy mptomatic rapid 
disease progression requiring urgent medical intervention) and unlikely  to receive 
further benefit from continued treatment should discontinue study  treatment
Theparticipant is tolerating stud y intervention
Review and concurrence by  the medical monitor
Participant has no evidence of unequivocal s ystemic progression
Participant has not had a previous isolated CNS progression while on study

Tucatinib will be administered PO BID and may be taken with or without food. Dose 
modifications of tucatinib are described in Section 5.5.1. Participants will be instructed b y 
the pharmacist or investigator as to the specific number of tablets required for each dose. At 
each visit during study  treatment, participants will be supplied with the appropriate numbe r 
of tablets for the number of doses to be taken prior to the next scheduled visit. 
Participants will be instructed to take tucatinib twice each day  (once in the morning, and once 
in the evening) approximately  8 to 12
hours between doses in the same calendar day . It is 
recommended that if a participant misses a scheduled dose of tucatinib and less than 6 hours 
have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should be immediately taken. It is 
recommended that if more than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the 
participant should not take the missed dose but should wait and take the next regularl y 
scheduled dose. Tucatinib may  be taken with or without food. Tablets must be swallowed 
whole and may  not be crushed, chewed or dissolved in liquid. On the day  of dosing, the 
individual unit dose of the tucatinib tablet may  be exposed to ambient temperature for up to 
6hours prior to dose.
Complete dosing instructions will be provided to the pharmacist prior to the initiation of the 
study . Comp lete dosing instructions will also be provided to study participants and will

guidance.
5.5.Dose Modifications
Tucatinib and T -DXd dose reduction recommendations are described in Table 3and Table 4, 
respectivel y.
Guidelines for dose modification recommendations (including dose holds, dose re duction, or 
discontinuation of drug) in response to potential AEs are described in the tables in 
Section 5.5.3. Dose reductions or treatment interrup tion/discontinuation for reasons other 
than those described in Section 5.5.3 may be made by  the investigator if it is deemed in the 
best interest of participant safet y. Whenever possible, these decisions should first be 
discussed with the study  medical monitor.
All AEs and clinicall y significant laboratory abnormalities should be assessed by the 
investigator for relationship to tucatinib and T
-DXd. An AE may  be considered related to 
tucatinib alone, T -DXd alone, to both drugs, or to neither. In the event that the relationship is 
unclear, discussion should be held with the study  medical monitor, to discuss which study  
intervention(s) should be held and/o r modified.

delay  greater than 6 weeks is required due to treatment- related toxicity , unless a longer delay  
is approved b y the stud y medical monitor.
In the event of isolated progression in the CNS, study  treatment may  be held up to 6 weeks to 
allow local CNS therap y (Section 4.5.1.1). Tucatinib and T- DXd are to be held 1 week prior 
to planned CNS -directed therap y. The potential for radiosensitization with tucatinib and 
T
-DXd is unknown. Study  treatment may  be reinitiated ≥7 days after completion of SRS, 
≥14days after WBRT, and ≥28days after surgical resection. Plans for holding and 
reinitiating stud y interventions before and after local therap y will require discussion with, 
and documented approval from, the medical monitor.
Protocol -defined visits and cy cle numbering will be determined by  T-DXd dosing, allowing
for dose holds or delay s with T -DXd. In the event T -DXd is discontinued but study  treatment 
with tucatinib continues, protocol -defined visits and cy cle numbering will proceed using a 
21-day  cy cle regardless of dose holds or delay s for tucatinib.
5.5.1. Tucatinib Dose Reductions
Up to 3 dose reductions of tucatinib are allowed ( Table 3); fewer dose reduction levels may  
be available if alternative tucatinib doses or schedules are adopted, following SMC 
recommendation. Participants who would require a dose reduction to below 150mg BID 
should discontinue treatment with tucatinib. Dose reductions of larger intervals than those 
described in 
Table 3 may be made at the discretion of the investigator, but dose reductions to 
below 150 mg B ID are not allowed. 
Tucatinib dose should not be re -escalated after a dose reduction is made.

Thoracentesis or paracentesis may  be performed, if needed for comfort.
If surgery  or localized radiation become indicated (either for palliation or 
down -staging of previously  nonresectable tumor), these concomitant procedures 
are permitted for non -target non- CNS lesions only  in situations where other 
disease remains assessable by  RECIST v1.1. These interventions should be 
avoided if clinicall y feasible until after the second response assessment. The 
medical monitor should be consulted prior to the intervention occurring. 
Corticosteroids
oParticipants requiring s ystemic corticosteroids for control of CNS 
metastases at a dose >2 mg of dexamethasone ( or equivalent) on the first 
day of study  treatment are not eligible to begin study  treatment and should 
not be enrolled until doses <2 mg can be achieved.
oAfter initiation of study  treatment, corticosteroids may  be initiated for 
control of CNS sy mptoms.
oSystemic corticosteroids for control of other comorbidities (eg, asthma or 
auto- immune diseases) or premedication for contrast use in computed 
tomograph y (CT) or MRI scans are permitted.

disease assessable b y RECI ST v1.1
Vaccination with live vaccines
Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors are prohibited within 5 elimination half -lives of the 
inhibitor. Moderate/strong inducers of CYP2C8 are prohibited within 5 days prior 
to the first dose of study  treatment, as concomitant medications during study  
treatment, and within 1 week of discontinuation of tucatinib treatment. Moderate 
inhibitors of CY P2C8 should be used with caution. For additional information, 
including drug elimination half -lives of strong inhibitor, moderate inhibitors, and 
moderate inducers, see Appendix B
Strong inducers of CYP3A4 are prohibited within 5 days prior to first dose of 
study  treatment, as concomitant medications during stud y treatment, and within 
1week of discontinuation of study  treatment. For additional informa tion 
including drug elimination half -lives of strong inducers, see Appendix C
Use of sensitive CYP3A substrates should be avoided 1 week prior to f irst dose of 
study  treatment and during study  treatment ( Appendix D). Consider using an 
alternate medication which is not a sensitive CYP3A substrate. If unavoidable, 
consider dose reduction of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices 
and/or increased monitoring for potential adverse reactions as described in the 
medication’s prescribing information
Concomitant use of tucatinib with digoxin, a P -glycoprotein (P -gp) substrate, 
which increases digoxin concentrations and may  increase the risk for 
digoxin -related adverse reactions. Concomitant use of tucatinib with digoxin or 
P-gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (such as, but not limited to, 
dabigatran, fexofenadine, and cy closporine) should be used with caution. Refer to 
the prescribing information of digoxin or other P -gp substrates for dose 
adjustment recommendations due to drug interactions
5.7.Management of Treatment -emergent Adverse Event s
5.7.1. Infusion -related Reaction and its Management
An IRR is characterized by  an adverse reaction to the infusion of pharmacological or 
biological substances. IRRs occur within 24 hours of infusion and may  manifest as a 
combination of signs or symptoms includi ng fever, rigors, flushing, itching, various ty pes of 
rash, urticaria, d yspnea, nausea, vomiting, back or abdominal pain, and/or hy potension 
(Kang 
& Saif, 2007).
IRRs with T -DXd were observed (2.6% of patients); the infusion rate should be slowed or 
interrupted if the patient develops infusion -related sy mptoms. T -DXd should be discontinued

Page 61of 132permanentl y in the case of severe infusion reactions. The infusion should be administered at 
a site properl y equipped and staffed to manage anaphy laxis should it occur. All supportive 
measures consistent with optimal patient care should be given throughout the study  according 
to institutional standards. Supportive measures may inc lude extending the infusion time 
and/or administering medications for IRRs. 
Any IRR related to T -DXd should be managed according to the product label and/or 
institutional standard of care. Premedication for IRRs is allowed at the investigator’s 
discretion
The severit y of IRRs should be graded according to NCI  CTCAE, version 5.0, guidelines.
5.7.2. Allergic/Hypersensitivity Reaction
Allergic/hy persensitivity  reactions are characterized by  adverse local or general responses 
from exposure to an allergen (NCI CTCAE v ersion 5.0). For purposes of this study , 
allergic/h ypersensitivity  reactions are differentiated from I RRs by  being defined as occurring 
>24hours after infusion of T- DXd. Allergic/hy persensitivity  reactions may  manifest in the 
same manner as IRRs, ie, a co mbination of signs or sy mptoms including fever, rigors, 
flushing, itching, various ty pes of rash, urticaria, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, back or 
abdominal pain, and/or hy potension.
5.7.3. Anaphylaxis
Anaph ylaxis is a severe, life threatening, generalized or sy stemic allergic/hy persensitivity  
reaction. Anaph ylaxis is characterized b y an acute inflammatory reaction resulting from the 
release of histamine and histamine -like substances from mast cells, causing a h ypersensitivity  
immune response. Clinically , it pr esents with breathing difficult y, dizziness, hypotension, 
cyanosis, and loss of consciousness and may  lead to death (NCI CTCAE, version 5.0 and 
(Rosello et al, 2017).
If anaph ylaxis occurs, administration of T -DXd should be immediately  and permanentl y 
discontinued.
5.7.4. Management of Treatment -
associated Diarrhea
Perform diagnostic tests as clinically  indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. If an 
alternate cause of diarrhea is suspected and/or identified, treat accordingl y.
In participants enrolled during which primary  antidiarrheal prophy laxis is implemented, 
please refer to Section 5.5.1 for dosing guidance.
oAntidiarrheal proph ylaxis should be held in situations where use is 
contraindicated (eg, bacterial enterocolitis), until resolution of the 
contraindica tion.
In participants receiving antidiarrheals for s ymptomatic control (not prophy lactically ) of 
treatment -associated diarrhea:
oEarly Detection: Instruct participants to report diarrhea on the first s ymptom/sign 
of diarrhea.
oEarly Intervention:

treatment as soon as first unformed stool occurs.
The recommended dose of loperamide is 4mg at first unformed stool, 
followed b y 2mg every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea free (maximum 16 mg/day).
Instruct participants to call site if diarrhea persists >48 hours or there is an 
increase of >7 stools per day  over baseline (Grade 3 Diarrhea per CTCAE 
v5.0).
Instruct participants to seek medical attention if unable to maintain oral 
hydration due to diarrhea, particularl y in the presence of concomitant emesis.
Instruct participants to seek medical attention if unable to maintain oral 
hydration. Intervention with I V fluids and electroly te replacement should be 
considered as clinicall y indicated.
5.8.Treatment Compliance
Study  intervention administration will be documented in source documents and the CRF. 
The pharmacist or designee will record the number of tucatinib tablets dispensed to each 
individual participant, and the number of tablets returned to the clinic at the end of each 
cycle. Tucatinib compliance may  also be assessed on a participant -by-participant basis using 
participant diaries. 
Data regarding the administration and dose of T -DXd will also be collected by  the site after 
each cy cle. Dose modifications and interruptions of both study  interventions will be 
documented in the source documents and the CRF. Following implementation of 
Amendment 3 and entry  of remaining on -treatment participants into the L TEP, treatment 
administration data will no longer be collected in CRFs. Refer to Section 8.3for further 
detail on L TEP data collection requirements.
6.STUDY ACTIVITIES
6.1.Schedule of Events
AEs and concomitan t medications will be recorded from Day  1 (predose) through the safety  
reporting period (see Section 7.7.1.3). Any  study  protocol -related AE (define d in 
Section 7.7.1.1) as well as any  concomitant medications given for treatment of the AE, 
should be recorded from the time of informed consent.
Clinical laboratory  assessments (serum chemistry  panel, liver function tests [LFTs], complete 
blood count [CBC] with differential [manual differential if clinicall y indicated, see

7.STUDY ASSESSMENTS
7.1.Screening/Baseline Assessments
Screening/Baseline assessments will be conducted to establish study  baseline status and 
determine stud y eligibility. Onl y participants who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria 
specified in Section 4will be enrolled in this study.
Participants must have confirmed HER2+ breast cancer, as determined at a CLIA -certified or 
ISO-accredited local laboratory . HER2 positivity  will be defined by  the current ASCO/CAP 
guidelines. Participant medical history  includes a thorough review of significant past medical 
history , current conditions, any  prior treatment and response to prior treatment for the 
participant’s breast cancer, and an y concomitant medications.
All measurable and evaluable lesions will be assessed and documented at Screening/Baseline 
(see Section 7.2). A contrast MRI  of the brain will be performed to evaluate for the presence 
of brain metastases (see Section 7.2.1). Participants with brain metastases at study  entry  may  
be eligible for stud y participation if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the 
conditions described in Section 7.1.1.
A phy sical examination including height (Section 7.7.4), vital signs and weight 
(Section 7.7.2), ECOG PS ( Appendix E), clinical laboratory  testing (Section 7.7.3), Contrast 
CT, PET/CT, or MRI  (Section 6.3.6), ECHO/MUG A (Section 6.3.7), ECG (Section 7.7.7.2), 
hepatitis B and C screening ( 11), biomarker evaluation (Section 7.4), and pregnancy  testing 
(Section 7.7.5) will be done at Screening/Baseline (see 11).
7.1.1.
Treatment for Brain Metastases Prior to Study Entry
Participants with brain metastases at stud y entr y may be eligible for study  participation if 
they meet the eligibility  criteria described in Sections 4.1and 4.2. In order to minimize the 
risk of sy mptomatic cerebral edema in participants with brain metastases in this study , 
participants with high -risk metastases, including those requiring immediat e local therap y, 
those with rapidly  progressing lesions, those requiring corticosteroids at the start of the study  
(>2mg of dexamethasone or equivalent per day ) for control of CNS sy mptoms, and those 
with larger untreated lesions, are excluded from the tr ial. However, if these participants are

Page 71of 132amenable to immediate CNS- directed therap y with either surgery or radiation, they may 
undergo local therapy and then be eligible for the trial. 
Immediate local therap y to the CNS may  delay  the screening process bey ond the 28 -day 
screening window, in which case the requirement for a repeat contrast MRI after completion 
of local therap y and prior to starting study treatment is as follows: 
For participants who receive brain radiotherapy during the screening period, the
original baseline contrast brain MRI  will serve as the baseline for comparison for 
further response assessments.
For participants who undergo surgical resection of brain metastases during the 
screening period, a postoperative contrast brain MRI  will be pe rformed and will 
serve as the baseline for comparison for further response assessments.
For participants with brain metastases discovered during screening or a history  of 
brain metastases, relevant MRI  brain reports and CNS treatment records should be 
obtained and available for CRF source verification. 
7.2.Response/Efficacy Assessments
Radiographic scans and additional imaging assessments (if applicable) will be performed at 
protocol -specified time points outlined in Section 6and 11, or if disease progression is 
suspected. Efficacy  assessments will be made at each time point according to RECI
ST v1.1 
(Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ; Schwartz et al, 2016 )by the investigator. 
All known sites of metastatic or locall y advanced unresectable disease should be assessed b y 
radiographic imaging at Screening/Baseline to document sites of disease and overall tumor 
burden. Imaging, preferably  by high quality  spiral contrast CT scan (with oral and/or IV 
contrast), should include the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, at a minimum; PET/CT (if high 
quality  CT scan is included) and/or MRI scan may also be done as appropriate. If a CT scan 
with contrast is contraindicated (ie, in participants with contrast allergy  or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed instead, with MRI  scans of 
the abdomen and pelvis (if an MRI  is not feasible, a non-contrast CT scan is acceptable). At 
the investigator’s discretion, other appropriate imaging (eg, photograp hy for skin lesions, 
nuclear bone scan imaging for bone lesions) should be used to assess additional known sites 
of measurable disease. The same imaging modalities employ ed in Screening/Baseline should 
be used for all subsequent response assessments during study  treatment and in the follow -up 
period, unless otherwise clinically  indicated. If any  other radiographic or assessment exam, 
including pathology  from any  on-study  biopsies or procedures, is conducted per standard of 
care, the assessment information w ill be collected in the CRF. 
In the event of equivocal progression, for example a new lesion which is small in size 
(defined as an equivocal new lesion) and no imminent threat to participant safet y, all efforts 
should be made to continue the participant w ith study  treatment until unequivocal 
progression is documented. Demonstration of an unequivocal new lesion constitutes disease 
progression.
Participants’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification. In addition, images 
will be collected b yan ICR facility  for possible future anal ysis. Copies of tumor images must

Page 72of 132be made available for review by  the sponsor (or its designee) upon request. All imaging will 
be submitted or uploaded to the I CR facility  as soon as reasonabl y possible (eg, within 
approximately  2weeks) following the date of assessment. Refer to the Study Manual for 
instructions on collecting and submitting tumor imaging studies to the ICR facility .
During the LTEP, efficacy assessments will be performed per institutional guidelines and 
investigator -determined usual and customary  clinical care.
7.2.1. Evaluation of Brain Metastases
Contrast MRI  scan of the brain will be performed for all participants at Screening/Baseline to 
assess tumor burden in the brain and/or dura and identify  particip ants with brain metastases 
at baseline. CT of the brain will not be allowed, and participants with known 
contraindications to undergoing contrast MRI imaging will be excluded from the study . 
Participants are considered to have brain metastases at baseline with an y of the following:
Any history  of brain metastases
Any brain metastases at baseline
Brain lesions of equivocal significance at baseline
Only  participants with documented brain metastases at baseline, as defined above, will 
continue to have follow -up contrast MRI s of the brain on the same schedule as non -CNS 
response assessments (Section 
6and 11). Contrast MRI s of the brain may  also be performed 
in participants without known brain metastases if there is clinical suspicion of new brain 
lesions. All participants with a history  of bra in metastases who discontinue study  treatment 
for reasons other than radiographic disease progression will have an additional contrast MRI 
of the brain at the EOT visit, unless one has been performed within 30 days of discontinuing 
study  treatment or if pr ogression in the brain has alread y been documented while on the 
study .
In participants with baseline brain lesions, at least 1 brain lesion should be included in the 
baseline RECI ST lesion selection as either a target or non
-target lesion. As an exception,
however, when unsuspected brain metastases are discovered at screening and immediate 
CNS -directed therap y is administered, treated lesions should not be selected as target lesions 
but as non-target lesions for the purpose of disease assessment b y RECI ST v 1.1. 
All brain imaging will be collected b y an ICR facility  for possible future analy sis. Copies of 
brain imaging must be made available for review by the sponsor (or its designee), upon 
request. Images will be submitted or uploaded to the I CR facility  assoon as reasonabl y 
possible (eg, within approximately  2weeks) following the date of assessment. Refer to the 
Study  Manual for instructions on collecting and submitting brain imaging studies to the I CR 
facility .
During the LTEP, brain metastases evaluatio ns will be performed per institutional guidelines 
and investigator -determined usual and customary  clinical care.
7.2.2. Isolated Progression in the Brain
In participants with isolated progression in the brain per RECI ST v1.1 (including either 
parench ymal brain or dural metastases but not skull -based or leptomeningeal metastases) and

Amendment 03, 16Oct 2024
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 73of 132does not have progression of disease outside the CNS, the participant may be eligible to 
continue on study  treatment after completion of local treatment (radiotherapy  or surgery ) to 
the brain/dural metastases to allow for clinical benefit with medical monitor approval. This 
approach approximates standard clinical practice in this clinical scenario. 
Because the primary  endpoint of the study  is cORR, every  effort should be made to avoid 
radiation or surgery  to target lesions in the brain in the absence of PD b y RECIST v1.1 unless 
clinically  necessary  in the opinion of the investigator and approval of the medical monitor. 
Target lesions, once treated with local CNS therapy, cannot be adequ ately assessed for 
subsequent response to systemic therap y. Because of this, if a participant continues on study 
therap y after local CNS treatment to a target lesion, special consideration must be given for 
evaluation of the treated target lesion and the i mpact on the overall RECI ST v1.1 assessment.
Following CNS -directed therapy  for isolated CNS disease progression, RECI ST v1.1 criteria 
would continue to measure CNS target lesions(s) if previousl y identified and used in the 
overall estimation of the sum of diameters measuring total disease burden. However, 
following treatment, measurement of the treated CNS target lesion(s) would use the 
immediate pre -CNS treatment measurement. If a subsequent decrease in the size of a treated 
CNS lesion post -treatment is s een, the immediate pre -CNS treatment longest diameter would 
be used for RECIST measurement. Should a treated CNS lesion enlarge following 
CNS -directed therap y that was identified as a target lesion, the new and larger longest 
diameter is to be used for REC IST measurement.
Additionally , treatment changes which may  mimic progression will be taken into account, 
and participants with possible “pseudo- progression” should continue on study  until 
unequivocal evidence of radiographic or clinical progression is pres ent. In the absence of 
clear evidence of PD (per RECI ST v1.1), development of CNS sy mptoms or radiographic 
changes thought to pose potential immediate risk to participant, all efforts should be made to 
continue treatment until unequivocal evidence of radio graphic progression occurs, as defined 
in RECI ST v1.1.
After discontinuing stud y treatment, participants may receive further care as determined b y 
their phy sician.
7.3.Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples will be collected in all participants at baseline, predose, and at 2 hours 
(±15 minutes) post -dose of tucatinib per the sample collection schedule provided in Table 10.
The stead y state PK of tucatinib will be assessed through the sparse sampling of the peak and 
trough levels from Cy cle 2 to Cy cle 6. PK assessment of trough levels will be performed on 
all participants on Day  1 of Cy cles 2, 3, and 6 prior to drug administration and peak level 
assessment w ill be on Day  1 of C ycles 2 and 3 at 2 hours (±15 minutes) post -tucatinib dose. 
PK samples should continue to be collected on schedule regardless of dose holds or 
interruptions. The time of tucatinib administration and PK collection will be recorded b y the
site.
For safet y lead -in participants only , an additional pharmacokinetic assessment will be 
performed at an unspecified time on Cy cle 1 Day  12. The time of the tucatinib administration 
on the morning of the visit will be recorded b y the participant. Part

7.4. Biomarker Studies
When available, archival tumor blocks are to be collected at screening. If tumor blocks are 
not available, slides may  be submitted after discussion with and approval from the medical 
monitor. HER2 expression may  be further evaluated by  multiple methods including 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC), in situ hy bridization (I SH), tissue -based next generation 
sequencing (NGS), and cell -free DNA. Additionally , tumor biopsies performed while the 
participant is on study  should be made available to the sponsor , if feasible. For example, if a 
biopsy  on residual tumor i s performed at the EOT or at progression, a sample will be 
collected (if residual tumor is available). Blood samples for biomarker assay will be drawn at 
screening, C ycle 3, Day 1 (predose), and at EOT. 
Biomarker assessments may  include an exploratory  assessment of HER2 mutations or other 
mutations as potential biomarkers of response. Additional analy ses including but not limited 
to IHC and NGS anal ysis may  be performed to interrogate biomarkers that are associated 
with tumor growth, survival and resistanc e to targeted therapeutics. This assessment may  
enable the correlation of additional biomarkers with treatment outcome and may  ultimatel y 
guide or refine participant selection strategies to better match tucatinib regimens with tumor 
phenoty pe/genot ype in t he future.
7.5.Biospecimen Repository
In the US only , for participants who provide additional consent, remaining de- identified 
unused blood and/or tissue will be retained b y Pfizer and used for future research, including 
but not limited to the evaluation of ta rgets for novel therapeutic agents, the biology  of 
sensitivity  and resistance mechanisms to targeted therapeutics, and the identification of 
biomarkers. Blood and tissue samples donated for future research will be retained for a 
period of up to 25 years. I f additional consent is not provided, any  remaining biological 
samples will be destro yed after the stud y has been completed and all applicable regulatory 
obligations have been met.

Patient- reported outcome measures will be adminis tered as specified in 11and Section 6
using the EQ -5D- 5L instrument. During study  treatment, these questionnaires must be 
completed prior to evaluation by  study  personnel (phy sical examination, review of AEs) and 
administration of study  treatment on treatment days.
7.6.1. EQ-5D- 5L – Utility Measurement
The EQ -
5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a 
generic, preference -based measure of health- related quality  of life (HR- QoL) outcomes that 
can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments (van Agt et al, 1994) . The 
EQ-5D- 5L consists of a descriptive s ystem questionnaire and the EuroQoL (EQ) visual 
analog scale (VAS; Appendix H). 
The descriptive s ystem questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression. Each dimension 
comprises 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate prob lems, severe problems, and 
extreme problems. The scores on these 5 dimensions can be presented as a health profile or 
the digits for the 5 dimensions can be converted to a 5 -digit number that describes the 
participant’s health state. The recall time frame for the descriptive s ystem is the day  in which 
the questionnaire is administered. The EQ VAS records the participant’s self -rated health 
status on a vertical VAS ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best 
imaginable health state) and can b e used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that 
reflects the participant’s own judgment. 
7.7.Safety Assessments
The assessment of safet y during the course of this study  will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs (including clinicall y significant safet y events) identified during the safet y 
lead-in stage and SAEs identified during the safety  lead -in or study  activity  assessment 
phase, ph ysical examination findings, vital signs including weight, concomitant medication, 
pregnancy  testing, and laboratory  tests. Participants will be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis. I n cases where ILD/pneumonitis is suspected, treatment with 
T-DXd will be interrupted, and the participant will undergo evaluation including 
radiographic imagin g. Pulmonary  consultation should also be considered. Dose modification 
or discontinuation of T -DXd for cases of ILD/pneumonitis will be made as per product label. 
Assessment of cardiac ejection fraction will be performed using MUGA scan or ECHO. 
Only preg nancies and SAEs will be collected by  the sponsor during the LTEP. All other 
assessments, including additional safety  assessments, will be performed per institutional 
guidelines and investigator -determined usual and customary  clinical care. Pregnancy  testi ng 
will continue as outlined in the schedule of events for participants of child -bearing potential.
Safety  will be monitored over the course of the study  by the SMC as described in 
Sections 3.1and9.3.1.9.

7.7.1.1. Definitions
Adverse Event
According to the International Council for Harmonisation (I CH) E2A guideline Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 CFR 312.32, I ND Safet y Reporting, an AE is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigational participant 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
The following information should be considered when determining whether or not to record a 
test result, medical condition, or other incident on the Adverse Events CRF:
From the time of informed consent through the day  prior to study  Day  1, only  
study  protocol -related AEs should be recorded. A protocol-related AE is defined 
as an untoward medical event occurring as a result of a protocol mandated 
procedure.
All medical conditions present or ongoing predose on study  Day  1 that increase in 
CTCAE grade should be recorded.
Medical conditions present or ongoing predose on study  Day  1 that worsen in 
severit y, increase in frequency, become related to study  intervention, or worsen in 
any other way  but do not meet the threshold for increase in CTCAE grade should 
be recorded.
All AEs (regardless of relationship to study  intervention) should be recorded from 
study  Day 1 (during and post -dose) through the end of the safet y reporting period 
(see Section 7.7.1.3). Complications that occur in association with any  procedure 
(eg, biopsy ) should be recorded as AEs whether or not the procedure was protocol 
mandated.
In general, an abnormal laboratory  value should not be recorded as an AE unless 
it is associated with clinical signs or sy mptoms, requires an intervention, results in 
a SAE, or results in study termination or interruption/discontinua tion of study  
treatment. When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory  abnormalit y, the 
resulting medical condition rather than the abnormality  itself should be recorded 
(eg, record “anemia” rather than “low hemoglobin”).
New condition detected or diagn osed after study  intervention administration, even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overd ose of either study  
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE or SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self
-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of 
sequel ae.

Page 77of 132Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments that are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the maligna ncy under study  should be 
recorded as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression 
assessed b y measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods 
should not be reported as AEs
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, ap pendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or conditi on(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
Serious Adverse Events
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria:
Fatal: AE resulted in death
Life threatening: The AEs placed the participant at immediate risk of death. This 
classification does not apply  to an AE that h ypothetically might 
cause death if it were more severe.
Hospitalization: The AE resulted in hospitalization or prolonged an existing inpatient 
hospitalization. In general, hospitalization signifies that the 
participant has been detained (usuall y involving at least an overnight 
stay) at the hospital or emergency  ward for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or outpatient setting. Hospitalizations for elective medical or 
surgical procedures or treatments planned before the signing of 
informed consent in the study  or routine check -ups are not SAEs by  
this criterion. Admission to a palliative unit or hospice care facility  
is not cons idered to be a hospitalization. Hospitalizations or 
prolonged hospitalizations for scheduled therap y of the underl ying 
cancer or stud y target disease need not be captured as SAEs. 
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication p rolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious 
criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether

considered serious.
Disabling/ 
incapacitating:An AE that resulted in a persist ent or significant incapacity  or 
substantial disruption of the participant’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, 
sprained ankle), that may interfere with or prevent every day life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
Congenital 
anomaly  or birth 
defect:An adverse outcome in a child or fetu s of a participant exposed to 
the molecule or study treatment regimen before conception or during 
pregnancy .
Medically  
significant:The AE did not meet any of the above criteria, but could have 
jeopardized the participant and might have required medical o r 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above or 
involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an 
infectious agent. Potential drug -induced liver injury  (DILI) also is 
considered a medicall y significant event (see Section 7.7.1.2 for the 
definition of potential DILI.)
Adverse Event Severity
AE severit y should be graded using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology  
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI  CTCAE), version 5.0. These criteria are provided in the 
study  manual.
AE severit y and seriousness are assessed independently . ‘Severit y’ characterizes the intensity  
of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory  definition and serves as a guide to the sponsor for defining 
regulatory  reporting obligations (see definition for SAEs, above).
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment
The relationship of each AE to each stud y treatment (tucatinib or T -DXd) should be 
evaluated b y the investigator using the following criteria:
Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the AE, such as:
A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be 
strongl y associated with drug expos ure (eg, angioedema, hepatic 
injury , Stevens- Johnson Sy ndrome)

Page 79of 132One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly  
associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the 
population exposed to the drug (eg, tendon rupture)
Unrelated: Another cause of the AE is more plausible (eg, due to underl ying 
disease or occurs commonly  in the study  population), or a temporal 
sequence cannot be established with the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study  treatment, or a causal relationship is 
consi dered biologicall y implausible
If the investigator does not know whether or not the study  intervention caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to study  intervention” for reporting purposes, as defined 
by the sponsor. In addition, if t he investigator determines that an SAE is associated with 
study  procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source 
documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the PSSA and 
in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) can be any serious or non -serious AE that is of 
scientific or medical concern as defined b y the sponsor and specific to the program, for 
which ongoi ng monitoring and rapid communication to the sponsor may  be appropriate. 
During the LTEP, only  AESI s that meet SAE criteria will be reported to the sponsor using 
the PSSA and will not be recorded within the CRF.
AESI s for this study  are:
Diarrhea
o≥Grade 3 diarrhea
oGrade 2 diarrhea with concomitant Grade 2 nausea and/or vomiting 
Hepatotoxicity : Any  of the following t ypes of LFT elevations:
oAST or ALT elevations that are >3 ×ULN with concurrent elevation 
(within 21 days of AST and/or ALT elevations) of tot al bilirubin 
>2×ULN, except in participants with documented Gilbert’s sy ndrome 
oAST or ALT elevations > 20 ×ULN
oBilirubin elevations > 10 ×ULN
Measurement of direct and indirect bilirubin should be considered in cases of 
hyperbilirubinemia to assist in de termination of its etiology . The sponsor will 
subsequently  determine whether the elevations are associated with other 
possible causes of aminotransferase elevation and hy perbilirubinemia, such as 
viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease , or the administration 
of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

Participants should be advised to immediately  report cough, d yspnea, fever, and/or 
any new or worsening respiratory  symptoms. Treating ph ysicians should monitor 
participants for signs and sy mptoms of ILD/pneumonitis and promptly  investigate for 
any evidence of ILD/pneumonitis. The evaluation of participants with suspected 
ILD/pneumonitis should include radiographic imaging.
See Section 5.5.3.3 for dose modification guidelines and Appendix Ffor 
ILD/pneumonitis evaluation and treatment guidelines. See Appendix Gfor potential 
conditions that can trigger potential ILD. 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) decrease
The following 2 types of LVEF decrease are considered AESIs:
oAn as ymptomatic decline in L VEF leading to a change in study  treatment 
or discontinuation of study  treatment. Use the term “ejection fraction 
decreased” and seve rity Grades 2 to 4 to report asy mptomatic LVEF 
decrease. 
oSymptomatic CHF. Use the term “heart failure” and severit y Grades 2 to 5 
to report s ymptomatic CHF. 
7.7.1.2. Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events
Investigator and stud y personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during 
participant questioning, discovered during ph ysical examination, laboratory testing and/or 
other means b y recording them on the CRF and/or reporting through the PSSA, as 
appropriate. Refer to Appendix Jfor guidance on recording/reporting AEs and SAEs.
During the LTEP, pregnancies and SAEs will be reported to the sponsor using the P SSA and 
will not be recorded within the CRF.
Eliciting Adverse Events
An open -ended or non- directed method of questioning should be used at each study  visit to 
elicit the reporting of AEs.
Recording Adverse Events
The following information should be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF:
Description including onset and resolution dates
Whether it met SAE criteria
Severity
Relationship to study  treatment or other causality
Outcome
Diagnosis vs. Signs or Symptoms

Page 81of 132In general, the use of a unify ing diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual 
symptoms. Grouping of sy mptoms into a diagnosis should only  be done if each component 
sign and/or s ymptom is a medically  confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by  
standard medical textbooks. If an y aspect of a sign or sy mptom does not fit into a classic 
pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate adverse event.
Important exceptions for this study  are adverse reactions associated with the infusion of 
study  intervention. Record each sign or s ymptom as an individual AE in addition to the I RR 
term. If multiple signs or sy mptoms occur with a given infusion -related event, each sign or 
symptom should be recorded separatel y with its level of severit y. 
Recording Serious Adverse Events
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the CRF and  report to Pfizer Safety  using the PSSA.
The following should be considered when recording SAEs:
Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
reported to Pfizer Safet y using the PS SA.
For hospitalizations, surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself. The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken
in response to the illness.
Progression of Underlying Malignancy
Since progression of underly ing malignancy  is being assessed as an efficacy  variable, it 
should not be reported as an AE or SAE. The terms “Disease Progression”, “Progression of 
Disease”, or “Malignant disease progression” and other similar terms should not be used to 
describe an AE or SAE. However, clinical s ymptoms of progression may  be reported as AEs 
or SAEs if the sy mptom cannot be determined as exclusively  due to progression of the 
unde rlying malignancy  or does not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease 
under study . In addition, complications from progression of the underl ying malignancy  
should be reported as AEs or SAEs.
Environmental Exposure, Exposure During Pregnancy , and Occupational Exposure
Environmental exposure occurs when a person not enrolled in the study as a participant 
receives unplanned direct contact with or exposure to the study intervention. Such exposure 
may or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE or SAE. Persons at risk for environmental 
exposure include healthcare providers, famil y members, and others who may be exposed. An 
environmental exposure may  include EDP, EDB, and occupational exposure.
Any such exposure to the study  intervention under study are reportable to Pfizer Safet y 
within 24 hours of investigator awareness. Refer to Table 12 inAppendix Jfor guidance on 
reporting/recording environmental exposure.

Page 82of 132An EDP occurs if: 
A participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study  
intervention. 
A participant who is receiving or has discontinued study  intervention inseminates 
a partner. 
A nonparticipant is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been 
exposed to study  intervention because of environmental exposure. Below are 
examples of environmental EDP: 
A family  member or healthcare provider reports that they  are pregnant after 
exposure to study  interve ntion, for example, by  ingestion or skin contact.
A family  member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study  
intervention, for example, by  ingestion or skin contact and then inseminates 
their partner prior to or around the time of conception.
The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted 
should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to
termination of pregnancy ).Refer to Table 12in Appendix Jfor guidance on 
reporting/recording EDP.
If EDP occurs in a participant/participant’s partner after the start of stud y 
intervention and until 7 months after the last dose of the last study  intervention, 
the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safet y via PSSA, regardless 
of whether an SAE has occurred.
If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must 
report information to Pfizer Safety via PSSA. Since the exposure information 
does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , the information is not 
recorded on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed PSSA is maintained in the 
investigator site file.
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outc ome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP. I n the case of a live birth, the struct ural integrity  of the neonate 
can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrit y of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).

the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnanc y, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal 
demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to 
Pfizer Safety  as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion should be 
reported as an SAE;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causalit y, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be 
reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or 
possibly  related to exposure to the study  intervention. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  the sponsor. Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to their partner. The investigator must document in the source documents 
that the par ticipant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to 
their partner.
Exposure During Breastfeeding
An EDB occurs if: 
A participant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after discontinuing study  
intervention. 
A nonparticipant is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been 
exposed to study  intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of 
environmental EDB is a family  member or healthcare provider who reports 
breastfeeding after having been exposed to study  interventi on by  ingestion or skin 
contact. 
The investigator must report EDB to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported 
using the PSSA. When EDB occurs in the settin g of environmental exposure, the exposure 
information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not 
recorded on a CRF. However, a cop y of the completed PSSA is maintained in the 
investigator site file.
Occupational Exposure
The investigator must report any  instance of occupational exposure to Pfizer Safet y within 
24 hours of the investigator’s awareness using the PSSA regardless of whether there is an

a participant enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  
of the completed PSSA must be maintained in the investigator site file.
Lack of Efficacy
The investigator must report signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of 
efficacy . Lack of efficacy  or failure of expected pharmacological action is reportable to 
Pfizer Safety  only if associated with an SAE. 
Potential Drug- induced Liver Injury
Hy’s Law can be used to estimate severit y and the likelihood that a study intervention may 
cause an increased incidence of severe hepatotoxicity .
The absence of hepatotoxicity  in clinical trials provides a limited predictive value for 
potential DILI in the clinical setting(s) being studie d. However, finding 1 Hy ’s Law case in 
clinical trials is ominous; finding 2 cases is highl y predictive of a potential for severe DILI.
Definition
Briefl y, potential Hy’s Law cases include the following 3 components:
1. Aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) eleva tion >3 x ULN
AND
2. Total bilirubin >2 x UL N, without initial findings of cholestasis (ie, elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase),
AND
3.No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of aminotransferase elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limite d to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or 
acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
Reporting Requirements
Any potential Hy’s Law case should be handled as a serious adverse event (SAE) and 
reported promptly to the sponsor .
Reporting should include all available information and should initiate close follow -up until 
complete resolution of the problem and completion of all attempts to obtain supplementary  
data.
Follow -up for Abnormal Laboratory Results Suggestin g Potential DILI
In general, an increase of serum ALT or AST to >3 x ULN should be followed by  repeat 
testing within 48 to 72 hours of serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, 
to confirm the abnormalities and to determine whether they  areworsening.

7.7.1.3. Reporting Periods for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The safet y reporting period for all AEs and SAEs is from study  Day  1 (predose) through 
30days after the last study  treatment. However, all study  protocol -related AEs are to be 
recorded from the time of informed consent.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek information on AEs or SAEs after the 
participant has concluded study  participation. However, if the investigator learns of any  SAE, 
including a death, at an y time after a participant has concluded stud y participatio n, and they  
consider the event to be reasonabl y related to the study  intervention, the investigator must 
promptly  report the SAE to Pfizer using PSSA.
SAEs will be followed until significant changes return to baseline, the event stabilizes 
(recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically significant b y the investigator, or 
the participant dies or withdraws consent. All non- serious AEs will be followed through the 
safet y reporting period. Certain non -serious AEs of interest may  be followed until resolution, 
return to baseline, or study closure. 
If a participant begins a new anticancer therap y, the recording period for nonserious AEs 
ends at the time the new treatment is started. SAEs occurring during the safety  reporting 
period mu st still be reported to Pfizer Safety  irrespective of an y intervening treatment. Note 
that a switch to a commercially  available version of the study  intervention is considered as a 
new anticancer therap y for purposes of SAE reporting.
7.7.1.4. Serious Adverse Event s Require Immediate Reporting
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the safety reporting period are reported to Pfizer 
Safety  via the PSSA immediatel y upon awareness and under no circumstance should this 
exceed 24 hours. The investigator will submit a ny updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 
hours of its being available.
For initial SAE reports, available case details are to be reported to Pfizer Safety  using the 
PSSA. At a minimum, the following should be included:
Participant number
Date of event onset
Description of the event
Study  treatment, if known
Investigator causality  assessment
An investigator who receives suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) or 
other specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the SRSD(s) for the study  and will notify the I RB/EC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements.

respiratory  rate, and pulse oximetry .
7.7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests
Local laboratory  testing will include institutional standard tests for evaluating safet y and 
making cl inical decisions. The following laboratory  assessments will be performed to 
evaluate safet y at scheduled time points (see 11) during the course of the study :
The serum chemistry  panel is to include the following tests: bicarbonate, blood 
urea nitrogen, calcium, creatinine, chloride, glucose, magnesium, phosphorus, 
potassium, and sodium 
LFTs include albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, tot al bilirubin (and both 
direct and indirect bilirubin when total bilirubin is >ULN), and total protein
The CBC with differential is to include, but is not limited to, the following tests: 
white blood cell count with 5 -part differential (neutrophils, ly mphocy tes, 
monocy tes, eosinophils, and basophils), platelet count, hemoglobin, and 
hematocrit. 
The coagulation panel is to include the following tests: international normalized 
ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), and part
ial thromboplastin time (PTT) or 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
The eGFR should be calculated using the MDRD equation, with serum creatinine 
(Scr) reported in mg/dL. 
GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (Scr)–1.154x (Age)–0.203x (0.742 if female) x 
(1.212 if African American)
A serum or urine β -hCG pregnancy  test for participants of childbearing potential
Following implementation of Amendment 3, local laboratory  testing with the exception of 
pregnancy  testing will be performed per institutional gu idelines and investigator -determined

when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected) and at the end of the study .
Participants with false positive results and documented verification that the participant is not 
pregnant are eligible for study  participation. Similarly , participants with false positive results 
that develop during study treatment are allowed to continue treatment with documented 
verification that the participant is not pregnant.
After the last dose of study  treatment, pregnancy  tests will be performed once a month for 
7months. Participants may do monthl y home pregnancy  tests and report interim results at 
long term follow -up visits. Pregnancy  tests may  also be repeated as requested per IRB/IEC or 
if required b y local regulations.
During the LTEP, pregnancy  reporting should c ontinue per protocol and pregnancy  should be 
reported to the sponsor per guideline under EDP in Section 7.7.1.2. 
7.7.6. Interstitial Lung Disease
ILD and pneumonitis, inclu ding fatal cases, have been reported with T -DXd in clinical 
studies. Evaluate participants with suspected ILD/pneumonitis by  radiographic imaging. If a 
participant is suspected or diagnosed as having ILD, the investigator should consult with a 
pulmonologis
t as needed, and the participant will be treated appropriatel y. T-DXd dosing 
will be interrupted until drug induced pulmonary  toxicity  can be ruled out. Please see Section 
5.5.3.3 for dose modification guidelines and Appendix Ffor ILD/pneumonitis evaluation and 
treatment guidelines. See Appendix Gfor potential conditions that can trigger potential ILD. 
7.7.7. Cardiac Function
7.7.7.1. MUGA or ECHO
Assessment of cardiac ejection fraction will be performed b y MUGA or ECHO at screening 
and at least once every  12weeks thereafter (as determined b y the date of Cycle 1 Day 1), and 
at the EOT visit (if not done within the previous 12 weeks). If there is an interim assessment, 
subsequent cardiac ECHO or MUGA should be performed every  12weeks as determined by  
the date of the most recent interim assessment. The modality  chosen in screening should be 
used for all subsequent cardiac assessments throughout the study  for comparison. During the 
LTEP, cardiac function asse ssments will be performed per institutional guidelines and 
investigator -determined usual and customary  clinical care.
7.7.7.2. Electrocardiogram
ECGs will be performed at screening. To correct for heart rate, QT intervals should be 
calculated using the Fridericia f ormula (QTcF). During the LTEP, ECG assessments will be 
performed per institutional guidelines and investigator- determined usual and customary  
clinical care.
7.8.Appropriateness of Measurements
Response will be assessed according to RECI ST v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ; Schwartz et al, 
2016) which are standardized criteria for evaluating response in solid tumors. The intervals 
of evaluation in this protocol are considered appropriate for disease management.

9.2.Study Endpoint Definitions
9.2.1. Objective Response Rate
ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR), per RECI ST v1.1. Participants who do not have at least 2 (initial 
response and confirmation scan) post-baseline response assessments as described in 
Section 7.2of the protocol will be counted as non -responders. ORR per investigator and per 
ICR are based on investigator response assessments and I CR response assessments, 
respectivel y.
9.2.2. Progression -free Survival
PFS is defined as the time from start of stud y treatment to first documentation of tumor 
progression (PD per RECI ST v1.1), or to death due to any  cause, whichever comes first. 
Participants wi thout documentation of progression or death at the time of analy sis will be 
censored at the date of the last disease assessment with an overall response of CR, PR, stable 
disease (SD) or non- CR/non -PD. If there is no radiographic post-baseline tumor assessment, 
PFS will be censored at the date of treatment initiation. PFS per investigator and per ICR are 
based on investigator response assessments and ICR response assessments, respectivel y.
Detailed methodology , including handling rules for missing assessmen ts and censoring 
approaches for the anal ysis of PFS, will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan (SAP).
9.2.3. Duration of Response
DOR is defined as the time from first documentation of objective response (CR or PR, that is 
subsequently  confirmed) to the f irst documentation of disease progression per RECI ST v1.1 
or death from an y cause, whichever occurs earlier. Only participants with an objective 
response will be included in the anal ysis of DOR. DOR per investigator and per ICR are 
based on investigator re sponse assessments and ICR response assessments, respectivel y.
9.2.4. Disease Control Rate
DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed CR, PR or stable disease 
(SD or non
-CR/non -PD) according to RECI ST v1.1. DCR per investigator and per ICR ar e 
based on investigator response assessments and ICR response assessments, respectivel y.

OS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to death due to an y cause. For a 
participant who is not known to have died b y the end of study fol low-up, observation of OS 
is censored on the date the participant was last known to be alive (ie, the date of last contact). 
Participants lacking data bey ond the day  of treatment initiation will have their survival time 
censored on the date of treatment initiation (ie, OS duration of 1 day ).
9.2.6. Exploratory Endpoints
9.2.6.1.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
PK parameters for tucatinib will be evaluated.
9.2.6.2. Biomarker Analysis
Relationships of biomarker parameters (eg, baseline values, absolute and relative changes 
from baseline) to efficacy , safet y, and PK parameters may be explored. Relationships and 
associated data that are determined to be of interest will be summarized. Details will be 
described separatel y in the SAP or biomarker analysis plan (BAP).
9.2.6.3. Patient -reported Outcomes
Change from baseline in PRO assessments of the EQ -5D- 5L.
9.3. Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical and anal ytical plans presented below summarize the more complete plans to be 
detailed in the SAP. The SAP may  modify  what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; 
however, an y major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their anal yses will 
also be reflected in the protocol amendment. 
9.3.1. General Considerations
Tabular summaries will be presented b y cohort, unless otherwise specified. In general, 
summary  tabulations will display  the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and the number and percent 
(ofnon-missing) per category  for categorical data. 
Unless otherwise speci fied, CI s will be calculated at 2 -sided 95% level.
The 2 -
sided 95% exact CI using Clopper- Pearson method ( Clopper & Pearson, 1934) will be 
calculated for the response rates where applicable (eg, ORR). 
For time -to-event endpoints, the median survival time will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method; the associated 95% CI will be calculated based on the complementary  
log-log transformation (Collett, 1994 ).  
9.3.1.1. Randomization and Blinding
This is a single arm and open-label stud y. Randomization and blinding will not be performed.
9.3.1.2. Adjustments for Covariates

who (1) had a baseline disease assessment, (2) received study  treatment, and (3) had at least 
1post-baseline assessment or discontinued treatment due to PD, clinical progression, 
toxicity , or death. The analy ses of ORR, DCR and DOR will use the response -evaluable 
analysis set.
Additional analy sis sets of participants may  be defined in the SAP.
9.3.1.8. Examination of Subgroups
As exploratory  anal yses, subgroup anal yses may  be conducted for selected endpoints. The 
subgroups and detailed methodology will be provided in the SAP.
9.3.1.9. Timing of Analyses
A safet y anal ysis will be undertaken b y the SMC when the first 10 treated participants have 
been followed for at least 1 cycle (safet y lead -in stage). The SMC will undertake similar 
analyses if alternative tucatinib and/or T-DXd dose levels or schedules are evaluated in 
additional safet y lead -in stage(s). Once the safet y lead-in stage is completed, the SMC will 
evaluate the sa fety of the study  regimen throughout the remainder of the study . 
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be then undertaken when approximately  
60response -evaluable participants have been treated at the SMC recommended dose and 
followed for at least 6 months.

10.1.7. Use of Medical Records
There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by  
Pfizer Safety , where ethically  and scientifically  justified and permitted by  local regulations, 
to ensure partic ipant safety .
Due to the potential for a participant to be reidentified from their medical records, the 
following actions must be taken when medical records are sent to the sponsor or sponsor 
designee:
The investigator or site staff must redact personal information from the medical 
record. The personal information includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
participant names or initials, participant dates (eg, birth date, date of hospital 
admission/discharge, date of death), participant identification n umbers (eg, Social 
Security  number, health insurance number, medical record number, 
hospital/institution identifier), participant location information (eg, street address, 
city, country , postal code, I P address), and participant contact information (eg, 
telephone/fax number, email address).
Each medical record must be transmitted to the sponsor or sponsor designee using 
systems with technical and organizational security  measures to ensure the protection 
of personal data (eg, Florence is the preferred s ystemif available). 
There may  be unplanned situations where the sponsor may  request medical records 
(eg, sharing medical records so that the sponsor can provide study -related advice to 
the investigator). The medical records should be submitted according to th e procedure 
described above.
10.1.8. Study and Site Start and Closure
The study  start date is the date of the first site activation.
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study  site or terminate the study  at any  
time for an y reason at the sole discr etion of the sponsor, including (but not limited to) 
regulatory  authorit y decision, change in opinion of the I RB/EC, or change in benefit -
risk 
assessment. Study  sites will be closed upon study completion. A study  site is considered 
closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been collected and a study -site 
closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may  initiate study -site closure at any  time upon notification to the sponsor 
or designee if requested to do so by  the responsible I RB/EC o r if such termination is required 
to protect the health of study participants.

Page 103of 132Reasons for the earl y closure of a stud y site b y the sponsor may include but are not limited 
to:
Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the
IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or the ICH GCP 
guidelines;
Inadequate recruitment of participants by  the investigator;
Discontinuation of further study  intervention development.
If the stud y is prematurely terminated or suspe nded, the sponsor shall promptly  inform the 
investigators, the ECs/IRBs, the regulatory  authorities, and any  CRO(s) used in the study  of 
the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by  the applicable regulatory  
requirements. The investigator shall promptly  inform the participant and should assure 
appropriate participant therap y and/or follow -up.
Study  termination is also provided for in the clinical study  agreement. If there is any  conflict 
between the contract and this protocol, the contract will control as to termination rights.
10.1.9. Publication Policy
For multicenter trials, the primary  publication will be a joint publication developed b y the 
investigator and Pfizer reporting the primary  endpoint(s) of the study  covering all study  sites. 
The investig ator agrees to refer to the primary  publication in any  subsequent publications. 
Pfizer will not provide any financial compensation for the investigator’s participation in the 
preparation of the primary congress abstract, poster, presentation, or primary ma nuscript for 
the study . 
Investigators are free to publish individual center results that they  deem to be clinically  
meaningful after publication of the overall results of the study  or 12 months after primary  
completion date or stud y completion at all sites, whichever occurs first, subject to the other 
requirements described in this section.
The investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity  to review any  proposed publication or 
any other t ype of disclosure of the stud y results (collectively , “publicat ion”) before it is 
submitted or otherwise disclosed and will submit all publications to Pfizer 30 days before 
submission. If an y patent action is required to protect intellectual propert y rights, the 
investigator agrees to delay  the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 day s 
upon request from Pfizer. This allows Pfizer to protect proprietary  information and to provide 
comments, and the investigator will, on request, remove an y previousl y undisclosed 
confidential information before disclosur e, except for an y stud y-intervention or Pfizer -related 
information necessary  for the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the
study  results. For joint publications, should there be disagreement regarding interpretation 
and/or presentatio n of specific anal ysis results, resolution of, and responsibility  for, such 
disagreements will be the collective responsibility  of all authors of the publication.

inhibitors of a given metabolic pathw ay in clinical DDI studies. Moderate sensitive substrates are drugs that 
demonstrate an increase in AUC of ≥2 to <5 -fold with strong index inhibitors of a given metabolic pathway 
in clinical DDI studies. Sensitive substrates of CYP3A with ≥10- fold increase in AUC by co -administration 
of strong index inhibitors are shown above the dashed line. Other elimination pathways may also contribute 
to the elimination of the substrates listed in the tab le above and should be considered w hen assessing the 
drug interaction potential.

Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 or 4
Work -up If a patient develops radiographic changes potentially consistent with ILD/pneumonitis or develops an acute onset of new or 
worsening pulmonary or other related signs/symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or fever, rule out ILD/pneumonitis
Evaluations should include:
–High resolution CT
–Pulmonologist consultation (Infectious Disease consultation as clinically indicated)
–Blood culture and CBC. Other blood tests could be considered as needed
–Consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if clinically indicated and feasible
–Pulmonary function tests and pulse oximetry
–Arterial blood gases if clinically indicated
–One blood sample collection for PK analysis as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected, if feasible
If the AE is confirmed to have an etiology other t han treatment -related ILD/pneumonitis, follow routine clinical practice
If another etiology for the AE cannot be identified and it could be related to T -DXd, then follow the ILD/pneumonitis 
management guidance as outlined below
All events of ILD/pneumonitis, regardless of severity or seriousness, should be followed until resolution
Dose 
modificationThe administration of T -DXd must be 
interrupted
T-DXd can be restarted only if the event is 
fully resolved:
–If resolved in ≤28 days from day of onset, 
maintain dose.
–If resolved in >28 days from day of onset, 
reduce dose by 1 level
–However, if the event Grade 1 ILD/pneumonitis 
occurs beyond cycle Day 22 and has not 
resolved within 49 days from the last infusion, 
the drug should be discontinuedPermanently discontinue patient 
from T -DXd treatmentPermanently discontinue patient

Acceptable methods for highly effective birth control (preventing conception)
Participants who are of childbearing potentialaor whose partners are of childbearing potentialaand 
who are sexually active in a way that could lead to pregnancy m ay choose any TWO of the following 
methods (please see acceptable combinations below):
●Hormonal methods of contraception (excluding progestin -only pills; method must be associated w ith 
inhibition of ovulation), unless contraindicated
●Intrauterine device with failure rate <1%
●Tubal ligation
●Vasectomy (at least 90 days from the date of surgery with a semen analysis documenting azoospermia)
●Barrier method (male or female condom with or without spermicide, cervical cap with or without 
spermicide, diaphragm with or w ithout spermicide)b
aSee Section 4.4 for the definition of a person of childbearing potential.  
bA barrier method should only be used w ith a highly effective birth control method that is not a barrier 
method. Barrier methods alone, including a double -barrier method, are not considered highly effective 
contraceptive measures (see unacceptable methods of contraception).
Acceptable combinations of contraceptive m ethods: 
●Horm onal method and vasectomy
●Hormonal method and barrier method
●Intrauterine device and vasectomy
●Intrauterine device and barrier method
●Tubal ligation and vasectomy
●Tubal ligation and barrier method
Acceptable methods for preventing secondary exposure to seminal fluid
Participants born m ale and who are sexually active with a pregnant person must use a m ale condom 
(even if the subject participant has had a vasectom y).
Participants born m ale and who are sexually active with a breastfeeding person must use a male 
condom  (even if the subject participant has had a vasectom y). In addition, it is recommended that the 
breastfeeding partner use a highly effective fem ale contraceptive m ethod as listed in the section titled 
“Acceptable com binations of contraceptive m ethods”.

Page 126of 132Unacceptable methods of contraception
●Periodic abstinence ●Sperm icide only
●No m ethod ●Progestin -only pills
●Withdraw al ●Concomitant use of female and male condoms
●Rhythm ●Barrier methods alone, including double -barrier methods
For the purposes of this guidance, complete abstinence, if consistent with the participant’s 
preferred lifesty le, is an acceptable form of contraception. Complete abstinence is defined as 
abstinence starting from the time of informed consent and continuing throughout the study  
and until the end of s ystemic exposure (at least 7 months for participants of childbearing 
potential and 4 months for participants who can father children after the final dose of study  
intervention; see Section 4.1).

RECORDING and REPORTING
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording AEs on the CRF and for 
reporting SAEs via PSSA to Pfizer Safety throughout the safet y reporting period. These 
requirements are delineated for 3 t ypes of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious AEs; and (3) 
exposure to the study  intervention under stud y during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposure.

Environme ntal or 
occupational exposure to 
the product under stud y to 
a non -participant (not 
involving EDP or EDB)None. Exposure to a study 
non-participant is not 
collected on the CRFThe exposure (whether or not 
there is an associated AE or 
SAE) must be reported***
* EDP (with or w ithout an associated SAE) is reported to Pfizer Safety via PSSA. 
**EDB is reported to Pfizer Safety via PSSA, which w ould also include details of any SAE that might be 
associated with the EDB. 
***Environmental or occupationa l exposure: AEs or SAEs associated with occupational exposure are 
reported to Pfizer Safety via PSSA.
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records to Pfizer Safety  in lieu of completion of the Report Form/AE or SAE 
CRF page.

requested b yPfizer Safety . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception 
of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records 
before submission to Pfizer Safet y. 
SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via an electronic DCT
The primary  mechanism for reporting an SAE to Pfizer Safety  will be the electronic 
DCT (PSSA).
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE report 
form (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic DCT (PSSA) or paper form (as 
applicable) as soon as the data become available.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic DCT will be taken off -line 
to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic DCT has been taken off -line, 
then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section ) or to 
Pfizer Safety  by telephone.
SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via the CT SAE Report Form
Facsimile transmission of the CT SAE Report Form is the backup method to transmit 
this information to Pfizer Safety  in case PSSA is unavailable for more than 24 h ours.
In circumstances when the facsimile is not working, an alternative method should be 
used, eg, secured (Transport Lay er Securit y) or password -protected email. If none of 
these methods can be used, notification by  telephone is acceptable with a copy  ofthe 
CT SAE Report Form sent by  overnight mail or courier service.
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the CT SAE Report Form pages within the designated reporting 
time frames.

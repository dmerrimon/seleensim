2.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
       
The efficacy of aromatase inhibitors (AI) in the treatment of postmenopausal women with 
hormone receptor positive, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is undisputed. In this regard, 
prior randomized clinical trials have documented the superiority of exemestane (EXE) 
over tamoxifen, as first line therapy [1] and the superiority of EXE over megestrol 
acetate, as second line therapy after tamoxifen failure [2]. Prior phase II studies have also 
documented the efficacy of EXE in the treatment of MBC after failure of several lines of 
prior hormonal therapies [3], including prior exposure to nonsteroidal AIs [4, 5]. While 
the utility of EXE has been proven with respect to several important clinical indicators 
(e.g. response rate, time to progression, median survival time and median duration of 
response), eventually all patients will develop disease progression due to the development 
of acquired resistance to further treatment. In addition, as has recently been reported, 
some pa
tients with breast cancer may derive less than maximal benefit from AI therapy 
due to noncompliance because of musculoskeletal-related adverse effects [6, 7]. The aim 
of this research proposal, therefore, is to determine whether there may be an effective 
strategy to delay the time to development of resistance to EXE in the treatment of MBC, 
while minimizing potential toxicities and ensuring patient compliance with treatment. 
 
In order to achieve our study objectives, we propose a phase II pilot, 
translational trial incorporating the use of intermittent EXE therapy in the 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 6 treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive MBC. The 
rationale for this trial stems from preclinical data derived at the City of Hope, in 
the labo ratory of our collaborator, Dr. Shiuan Chen (Figure 1). As Dr. Chen’s 
research interests have been in identifying mechanisms of AI resistance, he has 
generated a unique research tool, MCF-7aro, an estrogen receptor positive 
br
east cancer cell line in which aromatase is over-expressed [8,9]. Using this 
c
ell line, it was demonstrated that continuous exposure to EXE initially 
inhibited cell growth, indicative of the sensitivity of this cell line to treatment. 
With prolonged, continuous exposure to EXE, however, cells eventually 
resumed growth after 6-8 weeks of treatment, reflecting the gradual 
development of acquired resistance to further treatment. In contrast, in cells 
exposed to intermittent treatment with EXE, either on a schedule of 1 week 
on/1week off, 2 weeks on/1 week off or 3 weeks on/1 week off, sensitivity to 
g
rowth inhibition by EXE was maintained beyond 12 weeks. These data suggest 
that the scheduling of EXE therapy may influence the clinical efficacy of this AI 
in the treatment of MBC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While molecular mechanisms underlying this observation of delayed resistance 
a
re not yet fully elucidated,  a clinical trial of intermittent EXE therapy in the 
treatment of MBC, is supported by both anecdotal clinical reports, as well as 
data derived from other laboratories. Clinical case reports have documented, for 
example, that patients with MBC can demonstrate regression of disease in 
response to withdrawal of antiestrogen treatments [10, 11 ]. This effect is 
presumed to result from of an adaptive hypersensitivity to low estrogen levels 
which over time, can lead to a paradoxical inhibitory effect of estrogen on 
breast cancer cell growth. A similar phenomenon has also been observed in 
vitro  in that in LTED cells (i.e., MCF-7 breast cancer cells cultured under 
conditions of long-term estrogen deprivation), exposure to estrogen results in 
growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis [12]. In this regard, the current 
standard method of continuous daily dosing of EXE may not be as effective in 
inhibiting breast cancer cell growth, as sequencing intermittent periods of EXE

Version: 11 7 withdrawal. Moreover , in vitro  and mouse xenograft  models have shown that  
reversal of resistance to tamoxifen can be achieved with the administration of  
estrogen [13,14], suggesting that  in patients with advanced, hormone receptor 
posi
tive breast cancer, resistance to anti-estrogen therapy may possibly be 
delayed by allowing intermittent periods of exposure to low levels of estrogen. 
An alternative hypothesis to account for the development of acquired resistance 
to EXE is the recent finding of elevated expression of the epidermal growth 
factor (EGF)-like protein, amphiregulin (AREG), in MCF-7 aro cells treated 
c
ontinuously with 1μmol/L of EXE. As AREG binds to the EGF receptor, it is 
postulated that AREG may mediate the development of acquired resistance to 
EXE via activation of EGFR and MAPK, leading to cell proliferation. As such, 
it is possible that intermittent withdrawal of EXE may also delay the 
development of acquired endocrine resistance due to diminished expression of 
AREG [15 ]. In addition to the potential beneficial effects of intermittent EXE 
therapy in terms of prolongation of time to drug resistance, this new method of 
drug scheduling may also allow improvements of other clinically important 
endpoints, such as better quality of life due to reduced exposure to drug-related 
toxicities. 
  
To c
orrelate with observations obtained in cell culture (i.e. that intermittent 
EXE therapy delays the time to re-growth of MCF-7aro breast cancer cells), the 
selected primary endpoint of this study will be progression free survival (PFS), 
although other clinically meaningful endpoints, such as objective response rates 
and clinical benefit will also be measured. That PFS correlates with acquired 
resistance to treatment is exemplified by prior clinical trials in which it was 
shown tha
t as first line therapy, median duration of response to EXE was 
r
eported as 10 months [1]. However, as second [2] and third [3] line therapies, 
ti
me to tumor progression was reported as 20.3 weeks and 2 months, 
re
spectively. In other clinical trials in which EXE was used after multiple lines 
of
 prior endocrine therapy (≥ 2), including use of prior non-steroidal AIs, time 
to t
umor progression ranged between 14.7 weeks  to 3.7 months [4,5,16]. In 
view
 of these previously reported data and in consideration of the desire to be 
able to complete this study in a timely manner, we have chosen to measure PFS 
at 4 m
onths as a benchmark for comparison (10 months  for first line patients, 
se
e statistical considerations) and as such, have incorporated eligibility criteria 
to re
flect the patient population from which these historical data were obtained 
[5,16]. The rationale for inclusion of this study population was also derived in 
c
onsideration of the hypothesis that after long-term estrogen deprivation of 
hormone
 receptor positive breast cancer cells in vitro , (presumed to be clinically 
equivalent to long-term exposure to anti-estrogens), estrogen may actually 
induce apoptosis [12 ]. 
 
 
3.0  TREATMENT PLAN  
 
3.1  Study Design  
 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 8 In order to test the study hypothesis that intermittent EXE may delay the time to 
development of acquired resistance, a pilot, phase II  clinical trial will be 
conducted in which all study participants will receive treatment with  EXE.   
 
3.2 Treatment Dosage and Schedule  
 
As is currently recommended, the standard approved dose of EXE is 25 mg 
orally per day, after a meal. Absorption of EXE is rapid, and after peak plasma 
leve
ls are reached, plasma levels of EXE decline in a polyexponential manner, 
resulting in a terminal half life of approximately 24 hours. Given these 
pha
rmacokinetic properties and in consideration of convenience/ease of dosing, 
a 21-day treatment cycle, consisting of a schedule of 2 weeks on (consecutive 
da
ily dosing of 25 mg of EXE from Days 1-14), followed by 1 week off 
(c
essation of dosing from Days 15-21), will be used. 
 
 
3.3 Concurrent Treatment  
 
 Bisphosphonates 
  
Concurrent bisphosphonates for the treatment of bone metastases will be  
permitted. In addition, throughout the study, concomitant medications deemed 
ne
cessary for the supportive care of patients will be given at physician 
discretion. 
 
 Radiation  
  
Subjects with measurable disease per RECIST criteria, who require palliative 
radiation to a non-target lesion, will be permitted to receive treatment without 
being considered as having disease progression. However, patients with 
measurable disease who require radiation to a target lesion will be considered as 
having disease progression and will be removed from study. 
 
Subjects with non-measurable disease by RECIST criteria, who require 
palliative radiation to a single site, will be permitted to receive treatment and 
remain on study. However, subjects with non-measurable disease who required 
palliative radiation to more than one site will be considered as having disease 
progression and will be taken off study. 
 
3.4  Number of Subjects  
 
 This trial will entail enrollment of a maximum of 36 patients for treatment, as 
discussed in section 6.0. The target accrual goal will be 18 subjects/year. 
 
3.5  Treatment Duration and Follow- Up 
 
 Study subjects will remain on treatment until disease progression, the development

treatment on protocol would not be in the best interest of the study participant) or death. 
Study participants will be followed for one year after completion of study treatment.

4.3 Minorities and Women Statement  
  
          Female subjects of all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet 
        the eligibility criteria specified in sections 4.1 and 4.2. To address disparities 
        in healthcare and breast cancer treatment among women from underserved 
        populations, all efforts will be made to accrue subjects from ethnically diverse, 
        underserved and minority populations. In order to achieve this goal, this study will  
       be conducted with the collaboration of Dr. Kimlin Ashing-Giwa who has established  
        the City of Hope Center of Community Alliance for Research and Education  
        (CCARE), an organization charged with increasing the awareness of cancer clinical         
        trials among underserved populations.    
  
 
5.0  STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
 5.1  Screening  
 
            A signed and dated IRB approved protocol consent form must be obtained 
          before any study specific procedures can be performed. Procedures that are  
          considered part of routine care are not considered study specific procedures but may 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 11           be used to determine eligibility during screening. The following assessments must  
          be performed within 28 days of initiation of treatment: 
 
            -
  Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
            -
  Recording of concomitant mediation, including date of last use of prior therapy 
               for tre
atment of breast cancer. 
            - Complete review of medical history (documentation of diagnosis, hormone 
               re
ceptor status of tumor, most recent radiologic assessment of disease status and 
               prior treatment history) 
            - Complete physical examination, including assessment of ECOG performance 
               status.
 
            -  Laboratory assessment for hematologic, renal and hepatic function. 
            -
  Disease assessment according to RECIST criteria. All baseline radiologic scans 
               (CT, MR
I, bone scans) must be performed within 28 days of study initiation. 
[Note: PET/
CT Scan may be used in lieu of Bone Scan when patient is symptomatic] 
            -  If available, submission of archival paraffin-embedded or fresh frozen tumor 
               tissue samples. 
         
5.2  Tumor Assessments  
 
Radiologic assessment of disease must include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and the imaging modality 
se
lected should remain consistent throughout the entire study. All subjects will 
additionally undergo a bone scan at baseline [ Note: P ET/CT Scan may be used in lieu of 
Bone Scan when patient is symptomatic] . Subjects with a positive bone scan at baseline 
will
 continue to have bone scans as part of their radiologic assessments throughout the 
study period. Subjects with a negative bone scan at baseline, will not be required to 
c
ontinue with further bone scans during the study period, unless clinically indicated. All 
im
aging studies will be required at baseline and will be repeated every 3 cycles (i.e. day 
15-21 of every 3rd cycle ). Tumor response assessments will be performed according to 
R
ECIST criteria: 
 
 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Referen ce 
 Eligibility 
Measurable disease  - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
cytology/histology .  
             Measurable lesions  - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
with longest diameter 
 20 mm using conventional techniques or 
 10 mm with spiral CT 
scan. 
        
    Non-measurable  lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 
m
m with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan), i.e., bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal d isease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 12 lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not 
confirmed and followed by imaging techniques. 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., 
skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 Methods of Measurement 
 
 CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT 
should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  This applies 
to tumors of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of 
extremities usually require specific protocols. 
 
 Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  
 
 When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound 
(US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible 
alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, 
subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical 
examination. 
 
 The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not 
yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require 
sophi
sticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in 
some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor 
response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers. However, 
such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained. 
 
 Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response when all lesions have disappeared. 
 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 13 
 Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases 
(e.g., after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual 
malignant lesions). 
Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesions 
 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and  
re
corded and measured at baseline.  
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically).  
 A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions  will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by 
which to characterize the objective tumor. 
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions  and 
shoul
d also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, 
but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 Response Criteria 
Evaluation of target lesions 
* Complete Respon se 
(CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
* Partial Response 
(PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD  
* Progressive Disease 
(PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of targ et lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions  
* Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest sum LD since the 
treatment started  
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
* Complete Response 
(CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level  
* Incomplete 
Response/          
Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits  
* Progressive Disease Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 14 (PD):  progression of existing non -target lesions (1)  
(1) Although a clear progression of “non target” lesions only is exceptional. In such 
c
ircumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the 
progression status should be confirmed later on by the review panel (or study 
chair). 
Evaluation of best overall response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria  
 
Target lesions  Non-Target lesions  New Lesions  Overall response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Incomplete 
response/SD  No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to 
confirm the complete response status. 
 Confirmation 
 The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the 
response rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it 
should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses 
are not confirmed. 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 15 
 To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be 
c
onfirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after 
the criteria for response are first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study 
protocol may also be appropriate.  
 In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least 
once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6-8 weeks) that 
is defined in the study protocol  
 Duration of overall response 
 The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that 
recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
 Duration of stable disease 
 SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.  
  
5.3  Toxicity Assessments  
 
To protect against and minimize potential risks, assessments of treatment-related    
tox
icities will be performed by the study nurse every three weeks (via telephone). The 
NCI, Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version  
3.0, available at http://ctep.cancer.gov//forms/CTAEv3.pdf) ), will be used as a guide to    
assess severity. To assess musculoskeletal adverse effects associated with EXE use, all  
subj
ects will complete modified Health Assessment Questionnaires (HAQ DI©) 
(A
ppendix A) at the start of each cycle of treatment, as previously validated [7, 17].  
 
5.4  Quality of Life Assessment (Appendix C)  
      
          For determination of quality of life associated with EXE use, the European         
 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
          Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) will be used. This instrument consists of a 30-item,   
          cancer-specific tool which encompasses measures of physical, emotional, cognitive        
          and social well being, in addition to measures of symptoms and overall quality of  
          life. Questionnaires will be completed at the start of every new cycle of treatment. 
       
5.5  Exemestane Drug Diary  
      
           To assess compliance with treatment, all patients will be supplied with a           
 
calendar of the treatment schedule at the start of each new cycle and will be  
         instructed to track their daily consumption of EXE at home. Completed calendars  
          will be collected at the end of each cycle of treatment.

6.0   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
6.1  Maximum Accrual: 36 Subjects  
 
While toxicity is safely assumed to be reduced, the improvement in PFS is less clear and 
int
erim stopping conditions in case the PFS is dramatically worse than historical data [5], 
a
re incorporated in the design. The following design operating characteristics were 
calculated by the method of Simon, but the specific design chosen differs slightly from 
the Optimum or Minimax design to take into consideration the sawtooth nature of the 
powe
r function [18, 19].  Patients will be defined as a “success” or “failure” based on 
whether they have obtained the appropriate benchmark for median PFS (see below). An 
interim analysis will be performed at 21 subjects.  If fewer than six of the first 21 subjects 
a
re a “success”, the study will be stopped for futility.  If fewer than fourteen patients out 
of
 the 36 subjects are a success this will also be suggestive that this regimen does not 
warrant further study.  This design discriminates between an encouraging “success” rate 
of
 50% and a discouraging “success” rate of 30%.  The probability of early stopping if 
the tr
ue success rate is 50%, is 1% whereas the probability of early stopping if the true 
succ
ess  rate is 30%, is 36%.The overall type II error for the decision on whether or not 
the tr
eatment is promising is 7%, whereas the type I error is less than 17%, when 
c
omparing a discouraging success rate of 30% to an encouraging rate of 50%. 
 
F
or second or third line patients (as was done prior to the amendment to include first line 
patients) if patients are progression-free at the 4 month evaluation this will be considered 
a success. Based on recent publication (e.g. Paridaens, et al , Vol 26, No. 30, pp-4883-
4890, J
CO 2008) the median PFS for first line patients on EXE is approximately 10 
months. As a result, we will view a “success” for first line patients if they are 
progression-free at 10 months.  
 
Patients who are not first line will be assigned to Treatment Arm 1. Patients who are first 
li
ne will be accrued to treatment Arm 2. These arms are used simply as a convenience for 
easier determination of the primary endpoint, and no specific accrual goals are made for 
each treatment arm, with a total goal of 36 subjects. 
 
While it is assumed that reduced exposure to EXE results in fewer and less severe drug-
related toxicities, a sufficient sample size must be accrued in order to obtain a reasonable 
e
stimate of the frequency of treatment related toxicities. One benchmark will look at the 
incide
nce of joint disorders,reported by Gradishar [5], at approximately 30%. A one-
sided exact binomial test with a nominal 10% significance level, will have 81% power to 
de
tect a difference from a historical 30% complication rate, to a 15% complication rate 
with 36 subjects. Generally, however, if the PFS is equivalent to historical data, this will 
be
 considered successful, based on the assumption that reduced drug exposure will result 
in l
ess toxicity. While progression free survival (time to progression or death) at 4 
mont
hs (and 10 months)  is calculated as a binomial (all treated patients will count and 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 17 patients lost to follow-up before 4 months (10 months for first line) will count as a 
failure), progression-free survival will also be reported using the method of Kaplan-
Meie
r. 
 
 
6.2  Correlative Analysis  
   
With 36 patients, correlative analysis will be exploratory in nature. No attempt will be   
made to adjust for multiple comparisons (except as part of standard microarray analysis) 
a
nd this will be noted in any report. Changes from baseline and comparison between 
re
sponders and non-responders, will be summarized. We will also do a more refined 
a
nalysis of 1st line, second line and third-line patients to explore the potential impact of 
EXE
 in these different patient populations. 
6.3  Reporting of results  
 All patients included in this study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if 
there
 are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are later determined to be 
inelig
ible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete 
response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death 
from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other 
cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). 
 
7.0  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
  
7.1  Definition of Risk Level  
 
This is a Risk Level 3 study, as defined in the “City of Hope Data and Safety Monitoring 
P
lan”, http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Pages/forms-and-procedures.aspx  because it is a pilot, 
P
hase II clinical trial  where the risks are at least balanced by the potential benefit to 
subj
ects and the importance of the knowledge that may result. 
 
7.2  Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring  
 
The Protocol Management Team (PMT), consisting of the PI, Collaborating Investigator, 
CRA/protocol nurse and statistician, is responsible for monitoring the data and safety of 
thi
s study, including implementation of any stopping rules for safety and efficacy.  
 
Da
ta and safety will be reported to the COH DSMC using the PMT report and submitted 
according to the timelines in Table 1 below.  Protocol specific data collection will include 
the following items: summary of accrual, adverse events, and treatment related mortality.

 7.3  Definitions  
 
Adverse event (AE) - An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change 
of
 an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is 
considered to be related to the protocol intervention.  
 
Unexpected  Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a)  – An  advers e e vent is unexpected if it 
is not listed in the investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the protocol and/or consent; is not a n expected natural progression of any 
underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research 
participant experiencing the adverse event. 
 
Expected  Adverse Event  - Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected 
e
vent OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, 
condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the 
adverse event 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [21 CFR 312.32] is defined as any expected or unexpected 
adverse event  that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred) 
 Unplanned hospitalization (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of 
e
xisting hospitalization 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Secondary Malignancy 
 Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasisas of convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 19 Unanticipated problem (UP)  – Any incident, experience, or outcome that m eets all 
three  of the following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related documents such as the IRB 
approved research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure 
(IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2. R elated or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have 
been caused by the drugs, devices or procedures involved in the research); AND  
3. S uggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously 
known or recognized.

8.0  DRUG INFORMATION  
 
8.1  Description  
 
EXE is an oral, irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally similar to   the 
na
tural substrate, androstenedione. In postmenopausal women, estrogens are produced 
primarily by the conversions of androgens into estrogens through the aromatase enzyme 
in peripheral tissues. By acting as a false substrate and irreversibly binding to the active 
sit
e of the aromatase enzyme, EXE causes inactivation of the aromatase enzyme, 
IRB #08063    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 23 resulting in significant inhibition of circulating estrogen concentrations in 
postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on adrenal biosynthesis of 
corticosteroids or aldosterone.  In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with 25 
mg of EXE daily, whole body aromatization was suppressed by greater 
than 90%. EXE is currently approved by the FDA for use in the treatment  
of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, whose disease has progressed 
following tamoxifen therapy. EXE is also approved for use as adjuvant therapy  
for
 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. 
      The recommended dose of EXE is 25 mg orally once daily after a meal.  
       
 8.2  Toxicology  
  
      In clinical trials of 1058 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, daily 
      doses of EXE consisting of 25 mg, was generally well tolerated and adverse events 
      were usually mild to moderate. Adverse effects of EXE which have been reported  
      a
mong postmenopausal women receiving this therapy in either the adjuvant or 
      meta
static setting, include: 
 
      More Common  
        
           Endocrine/metabolic: diaphoresis (6-17.8%), hot sweats (13-32.9%) 
           Gastrointestinal: nausea (8.5-18%), diarrhea (4-9.6%), vomiting (7%) 
            
           
Musculoskeletal:  arthralgia (14.6-28.8%), myalgia (5.5%), osteoporosis (4.6%), 
                                        pa
in in limb (9%), osteoarthritis (5.9%) 
           Neurologic: headache (6.9-13.1%), insomnia (11-13.7%), dizziness (8-9.7%) 
           Constitutional: fatigue (11-22%), asthenia (6%) 
           Dermatologic: alopecia (15.1%), dermatitis (8.2%) 
           Psychiatric: depression (6.2-13%), anxiety (4.1-11%) 
   
           Severe  
 
           Cardiovascular: heart failure (0 .4% ), myocardial infarction (1.6%) 
           Musculoskeletal: fracture of bone (4.2%) 
           Neurologic: cerebrovascular accident (6 deaths due to stroke, N=2252) 
           Hematologic: thromboembolic event (0.9%)     
               
   8.3  Pharmacology  
 
           Kinetics :  EXE is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and high-fat food 
           increases plasma levels. It is metabolized hepatically via the CYP3A4 pathway and 
           converted into an active 17-dihydro metabolite. Routes of systemic excretion 
           of EXE consist of fecal (42%) and renal (42%), with < 1% of drug remaining 
     unchanged. Elimination half life is 24 hours. Based on experience with 
     EXE in m
ultiple doses up to 200 mg daily, the manufacturer does not  
     recommend dosage adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
           In postmenopausal women, suppression of plasma estrogen was observed 
           8-
24 h after single oral doses of EXE [20].

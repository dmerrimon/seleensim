 HEOR 24  Summary of Changes  
AMENDMENT NUMBER:  6 AMENDMENT DATE:        9 November 2020 
Additions are noted by bolding . Deletions are noted by cross outs .  
Throughout the protocol, enrol lment  of healthy subjects was changed from 3,300 to 4,300 and the 
total number of subjects enrolled changed from 4,300 to 5,300. 
Synopsis   
A total of 5,3004,300 patients are planned to be enrolled on this study, 1,000 subjects with 
known or suspected cancer confirmed through pathology reports and/or clinical/radiographic 
data and 4,3003,300 subjects with no known cancer. 
Synopsis and Section 2.1 Primary Objective  
• Up to the first 700 subjects with known or suspected cancer and the first approximately  
1,400 subjects with no known cancer collected will be used as training cases to develop a model to discriminate cancer from non -cancer cases.  
Synopsis and Section 3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
• Age ≥50 years (both cancer and non- cancer cohorts)  or age 18- 30 years (non -cancer 
cohort only). 
Synopsis and Section 9 Determination of sample size  
The overall study aims to consent 5,3004,300 subjects (1,000 confirmed cancer subjects, 
4,3003,300 non- cance r).  The cancer cohort will limit breast and endometrial cancer to 
approximately  200 subjects and 50 subjects, respectively.  
Section 2 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
Thrive Earlier Detection is seeking to conduct a development and validation study for a new version of the CancerSEEK  assay,  in a cohort of 1,000 subjects diagnosed with cancer  and a cohort 
of 4,3003,300 non-cancer volunteers with no known diagnosis of cancer. The overall study aims 
to consent 5,3004,300 subjects meeting  eligibility  criteria  (1,000 confirmed  cancer subjects and 
4,3003,300 non- cancer subjects).  
Section 5.1 Overview  
To ensure inclusion of that a heterogen eous group of cancer types and that  breast and 
endometrial cancer  patients are not overrepresented in the sample of cancer pa tients (N Total = 
1,000), we will limit enrollment of those tumor sites  as shown in Table 1. Each cancer type 
should include a distribution of Stage I -IV. to approximately  20% of the overall sample 
(NBreast = 200, N endometrial  = 50).  Initial data analysis will be conducted after collecting 70% of our 
cancer cohort ( NInitial = 700).  Breast and endometrial cancer patients will be capped at 
approximately  20% and 5% of the initial sample as well (N Breast = 140, N Endometrial  = 35)  (See  
Table 1 below).

Sponsor:  Thrive Earlier Detection Corporation – Cambridge, MA 02139  
Number of 
Patients:  A total of 5,300  patients are planned to be enrolled on this study, 1,000 subjects with 
known or suspected cancer confirmed through pathology reports and/or 
clinical/radiographic data and 4,300 subjects with no known cancer. 
Objectives:  The primary objective of the study is to develop and validate the classification algorithm 
used by the CancerSEEK cancer screening test by collecting clinically annotated peripheral blood specimens from subjects with cancer and no known cancer.  
• Up to 700 subjects with known or suspected ca ncer and approximately  1,400 
subjects with no known cancer collected will be used as training cases  to develop  
a model to discriminate  cancer  from  non-cancer cases.  
• The subsequent cases  collected  will be used as test cases to validate a model that 
discriminates cancer from non - cancer cases.  
In addition to planned analyses for the primary objective, future exploratory investigation may study histology, pathology, medical records, tissue, and other biospecimens collected as part of standard of care.  
Study Design:  This is a prospective, observational study of 1,000 subjects with known or suspected cancer and 4,300  subjects with no known cancer.  
Potential participants will be asked questions to confirm their eligibility by a nurse navigator, study staf f member, physician or via the patient web portal.  
Informed consent will be carried out for eligible subjects in accordance with applicable federal regulations and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
Subje cts will then complete a survey, and either study staff will draw 60 mL of blood and 
measure the height and weight of the subject, or a home health visit will be scheduled to complete the blood draw and collect height and weight.  
Where available, data from  the medical records of the cancer subjects will reviewed and 
collected. In addition, non -cancer subjects will be requested to allow access to their 
medical records as an optional portion of their informed consent.
 
Inclusion Criteria:  All Patients  
• Age ≥50 years (both cancer and non -cancer cohorts) or age 18- 30 years (non -
cancer cohort only).  
• Ability to understand the nature of this study and give written informed   consent.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
 Background and Study Rationale  
Recommended screening  is known to reduce the mortality and morbidity of breast, colo rectal , 
cervix, prostate, and lung cancer.  At present , a screening assessment , the prostate -specific antigen 
(PSA)  test, can be performed with a blood sample.  Cervical cancer screening involves a Pap smear 
test, and in countries where the test is the standard -of-care cervical cancer has nearly disappeared.  
Breast and colorectal cancer screening s are conducted with mammography and colonoscopy, 
respectively , and may detect precancerous lesions that can be removed  (Kalinich et al 2018) .  
Screening heavy smokers with low -dose chest computed tomography (CT) scans can detect lung 
cancer and improve cancer -specific survival ( Siegel et al 2019).   
Timely , less invasive, and effective screening for cancer  provides the best opportunity to reduce 
cancer mortality and morbidity for patients .  The CancerSEEK assay constitutes an important step 
toward s early cancer detection  (Cohen et al 2018).   The CancerSEEK assay was characterized in 
a retrospective study of over 1800 subjects (1,005 previously diagnosed with cancer and 812 non-
cancer  subjects) .  A cross -validation technique was used to train and evaluate the performance of 
classified algorithms.  Eight cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectal, lung, and breast) were used to demonstrate the performance of the assay.  Altogether, the algorithm 
for detection demonstrated sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 99.14%.  In cases where the 
CancerSEEK result was positive for presence of cancer (N=626) the algorithm for localization further predicted the 2 most likely anatomic al sites (out of 8) for each assayed tumor.  During 
cross- validation this prediction contained the actual site of origin of the tumor in a median of 83% 
of subjects ( Cohen et al 2018).   
In this study a new analytic feature of the CancerSEEK test not available in previous CancerSEEK studies will be  validated .  The new CancerSEEK test will measure genome- wide aneuploidy and 
as a result, a new version of the algorithm will be developed.  
2. STUDY O BJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS  
Thrive Earlier Detection is seeking to conduct a development and validation study for a new version of the CancerSEEK  assay,  in a cohort of 1,000 subjects diagnosed with cancer  and a cohort 
of 4,300 non-cancer volunteers with no known diagnosis of cancer. The overall study aims to consent 5,300 subjects meeting  eligibility  criteria  (1,000 confirmed  cancer subjects and 4,300 non-
cancer subjects). Enrolled subjects will complete a brief survey and supply a sample of blood to be sent to a central laboratory where the CancerSEEK blood test is in  development.  
 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to develop and validate the classification algorithm used by the CancerSEEK cancer screening test by collecting clinically annotated peripheral blood specimens from subjects with cancer and no known cancer. 
• Up to 700 subjects with known or suspected cancer and approximately  1,400 subjects with 
no known cancer collected will be used as training cases to develop a model to discriminate 
cancer from non -cancer cases.

Page 14 of 35 
 • The subsequent cases collected will be used as test cases to validate a model that 
discriminates cancer from non -cancer cases.  
 Exploratory Objective 
 
 
 
 Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is the  ability of the CancerSEEK assay to effectively discriminate cancer 
from non- cancer as measured by sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). 
Additional indicators of accuracy will be provided in a full confusion matrix, which is a table that 
shows the full performance of a classification model against true values.

 WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION  
Participation in this study is voluntary.  Subjects are not required to participate and may decid e to 
withdraw their information from the study at any time, without penalty and without affecting their 
medical care.   
• If a subject elects to discontinue participation in the study and withdraws consent and 
authorization, Outcomes will make all reasonable  efforts to take the following actions:  
• Future use of the s ubject’s biological sample and future access to the s ubject’s medical 
information will not take place .  
• Any information already obtained through study of the s ubject’s biological sample will 
continue to be used as described in this protocol.   
• Any information already collected from the subject’s medical record or through study 
surveys will continue to be used as described in this protocol. 
• Any remaining portion of the subject’s biological sample will be destroyed.  
Note:  It may not be possible to retrieve and/or destroy biological sample and other information 
previously released; in addition, the biological sample may have already been depleted at the time of the request.  
4. STUDY REGISTRATION 
The subject must willingly consent after being informed of the procedures, the experimental nature 
 
 
Confidential 
Sarah Cannon Development Innovations       Study Number: HEOR 24   
Protocol Date: 9 November 2020        Version 7.0 
Page 16 of 35 
 of the study, potential benefits, alternatives, side -effects, risks, and discomforts.  Human protection 
committee approval of this protocol and associated consent form(s) is required.   
Study subjects will be identified for one of the two cohorts ( Cancer Cohort or Non-C ancer Cohort 
[healthy volunteer ]) (please refer to  Table 1).   
In the confirmed Cancer Cohort, subjects for the study will be identified  by physicians, study 
staff and  nurse navigators.  For some participants, a  Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
machine learning algorithm will be  applied to pathology report s to predict a positive cancer 
diagnosis and the most likely primary tumor site .   
Cancer subjects will  then  be populated into an  application where they will be  assigned a nurse 
navigator or study coordinator  who may identify them as eligible for the study.  
All subjects participating in the cancer cohort will receive compensation after signing informed 
consent and completing the study survey (see Appendix A).  Completion of the study survey is defined as an attempt at survey, and compensation will be sent regardless of any skipped or 
“prefer not to answer” responses present.  
Navigated gateway  
For sites using the navigated gateway, a nurse naviga tor will recruit potential participants.  
Because nurse navigators will only be recruiting potential participants for the study and not consenting them, their activities are limited to screening activities, enter ing subject 
demographics, tablet activation and distribution of Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved materials.   They will be trained to direct participants to the study phone line if they have 
questions related to the informed consent form.  Patients will be sup plied with the consent by the 
nurse navigator, but will call the study phone line if they have any questions.   
Study site gateway  
For sites using a study coordinator, the study coordinator will conduct the consent survey and 
blood draw.   
In the Non- Cancer Cohort, subjects will be recruited and enrolled from several sources.  Firstly, 
from the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) employee base, referrals to non -HCA-
employed individuals (e.g., friends, family, neighbors) and others in waves  until enrollment 
targets  are met. This approach  will include messaging  to create awareness of the opportunity 
within  targeted  departments/subsidiaries of HCA Healthcare. While employee email addresses 
may be used to inform individuals of the study opportunity, no data regarding  individual 
employee participation  will be shared  with the employer, and participation will have no impact on 
employees’ standing with their employer. A financial incentive will not be offered to HCA 
employees or HCA -employee referrals .  Secondly, subjects will be recruited and enrolled via a 
study web portal.  Informed consent and survey data collection will be performed via the web 
portal, and the blood draw performed using home health visits.  A financial incentive will be offered to th is non- cancer cohort for additional time and effort in participating.  
Study site gateway  
For sites using a study coordinator, the study coordinator will conduct the consent survey and blood draw.

5. STUDY DESIGN  
 Overview  
This is a prospective,  observational study of 1,000 subjects with known or suspected cancer 
confirmed through pathology reports ( Table 1 ) and/or clinical/radiographic data and 3,300 
subjects with no known cancer.  De -identified blood samples and clinical data will be collected 
from subjects to validate a classification algorithm for a new version of the CancerSEEK assay.  
All subjects in the cancer cohort signing informed consent and completin g the study survey will 
receive compensation for participating.  
Potential participants will be asked questions to confirm their eligibility by a nurse navigator, 
study staff member, physician (see Appendix A ), or via the patient web portal,  to document 
screening including date of upcoming therapy or surgery for cancer patients if one has been scheduled, before providing informed consent to participate in the study.  Study procedures outside of the pre -screening for eligibility will not be perfor med prior to the subject  providing 
consent.  Informed consent will be carried out in accordance with applicable federal regulations 
and International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH)/ Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) guidelines. 
Prior to signing the informed consent form ( ICF), potential participants will confirm that they 
understand the study and that they have no questions about the study. 
The ICF may be offered  by paper, electronically , or via a secure web site,  with the option to also 
review a paper copy provided by the nurse navigator or study coordinator either face -to-face on a 
tablet, via printing, or via email.  Potential participants will be given a phone number to call with 
any study specific questions.  C opies of all sig ned consent forms will be stored centrally in a 
secure environment, and signed consent forms will thereby be available for verification by Thrive or its designee at any time.  
Once the subject completes the survey, study staff will complete the blood draw and collect 
height and weight  data . For some participants, their contact information and unique study 
identifier ( ID) will be sent securely to a third -party vendor who will contact the subject within 24 
hours to schedule the blood draw and height and weight measurements at a location convenient 
to the subject.  
For all subjects, study staff and /or the third -party vendor performing the blood collection will 
verify the following before performing the blood draw and height and weight measurements: 
participant i dentity and age against a form of identification, that consent to participate has been 
given, that the participants in the cancer arm are still treatment naïve, and that they do not have a fever that could be caused by an infection.  The blood collection vendor or study staff will ensure 
all required data are captured and included with the blood sample, that the sample is collected and packaged according to laboratory manual specifications, and that the sample is shipped to the indicated processing lab with  the required expediency.  Following all study visits, study staff 
and third party vendor or study staff will complete a visit checklist confirming all of the study activities that occurred.  
Subjects in the Cancer cohort  will be identified via nurse navigation , study staff or oncology 
physicians in local offices.  The nurse navigator or study staff  will verify eligibility through chart

 review and pre -screen, approach the subject about the study opportunity, and present the 
informed consent form. For participants enrolling electronically, participants will be presented 
with a secured tablet device on which the subject will watch a brief video about the study, read the informed consent and provide electronic consent.  Some p articipants may also have the 
option of having the video, informed consent and survey emailed to them. Upon consent and enrollment, subject s will be assigned  a unique subject  study ID, which will be  used to track the 
subject, their data and their biospecim en throughout study operations.  Consented subjects will 
then be directed to complet e a survey via the tablet device, email  or paper. Participants will be 
allowed to skip questions in the survey or select the answer option “prefer not to answer.”  Subject data will be tracked in  real-time by central study staff to ensure desired tumor type 
diversification and communicate enrollment strategy changes to the nurse navigators and study staff.  
To ensure inclusion of a heterogen eous gr oup of cancer types and that  breast and endometrial 
cancer  patients are not overrepresented in the sample of cancer patients ( N
Total = 1,000), we will 
limit enrollment of those tumor sites as shown in Table 1. Each cancer type should include a distribution of Stage I- IV.

6. BLOOD SAMPLE COLLECTION 
Subjects will have 6 (10 mL) biological samples (blood) collected in Streck circulating free DNA 
(cfDNA) tubes with a needle no larger than 21G.  Tubes will be filled completely and then 
immediately mixed by gentle inversion 8 -10 times.  A temperature monitor is required to ensure 
the blood samples do not become too hot or cold as samples must be shipped at ambient temperature (43 -99ºF, 6 -37ºC).  Sample  shipping instructions are detailed in the study operations 
manual.  
7. DATA COLLECTION  
Data from the non- cancer subjects (healthy volunteers)  and cancer subjects will be self- reported 
for this study.  Where avai lable, data from the medical records of the cancer subjects will reviewed 
and collected.  In addition, non- cancer subjects will be requested  to allow  access to their medical 
records .  These subjects will be asked to check and sign the optional section of the consent allowing 
access to their  long- term outcomes data.   
The following demographic data will be  collected from e ach subject ( cancer  and non- cancer) :  
• Date of birth

 Study  Documentation and Storage 
The Principal Investigator must maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he has 
delegated study duties and should ensure that all persons assisting in the conduct of the stu dy are 
informed of their obligations.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on the 
electronic case report forms ( eCRFs ) are to be included on this document.  All entries in the 
subjects’ e CRF s are to be supported by source documentation where appropriate.   
Source documents are the original documents, data, records, and certified copies of original 
records of clinical findings, observations, and activities from which the subjects’ e CRF data are  
obtained.  These can include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory, medico -technical department and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) traces, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being 
accurate and complete, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x- rays, and 
correspondence. 
The Principal Investigator and study staff members are responsible for maintaining a 
comprehensive and centralized filing system  (e.g., regulatory binder or Investigator study file 
[ISF]) of all essential study- related documentation, suitable for inspection at any time by 
representatives from the Sponsor and/or applicable regulatory authorities.  The ISF must consist 
of those docum ents that individually or collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of the study 
and the quality of the data produced.  The ISF should contain at  a minimum all relevant documents 
and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP Section 8 and 21 CFR Part 312.57, including key 
documents such as the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) and any amendments, the protocol and any 
amendments, copies of completed e CRFs, I RB approval documents , subject  identification lists,  
and enrollment logs.   
 Data Management 
The Data Science team will work with the S ponsor and I nvestigator to provide operational 
definitions for each variable and the Data Manager will work with the appropriate subject matter experts (SME) to map these required variables to the appropriate data fields, ensuring their existence and completeness, and will design requirements for their collection.  Variables to be abstracted will be outlined and collected via  study staff  manually entering the data into the study  
electronic data capture EDC  system or through automated direct transfer of electronic health record 
(EHR) data elements to the EDC system .  Requirements for the EDC eCRF will be identified , 
documented and developed under the oversight of Sarah Cannon Data Management.  
Innovations will monitor enrolled subjects – receiving both their EMR subject  ID and unique study 
ID – and will ensure that other required study variables are abstracted from the subject  record s into 
the EDC.  A percentage of these cases will be reviewed in entirety for quality assurance, and 
monitoring of all collected data will be performed according to the agreed -upon Monitoring Plan. 
Quality -assured abstracted subject data will be merged with quality -assured subject survey data 
via unique subject ID to produce a final dataset.

 Electronic Case Report Form  
The study e CRF is the p rimary data collection instrument for the study.  Case report forms will be 
completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable Outcomes to review 
the subject s’ status throughout the course of the study.   
In order to maintain confidentiality, only study number, subject  number, and year of birth  will 
identify the subject in the eCRF .  If the subject ’s name appears on any other document (e.g., 
laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the  document to be supplied to Outcomes 
and be replaced instead with the subject number and other identifier (i.e., subject initials) as 
allowed per institutional policy.  The Investigator will maintain a personal su bject  identification 
list (subject  numbers with corresponding subject identifiers) to enable records to be identified and 
verified as authentic.  Subject data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed 
according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
All data requested in the eCRF system must be supported by and be consistent with the subject ’s 
source documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, 
assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the e CRF, 
a note should be created verifying that the test was “Not Done” or  the result was “Unknown.”  For 
any entry errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided. 
The Investigator  will electronically sign and date the subject e CRF casebook indicating that the 
data in the e CRF has been assessed.  Each completed e CRF will be signed and dated by the 
Principal Investigator, once all data for that subject  is final.  
 Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of subjects ’ personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health Ins urance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HIPAA regulations require that, in order to 
participate in the study, a subject  must sign an authorization form for the study that he or she has 
been informed of the following: 
• What protected heal th information will be collected from subject s in the study; 
• Who will have access to that information and why; 
• Who will use or disclose that information ; 
• The health information may be further disclosed by the recipients of the information, and that if the information is disclosed, the information may no longer be protected by federal 
or state privacy laws; 
• Whether the authorization contains an expiration date; 
• The rights of a research subject to revoke his or her authorization. 
In the event that a Subject r evokes authorization to collect or use his or her personal health 
information ( PHI), the Investigator retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the 
revocation of authorization.

 The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of Outcomes , Innovations , 
applicable regulatory authorities and the  IRB to review the subject’s original medical records for 
verification of trial -related procedures and data.  
 Disclosure and Publication Policy  
All information provided regarding the study, as well as all information collected/documented 
during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential.  The Sponsor reserves the right to release literature publications based on the results of the study.  Results from the study will be 
published/presented as per the Sponsor’s publication process.  
Inclusion of  the Investigator in the authorship of any multi -center  publication will be based upon 
substantial contribution to the study design, the analysis or interpretation of data, or the drafting 
and/or critically revising of any manuscript(s) derived from the study.   
9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The primary objective of the study is to collect clinically annotated peripheral blood specimens from subjects with  confirmed  cancer and subjects with no known cancer (healthy volunteers) to 
develop and validate the classification algorithm used by the CancerSEEK cancer screening test.  
The primary endpoint is the assay’s ability to effectively discriminate cancer from non -cancer as 
measured by the full confusion matrix, including sensitivity, specificity, and  PPV.  
 
 
 
 
 Determination of sample size  
Given the exploratory nature, no formal statistical analysis will be performed in this study.  The statistical analysis will be descriptive and co nsist of subject listings, graphs, and summary statistics 
comprising geometric mean, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum (max) values as appropriate. 
The overall study aims to consent 5,300 subjects (1 ,000 confirmed cancer subjects, 4,300 non-
cancer).  
 Subject characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristic data will be recorded .  Demographic data will include 
date of birth, age, sex, race and ethnicity.  Subject characteristics, cancer history, family history,  
and baseline data will include smoking details (quantity and duration of smoking history).

 10. SAFETY REPORTING AND ANALYSES  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for recognizing and reporting serious adverse events 
(SAEs ) to the Innovations Safety Department.  It is  the Sponsor’s responsibility to report relevant 
SAEs to the applicable national regulatory bodies.  In additi on, the Principal Investigator must 
report SAEs and follow -up information to the responsible IRB according to the policies of that 
IRB.  
The Principal Investigator is also responsible for ensuring that every staff member involved in the 
study is familiar with the content of this section.  
 Definitions   
 Serious Adverse Events 
Each SAE must be assessed for severity and intensity using the following classification guidelines:  
Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s usual activity or 
is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae. 
Moderate:  Interferes with the subject’s usual activity and/or requires symptomatic treatment.  
Severe:  Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact o n the subject’s usual 
activity and requir ing treatment.  
 Relatedness  
An SAE should be considered definitely related if, in the opinion of the I nvestigator, the study 
procedure caused or contributed to the S AE.  The initial assessment may be revised as new 
information becomes  available.  
Related:  there is a reasonable relationship to study application  
Unrelated:  there is not a reasonable relationship to the study application  
Unknown:  there is no clear or compelling evidence that the event is or  is not due to the study 
application   
 Definitions of s erious a dverse e vent 
An SAE is an adverse event  occurring during any study phase that fulfil ls one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (e.g. subject cannot breathe) 
• Requires in -subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardi ze the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of these would include: 
angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring IV  hydrocortisone

Page 25 of 35 
 treatment, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitaliz ation . 
 Recording of serious adverse events  
All SAEs whether volunteered by the subject , discovered by study personnel during questioning, 
or detected through other means will be reported appropriately.    
 Reporting of serious adverse events 
All SAEs have to  be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the study procedure(s).  
All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.  
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel  must 
inform appropriate Innovations Safety D epartment representatives immediately, or no 
later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
To report a SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information. 
The SAE report should be sent to Innovations Safety Department via fax or e -mail using the 
following contact information (during both business and non-business hours):  
Sarah Cannon Innovations Safety Department Safety Dept. Fax #:       
Safety Dept. Email:      
Trans mission of the SAE report should be confirmed by the site personnel submitting the report, 
a
nd a copy of the confirmation should be retained with the subject ’s records.  
The Principal Investigator must report SAEs and follow -up information to the responsible IRB 
according to the policies of the responsible IRB. 
 Recording of Serious Adverse Events  
 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
All SAEs should be recorded individually in the subject ’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Principal Investiga tor, the S AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, 
disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named 
rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an SAE as appropriate on the SAE Report Form.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up informatio n is available.  
If a diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect the diagnosis.  
 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent S AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject evaluation 
time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form.  If a persistent

 SAE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be recorded on a separate SAE Report 
Form.  
A recur rent SAE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent SAEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form.

Name of Sponsor/Company:  
Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product:  
TNX -102 SL (Cyclobenzaprine HCl Sublingual Tablets)  
Name of Active Ingredient:  
Cyclobenzaprine HCl  
Title of Study:  
A Phase 2, 14-week Double -Blind, Randomized, Multicenter, Placebo -Controlled Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TNX -102 SL Taken Daily at Bedtime in Patient s with 
Multi -site Pain Associate d with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS -CoV-2 Infection (PASC)  
(Protocol No. TNX -CY-PA201)  
Study center(s):  Approximately  30 centers in the United States  
Estimated Studied period: 16 months  
Estimated date first patient  enrolled:  August 2022  
Estimated date last patient  completed:  November 2023  Phase of development: 2 
Objectives:  
Primary  
To evaluate the efficacy of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg daily at bedtime  in the treatment of patients with 
multi -site pain associated with Long COVID . 
Secondary  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg daily at bedtime  in the treatment of 
multi -site pain associated with Long COVID .  
 
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, parallel -group, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 14 -week study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) taken 
once daily at bedtime for the management of multi -site pain associated with Long COVID . The 
study is to be conducted at approximately 30 investigational sites in the United States.  
The study will consist of a Screening Visit (Visit 1, Days -35 to -7), a Washout and Screening 
period of at least 7 days ( for those patients not requiring washout) and no more than 35 days, 
inclusive of a 7 -day baseline data collection phase immediately preceding  the Baseline Visit. 
Eligible patients who provide written informed consent will have study assessments performed at 
Screening . Due to lim itations in the diary completion window, patients who are planning on

prohibited.   international travel during the study period should not be considered for the study. Patients 
whose employment involves overnight shifts also should not be considered for the study due t o 
the restricted completion window and the requirement for consistent bedtime dosing.  
At Screening Visit 1 and after signing the written informed consent, any required washout should 
be discussed with the patient  and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stopping 
any excluded medications. This down -titration and discontinuation of excluded medications must 
be accomplished so that the patient  is free of excluded medications at least 14 days prior to 
beginning of the collection of Baseline diary  data that takes place during the 7 days leading up to 
the Baseline/Randomization Visit . Any additional time required for down -titration would be in 
addition to this washout requirement. For extenuating circumstances, the total duration of the 
Screening pe riod may be increased to up to a maximum of 49 days with Medical Monitor 
approval.  All excluded medications will be stopped during the Washout period through 
Week  14/E arly Termination Visit  (ET)  (Visit 6).  
Pre-randomization Approval by Tonix Pharmaceuticals will be required prior to the 
Baseline/Randomization Visit ( Visit 2 ) in addition to satisfying all other eligibility and 
randomization criteria.  
The Screening period will be followed by the Baseline/ Rando mization Visit (Visit 2, Day 1), and 
4 in-clinic  visits at Weeks 2, 6, 10 , and 14 /ET. Due to the exceptional circumstances caused by 
the COVID -19 pandemic, an option for a telephone visit will be available for Weeks 2, 6, 10 
(Visit s 3, 4, 5), and, only wit h Medical Monitor approval, Week 14/Visit 6 (or ET) for those 
unable to attend an in -clinic visit due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Approximately 2 weeks after 
Week 14 (Visit 6) , there will be a n initial  Post-study Safety Follow -up telephone call  (Visit 7), 
and approximately 4 weeks after Week 14 , there will be a 1-Month  Safety Follow -up telephone 
call (Visit 8) . The total duration for each individual participant in  the study, including Screening, 
may be as long as  25 weeks. The maximum treatment duration will be 14  weeks.  
Patients will be trained on use of the electronic diary (eDiary)  system at Visit 1.  During the 7 -day 
run-in Phase (7 days immediately preceding Visit 2 [Baseline/Randomization Visit; Day 1]) 
patients will be asked to record their  worst daily Long COVID pain intensity on the 11 -point 
(0−10) numeric rating scale ( NRS ) scale using 24 -hour recall and assess sleep quality from the 
previous evening, also using an 11 -point NRS scale. The average of the 7 days immediately 
preceding Visit 2 (Baseline Randomization Visit; Day 1) will serve as the Baseline pre -treatment 
scores.   
After completing any required washout of excluded therapies and recording Baseline Diary 
scores for at least 7 days, patients will return to the investigative site fo r Baseline assessments 
and randomization (Day 1, Visit 2), when they will be randomly assigned to receive 
TNX -102 SL or matching placebo sublingual tablet in a 1:1 ratio.  
Patients will take the study drug sublingually (SL) once daily at bedtime, starting on the day of 
randomization (Day 1), for 14 weeks. For the first 2 weeks of treatment, patients will start on 
TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg/day (1 tablet) or placebo.  
All p atients will then return to the clinic at Week 2 (Visit 3) for efficacy and safety assessments  
and assessment of study drug compliance . The study drug dose will be increased to 2 tablets 
(5.6 mg; 2 x 2.8 mg of TNX -102 SL or placebo) taken sublingually and simultaneously daily at 
Protocol No. TNX -CY-PA201

efficacy , study drug compliance, and dose tolerability at the 5. 6-mg daily dose. In scenarios in 
which TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (or 2 placebo tablets ) is considered intolerable due to adverse 
event(s) (AEs) and would otherwise lead to study discontinuation, with Medical Monitor 
approval, the Investigator may lower the dose back to 1 tablet every night (TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg 
or 1 placebo tablet). If/when it is deemed clinically warranted by the Investigator , re-challeng e 
with 2 table ts TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg (5.6 mg dose)/placebo may be attempted , or the patient may 
remain on the lower dose for the remainder of the study. Patients will return to the clinic  for 
safety , tolerability, and efficacy assessments, and assessments of study drug compliance at 
Weeks 10 (Visit 5) and 14 (Visit 6) or ET and will receive two safety follow -up call s 
approximately 2 weeks  (Visit 7) and 4 weeks (Visit 8)  later.   
During the treatment phase, e ach eveni ng, the eDiary  will prompt the patient to reflect on the past 
24 hours and record  their worst pain intensity , assess their sleep quality from the previous 
evening, and  log study drug dosing  from the previous night  (post -randomization).  
Patients who wish to  withdraw from the study may do so at any time.  
Number of Patients  (planned):  
Approximately 470 patients  (235 per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with 
TNX -102 SL or placebo tablets. Randomized patients  who withdraw will not be replaced.

be withdrawn include duloxetine, milnacipran, preg abalin, gabapentin  and other forms of 
anticonvulsants , tramadol,  tapentadol, amitriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants, 
trazodone, narcotics/opioids, naltrexone (including CONTRAVE®), all other forms of 
cyclobenzaprine (AMRIX®, or generic equivalen ts), orexin receptor antagonists , and 
benzodiazepines.   
Therapies used to treat acute COVID -19 symptoms or severity, such as convalescent plasma, 
remdesivir, or dexamethasone  will be prohibited . Due to the exclusion of all opioids (including 
tramadol and tapentadol) during the treatment phase of the study, patients requiring opioids on a 
regular or frequent basis for any indication should not be considered.  
In addition, patients who are taking gabapentin, pregabalin, or any other anticonvulsant due to 
neuropathic pain should not be considered.  
Other prescription or over -the-counter medication not specifically excluded by entry criteria may 
be continued during the study, provided that the patient has been on this medication a stable dose 
for at least 4 weeks  (except for allowed antidepressants, which require 90 days at stable dose) 
prior to randomization  and is  not expecting to change dosages during the period of the study  
In addition, cert ain other medications will also be prohibited and may require washout or 
exclusion of the patient if washout is not appropriate (eg, trazodone, mirtazapine,  
levomilnacipran, nefazodone, benzodiazepines,  non-benzodiazepine sleep aids,  stimulants, 
sodium  oxybate, ketamine, esketamine, etc.).   
Patients  using teeth -whitening products such as whitening strips or prescription whitening 
products must agree to discontinue their use from the day of randomization until the end of their 
study participation.   
After ra ndomization, sedating antihistamines (eg,  diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) can be used as 
needed for insomnia; however, patients must be able to discontinue them during the Screening 
phase and must refrain from their use during the week of baseline data colle ction preceding 
Visit  2. The use of sedating  anti-histamines  after randomization should be  under the direction of 
the Investigator,  and such use should be minimized to  no more than a  few nights in a 
row, followed by attempts to refrain from use.     
The use  of non-prescription nutraceuticals  such as melatonin, ramelteon, and valerian root is not 
restricted.   
New medications that are deemed required, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or another 
physician, will be allowed, including medications nee ded to treat AEs. If there is a requirement 
for acute opioids, corticosteroids, or other treatments that could confound the evaluation of pain  
throughout the treatment period , the Investigator may consult with the Medical Monitor to 
potentially delay the s tudy visit until the medication is no longer needed. At a minimum, no 
opioid/narcotic should have been utilized within 2 days of a study visit, and ideally there will 
have been no usage during the 7 days prior to any visit, since important efficacy data wi ll be 
collected on the eDiary. 
Rescue medications used by patients throughout the study will be identified and documented 
during study visits.

Populations for Analysis:  
 In the case that the study goes to full enrollment or has a sample size increase, the following 
analysis populations are planned for this study : 
• All patients : Used for summaries of dispositions of patients; tabulations of dispositions 
may also use th e populations below.  
• Safety population: all patients who receive at least one dose of the investigational 
product. All safety analyses will be performed using this population, analyzed as treated.  
• Intention -to-treat (ITT) population: all patients who are r andomized. This is the primary 
population for efficacy analyses, and patients will be analyzed based on their randomized 
treatment.  
In the case of an early stop for efficacy  or futility  from the interim analysis, the following 
populations will be utilized:  
• All Patients: used for summaries of dispositions of patients; tabulations of dispositions 
may also use the populations below.  
• Interim Safety population: all patients who receive at least one dose of the investigational 
product and included in the cohort o f interim analysis patients. All safety analyses will be 
performed using this population, analyzed as treated.  
• Interim ITT population: all patients who are randomized and included in the cohort of 
interim analysis patients. This is the primary population f or efficacy analyses, and 
patients will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment.  
• Full Safety population: all patients who receive at least one dose of the investigational 
product. This will be used for supportive safety analyses on all patients exp osed in the 
study , analyzed as treated . 
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy parameter will be the difference  between TNX -102 SL and placebo in the 
weekly mean change  in worst pain  score from Baseline  to the Week 14 . The weekly pain score 
will be based on the weekly average of the daily diary patient self -reported 24 -hour recall worst 
Long COVID  pain intensity  scores using an 11 -point (0 −10) NRS . A weekly value will be 
calculated as long as at least one daily measure  is recorded .  
The primary ITT analysis will provide  the following causal  estimand  for the primary analysis: 
the difference in the weekly mean  change  from Baseline of the daily patient self -reported 24 -hour 
recall worst  Long COVID  pain intensity  rating usi ng an 11 -point (0 −10) NRS evaluated at the 
Week 14 endpoint in all randomized patients attributable to the initially randomized treatment 
assignment. The primary analysis will use a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
approach with multiple imputation (MI) for missing data.  Covariates in the model will include 
the fixed categorical effects of treatment, pooled site (with small sites pooled into a single large 
site), study week,  and treatment by study week interaction, as well as the continuous fixed

separate  Statistical  Analysis  Plan (SAP)  for more details on the primary and secondary analyses  
and handling of missing data .   
A hierarchical testin g strategy will be applied to perform confirmatory analysis of the primary 
endpoint and key secondary efficacy endpoints; testing will begin with the first endpoint 
(primary endpoint) and continue through the sequence of key secondary endpoints only until an 
endpoint is not statistically significant . The order will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
Safety Analyses : 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will 
be summarized overall and by preferred term and system organ class. AEs will also be 
summarized by severity and relationship to study drug. Serious AEs, AEs involving t he oral 
cavity , and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will also be summarized. Actual values 
and changes from Baseline for clinical laboratory test results and vital signs will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviat ion, median, range, minimum, and 
maximum). The number of patients with Baseline and treatment -emergent suicidal ideation 
and/or suicidal behavior or self -injurious behavior, based on the C -SSRS, will be summarized by 
treatment group.  
 
Sample Size:  
The stud y is planned to enroll approximately 470 patients total in a 1:1 randomization; that is, 
235 patients in each of the TNX -102 SL and placebo arms. Using a two -sided test with an alpha 
level of 0.05, a sample size of 235 per group provides a power of at leas t 90% if the effect size is 
0.3.  
 
Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be completed when approximate ly 50% of the initially planned 
enrollment is evaluable for efficacy assessments. The analysis will be conducted  for the purpose 
of potential  sample size re -estimation , early stop for futility, and early stop for efficacy . This will 
be evaluated by an independent data monitoring committee; only recommendations on early 
stopp ing, continuing with the sample size a s planned , or a sample size adjustment will be 
communicated to the Sponsor.  
In the case of an early stop for efficacy,  all ongoing patient s will be asked to return to the clinic 
and complete an ET Visit, and the study will be halted once all patient s have completed their 
termination visit.  
Full details of the interim analysis will be included in the SAP and finalized prior to execution of 
the interim analysis.

however, it is preferred that they are collected at Visit 2 whenever possible.   
The pharmacogenomic ana lyses will involve whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analysis for 
allelic polymorphisms related to treatment response to TNX -102 SL. It is presumed that unused 
sample will be stored up to 15 years, and potentially utilized to develop a pharmacogenomic test  
for determining likelihood of treatment response to TNX -102 SL.

be done at Day -8 or earlier.  
b  Patients who discontinue from the study before completing the Week 14 Visit will be asked to return to the site for an Early Termination (ET) Visit to have 
Week 14 assessments completed.  
c  Any additional (pre -screening) medical findings or medications discovered after the Screening Visit are to be noted in the medical history, 
Prior/Concomitant Medication Page s, respectively.  
d  A full physical examination, including measurement of height  and weight and calculation of the body mass index , will be performed at Screening.  
e  A brief physical examination will be performed at Baseline an d Week 14/ET. For patients for whom a telephone visit is being conducted for Week 14/ET, 
the brief physical exam will not be required.  
f  There will be a thorough examination (visual and palpation) of the oral cavity at the Screening Visit and then visual ex aminations at all other in -clinic visits. 
For visits at which a visual exam is not possible ( ie, telephone visit), the visual oral cavity exam is not required; in lieu of the in -clinic (or home visit) oral 
cavity exam, after conclusion of “any changes in your medical condition”, ask specifically if there have been any changes or problems in the oral cavity. 
Patients reporting any concerning lesion description or painful processes in the oral cavity possibly related to study drug e xposure should be strongly urged 
to come into clinic for an Unscheduled Visit for oral cavity exam. In circumstances in whi ch, due to the COVID -19 pandemic , it is not possible for the 
patient to return to the clinic for the Unscheduled Visit exam, a clinician certified by the Sponsor to conduct oral cavity e xamination should contact the 
patient by phone and obtain greater hist ory and description of the oral cavity AE by patient, potentially augmented with images of oral cavity taken by the 
patient and sent to the site for the examining clinician to textually document in the source.  In addition to the regularly scheduled in -clinic examinations, an 
unscheduled examination of the oral cavity in -clinic should be performed any time a patient contacts the clinic to report an oral cavity lesion or other oral 
AE possibly related to study drug exposure, other than oral  numbness, tingling , or noticeable taste (eg, bitter, metallic, or unpleasant) after dosing , which do 
not require unscheduled examinations.  
g  The Screening version of the mMBM will be administered.  
h  The Baseline/Post -Randomization version of the mMBM will be administered.  
i  For t elephone visits, the patient will be mailed all applicable patient reported outcomes for a given visit.  
j  Weekly recall of daily average Long COVID pain intensity on the NRS scale is required at the Screening Visit. Patients should only continue screening if  
they score ≥  4 and ≤  9.  
k  Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at Screening , Week 6,  Week 14/ET.  TSH , ESR,  and HbA1c will be tested at Screening only.  
l  Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV), hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) and hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsA g) testing will be performed at Screening and may be 
performed at other visits, at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor.  Medical Monitor approval is required for repeat testing.  
m  The urine drug screen is mandatory at Visit 1. If the screening urine drug screen ( UDS ) is positive for opioids, benzodiazepines, or amphetamines and 
washout is appropriate, the patient will need to return to the clinic for an unscheduled UDS prior to the beginning of the 7 -day baseline data collection phase 
leading up to V isit 2. Opioid  and stimulant retesting can be performed with an in -clinic UDS, whereas the UDS must be analyzed centrally in patients 
washing off of benzodiazepines.  Urine drug screening may be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion at any time.  
n  A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening, followed by in -clinic urine pregnancy tests at Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 10 , and 
Week  14/ET for women of child -bearing potential. For patients for whom a telephone visit is being conducted, the urine pregnancy test will be performed 
by the patient at home.  
o  Vital signs (oral temperature, sitting blood pressure and heart rate [obtained after resting for 5 minutes in a sitting posit ion]) w ill be measured at each visit . 
For patients for whom a telephone visit is being conducted, the vital signs will not be required.  
p  A 12 -lead electrocardiogram will be obtained at Screening.  All electrocardiograms will be performed and interpreted locally.  
q  Clinic staff members will train the patient on how to take the study drug and how to complete an electronic diary  (eDiary) . In addition, patients will be 
asked to complete a brief training on accurate pain reporting and placebo response reduction training at each study visit. Patients will be asked to complete

during the study.  
r  Patients will assess their worst daily Long COVID  pain over the last 24 hours every evening using an 11 -point (0 –10) numerical rating scale.  Patients 
should be instructed to complete their diary responses in the evening, but before taking their bedtime dos e of study drug.  The 24 -hour recall interval will 
assess the previous night’s sleep and symptoms of pain since bedtime the previous night.  
s  The study drug will be dispensed to patients at Baseline on Day 1 (following randomization) and at Weeks 2, 6, and 10 . One bottle will be dispensed on 
Day 1 , and two bottles will be dispensed at Weeks 2, 6 , and 10. For patients for whom a telephone visit is being conducted, the study drug will be mailed 
via courier to their home. Patients will be instructed to take 1 tablet of study drug sublingually every evening at bedtime for 2 weeks starting the evening of 
Day 1, and then 2 tablets sublingually every evening from Week 2 to Week 14.  
t  * The blood draw for the pharmacogenomic assessment can be obtained at any study visit post-Screening (including an ET Visit). Due to circumstances 
caused by the COVID -19 pandemic and the possibility of no further in -clinic visits after Baseline Visit (Visit 2), it is strongly recommended that the 
pharmacogenomics blood sample be obtained at  the Baseline Visit (Visit  2). It should only be obtained one time during the study.  Separate written, signed 
informed consent is required if the patient is to participate in the optional pharmacogenomic assessment.  
u  The Week 2, Week 6, and Week 10 Visits may be performed via telephone only when an in -clinic visit is not feasible due to the COVID -19 pandemic. 
Select safety assessments specifically required in -clinic will not be required for the telephone visits ( eg, vital signs and oral cavity exam). Teleph one visits 
for Week 14/ET Visits are to be strongly discouraged due to inability to obtain several safety measures ( eg, vital signs, physical exam, oral cavity exam, 
chemistry and hematology labs), but telephone visits will be permitted for Week 14/ET Visit if attendance of an in -clinic visit is absolutely impossible or 
refused by the patient as a result of the COVID -19 pa ndemic and it is not feasible for the site to conduct a home visit.  
v  Visit 7  (Week 16 or approximately 2 weeks after ET ) will be a telephone visit.  
w  Visit 8 (Week 18 or approximately 4 weeks after ET) will be a telephone visit.  
x  Confirmation of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection  can be obtained through either a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nucleic acid tests or a rapid antigen test. 
Acceptable documentation of SARS -CoV -2 infection may be through either a laboratory report or formal documentation either generated  at the point -of-
care or by a virtual at -home test proctor/telehealth service.

5.1. Overview of PASC  
5.1.1.  Definition  and Characteristics  
A set of symptoms experienced by people with a history of probable or confirmed SARS -CoV -2 
infection, usually 3 months from the onset of Coronavirus Disease 2019  (COVID -19), with 
symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an altern ative diagnosis , has 
been termed Post -acute Sequelae of SARS -CoV -2 infection (PASC) (colloquially known as 
“Long COVID” or “long haulers”). Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and 
cognitive dysfunction , as well as  others that generally have an impact on everyday functioning. 
Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COV ID-19 episode, or 
persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time (World Health 
Organization ; WHO 2021 ). 
The lack of a standardized definition for PASC makes it difficult to determine the exact 
epidemiology, incidence rates, and the impact of the condition on long -term disability. A 
conservative estimate based on data collected from numerous countries is that , on average , 30% 
(range 32.6% to 87.4%) of people with COVID -19 experience PASC (summari zed in 
Nalbandian et al. 2021 ).  
The WHO -endorsed definition states that PASC occurs in individuals with a history of probable 
or confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID -19 with 
symptoms th at last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. 
Therefore, PASC can broadly be described as the presence of one or more symptoms (continuous 
or relapsing/remitting; new or same symptoms of acute COVID -19) in individuals w ho have 
been infected with SARS -CoV -2 after the expected period of clinical recovery ( Raveendran et al . 
2021 ).  
Symptoms of PASC have been variably reported as including fatigue, muscle weakness, 
diaphoresis, myalgia, arth ralgia, chills, limb edema, dizziness, post-exertional malaise, cognitive 
dysfunction , respiratory symptoms (polypnea, chest pain, cough, sputum, sore throat), 
cardiovascular abnormalities, alopecia, olfactory abnormalities, psychosocial symptoms (such as 
sleep difficulties, depression, anxiety, feelings of inferiority ), and generally a worse quality of 
life ( Gagnier et al . Submitted ; Davis et al. 2021 ; Lambert et al 2021 ; Bierle et al. 2021 ; Crook et 
al. 2021 ; Raveendran et al. 2021 ).  
Fatigue is the most common symptom reported in PA SC patients, occurring in roughly 40% to 
80% of patients at an average of 4 to 8 weeks post -onset ( Crook et al. 2021 ; Davis et al. 2021 ; 
Lambert et al 2021 ; Lopez -Leon et al. 2021 ; Bierle et al. 2021 ). In a telephone study performed 
in the United States (US), of 488 patients, 32.6% reported persistent symptoms at 60 days 
post-discharge from the hospital, including 18.9% with new or worsened symptoms ( Chopra et 
al. 202 0). Fatigue has been reported in 7 7.7% of those with symptoms at  6 months post -
infection , according to a survey disseminated via email, social media, and online patient support 
groups  (Davis et al. 2021 ).  
Muscle pains and aches were reported in 4 3.7% of those with symptoms at 6 months post -
infection ( Davis et al. 2021 ). The authors noted that PASC features involving pain occurred more

influenza (24.0%). Also, pain was the only  feature that had a higher incidence in the 3 - to 6-
month period than in the 0 - to 3-month period. The authors conclude that pain appears to be a 
prominent and relatively persistent element of PASC  (Taquet et al. 2021 ).  
Clauw and colleagues from University of Michigan  are currently conducting a study to: (1) 
understand the experience of PASC among those who are Black or African American; and (2) 
identify factors that support or hinder their ability to manage and cope with  PASC symptoms. 
Data are collected using semi -structured interviews that are visually and/or audio recorded. Of 
those who have participated in the study thus far, a third have reported pain symptoms. Some 
patients reported swelling and pain in joints, either as an  exacerbation of previous pain or as  new 
pain.  The interviews revealed that the pain manifests mostly as headaches/facial pain, back pain, 
and joint pain and that it is either persistent or occurs in relapsing episodes. The pain was 
associated with  significant distress, functional impairments, and decrease in quality of life 
(Clauw et al. Data on File/ Personal Communication ).  
A variety of sleep disturbances have also  been reported in PASC. In one report, nearly 80% of 
PASC patients experienced sleep disturbances, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, 
vivid/lucid dreams, and nonrestorative sleep ( Davis et al. 2021 ). 
Al-Aly and coll eagues reported on the burden of PASC in a  large cohort that included 73,435 
users of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) with COVID -19 who survived for at least 
the first 30 days after their COVID -19 diagnosis and who were not hospitalized vs nearly 
5 million VHA users who were hospitalized but not for COVID -19. Individuals with COVID -19 
exhibited an excess burden of poor general well -being, including sleep -wake disorders (hazard 
ratio 14.53 [confidence interval (CI) 11.53−17.36]), malaise and fatigue  (12.64 [11.24 –13.93]), 
musculoskeletal pain (13.89 [9.89−17.71]), muscle disorders (5.73 [4.60 –6.74]), and arthralgia 
and arthritis (5.16 [3.18 –7.01]) ( Al-Aly et al. 2021 ). 
Therefore, PASC symptoms span multiple organ systems  and may have significant effects on 
physical and mental health, functional status, and quality of life.  
5.1.2.  PASC and Fibromyalgia  
Among the symptoms that characterize PASC, multi -site pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue 
have been reported in several longitudinal studies of PASC ( Lambert et al 2021 ; Davis et al. 
2021 ; Bierle et al. 2021 ). This has prompted several groups to propose that PASC may be a 
condition sim ilar to other central sensitization/nociplastic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia 
(FM), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ( Bierle et 
al. 2021 ; Ursini et al. 2021 ; Clauw et al. 2020 ). 
Multi -site pain in association with fatigue and cognitive and sleep disturbances, such as observed 
in patients with PASC, is a characteristic feature of FM ( Mease et  al. 2009 ). Pain associated with 
FM and other complex regional pain syndromes are generally independent of underlying tissue 
damage and are believed to reflect abnormalities of central pain perception ( Fitzcharles et al. 2021 ; 
Minhas et al. 2021 ; Kosek et al. 2021 ).  
A connection between PASC and FM has been proposed by other groups. Based on their analysis 
of patient appointment request documentation for 465 peopl e with confirmed or suspected

criteria for a significant post -viral syndrome with central sensitization, which they termed 
Post-COVID Syndrome (PoCoS). Furthermore, t hey proposed that , if these symptoms persist 
past 6 months, these patients may meet the clinical definition of one of the central sensitization 
syndrome disorders, such as FM, CFS, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome  (Bierle et al. 
2021 ).  
In a web -based survey distributed through social networks, Ursini and colleagues collected 
information from people who have had COVID -19 diagnosis 6 ± 3 months earlier using the 
American College of Rheumato logy 2010 FM Survey Criteria modified for self -administration. 
They found that , of the 616 responders, 189 (30.7%) met the criteria for FM after an average of 
6 months since COVID -19 diagnosis ( Ursini et al. 2021 ).   
We hypoth esize that chronic multi -site pain reported in PASC patients involves 
pathophysiological mechanisms similar to those of FM and nociplastic pain ( Clauw  et al. 2020; 
Bierle et al. 2021 ; Ursini  et al. 202 1; Fitzcharles et al. 2021 ; Minhas et al. 2021 ; Kosek et al. 
2021 ) and will therefore respond to treatments that are effective  in FM.  
5.2. Background of TNX -102 SL  
TNX -102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) is being developed through  505(b)(2) 
New Drug Applications ( NDAs ) for FM, post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Agitation in 
Alzheimer’s Disease , and Alcohol Us e Disorder  using AMRIX (extended  release [ER] capsule, 
30 mg; AMRIX® Prescribing Information, 201 9) as the reference listed drug. We are currently 
also developing TNX -102 SL for the treatment of  multi -site pain in PASC.  
The TN X-102 SL is a formulation containing 2.8 mg cyclobenzaprine HCl [3 -(5H-
dibenzo[a,d] cycloheptene -5-ylidene) -N,N-dimethyl -1-propanamine hydrochloride] for 
sublingual (SL) administration. The active ingredient in TNX -102 SL, cyclobenzaprine HCl 
(CBP), has bee n approved for use in the US since 1977, originally as FLEXERIL® 10-mg oral 
tablets indicated as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for the relief of muscle spasm 
associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The usual dose for this indic ation is 
30 mg or 15 mg per day taken as 10 mg three times daily ( TID) or 5 mg TID, respectively  
(FLEXERIL® Prescribing Information, 2013 ). The FLEXERIL® brand of immediate -release (IR) 
CBP  tablets was discontinued in May 2013. Generic CBP  is available and marketed in a variety 
of strengths , including 5 -, 7.5- and 10 -mg IR tablets. AMRIX® (AMRIX® Prescribing 
Information, 201 9), an ER capsule of CBP , was approved in 2007 in t he US through  an NDA 
and is currently available in 15 and 30  mg, taken once a day for the same indication as 
FLEXERIL® in the US. Both FLEXERIL® and AMRIX® are indicated for 2 –3 weeks use only. 
No CBP  product has been approved for use in PASC  by the Food a nd Drug Administration 
(FDA), Health Canada, or in any other country.  
In addition to its therapeutic effects on muscle spasm, CBP also exhibits functional antagonism 
of 5 HT2A, α1 -adrenergic, H1 -histaminergic, and M1 -muscarinic acetylcholine receptors , and 
these actions may underlie its putative ability to improve sleep quality. TNX -102 SL is a 
low-dose sublingual formulation of CBP being developed to provide greater diurnal variation in 
peak -to-trough drug levels to enhance nocturnal treatment effects whil e minimizing daytime side 
effects.

is mediated by targeting sleep disturbances. Prior s tudies performed in FM patients and PTSD 
patients saw that improvement i n sleep precede and predict improvements of global symptoms of 
these disorders. Thus, given that difficulty sleeping and chronic pain are common symptoms of 
PASC, the proposed treatment with TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg taken daily at bedtime may provide 
adequate rel ief of PASC symptoms by promoting improvement in sleep quality, and, 
secondarily, improvement in chronic pain, fatigue, anxiety and mood, and cognitive function.  
5.3. Scientific Rationale  
The symptoms of PASC can roughly be divided into 4 groups , including: 1)  direct organ or 
tissue damage due to the acute infection, 2) COVID -19-induc ed hypercoagulable states, 
3) mental health issues triggered by the infection, isolation , and  disparities in health, and 4) a set 
of non -specific symptoms including multi-site pain, sleep  disturbances , and fatigue  (Lopez -Leon 
et al. 2021 ; Sudre et al. 2021 ; Huang et al. 2021 ; Clauw et al. 2020 ). The develo pment program  
for TNX -102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets)  is aimed at palliation of this latter 
mechanism, focusing on identifying and treating individuals with multi -site pain  due to PASC  
who display the primary symptoms  observed  in common ove rlapping pain conditions , such as 
FM, CFS, tension headache, irritable bowel  syndrome , and bladder pain syndrome  (Fitzcharles et 
al. 2021 ; Kosek et al. 2021 ; Larkin et al. 2021 ; Kratz et al. 2021 ). 
5.3.1.  Case Definition of Multi -Site Pain Associated with PASC   
We define multi -site pain as chronic pain in 4 or more regions on the modified Michigan Body 
Map ( mMBM; Appendix 2), a self -report measure to assess body areas of chronic pain. The 
original Michigan Body Map  is depicted in Figure  1. 
In a series of studies using lower extremity arthroplasty as a model for pain originating in the 
periphery (which should be relieved with surgery), Dr. Daniel Clauw from the University of 
Michigan  and his colleagues showed that , for each 1-point increase in the 2016 FM Survey 
criteria, there was a 25% decrease in response to surgery intended to relieve pain  (Brummett et 
al. 2015a ), and, similarly, non -responsi veness to opioids (Goesling et al. 2016 ). In order to 
identify a data -driven cut -off point for multi -site pain,  they analyzed the data from Brummett et 
al. 2015a  specifically comparing the number of pain regions (out of a possible 7, including left 
arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, front of trunk, back of trunk, and head) to the incidence of the 
other key features of pain in central sensitization (memory and sl eep problems, fatigue, 
decreased functional status). They measured the participants’ ability to perform tasks (per 
PROMIS Physical Function Scale) scored on a numeric scale from 1 to 5 (see Figure  2 footnote 
for details). Before surgery ( Figure  2A), the average score of ≥ 3 (“with some difficulty”) for t he 
functional status measures was observed independent of the number of pain sites. Six months 
after the surgery ( Figure  2B), the average scores for only  those participants with ≥ 4 pain sites 
indicated at least “a little difficulty” with performing tasks (score of ≥  2). Furthermore, they 
observed an increase in the co -morbid non -pain symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep, memory and 
cognitive function, as the number of regions affected by pain increased from 3 to 4 ( Clauw et al. 
Data on file/Personal communication ).  
The MBM has been used to assess widespread pain in a number of recent studies ( Brummett et 
al. 2013a ; Brummett et al. 2013b ; Brummett et al. 2015a ; Brummett et al. 2015b ; Hassett et al.

Clauw et al, m ulti-site pain , defined as pain persisting in 4 or more regions  on the mMBM , 
would be indicative of the widespread pain associated with PASC .

5.3.2.  TNX -102 SL  in the Treatment of Fibromyalgia  
One Phase 2 and two Phase 3 studies evaluated TNX -102 SL  in patients with FM. Even though 
the Phase 2 study and the first Phase 3 study  (TNX -CY-F301), both using 2.8 mg dose of 
TNX -102 SL , narrowly missed on their  primary pain efficacy endpoint, both studies showed 
significant improvements in FM pain when analyzed  by other standard statistical approaches, as 
well as significant improvements in sleep quality, Patient Global Impression of Change , and 
fibromyalgia -specific measures.  
Based on these promising results, the next Phase 3 study (TNX -CY-F304 /F304 ) in FM  used 
TNX -102 SL at the 5.6 mg dose. In this 14-week randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter Phase 3 study , 503 patients were randomized to receive either TNX -102 SL or 
placebo. For the first 2 weeks of treatment, patients started on TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg (1 tablet) or 
placebo. Starting at the Week 2, all patients had t he dose increased to TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg 
(2 x 2.8 mg tablets) or 2 placebo tablets for 12 weeks of treatment. The study showed a  reduction 
in the weekly average daily diary pain scores at Week 14  (primary endpoint) . The treatment 
group difference (TNX -102 SL  minus placebo) in daily pain reduction was statistically 
significant ( p=0.010) in favor of TNX -102 SL. The primary efficacy analysis was also supported 
by an exploratory 30% responder analysis of daily diary pain ( p=0.006). A second Phase 3 study  
(TNX -CY-F306/F306)  with a similar design discontinued enrollment after an in terim analysis 
when an independent data monitoring committee recommended to stop the study early for 
futility . The study  did not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint in the weekly 
average daily diary pain scores at Week 14  (p=0.115) , which Tonix believes was due to an 
unexpected  higher rate of adverse -related discontinuations in both the active  and placebo groups  
compared to prior studies  of TNX -102 SL.  However, there wa s strong activity on sleep 
disturbance (p=0.004) and on the Patient Global Impression of Change ( p=0.038). Encouraged 
by these results, a  third potential pivotal Phase 3 study in FM with a similar design is currently 
ongoing.  
In the studies in FM patients , the improvement in pain can be  assessed by the mean change from 
Baseline to Week 14 in a score based on the self -reported 24 -hour recall of average pain intensity  
using an 11 -point (0 –10) numeric rating scale (NRS ). As in these studies , multi -site pain was 
reproducibly measured using the pain NRS diary , we intend  to measure effects of TNX -102 SL 
on pain in PASC patients as measured by the NRS diary.  
5.4. Rationale for Dose Selection  
Previous FM Phase 2 studies and the first Phase 3 study (TNX -CY-F301) used TNX -102 SL at 
the 2.8 mg dose. Although the study did not reach statistical significance for the primary 
endpoint of 30% responder analysis in pain ( p=0.095), most secondary endpoints, including 
many other common statistical analyses of pain  and sleep, were nominally significant. The 
second Phase 3 study of TNX -102 SL, TNX -CY-F302, was initiated in the first half of 2016 but 
was terminated upon receipt of the negative TNX -CY-F301 study primary analysis results. The 
findings from early Phase 2  and 3 studies used TNX -102 SL at the 2.8 mg dose  provided an 
opportunity to reassess the optimal dose of TNX -102 SL and the most appropriate study design 
for the subsequent Phase 3 study in FM, TNX -CY-F304.

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly

higher than 2.8 mg, in -clinic pain data from the Phase 2 study (TNX -CY-P201) in patient s with 
PTSD were analyzed. Study TNX -CY-P201 was more restrictive than TNX -CY-F301 in terms 
of allowable pharmacological pain ther apies, with exclusion of opiates, all antidepressants, and 
other pain treatments ( eg, gabapentin, pregabalin). Like TNX -CY-F301, TNX -CY-P201 allowed 
only use of acetaminophen or NSAIDs  for pain control. The TNX -CY-P201 subgroup included 
in this analysis co nsisted of patient s with Baseline NRS scores of ≥  4 for in -clinic assessments of 
average pain over the previous 24 hours, similar to the pain diary minimal pain requirement for 
randomization in the FM studies. Results showed that the TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg subg roup had the 
largest numerical improvement in pain scores at each post -baseline assessment (average 
difference from placebo in least squares mean change from Baseline across Weeks 2 through 12 
was -0.81 units), whereas the TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg subgroup was si milar to placebo. Numbers of 
patient s in each group were too small for appropriate power to show statistical significance of 
5.6 mg compared with placebo, but calculated effect sizes supported the effects of this dose on 
pain. The Cohen’s D effect size aft er 12 weeks of treatment for TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg over 
placebo was 0.34, which is a clinically meaningful reduction in pain and on par with the effect 
sizes on pain of the 3 FDA -approved pharmacotherapies for FM ( Perrot and Russe ll. 2014 ). 
These results of improved analgesic response while maintaining good tolerability in PTSD at 
5.6 mg supported the notion that increasing the dose studied in FM may have a greater analgesic 
response on FM pain while maintaining an acceptable level  of tolerability.  
A 5.6-mg dose of TNX -102 SL was used in the Phase 3 study F304. In Study F304, the primary 
efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Week 14 in the NRS weekly average of daily 
self-reported average pain intensity  scores. The treatment group difference (T NX-102 SL minus 
placebo) in pain reduction was statistically significant ( p=0.010) in favor of TNX -102 SL.  
Given the overlapping symptoms of pain reported in FM and PASC, we believe that  TNX -102 
SL 5.6 mg is a promising first -line therapy to treat the pro posed indication of multi -site pain 
associated with PASC.  
5.5. Conclusion  
We propose that PASC, characterized by a triad of multi -site pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, 
has features of central sensitization syndromes similar to FM. We propose to investigate  the 
efficacy and safety of TNX -102 SL, which has shown promising results in treating FM, as a 
treatment of multi -site pain in patients with PASC.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, parallel -group, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 14 -week study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2 .8 mg tablets) taken 
once daily at bedtime for the management of multi -site pain associated with Long COVID . The 
study is to be conducted at approximately  30 investigational sites in the US.  
The study will consist of a Screening Visit (Visit 1, Days -35 to -8), a Washout and Screening 
period of at least 7 days (for those patients not requiring washout) and no more than 35 days, 
inclusive of a 7 -day baseline data collection phase immediately pr eceding the Baseline Visit. 
Eligible patients who provide written informed consent will have study assessments performed at 
Screening. Due to limitations in the diary completion window, patients who are planning on 
international travel during the study per iod should not be considered for the study. Patients 
whose employment involves overnight shifts also should not be considered for the study due to 
the restricted completion window and the requirement for consistent bedtime dosing.  
At Screening Visit 1 and after signing the written informed consent, any required washout should 
be discussed with the patient  and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stopping 
any excluded medications. This down -titration and discontinuation of excluded medications  must 
be accomplished so that the patient  is free of excluded medications for at least 14 days prior to 
beginning of the collection of Baseline diary data that takes place during the 7 days leading up to 
the Baseline/Randomization Visit . Any additional tim e required for down -titration would be in 
addition to this washout requirement. For extenuating circumstances, the total duration of the 
Screening period may be increased to up to a maximum of 49 days with Medical Monitor 
approval.  All excluded medications  will be stopped during the Washout period through the 
Week  14/ Early Termination (ET) Visit  (Visit  6).  
Patients will be trained on use of an eDiary system at Visit 1.  
During the 7 -day run -in Phase (7 days immediately preceding Visit 2 [Baseline/Randomiz ation 
Visit; Day 1]) patients will be asked to record their worst daily Long COVID pain intensity  on 
the 11 -point (0 −10) NRS scale using 24 -hour recall  and assess  sleep quality from the previous 
evening, also using an 11 -point NRS scale. The average of the 7 days immediately preceding 
Visit 2 (Baseline Randomization Visit; Day 1) will serve as the Baseline pre -treatment scores.   
After completing any required washou t of excluded therapies and recording Baseline Diary 
scores for at least 7 days, patients will return to the investigative site for Baseline assessments 
and randomization (Day 1, Visit 2), when they will be randomly assigned to receive 
TNX -102 SL or matchi ng placebo sublingual tablets in a 1:1 ratio.  
During the treatment phase, e ach evening, the system will prompt the patient to reflect on the 
past 24 hours and record  their worst pain intensity , assess their sleep quality from the previous 
evening, and  log study drug dosing  from the previous night  (post -randomization).  
Patients will take the study drug SL once daily at bedtime, starting on the day of randomization  
(Day 1), for 14 weeks. For the first 2 weeks of treatment, patients will start on TNX -102 SL 
2.8 mg/day (1 tablet) or placebo . Patients will continue to record their worst daily pain, assess 
their sleep quality from the previous evening , and log study drug compliance .

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   All p atients will then return to the clinic at Week 2 (Visit 3) for efficacy an d safety assessments  
and assessment of study drug compliance . The study drug dose will be increased to 2 tablets 
(5.6 mg; 2 x 2.8 mg TNX -102 SL tablets  or placebo ) or 2 placebo tablets taken SL and 
simultaneously daily at bedtime . Patients will next return  to the clinic at Week 6 (Visit 4) for 
assessment of safety, efficacy, study drug compliance, and dose tolerability at the 5. 6-mg dose. 
In scenarios in which TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (or 2 placebo tablets ) is considered intolerable due to 
adverse event(s) (AEs) and would otherwise lead to study discontinuation,  with Medical Monitor 
approval,  the Investigator may lower the daily dose to 1 tablet every night (TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg 
or 1 placebo tablet). If/when it is deemed clinically warranted by the Investigator,  recha llenge 
with 2 tablets TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg (5.6 mg dose)/placebo may be attempted  or the patient may 
remain on the lower dose for the remainder of the study. It will be emphasized to Investigators 
that such dosage reduction should only be considered when the patient’s intolerability is 
sufficient to cause the patient to consider discontinuing from the  study. It will be emphasized to 
participating patients that they should only make changes in study drug dose upon consultation 
with the Investigator, and they should notify the clinic immediately if they think the dosage 
needs to be adjusted. Ideally, any  changes in dose should only be made at a scheduled visit, but, 
if it necessary to change dose between visits, the change should only be made upon the 
recommendation of the Investigator after discussion between the patient and the Investigator.  
Patients w ill return to the clinic  for safety , tolerability,  and efficacy assessments, and 
assessments of study drug compliance at Week 2 (Visit 3),  Week 6 (Visit 4), Weeks 10 (Visit 5) 
and 14 (Visit 6) or ET.  
Approximately 2 weeks after Week 14 (Visit 6), there wi ll be a Post -study  Safety Follow -up 
telephone call  (Visit 7), and approximately 4 weeks after Week 14, there will be a 1-Month 
Post-study Safety Follow -up telephone call (Visit 8) . 
Due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID -19 pandemic, an op tion for a 
telephone visit will be available for Weeks 2, 6, 10 (Visit s 3, 4, 5), and, only with Medical 
Monitor approval, Week 14/Visit 6 (or E T) for those unable to attend an in -clinic visit due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic . However , all visits should be con ducted in person whenever possible.  
The total duration of the study, including screening  and follow -up, may be as long as  25 weeks . 
The maximum treatment duration will be 14 weeks.  
Patients who wish to withdraw from the study may do so at any time.  
The study timeline and events schedule are provided in Table 2.

9.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Patients who are taking certain medications are eligible for the study if they are willing and able, 
and it is medically reasonable, f or them to be withdrawn from these medications prior to 
randomization and then refrain from usage during this study.  The specific medications that must 
be withdrawn include duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, gabapentin  and other forms of 
anticonvulsants , tramadol, tapentadol, amitriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants, 
trazodone, narcotics/opioids, naltrexone (including CONTRAVE®), all other form s of 
cyclobenzaprine (AMRIX®, or generic equivalents) , orexin receptor antagonists , and 
benzodiazepines.   
Therapies used to treat acute COVID -19 symptoms or severity, such as convalescent plasma, 
remdesivir, or dexamethasone  will be prohibited . 
Due to the exclusion of all opioids (including tramadol and tapentadol) during the treatment 
phase of the study, patients requiring opioids on a regular or frequent basis for any indication 
should not be considered.  In addition, patients who are taking gab apentin, pregabalin , or any 
other anticonvulsant due to neuropathic pain should not be considered.  
Other prescription or over -the-counter medication not specifically excluded by entry criteria may 
be continued during the study, provided that the patient  has been on this medication at a stable 
dose for at least 4 weeks  (except for allowed antidepressants, which require 90 days at stable 
dose) prior to randomization  and is not expecting  to change dosages during the period of the 
study.  
In addition, certain ot her medications will also be prohibited and may require washout or 
exclusion of the patient  if washout is not appropriate  (eg, trazodone,  mirtazapine,  
levomilnacipran, nefazodone, benzodiazepines,  non-benzodiazepine sleep aids,  stimulants, 
sodium  oxybate, ketamine, esketamine, etc.).  
Patients using teeth -whitening products such as whitening strips or prescription whitening 
products must agree to discontinue their use from the day of randomization until the end of their 
study participation.  
After randomization, sedating antihistamines ( eg, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) can be used as 
needed for insomnia ; however, patients must be able to discontinue them during the Screening 
phase and must refrain from their use during the week of baseline data col lection preceding 
Visit  2. The use of sedating  anti-histamines  after randomization should always be  under the 
direction of the Investigator,  and such use should be minimized to  no more than a  few nights in a 
row, followed by attempts to refrain from use.     
The use of non-prescription nutraceuticals  such as melatonin, ramelteon , and valerian root is not 
restricted.    
New medications that are deemed required, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or another 
physician, will be allowed, including medica tions needed to treat AEs. If there is a requirement 
for acute opioids, corticosteroids, or other treatments that could confound the evaluation of pain 
throughout the treatment  period,  the Investigator may consult with the Medical Monitor to

opioid/narcotic should have been utilized within 2 days of a study visit, and ideally there will 
have been no usage during the 7 days prior to any visit , since important efficac y data will be 
collected on the diary during the week leading up to each visit .    
Rescue medications used by patients throughout the study will be identified and documented 
during study visits.  
9.2. Alcohol and Cannabis/THC Use  
Patients utilizing cannabis/THC and alcohol are to be excluded if MINI 7.0.2 Module J  criteria 
are met for greater than MILD Cannabis Use Disorder or greater than MILD Alcohol Use 
Disorder in Module I during the preceding 1 year  (prior to the Screening Visit), OR if the 
Investigator is concerned that the patient’s use of cannabis/THC or alcohol could interfere with 
patient’s ability to provide reliable data or comply with the protocol. Cannabis/THC  and alcohol  
use is otherwise allowed, with caution. The screening drug scre en will also test for THC to 
provide the Investigator with information regarding exposure, and to ensure that all usage is 
disclosed and taken into consideration when conducting MINI Module J.  
9.3. Enrollment of Patients  
Before undergoing any study -related scre ening procedures, each potential patient must provide 
written informed consent. The Investigator  will then determine the potential patient’s suitability 
for the study by interviewing the patient and by performing per -protocol Screening assessments.  
Pre-randomization Approval by Tonix Pharmaceuticals will be required prior to Visit 2 in 
addition to satisfying all other eligibility and randomization criteria. If excluded medications  are 
to be withdrawn for the explicit purpose of participation in this study, the patient must have 
already provided consent and signed an ICF before the withdrawal or down -titration of any 
medication is  initiated .

10.1. Study Drug Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Study drug supplies will be packaged identically so as to maintain the integrity of the study 
blind. The study drug bottles will be labeled minimally with the following information:  study 
number TNX -CY-PA201 , Sponsor name and address, bottle number, quantity, storage 
conditions, usag e instructions, and caution statements for investigational new drug, ie, Caution: 
New Drug – Limited by United States Law to Investigational Use, and Keep Out of Reach of 
Children and Pets.  
Each study drug bottle will contain 40 tablets. One bottle will b e dispensed to each patient at 
Visit 2 (Baseline) , and then 2 bottles will be dispensed at Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 6), and 
Visit 5 (Week 10). This will provide the patient with enough tablets to cover the 2 or 4 weeks of 
dosing between visits, plus  additional tablets to cover loss and/or visit window variability. The 
patient should be instructed to take all the tablets in one bottle before opening the second bottle. 
The patient should be instructed to keep this study drug in a safe location out of e xtreme 
environmental conditions and out of the reach of children and pets, and be instructed that this 
drug is not to be taken by any individual other than the study patient. Each patient will also be 
instructed that they are expected to return both bottle s (even if empty) and all unused study drug 
at each clinic visit; unused drug will be counted to assess compliance with study drug treatment.  
Storage of the study drug at the investigational site should be under locked and secure conditions 
with limited staff access. Study drug should be stored at 20 −25°C/68 −77°F in a 
temperature/humidity -monitored room; however, additional details on acceptable brief 
excursions and other pertinent information will be provided to the site.  
10.2. Dosing Instructions  
Patients will be instructed to take 1 tablet of randomly assigned study drug TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg 
or placebo tablet sublingually  (under the tongue ) each evening at bedtime starting at bedtime on 
Day 1 (Day of Visit 2) and continuing through Day 14. At the Week 2  Visit, patients will be 
instructed to increase the dose to 2 tablets at bedtime, administered simultaneously and under the 
tongue beginning on Day 15 and continuing through the end of the study.    
The study drug should be taken at bedtime after teeth brus hing and other oral care has been 
completed. The mouth/sublingual area should be moist at the time of dosing, so the patient 
should drink a few sips of water prior to dosing, especially if prone to dry mouth. Patients will be 
instructed to place the 1 or 2 SL tablets under their tongue  (if 2, placed simultaneously under 
tongue)  and keep them there until they have dissolved (approximately 90 seconds). They should 
not swallow, crush , or chew the tablets. Patients should not eat , drink , or chew gum for at leas t 
15 minutes after dosing, and preferably not  drink any hot, cold , or acidic beverage  until morning. 
Patients also should not talk for at least 5 minutes after placing the study drug in the mouth 
(under the tongue). Patients will be reminded that only 2 ta blets are allowed per day. Note:  If the 
patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue dosing with 2  tablets the next evening; ie, 
they should not take more to make up for the missed dose.  
If the patient reports intolerable side effects that are l ikely to result in premature discontinuation 
from the study, then the dose of study drug may be reduced to 1 tablet sublingually nightly , with 
Protocol No. TNX -CY-PA201

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   Medical Monitor approval . Any reduction in study drug dose must be documented in the case 
report form ( CRF ). The goal is for the patient to be on a stable and final dose of study drug 
starting from  the Week 2 Visit, at the highest dose tolerated ( preferably  2 tablets daily at 
bedtime ). It is anticipated that only a few patients will require dosage re duction, as TNX -102 SL 
5.6 mg has been well -tolerated in previous Phase 3 studies  of TNX -102 SL . Moreover, the 
gradual titration from 1 tablet for the first 2 weeks to 2 tablets for the remainder of the study 
should help with  acclimation to the higher dose .  
10.3. Dispensing Instructions  
Each patient who has met the randomization criteria ( Section  8.4) will be assigned a double -
blind treatment bottle at Visi t 2 via the Interactive Response Technology ( IRT), with a unique, 
but otherwise random bottle number that is generated when the study coordinator successfully 
completes randomization procedures . Patients will take one sublingual tablet each evening at 
bedtime for the first 2 weeks.  
Beginning with the evening of the Week 2 Visit, patients will take 2 sublingual tablets each 
evening at bedtime, and will continue doing so throughout the course of the  study. Only in the 
event of AEs that might possibly lead to discontinuation can the patient reduce the dose to 1 
tablet per evening, with approval of the Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
 
Study treatments at maximum dosage for the double -blind treatment phase are either:  
 
Treatment A : 2  TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg tablets (“TNX -102 SL”) to be taken 
sublingually (simultaneously) once daily at bedtime.  
Treatment B : 2  placebo tablet (“placebo”) to be taken sublingually (simultaneously) 
once daily at bed time.  
 
In the event that a study drug bottle  is lost , a new bottle will be provided by the IRT when 
appropriately requested by the site and/or the Sponsor or designee.  
10.4. Release of Clinical Study Supplies to the Investigator  
Tonix or Tonix’s designee’s Standard Operating Procedures for releasing clinical trial supplies to 
the site will be followed.  
10.5. Study Drug Accountability and Reconciliation  
All patients will be expected to bring their bottle s of study drug with them to all s tudy visits  
(including empty bottles) . At each study visit, the site staff will inspect the drug bottle s and 
perform a count of the tablets remaining in the bottle s and document this in the patient’s record. 
An assessment of drug adherence should be done by the study staff to ensure that the patient 
understands all dosing instructions and is taking the drug as prescribed. Patients will be asked for 
an explanation if the count of returned study drug tablets indicates a discrepancy between the 
expected number of tablets dosed and the number returned in the bottles. If it is found that the 
patient is not taking the study drug as expected, the patient will be re -counseled  with 
instructions, and this should be noted in the patients’ records. A deviation should be recorded on 
Protocol No. TNX -CY-PA201

should be contacted.  In addition, if a patient fails to re turn >8 tablets within a 4 -week (or >4 in a 
2-week period), the PI is required to assess the patient for any potential drug abuse, misuse, or 
diversion. This assessment should be documented and reported within the Drug Accountability 
case report form.  
Tonix or its designee will perform drug accountability , which entails reconciliation between the 
amount of drug shipped to the study site, study drug assigned and dispensed to the patient 
(including returned unused assigned study drug), and study supplies th at were never dispensed 
and/or assigned to patients.

The overall  and detailed  schedule for study  procedures and visits  is provided in  Table 2.  
11.1. Visit 1 (Screening Visit: Day -35 to Day -7) 
11.1.1.  Informed Consent  
Before the potential patient has undergone any study -related screening procedures, including any 
down -titration or withdrawal of medications, the nature of the study and the potential risks 
associated with it will be explained to the patient, and the patient will be given an opportunity to 
ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are a nswered, but before proceeding 
further, the patient must read and sign a written ICF. This signed ICF will be retained in the 
Investigator ’s study file, and the date the patient signed the form will be entered into the CRF. 
The patient will be provided wit h a copy of his or her signed and dated ICF. The patient will be 
required to sign all updated ICFs . 
11.1.2.  Screening Overview  
The first study visit, Screening Visit 1, will be when  the study is thoroughly explained to the 
prospective patient , whe n written informe d consent will be obtained and documented, and whe n 
certain protocol -specified study procedures and assessments will be completed. Screening Visit 1 
will start a variable length Screening and Washout P eriod. The length of the Screening  and 
Washout P eriod i s to be no shorter than 7 days (since the “run -in” period during which baseline 
diary data are collected must be at least 7 days in duration), but may be as long as 35 days in 
order to accommodate medication washout or other study requirements.  For extenua ting 
circumstances, the total duration of the Screening period may be increased to up to a maximum 
of 49 days with Medical Monitor approval.   
If the patient  does not need to complete any medication washout, and assuming all screening 
procedures have been successfully completed and initial eligibility has been confirmed, then the 
patient  may begin the 7-day run -in period as soon as the Screening Visit has been completed.  
Yet, due to potential delays in the issuance of a final laboratory report ( eg, when a confirmatory 
analysis is required, typically on a urine drug screen analyte that is preliminarily positive), it is 
recommended that the Baseline Visit is sched uled at least 10 days from the Screening Visit. If 
the patient needs to complete medication washout prior to the start of the run -in period, the 
down -titration schedule for the patient and the date on which the patient should start the run -in 
period should  be provided in writing to the patient. It is acceptable if another clinic visit is 
deemed necessary by the Investigator  before initiating the run -in period (and should be recorded 
as an Unscheduled Visit). It is important to remember that any patient with  a positive urine drug 
screen (UDS) (for a drug requiring washout) must return to the site for a repeat UDS prior to 
beginning their 7 -day baseline data collection period.  The repeat UDS for benzodiazepines must 
be centrally analyzed; all others may be per formed on site. Patients who test positive for 
cannabis/THC at the Screening Visit but are deemed eligible to continue are not required to 
undergo repeat UDS testing.

11.2.2.  Baseline Visit  
For patients who have qualified for randomization, these assessments and procedures will be 
completed in the following general order:  
• Collect any new medical history information  
• Record any additional prior and concomitant me dication use  
• Targeted physical exam, focusing on previous and new findings and AEs  
• Oral cavity examination . This examination should include a careful visual 
examination of the sublingual area, tongue, buccal mucosa, lips, palate , and gums.  
Any abnormaliti es should be noted on the oral exam source document.  It is 
recommended that both non -significant as well as significant findings be noted so that 
there is a complete and accurate baseline assessment available for comparison to 
findings at later visits.  
• Administer Baseline/Post -Randomization Version of the mMBM  
• Administer the “Since Last Visit” version of the C -SSRS. Any patient exhibiting 
Type 3, 4, or 5 suicidal ideation or any suicidal behavior since the Screening Visit 
should be screen -failed and assessed for appropriate follow -up care.  
• Patient should complete the following PRO s: 
a. SDS 
b. PROMIS Short Form – Sleep Disturbance  
c. PROMIS Short Form v1.0 – Fatigue 8a  
d. PROMIS Short Form v1.0 – Cognitive Function - Abilities

IRT Randomization System  
• Assessment of eDiary compliance  of 24 -hour recall of worst  Long COVID  pain and 
sleep quality  
• Assess occurrence of AEs 
• Dispense bottle of double -blind study drug as assigned via the IRT  
• Review patient instructions regarding study drug dosing and assess drug compliance 
(Section  10.2 and Section  12.1.8 ). 
• Patients should complete the training on accurate pain reporting and placebo response  
reduction training  as required . 
• Optional blood draw for pharmacogenomic s (after the separate I CF has been signed 
for the pharmacogenomic substudy)  – It is preferred that the draw is done at the 
Baseline Visit  (Visit 2) ; however, it can be drawn at  a future visit . 
11.2.3.  Study Drug Dispensing  
Qualified patients will be assigned a treatment bottle number via the randomization system 
(Section  10.3). The treatment bottle numbers are random and unique and will not necessarily be 
dispensed in any  particular order. The treatment bottle number will be recorded in the patient’s 
records.  
11.2.4.  Patient Instructions  
After all assessments have been completed and before leaving the clinic at Visit 2, patients 
should:  
• Be dispensed a single unopened bottle of dou ble-blind study drug. The patient should 
be instructed to begin dosing with study drug at bedtime, starting the night of Visit 2.  
• Receive instruction regarding proper sublingual dosing technique and the time of 
expected dosing.  
• Receive reinforcement about the importance of completing all questions that will be 
asked on the daily diary and receive re -instruction, if necessary, on what they are to 
do if they have difficulties recording their information. NOTE: Patients should be 
instructed that they should co mplete their diary within the required time window.  
• Receive an appointment for Visit 3.  
• The patient should be instructed to call the site if they develop a lesion under the 
tongue or any other localized AE in the oral cavity thought potentially related to study 
drug exposure, specifically to determine if an Unscheduled Visit for an oral cavit y 
examination is necessary prior to the next scheduled visit. Reports of oral numbness, 
tingling , or noticeable taste ( eg, bitter, metallic, unpleasant) after dosing do not 
require unscheduled examinations.

11.6. Visit 6 (Week 14 or Early Termination)  
11.6.1.  Visit 6 (Week 14)  
Visit 6 should occur after 14 weeks of double -blind study drug treatment, scheduled at Day 9 9  
-4 / +7  days. At this visit, the patient will return all study drug and be instr ucted that there is no 
longer any need to complete the diary. If circumstances involving the COVID -19 have resulted 
in the patient being reluctant to attend this visit at the clinic, it should be strongly emphasized 
that a complete safety assessment at end  of study necessitates the in -person visit.  If the patient 
absolutely refuses or it is impossible to attend the clinic because of a COVID -19 pandemic -
related “stay at home” order or similar, the PI should discuss the case with the Medical Monitor. 
Approval  for a Week 14 telephone visit may be granted by the Medical Monitors on a case by 
case basis.  In cases in which it is feasible for a site’s own research staff, with or without a 
research clinician, to make a home visit for Week 14/Visit 6 (or ET), a home visit should be 
conducted rather than a telephone visit in order to collect greater safety data than the telephone 
visits allow. Home visits may be conducted by any qualified staff member and will allow, in 
addition to all procedures conducted in a telepho ne visit, collection of vital signs and weight, and 
venipuncture for Week 14/ET laboratory tests and, for women of child -bearing potential, 
collection of urine specimen for pregnancy test upon return to site. Home visits that include a 
clinician certified by Sponsor to conduct the oral cavity exam will additionally be able to include 
an oral cavity examination and a brief physical examination, allowing completion of all 
Week  14/ET safety assessments.  
The following assessments and procedures are scheduled for this visit in the following general 
order:  
• Record concomitant medication use  
• Perform brief  physical  examination, including measurement of weight  and calculation 
of BMI  (Telephone visit exception : brief physical exam  is not required ). 
• Oral cav ity examination. Ensure that this exam includes the sublingual area and that 
any abnormalities are carefully described on the oral exam source document.

• The request of the patient, Investigator, or Tonix, whether for administrative or other 
reasons  
• Pregnancy  
Patients who wish to terminate their participation in the study should be instructed to come to the 
clinic for an ET Visit. The purpose of the ET Visit is to obtain critical information about the 
patient’s participation and should be scheduled preferably b efore there has been a substantial 
lapse in study drug usage. However, even if there has been a drug lapse, the patient should be 
encouraged to return to the clinic for this visit and should be instructed to return all study drug 
and bottles. NOTE: These v isit procedures are not intended for patients who fail to qualify for 
randomization or for patients who withdraw from the study prior to receipt of a dose of double -
blind study drug.

nature of the visit will be documented in the CRF and in the source documents.  
Patients should contact the investigative site as soon as possible if they experience a lesion under 
the tongue or any other oral cavity  AE potentially related to study  drug exposure (other than 
transient numbness, tingling , or bitter /metallic/unpleasant  taste after dosing ), specifically to 
determine if they should return to the clinic for a n unscheduled oral cavity examination .   
Note: If an AE is ongoing at the time of the Week 14/ET visit  or there is suspicion that an AE 
has occurred due to the drug even after discontinuation , the patient may be brought in for an 
unscheduled in -person visit  for additional follow -up.

The primary efficacy endpoin t and many of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints in 
this study are derived from patient -completed assessments. Therefore, it is critical that these 
assessments are conducted in the specified order, according to specific instructions, and in a  
setting where the patient has minimal distractions and sufficient time to complete them. After 
completion of these assessments, the study coordinator, unless specifically prohibited by 
instrument instructions, should review the responses for completeness with the patient.  
12.1. Efficacy Assessments  
12.1.1.  Modified Michigan Body Map  
The MBM is based on the 2011 FM Survey Criteria, a tool that is commonly used to assess for 
the presence of multi -site pain in FM, a disorder characterized by widespread body pain, along 
with comorbid symptomatology similar to that experienced by patients with Long COVID . The 
2011 FM Survey Criteria include the assessment of pain in 19 specific body areas using the 
Widespread Pain Index (WPI). The areas from the WPI are then combined with th e Symptom 
Severity scale to assess the presence and severity of FM ( Wolfe et al. 2010 ; Wolfe et al. 2011 ). 
The MBM  is a graphic mannequin with the 19 areas from the WPI superimposed upon it in 
anato mically relevant locations. The MBM also contains 16 additional areas for more general 
use. The MBM, and its online version, have been validated in patients with chronic pain 
(Brummett et al. 2016 ; Hassett et al. 2019 ).  
Tonix Pharmaceuticals has modified the MBM (mMBM) in consultation with its authors.

12.1.2.  Sheehan  Disability Scale ( SDS) 
SDS is a brief self-reporting tool that rates the extent to which work/school, social life , and home 
life or family responsibilities are impaired by the symptoms on a 10 -point visual analog scale  
(Williams et al. 2000 ; Appendix 6). The 3 items can also be summed into a single dimensional 
measure of global functional impairment that ranges from  0 (unimpaired) to 30  (highly 
impaired). SDS wi ll be administered as shown in Table 2. 
12.1.3.  PROMIS Scales  
PROMIS is the Patient -Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 
(www.nihpromis.org ), an NIH -funded initiative to develop instruments to be used across chronic 
conditions.  
Three  PROMIS Scales will be assessed in this study, including the Sleep Disturbance scale 
(version 8a) ( Appendix 7), the Fatigue scale (version 8a) ( Appendix 8,) and the Cognitive 
Function – Abilities  scale (version 8a) ( Appendix 9). Each of these scales will be assessed as 
shown in Table 2.

The PGI -C is a validated instrument to gauge the patient’s assessment of change in condition  
(Guy. 1976 ; Dworkin et al. 2008 ;

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   Appendix  10). This form will be completed by the patient at time points shown in Table 2. 
12.1.5.  Post-COVID -19 Functional Status ( PCFS ) scale  
PCFS scale is an ordinal scale for assessment of patient -relevant functional limitations over time 
after COVID -19 infection ( Klok et al 2020 ; Machado et al 2021 ; available at  
https://osf.io/qgpdv/ ; Appendix  4). The PCFS scale will be administered as shown in Table 2. 
12.1.6.  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  – Patient version  
The ISI is a 7-item self -reported questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomnia ( Spielman et al. 1987 ; Morin et al, 2011 ; Appendix 11). 
The usual recall period is the “last month” and the dimensions evaluated are severity of sleep 
onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, 
interfere nce of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by 
others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. The ISI questionnaire  will be administered as 
shown in Table 2. 
The scores  range from 0 (no problem) to 4 (very severe problem) yielding a total score ranging 
from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as:  
0–7 = absence of insomnia  
8–14 = sub -threshold insomnia  
15–21 = moderate insomnia  
22–28 = severe insomnia  
12.1.7.  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  
The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire with 8 questions  (Johns 1991 ; Appendix 12). The 
patient rates from 0 to 3 their usual chances of dosing off o r falling asleep while engaged in 
8 different activities. The total score can range from 0 to 24, with higher rating indicat ing higher 
average sleep propensity in daily life . The ESS questionnaire will be administered as shown in 
Table 2. 
12.1.8.  eDiary  
The daily eDiary is an important aspect of this study, and all patients must receive training 
explaining what is being asked of them, when to complete the diary, and how to use the diary 
system effectively. Patients will be trained on use of the diary system at Visit 1. Additionally, 
patients should complete the training on accurate pain reporting and placebo response reduction 
training as required.  
During the 7 -day run -in Phase (7 days immediately preceding Visit 2 [Baseline/Randomization 
Visit; Day 1]) patients will  be asked to record their worst daily Long COVID pain intensity on 
the 11 -point (0−10) NRS scale using 24 -hour recall and to assess sleep quality from the previous 
evening, also using an 11 -point NRS scale. The average of the 7 days immediately preceding 
Visit 2 (Baseline Randomization Visit; Day 1) will serve as the Baseline pre -treatment scores.

Version 3.0 – 13Oct2022   Page 71 of 113 
The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   During the treatment phase, e ach evening, the system will prompt the patient to reflect on the 
past 24 hours and record  their worst pain intensity , assess their sleep quality from the previous 
evening, and  log study drug dosing  from the previous night  (post --randomization).  
Patients will receive instructions and a password that uniquely identifies them when they log into 
the diary system , along with instructions about what to do if they have difficulty completing the 
diary.  
The diary should be started the evening of Visit 1 and completed daily until Visit 6 (Week 14). 
Patients should be instructed to complete the diary in the evening befor e dosing. Once the patient 
has properly identified themselves, the diary will prompt answers to the following:  
• Rate your worst Long COVID pain intensity during the last 24 hours on a scale from 
0-10, where 0 is “no pain ” and 10 is “pain as bad as you can i magine” . Rate your 
sleep quality last night on a scale from 0 −10 where 0 is the “best possible sleep”  and 
10 is the “worst possible sleep” . 
After randomization to study drug at Visit 2, the following questions will be added to the daily 
diary (starting in the evening of the day after randomization, Day 2):  
• Did you take your study drug last night? (Yes/No)  
• If yes, how many tablets of study drug did you take last night? (1 tablet/2 tablets)  
 
Appendix  13 details additional information about the eDiary . 
The study staff will be expected to monitor patient compliance  throughout the study and will be 
instructed to call the patient should any proble ms or significant non -compliance  be observed. 
During the Screening period, there are diary compliance requirements that must be met in order 
for the patient to qualify for randomization. Patients will receive a reminder to complete their 
diary if they miss diary entries. Patients who miss 2 diary entries will be flagged by the IRT 
system, and site staff will be alerted to contact patients for re -training and to instruct the patient 
on the importance of routine completion of their diary.  
12.2. Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by evaluation of AEs, vital signs, responses on the C-SSRS , and by 
clinical laboratory and physical examination findings, including visual inspection of the oral 
cavity.  
12.2.1.  Adverse Events  
Patients will be monitored for AEs throughout the study. Any clinically significant abnormal 
findings at Screening should be recorded in medical history. A Es will be recorded after the 
informed consent is signed. AEs that are spontaneously reported or elicited or observed are to be 
recorded on the CRF with the date, time of onset, date and time of resolution, severity, 
seriousness, causality (relationship to study drug), actions required, and outcome. Additional 
questions will be triggered for AEs involving the oral cavity ( Section 12.2.5 ).

Version 3.0 – 13Oct2022   Page 72 of 113 
The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   To elicit AEs, non -leading, simple questions with minimal connotations should be used as the 
initial questions at all evaluation points during the study. Examples of these questions can be:  
• How have you felt since your last visit?  
• Have you had any health problems since your last visit?  
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as deemed appropriate.  If 
an AE is unresolved on the last day of the study, an effort should be made to follow up until the 
AE is resolved or stabilized, the patient is lost to follow -up, or there is some other resolution of 
the event.  
There are many symptoms associated with Long COVID  that can vary in intensity and frequency 
over time. Only symptoms that worsen or become more frequent and , in the opinion of the 
patient , are outside of their normal experience should be reported as AEs. 
Additional information regarding definition and reporting requirements for AEs, serious adverse 
events  (SAEs) , and pre gnancies is provided in Section  14. 
12.2.2.  Oral Adverse Events  
Patient s should contact the investigative site as soon as possible if they experience a lesi on under 
the tongue or any other AE thought to be due to study drug exposure (other than transient 
numbness, tingling or bitter/metallic/unpleasant taste after dosing), specifically to determine 
whether an Unscheduled Visit is necessary prior to the next s cheduled visit. If the patient  does 
not call the site to discuss the oral cavity AE, the oral cavity exam should be performed at the 
next regularly scheduled visit and any findings noted. If a telephone visit, the patient should be 
queried if there have be en any changes or problems in the oral cavity. Patients reporting any 
concerning lesion description or painful processes in the oral cavity possibly related to study 
drug exposure should be strongly urged to come into the clinic for an Unscheduled Visit fo r an 
oral cavity exam. This exam must be performed by a qualified licensed medical professional who 
has been specifically trained and certified by the Sponsor to conduct this exam. In circumstances 
in which, due to the COVID -19 pandemic it is not possible for the patient to return to the clinic 
for the Unscheduled Visit exam, a clinician certified by the Sponsor to conduct oral cavity 
examination should contact the patient by phone and obtain greater history and description of the 
oral cavity AE by patient,  potentially augmented with images of oral cavity taken by the patient 
and sent to the site for the examining clinician to textually document in the oral exam source 
document.  
12.2.3.  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C-SSRS is a questionnaire de veloped by researchers at Columbia University to assess and 
track suicide risk and behavior.  This scale is intended to be used by individuals who have 
received training in its administration. The questions contained in the C-SSRS  are suggested 
probes. Ulti mately, the determination of the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior depends on 
the judgment of the individual administering the scale.  
Two versions of this questionnaire will be utilized in this study. At Visit 1, the 
“Baseline/ Screening” questionna ire will be administered , and the recall periods will be “lifetime” 
and “within the past 6 months ” for suicidal ideation and “within the past 1 year” for suicidal

Type 3, 4 , or 5 suicidal ideation)  within the past 6 months or a history of suicidal behavior  within 
the past year  will be excluded from participation, with recommended referral for appropriate 
intervention.  
At all subsequent visits (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), the “Since Last Visit” version of the 
questionnaire will be administered, and the recall period on this will be “since the last visit”.   
12.2.4.  Physical Examination  and Vital Signs  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Visit 1. The co mplete physical 
examination may exclude rectal, genitourinary, and breast examinations.  
Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and heart rate, temperature, and weight) will be assessed at 
Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , and 6 /ET (unless a telephone visit, in which case  vital signs will not be 
assessed at Visits 3, 4, 5, and  6/ET). Height will be measured without shoes at Visit 1 only. The 
BMI will be a derived variable, based on height and weight entries (but a Week 14/ET weight 
will not be assessed, if approved by the Medical Monitor for a telephone visit).  
12.2.5.  Visual Examination of the Oral Cavity  
A thorough examination (visual plus palpation) of the oral cavity will be completed at Visit 1, 
with visual examinations performed at each subsequent study visit (Visits 2, 3, 4,  5 and 6/ET). 
Visual exam of the oral cavity will not be performed if it is a telephone visit. This examination 
should include a careful visual exami nation of the sublingual area, tongue, buccal mucosa, lips, 
palate , and gums, aided with a tongue depressor , as well as palpation of the lips, hard palate, and 
floor of the mouth.   
Each examination must be performed by a qualified medical professional who has been 
specifically trained and certified by the Sponsor for this examination. An oral cavity examinatio n 
may also be required at an Unscheduled Visit if a patient reports an oral AE that requires follow -
up prior to the next scheduled visit.  
12.2.6.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The clinical laboratory evaluations to be performed in this trial are listed in Table  3. Those 
marked as screening tests will be performed at Screening only. All other tests will be performed 
at the Screening Visit , Visit  4/Week 6 , and a t Visit 6/ET (Week 14), aside from urine pregnancy 
tests and ad hoc urine drug screens. Testing for HIV, HCV , and hepatitis B surface antigen  
(HBsAg ) will be performed at Screening and may be performed at other visits  at Investigator’s  
or Sponsor’s  discretion.  
With the exception of the urine pregnancy test or an ad hoc urine drug screen, all clinical 
laboratory evaluations will be analyzed via a central clinical laboratory, and information 
regarding appropriate sample volume, collectio n tubes, sample labeling and handling, and 
shipment will be provided in the clinical laboratory manual.  
As per Exclusion Criterion # 14 any patient with evidence during the preceding year of drug or 
alcohol use disorder by MINI or history  is ineligible.

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   A centrally analyzed UDS will be performed at Visit 1. If the patient has a positive drug screen 
at Visit 1 due to a drug of abuse ( eg, cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy ) or due to a non-
disclosed opioid, amphetamine , or benzodiazepine, then he/she should be  screen -failed.  As 
discussed in Section 9.2, patients utilizing cannabis/THC are to be excluded if MINI criteria are 
met for greater than MILD Cannabis Use Disorder during the preceding 12 months, OR if the 
Investigator is concerned tha t the patient’s  use of cannabis/THC could interfere with patient ’s 
ability to provide reliable data or comply with the protocol . Otherwise, patients utilizing 
cannabis or THC products are allowed, w ith caution .  
The screening drug screen will test for THC to provide the Investigator with information 
regarding exposure, and to ensure that all usage is disclosed and taken into consideration when 
conducting MINI Module J. Repeat testing of THC is not necessary for patients testing positive 
for cannabis/THC at screening.  
Any patient deemed appropriate for washout of a prescription opioid, benzodiazepine , or 
amphetamine will require a repeat UDS before the beginning of their 7 days of baseline data 
collection leading up to V isit 2, the results of which must be ne gative and available for review 
before randomization may occur . Therefore, these patients will need to return for an 
Unscheduled Visit after the first 2 weeks of Washout have been completed. All benzodiazepine 
drug screening must be sent to the central lab oratory for analysis ; hence , results may be delayed . 
All other repeat urine drug screening may be conducted on  site. Patients do not have to wait for 
confirmation of negative centralized benzodiazepine results before starting their 7 -day baseline 
data collection phase, but all results must be confirmed negative prior to randomization.   
Patients with a positive screening UDS due to an allowed prescription drug ( eg, headache 
remedies containing butalbital) do not require further drug screening.   
Each clin ically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality 
should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely 
to resolve. If such abnormalities do not return to normal within a r easonable period, their 
etiology should be identified and T onix or designee should be notified. Clinically significant 
abnormalities in laboratory values after the Screening Visit labs will be recorded as AEs . 
NOTE: A screening TSH level greater than 1.5 t imes higher than the upper limit of normal, 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >  7.5%, or ALT or AST level > 2 times the upper limit of normal, 
is exclusionary; however, the patient may remain in screening to undergo repeat liver function 
assessments if a transie nt abnormality (eg, viral illness; effects of a medication being 
discontinued, etc .) is thought to be responsible for their initial elevation.

for the study.  
12.2.7.  Electrocardiogram  
A 12-lead ECG will be performed at Visit 1 and reviewed by the Investigator for the purpose of 
excluding from participation patients who have either a history of or current evidence  of 
clinically significant cardiac disease ( eg, significant arrhythmias or heart block, left bundle 
branch block, heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction within 
the preceding 2 years) , or a QTcF at Screening >  450 msec if male or 470 msec if female.  The 
ECG interpretation by the Investigator will be recorded in the CRF as normal, abnormal but 
clinically insignificant, or abnormal and clinically significant.  In addition, the standard ECG 
parameters including rhythm, heart ra te, and intervals for RR, QT, PR, QRS, and QTcF 
(Fridericia’s correction) will be recorded.  
If the Investigator has any concerns about the eligibility of a patient or wishes to confirm his/her 
assessment, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Mo nitor for this study.

For optional pharmacogenomic analy ses, blood samples will be obtained from each patient who 
provided separate written, signed informed consent  for pharmacogenomic analysis. These 
samples may be obtained at any post -screening visit, including an ET Visit; however, it is 
preferred that they are collected at Visit 2 whenever possible. The purpose of this testing is to 
allow for whole genome  sequenc ing (WGS) and analysis for allelic polymorphisms related to 
treatment response to TNX -102 SL .  
Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for additional details on the sample collection methods 
and materials used in this study.  
Unused extracted DNA may be store d up to 15 years and potentially utilized to develop a 
pharmacogenomic test for determining the likelihood of treatment response to TNX -102 SL. A 
decision not to participate in optional pharmacogenomic testing will not affect the patient’s 
eligibility for the main study. Patients have the right to stop participating at any time during the 
study or during the time of sample storage, and, if a patient decides to withdraw from the 
pharmacogenomics portion of this study, any remaining sample will be destroyed a nd not used 
for further research. Data collected before a patient’s withdrawal from the pharmacogenomics 
portion of this study will remain in the research database and included in the Sponsor’s analyses 
and reports.

A complete description of the statistical analyses to be performed will be provided in the 
study -specific statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock and 
the unblinding of study treatments.  
Baseline will be defined as those values recorded closest to, but prior to administration of , the 
first dose of study drug.  
13.1. Populations for Analysis  
 In the case that the study goes to full enrollment or has a sample size increase, the following 
analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• All Patients : used for summaries of dispositions of patient s; tabulations of dispositions 
may also use the populations below.  
• Safety population: all patients who receive at least one dose of the investigational 
product. All safety analyses will be performed using this population, analyzed as treated.  
• Intention -to-treat (ITT) population: all patients who are randomized. This is the primary 
population for efficacy analyses, and patients will be analyzed based on their randomized 
treatment.  
In the case of an early stop for efficacy  or for futility from the interim analysis, the following 
populations will be utilized:  
• All Patient s: used for summaries of dispositions of patients; tabulations of dispositions 
may also use the populations below.  
• Interim Safety population: all patients who receive at least one dose of the in vestigational 
product and included in the cohort of interim analysis patient s. All safety analyses will be 
performed using this population, analyzed as treated.  
• Interim ITT population: all patients who are randomized and included in the cohort of 
interim a nalysis patient s. This is the primary population for efficacy analyses, and 
patients will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment.  
• Full Safety population: all patients who receive at least one dose of the investigational 
product. This will be used for supportive safety analyses on all patients exposed in the 
study , analyzed as treated . 
13.2. Estimate  of Sample Size  
The study is planned to enroll approximately 470 patients total in a 1:1 randomization , 
235 patients in each of the TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg and placebo arms. Using a two -sided test with an 
alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 235 per group provides a power of at least 90% if the effect 
size is 0.3.

Demographic and baseline characteristics suc h as age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, weight, 
BMI, family status, education, employment status, smoking history , and MINI modules (A, C, I, 
J, K, O) will be summarized by treatment group (TNX -102 SL and placebo) and overall using 
descriptive statistics.  
Medical History will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)® and summarized by system organ class (SOC) and Preferred Term using frequency 
counts by treatment group.  
13.4. Efficacy  Analyses  
13.4.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy parameter will be the contrast between TNX -102 SL and placebo in the 
weekly mean change in worst pain score from Baseline to Week 14. The weekly pain score will 
be based on the weekly average of the daily diary patient self -reported 24 -hour recall worst Long 
COVID pain intensity  scores using an 11 -point (0−10) NRS. A weekly value will be calculated 
as long as at least one daily measure is recorded . 
The primary ITT analysis will provide the following causal estimand for the prim ary analysis: 
the difference in the weekly mean change from Baseline of the daily patient self -reported 24 -
hour recall worst Long COVID pain intensity  rating using an 11 -point (0−10) NRS evaluated at 
the Week 14 endpoint in all randomized patients attribu table to the initially randomized 
treatment assignment.  
The primary analysis will use a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach with 
multiple imputation  (MI) for missing data. Covariates in the model will include the fixed 
categorical effects of treatment, pooled site  (with small sites pooled into a single large site ), 
study week, and treatment by study week interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates 
of baseline score and baseline score by study week interaction.  An unstructured covariance 
structure will be used to model the within -patient errors.  If this analysis fails to converge, the 
following structures will be tested in this order: firs t order ante dependence, heterogeneous first 
order autoregressive, heterogeneous compound symmetry, and compound symmetry with the 
first to give convergence used. The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom ( DDFM) with the unstructured matrix; other covariance 
structures will utilize the sandwich matrix and the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) default 
DDFM.  The least square  (LS) means and differences across the 20 MI rep eats will be combined 
using SAS procedu re MIANALYZE ( Rubin , 1976 ).  Significance testing will be based on least -
squares means and two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be presented. The p -values will be 
compared against a two-sided alpha of 0.046.  
13.4.2.  Missing  Data  Imputation  
For individual daily pain scores, since a mean is used in the calculation of the primary endpoint, 
it is not necessary to replace values missing on random intermittent days; weeks will have 
average values as long as a single value for that week is present.

13.5. Sensitivity Analyses  
The primary analysis will be followed by several sensitivity analyses. The  SAP will include full 
details of the sensitivity analyses planned for this study.  
13.6. Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population.  For the purposes of possible 
label claims and reported p -values entered into the multiplicity algorithm, an approach identical 
to the primary analysis will be used for all key secondary continuous outcomes.   
Analys es of other  continuous secondary endpoints will be similar to the analysis of the pr imary 
endpoint, utilizing MMRM , but without MI for missing data . Significance tests of treatment

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   differences will be based on least -squares means , and corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated.  
A categorical analysis of PGIC will compare the treatment arms with a difference in proportions 
Z test (equivalent to a Pearson’s Chi Squared).  Subjects with results of “very much improved” 
or “much improved” (defined as responders) will be compared to al l other categories (defined as 
non-responders).  Subjects with missing data will be considered non -responders.  The 
percentages of responders and the 95% CIs of the percentages as well as the difference in the 
percentages and its 95% CI will be reported. A summary of frequency counts for all PGIC 
responses for each time point will be presented; Week 14 is of primary interest and all other time 
points are considered exploratory.   
To adjust for multiplicity and to control for overall type I error, a sequentia l test procedure will 
be applied to the  primary and key secondary  efficacy endpoints. If the primary analysis produces 
a result that is statistically significant at the two-sided 0.046 level, a significance level of 0. 046 
will be used for comparing the key secondary endpoints in an ordered fashion. If the analysis for 
a key secondary endpoint does not produce a statistically significant result at the 0. 046 level, 
then the remaining key secondary endpoint analyses will aut omatically be considered non -
significant regardless of the p -value produced. In the case of an early stop for efficacy, this will 
be the same as the stopping criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint (secondary endpoints will 
be tested at p -value = 0.005,  one-sided).   
The order in which the key secondary endpoints are to be tested will be specified in the SAP.  
No other adjustments for multiplicity will be made , and other p -values displayed in the output 
will be considered for descriptive summary purposes only and will not be used for formal 
inference. Full details regarding the statistical analyses for the listed endpoints, including 
graphical presentations, can  be found in the SAP . 
13.6.1.  Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Exploratory efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population. Details on exploratory 
efficacy analyses can be found in the SAP.  
13.7. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Popu lation. The analysis of safety 
assessments in this study will include summaries of the following safety and tolerability data 
collected for each patient:  
• Incidence of AEs 
• Changes from Baseline in clinical laboratory tests  
• Changes from Baseline in vital sig ns 
• Changes from Baseline in physical examination findings including examination of the 
oral cavity  
• Monitoring suicidality using the C -SSRS

Version 3.0 – 13Oct2022   Page 81 of 113 
The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   All AEs, treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE s), and SAE s will be coded using the 
MedDRA.  
An AE summary table will  be presented for the following:  
• All TEAEs  
• TEAEs  by severity  
• TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation  
• TEAEs by relationship  
• SAEs  
• Oral cavity TEAEs  
• Oral cavity TEAEs by severity  
Summaries of incidence rates (frequencies and percentages), of individual A Es by MedDRA 
SOC and preferred term will be prepared. Such summaries will be displayed for all TEAEs, oral 
cavity TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severity, and TEAEs by strongest relationship to study 
drug.  
Each patient will be counted only once within each summat ion level (SOC; preferred term). If a 
patient experiences more than one  TEAE within each summation level, the TEAE with the 
strongest relationship or the maximum severity, as appropriate, will be included in the 
summaries of relationship and severity.  
In the AE data listings, all AEs will be displayed.  
Laboratory data include analytes for chemistry and hematology , and these will be summarized by 
treatment and visit for the Safety Population. Descriptive summaries of actual values and 
changes from Baseline will be presented by study visit and last available assessment for each 
clinical laboratory analyte and each treatment group. 95% confidence intervals will be presented 
for change from Baseline.  
Laboratory values will be displayed in the data listings with their corresponding normal ranges, 
and those values  that are outside the normal range will be flagged.  For each laboratory analyte, 
shifts in assessments of abnormality from Baseline to each scheduled time point will be 
presented in shift tables.  
A by -patient listing of all clinical laboratory data will al so be provided.  
Descriptive summaries ( n, mean, standard deviation , median, range, minimum, and maximum) 
of actual values and changes from Baseline at each assessment time point and last -available 
assessment will be calculated for vital signs including weight, BMI, body temperature, pulse 
rate, systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure. Ninety -five- percent  confidence 
intervals will be presented for change from Baseline.  
Based on the C -SSRS results, the overall number of patients wi th lifetime and/or current suicidal 
ideation (by item and category), suicidal behavior (by item and category), or self -injurious 
behavior at the Screening and Baseline Visits will be summarized by visit and treatment group.   
Addi tionally, the number of subjects with increase over baseline in suicidal ideation at any time

prohibited.   point will be reported.   The maximum ideation across all visits for a subject will also be 
summarized with counts and percentages both for all subjects and among  subjects with an 
increase in ideation.  Likewise, the count and percentage of subjects with any suicidal behavior 
will be reported along with a summary of the most extreme behavior each subject reported.  
Physical examination data and oral examination data  will be presented in data listings.  
13.8. Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis will be performed when approximately 50% of  the initially planned 
enrollment is evaluable for efficacy assessments.  This interim analysis will be performed by an 
unblinded team separate from the team responsible for the conduct and analysis of the study. An 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (I DMC) will review the data and recommend to the 
Sponsor one of the following:  
• Stop the study early for efficacy if the one -sided alpha for the primary endpoint is less 
than 0.005  
• Increase the sample size by a fixed amount  
• Keep the current sample size and continue as planned  
• Stop the study early for futility  if conditional power at interim is <20%  
The recommendations are nonbinding, and the Sponsor may make adjustments other than those 
detailed above; however, the Sponsor will receive no information other than the 
recommendations listed.   
These assessments will be based on the primary analysis of the primary outcome; however, the 
committee will have additional outputs such as demographics, dispositions, and other key 
efficacy analyses. If the p -value for the primary falls short of stopping for efficacy, but the 
conditional powe r (CP) based on this is still greater than 90%, then the IDMC will recommend 
no change in sample size.  If the conditional power is less than 90 % but greater than or equal to 
20% the  IDMC will recommend an increase in sample size, with the maximum increase limited 
to 220 additional subjects and any increase done in blocks of 20 subjects. The increase will be 
chosen with the goal of increasing the sample size by the minimum number of s ubjects sufficient 
to raise the conditional power to at least 90%.  If the 220 subject increase is insufficient to 
increase the power over 90%, an increase of 220 patients will be recommended as long as the CP 
at the original planned sample size of 470 pat ients is over 20%. If the CP is below 20%, then the 
recommendation will be to halt the study for fut ility.  No further information will be provided to 
the sponsor beyond this recommendation.  
The interim analysis will be conducted approximately 18 weeks aft er randomization of 
approximately 235 participants, i.e. when approximately 50% of the initially planned participant 
enrollment (470) is evaluable for efficacy assessments (approximately 14 weeks); and related 
data cleaning, database freeze, and administra tive tasks have been completed on this cohort 
(approximately 4 weeks).  
In the case of an early stop for efficacy  or futility , all ongoing subjects will be asked to return to 
the clinic and complete an early termination visit, and the study will be halted once all subjects 
have completed their termination visit.

prohibited.   13.8.1.  P-value Adjustment  for the Interim Analysis  
 The interim analysis will test the primary and key secondary  outcome s at the one -sided 
alpha=0.005 for the purposes of an early stop for efficacy; if the study is not stopped, the 
corresponding final alpha level to account for the first stage alpha spend (should the study 
continue to full enrollment) will be 0.046 (two -sided).  For simplicity, 95% confidence intervals 
will be reported throughout, but for the purposes of study success, label claims and multiplicity, 
p-values will be compared to 0.046.  
Data from the interim and post -interim cohorts will be combined using the inverse normal 
method  (Cui et al . 1999 ): 
𝑍1=Φ−1(1−𝑝1) 
and 𝑍2=𝑤1𝑍1+𝑤2Φ−1(1−𝑝2)           (1) 
where:  
Z1 = the Z statistic for the first stage  
Z2 = the combination test statistic at the end of the second stage  
wi = the weighting applied for each associated Z statistic  
p1 = the first stage p -value p2 = the second stage p -value based on the  second stage participants 
The weights are defined prospectively according to the square -root of the planned proportion of 
participants in the two stages, relative to the preplanned total enrollment of 470 participants, as 
w𝑖 = √0.5. To control the type  I error, adaptive changes of  the stage wise sample sizes will not 
lead to changes of the weights ( Lehmacher and Wassmer . 1999 ). 
  
Full details of the interim analysis will be included in the SAP  and/or IDMC Charter  which will 
be finalized prior to execution of the interim analysis.

EVENTS  
14.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
According to International Council for Harmonisation  (ICH) guidance E2A, Clinical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient  admi nistered a pharmaceutical 
product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disea se temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
A TEAE is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study treatment or was present 
prior to study treatment but increased in  frequency or severity following initiation of study 
treatment.  
14.2. Adverse Event Recording  
14.2.1.  Coding the Adverse Event  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs. MedDRA  v24.1 and 
WHODRUG Global (B3 format)  will be used as the standard coding dictionary for AEs and in 
describing the patient’s medical history, and  the WHO Drug Dictionary will be used to code 
concomitant medications. Informal descriptions should be avoided.  
14.2.2.  Severity of Adverse Event  
AEs should be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the following definitions.  
• Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of minor irritant type 
causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a 
medical evaluation; signs and sy mptoms are transient.  
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by simple 
therapeutic measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference w ith 
functioning.  
• Severe: Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference be tween the terms 
“serious ” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarcti on); the event itself, however, maybe of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a p atient's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   14.2.3.  Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the following 
descriptions.  
• Not Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related to the study 
drug beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, another cause of the event is most plausible; 
and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is  inconsistent with the onset of the 
event and the administration of study drug and/or a causal relationship is considered 
biologically implausible.  
• Unlikely Related:  This category applies to an AE that could reasonably be considered 
caused by something els e, and where there is no known or expected response pattern 
to the suspected study drug.  
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected  
response pattern to the suspected study drug, but that could readily have been 
produced by a number of other factors.  
14.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Drug Reactions  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically  significantly abnormal 
laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) so 
that Tonix may comply with regulatory obligations. If the SAE is life -threatening or fatal, it must 
be reported to Tonix or its desig nee(s) immediately, by facsimile and telephone.  For these and all 
other SAEs, an SAE report form must be completed and sent by facsimile or email to Tonix or 
its designee(s) within 1 working day of the site’s initial awareness of the event. These 
requireme nts apply equally to all patients, regardless of the study phase or the at -risk patient’s 
treatment assignment or dosage.  
An SAE  (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires  in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• Is an important medical event . 
 
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definitio n of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in d eciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to preven t one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should 
also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  The 
development of C -SSRS suicidal ideation type 4 (intent) or type 5 (specific plan and intent) any 
time after consenting to the study should always be reported as an SAE. Add itionally, since only 
Types 1 and 2 are allowed at Screening or Baseline, the development of C -SSRS Type 3 (method 
but no plan or intent) after consenting should always be reported as an AE.   
Any death occurring during the study, during the per -protocol fo llow-up period, or reported to 
the Investigator after study participation (no required post -study time limit) must be reported to 
Tonix or its designee(s) immediately, whether or not it is considered treatment -related.  Initial 
SAE reports must be followed by detailed descriptions. These should include copies of hospital 
case records and other documents when requested. Telephone reports must be confirmed 
promptly either by facsimile or by e -mail. For reporting SAEs, Tonix’s designated Medical 
Monitor should be called, and the relevant forms submitted to Premier pharmacovigilance  within 
24 hours of the site’s awareness of the SAE.  The contact information for the Medical Monitor s is 
as follows:  
The Investigator, or the Sponsor or designee in the case of a central institutional review board 
(IRB), also must notify the ethics committee (EC)/IRB of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, 
as soon as is practicable and in accordance with local law. A copy of this notification must be 
provided to Tonix or its designee.  
In the event of an SAE that meets the criteria for ex pedited reporting, an investigational new 
drug (IND) Safety Report will be prepared for submission to the FDA.  
Clinical investigators also have the authority to unblind their own SAE patients  if/when the 
unblinded treatment information could impact the pat ient’s clinical management. There is a 
module within the IRT system for investigators’ use if “emergency” unblinding is required; 
however, the Investigator is requested to confer with the Medical Monitor before taking any 
action. The need for emergency unb linding is not expected for this study, in light of the nature of 
the study drug.

The active pharmaceutical product in TNX -102 SL  is cyclobenzaprine HCl, which is in 
Pregnancy Category B ( AMRIX® Package Insert, 20 20). All pregnancies occurring during the 
study (after exposure to study drug) or within 28 days after discontinuation of study drug must be 
followed until resolution ( ie, birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the pregnancy). All 
women  of childbearing  potential  are therefore  required  to continue  contraception  for 28 days 
after study  drug discontinuation.  Any patient found to be pregnant at any time during the study 
will be withdrawn from the study immediately. Any pregnancy out come that meets the criteria 
for an SAE will be reported as an SAE.

TERMINATING THE STUDY  
15.1. Protocol Modifications and Deviations  
The Investigator will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the written protocol a nd 
protocol amendments. All protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the 
appropriate EC/IRB before the revised protocol can be implemented. Emergency revisions that 
eliminate an apparent hazard to patients do not require preapproval by the E C/IRB.  However, the 
EC/IRB must be notified, in writing, as soon as possible after the modification has been made. A 
copy of this communication must be forwarded to Tonix.  
15.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time at the discretion of Tonix, its designee, or 
the Principal Investigator.  Should premature termination be considered necessary, written 
notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided, and specific 
procedures for termination will be arra nged. Circumstances that may warrant premature study 
termination include, but are not limited to, the following : 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients  
• Failure to enroll  patients at an acceptable rate  
• Insufficient adhere nce to the requirements of the protocol  
• Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug  
In the event that the study is terminated prematurely, all study materials must be returned  to 
Tonix or its designee.

16.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by the 18th World Medical 
Assembly General Assembly ( Helsinki, 1964 ) and amendments and clarifications ad opted by 
subsequent General Assemblies. The Investigator will make sure that the study described in this 
protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, the protocol, current FDA 
regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, G ood Laboratory Practices (GLP) 
guidelines, local ethical and regulatory requirements, including the Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act, US applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), and any EC /IRB  
requirements relative to clinical studies. As requ ired by the US FDA, the study drug may not be 
shipped to any participating Investigator until the requisite study documentation has been 
submitted to the IND.  
Should a conflict arise, the Investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the 
greater protection to the individual patient. The Investigator will also make sure he or she is 
thoroughly familiar with the appropriate administration and potential risks of administration of 
the study drug, as described in this protocol and the Investigator’ s Brochure, prior to the 
initiation of the study.  
16.2. Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (EC/IRB) Review  
The EC/IRB must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 
21 CFR Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards.”  This prot ocol, any protocol amendments, the 
associated ICFs , and the informed consent procedures must be submitted to the EC/IRB for 
review and approved before the enrollment of any patient into the trial.  
All types of patient recruitment or advertising information  must be submitted to Tonix or its 
designee and to the EC/IRB for review and approval prior to implementation. EC/IRB approval 
of any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes outlined in the 
amendments are put into effect, except when  the amendment has been enacted to eliminate a 
potential hazard to study patients. In such cases, the chair of the EC/IRB should be notified 
immediately and the amendment forwarded to the EC/IRB for review and approval.  
16.3. Written Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain signed written informed consent from each 
potential study patient prior to the conduct of any screening or other study procedures. This 
written informed consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives , and potential risks of the 
study have been fully explained to the potential patient. The Investigator must explain to each 
patient that he or she is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any 
time. NOTE:  Patients on antide pressant therapy should be warned of a potential serious drug 
interaction and should be advised to contact their study site immediately if they experience any 
symptoms that might represent possible serotonin syndrome, including fever, confusion or 
agitatio n, hallucinations, sweating, high or low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, tremor, muscle 
rigidity , or nausea, vomiting , or diarrhea.

Version 3.0 – 13Oct2022   Page 90 of 113 
The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   The patient should also be asked in the ICF for permission for the Principal Investigator or his 
designee to contact the p atient’s other personal physicians, as appropriate, concerning 
participation in the study.  
The method of obtaining and documenting informed consent and the contents of the ICF will 
comply with ICH GCP guidelines, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 50, “Protec tion of Human 
Patient s,” the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, and all 
other applicable regulatory requirements. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, 
and dated by each patient prior to entering the t rial or prior to performing any study procedure.  
The original signed and dated ICF will be kept on file at the study site. Patients will be given a 
copy of the signed ICF and will be informed of any new developments during the course of the 
study that migh t influence their continued participation in the study.  
The Investigator or a qualified designee will be available to answer each patient’s questions 
throughout the study, and all questions must be answered to the patient’s satisfaction.  If the 
protocol is  amended and a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each patient’s further 
consent must be obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the EC /IRB , prior to 
subsequently obtaining each patient’s consent.  
Receipt of written informed conse nt will be documented in each patient’s or potential patient’s 
CRF. The signed ICF must remain in each patient’s study file and must be available for 
verification by study monitors at all times.  
Separate written, signed informed consent must be obtained if  the patient is to participate in the 
optional pharmacogenomic assessment.

AUDITS  
17.1. Maintaining Privacy and Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability records, and other 
documents, including communications between the study site and Tonix, will identify patients 
only by their initials and their assigned study identification numbers. If required, the Investigator 
will grant monitors and auditors from Tonix or its desi gnee and/or regulatory authority’s access 
to patients’ original medical records for verification of the data gathered on the CRFs and to 
audit the data collection process. Patients’ confidentiality will be maintained , and patient 
information will not be ma de publicly available unless mandated by applicable laws and 
regulations.  
17.2. Maintaining Essential Clinical Documents  
Study site files for the retention of regulatory documents will be established at the beginning of 
the study, maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to FDA and ICH/GCP 
guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements.  The records maintained must be adequate to 
fully document appropriate protection of study patient s/patients, the validity of the study, the 
integrity of  the data, and the manner in which the study was conducted.  
The Investigator’s site file, copies of protocols, CRFs, originals of test result reports, drug 
disposition logs, correspondence, records of written informed consent, and other documents 
pertainin g to the conduct of the study must be kept on file by the Investigator and in readily 
accessible order for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application, until at 
least 2 years have elapsed after formal discontinuation of the clinical  development of the 
investigational product, or according to local regulatory requirements. No study document may 
be destroyed without prior written consent from Tonix or its designee. Should the Investigator 
wish to withdraw from the responsibility of kee ping the study records, custody must be 
transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility. Tonix must be notified in writing in 
advance if a custodial change is to occur. It is important that the Investigator remain ready to 
provide background i nformation from the archived study records on request.  
The Sponsor or designee will maintain adequate study records for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after clinical development of the study 
drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  After that period, the sponsor will be 
contacted to determine whether the study records will be forwarded to the sponsor, destroyed, or 
kept at the location of the designee or another facility for a longer period of time.  
17.3. Data Handling  
Unless otherwise specified, procedures, data collection and evaluation will be conducted as per 
the Standard Operating Procedures of the contract research organization (CRO). The Investigator

The contents of this document are confidential to Tonix. Unauthorized use, disclosure or  reproduction is strictly 
prohibited.   All laboratory results will be analyzed by an accredited and lice nsed clinical laboratory facility.  
Clinical laboratory data will be transferred from the central laboratory to the clinical database 
maintained by the CRO using systems that are validated and Part 11 -compliant.  
The responsible clinical study monitor(s) will check data at the monitoring visi ts to the clinical 
study site.  The Investigator will ensure that the data collected are accurate, complete, and legible.  
Any changes made to the clinical data will be documented with a full audit trail.  
Aspects of the clinical and statistical phases of the  study, including all associated documentation , 
may be reviewed by the Quality Assurance Unit of the CRO  using a risk -assessment approach.  
The final clinical and statistical report will be audited to ensure that, as far as can be reasonably 
established, th e methods described and the results reported accurately reflect the raw data 
generated during the study.  
17.4. Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study patient.  
Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by Tonix or its designee. Data (including AEs) will be 
recorded on raw data sheets and/or electronic or paper source documents.  
If selected data are collec ted via paper (patient questionnaires, etc.), the data must be entered into 
the CRF and verified that it has been transcribed correctly.  
17.5. Clinical Laboratory Certification  
A central clinical laboratory will be used to analyze all samples in this study, with  the exception 
of the post-Screening urine pregnancy tests and ad hoc urine drug screens. The Investigator must 
maintain,  on file, written evidence that the central clinical laboratory to be used is certified under 
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act o r equivalent certification (depending on local 
regulations). Further, the Investigator will maintain a copy of the certification, the range of 
normal values, the effective dates for the ranges, and the units of measurement for all laboratory 
tests requeste d in the protocol. If any of the laboratory measurements will be transformed and/or 
categorized in any way, a description of the procedures(s) used should be included. The 
Investigator is expected to receive these documents before the shipment of clinical supplies.  
17.6. Site Monitoring and Tonix’s Right to Review Records  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Tonix and/or its designee will be implemented 
to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP and GLP guidelines.  
Tonix’s designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact the Investigator and 
conduct regular visits to the clinical site. In extenuating circumstances related to the COVID -19 
pandemic, remote monitoring will be permissible. The monitor will be expected and al lowed to 
verify the Investigator’s qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study 
records, including proof of EC/IRB review, with the stipulation that patient confidentiality will 
be maintained in accordance with local and federa l regulations, including HIPAA requirements.  
The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting 
CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data. CRFs will be checked for 
accuracy, completeness,  and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source

uninterpretable data will be resolved in coordination with the Investigator.  
The monitor/audi tor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory 
requirements. Any administrative concerns will be clarified and followed.  The monitor will 
maintain contact with the site through frequent direct communications with the study site by 
e-mail, telephone, facsimile, and mail. The Investigator and all other site personnel agree to 
cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and 
all questions raised and difficulties detected by the monitor . 
17.7. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the EC/IRB, and/or Tonix or their 
designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study documentation 
for on -site audit or inspection and will retai n this right from the start of the study to at least 
2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after clinical 
development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued. The 
Investigator is  required to guarantee access to these documents and to cooperate with and support 
such audits and inspections.

prohibited.   18. CONFIDENTIALITY  
18.1. Protection of Patient Anonymity  
The Investigator must make sure that each patient’s anonymity is maintained. On CRFs or other 
documents submitted to Tonix or its agent, patients should not be identified by their names, but 
rather by their initials and the assigned study identification numbers. The Investigator should 
keep a separate record of the patient initials, randomization cod es, patient names, address, and 
contact information. Documents that contain the names associated with these initials and codes 
are not for submission to Tonix or its agents ( eg, written ICFs ). These records should be 
maintained by the Investigator in stric t confidence except to the extent necessary to allow 
auditing by regulatory authorities, Tonix, or its agents. These records should be kept in 
compliance with HIPAA regulations.  
18.2. Confidentiality of Study Information  
All information relevant to this study, w hether supplied by Tonix or its agents to the Investigator 
or collected by the Investigator in support of this study, is privileged and confidential.  The 
Investigator agrees to use this information to carry out the study and will not use it for other 
purpo ses without written consent from Tonix. It is understood that the Investigator is under 
obligation to provide Tonix with all data obtained during the study. The information obtained 
from this study will be used by Tonix toward the clinical development of t he indicated 
investigational drug and may be disclosed by Tonix to regulatory authorities, other Investigators, 
corporate partners, or consultants as required.  
18.3. Publication of Data and Protection of Trade Secrets  
No presentations, abstracts (including meeti ng abstracts), or other publications based on the 
conduct or results of this study will be permitted without the express written permission of Tonix 
or its designated agent. All such presentations or publications will proceed only as collaborations 
between  Tonix and the Investigators.  
If the Investigator wishes to publish the results of this study, a copy of the proposed manuscript 
or abstract (including meeting abstracts) will be provided to Tonix or its designee for review, 
revision, and approval at least  60 days before the expected date of submission for publication, 
unless otherwise arranged with Tonix in writing.  This will enable Tonix to protect its proprietary 
information and augment the publication with insights or information of which the Investigat or 
may not be aware.  
Patient names and other identifiers, such as photographs or audio or video recordings, may not 
be disclosed in any publication or public forum without prior written authorization from the

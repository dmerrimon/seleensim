Activated Charcoal in Healthy Volunteers   
   
October 18, 2019  Page 9 of 23 2019LS014  
 1 Objectives  
1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective  is to c ompare 2 extemporaneously prepared Medical Grade Activated 
Charcoal, “ AC” suspensions at 2 doses ( 4 combinations in total) in healthy volunteers for 
palatability/tolerability . 
1.2 Secondary Objective  
Determine the incidence of grade 2 and above SAEs deemed at least probably related to AC.   
2 Background  and Rationale  
2.1 Infectious Complications in Chemotherapy  
Antibiotics disrupt gut microbial communities (dysbiosis). A large fraction of most antibiotics, 
even when administered intravenously,  reaches the colonic lumen and its commensal flora. 
Antibiotics can reach the gut lumen via mechanisms that include incomplete absorption in 
the small bowel (e.g., macrolides)1, hepatic excretion via bile (e.g., tetracyclines)2, or active 
transfer across t he intestinal mucosa into the gut lumen (e.g., fluoroquinolones)3.  
In the absence of antibiotics, a stable and diverse gut microbiota effectively inhibits colonization by potential pathogens. In the presence of antibiotics, however, pathogenic organisms c an grow and cause intestinal and systemic infections. The best example for such 
infections is C. difficile  infection (CDI). Even a single dose of an antibiotic (e.g. pre -operative 
single -dose intravenous antibiotic) can lead to CDI.  Surprisingly, no attempts have been made 
to prevent dysbiosis in individuals exposed to antibiotics . A novel strategy that protects the 
indigenous microbiota without detracting from the beneficial effects of antibiotics could 
prevent pathobiont outgrowth and reduce infectious complications  of antibiotic use . 
2.2 Prevention of Dysbiosis 
It is important to discover ways to  prevent the untoward consequences of dysbiosis  in 
individuals exposed to antibiotics . The use of  oral AC, a potent non -absorbable adsorbent, 
may protect the gut microbiota by adsorbing the fraction of intravenous (IV) antibiotics that 
ultimately reaches the intestinal lumen.  
2.3  Activated Charcoal  
Activated charcoal (AC) is a processed form of carbon with small, low -volume pores that 
increase the s urface area available for adsorption. As a potent adsorbent with no systemic 
absorption from the gut, AC is a standard and effective agent used in the management of poisonings when gastrointestinal decontamination of drugs or chemicals is indicated.  
Activated Charcoal in Healthy Volunteers   
   
October 18, 2019  Page 10 of 23 2019LS014  
 2.4 Ration ale 
Investigators are looking for new ways to p rotect  the microbiome during the period of 
antibiotic exposure, improve the safety of antibiotics and reduce the rate of dysbiosis -related 
complications  in patients. Determining the palatability  and tolerability of AC  in healthy 
volunteers  in this research will aid in the design of future trials to investigate the efficacy of 
AC in patients . 
3 Study Design  
We will use the powder form of medical grade oral AC and mix it with liquids for 
administration. 12 healthy volunteers will be enrolled to determine the two most palatable 
and tolerable AC combinations. There  will be a total of 4  combinations (2 AC doses and 2 
solution s) in stage 1. Each participant will drink an assigned combination every day for 3 
consecutive days  (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, “M/T/W”)  and switch to a different 
assigned combination M/T/W the following week.  AC solution  assignments will be defined 
before the study using a balanced incomplete block design.  Each subject will rate their  
experience using a 5 -point scale every day  for the 12 days  they are on study .  
The following outcome variables will be measured:  
(i) Each healthy volunteer will rate their experience using a 5 -point scale (1=terrible, 
2=bad, 3=okay, 4=good, 5=great) every day.    
(ii) To evaluate tolerability, after each round of study product consumption, a member 
of the study team will contact the subject a nd screen for grade 2 or higher AEs and 
SAEs  
4 Participant  Selection  
Study entry is open to adult volunteers  regardless of gender or ethnic background. While 
there will be every effort to seek out and include women and minorit ies, the subject  
population is expected to reflect the population  of Minnesota.  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria   
• Age ≥18 years  
• No use of prescription medications , including oral birth control,  currently or in the last 
30 days  
• Sexually active women must be using an effective form of contraception.  Note that 
subjects who are on oral contraception should use an additional form of contraception such as barrier methods, as AC may interfere with the efficacy of oral 
contraceptive.  
Activated Charcoal in Healthy Volunteers   
   
October 18, 2019  Page 11 of 23 2019LS014  
 • Voluntary written consent signed before performance of any study -related 
procedure  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
• At risk of GI hemorrhage or perforation due to underlying pathology, recent surgery, 
or medical conditions that could be adversely affected by the administration of AC.  
• Planning to have an endoscopic procedure  
• Known h ypersensitivity to AC  
• Non -English speakers  
5 Patient Registration  
Registration will occur after the participant  has signed the subject consent and eligibility is 
confirmed, but before any study procedures have occurred. To be eligible for registration to 
this study, the participant  must meet each criteria listed on the eligibility checklist (found in 
appendix I) based on the eligibility assessment documented in the participant ’s research  
record.  
5.1 Participant  Identificatio n 
Healthy Volunteers will respond to poster advertisements containing a brief study 
description and the contact information of the study coordinator.  
5.2 Study Enrollment and Dose Level Assignment  
Upon completion of the screening evaluation, eligibility confir mation and obtaining 
written consent the Study Coordinator or designee will enroll the volunteer  on study in 
OnCore.  
The Primary Clinical Research Coordinator (PCRC) or designee will assign the study dose -
solution  and add the on -study  date to complete enrollment.  
5.3 Participants  Who Do Not Begin the Study  
If a pa rticipant  is registered to the study, and is later found not able to begin the study, 
for any reason, the pa rticipant  will be taken off study. The Study Coordinator or designee 
will update OnCore of the participant ’s non-study  status. The participant  will be replaced 
to fulfill enrollment requirements.  
6 Study  Plan  
6.1 Healthy Volunteers  
6.1.1 Dose Assignment  
Activated Charcoal in Healthy Volunteers   
   
October 18, 2019  Page 12 of 23 2019LS014  
 Dose  assignments will be defined at the time of study registration  using a balanced 
incomplete block design (Table 1).   
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
The dose levels are 12  and 25 of medical  grade oral AC . While the standard AC dose for 
poison control is 25 -100 grams, these smaller doses have been chosen to ensure safety.   
The AC  will be mixed with 4 oz of either tap water  or apple juice  for a total of 4  
combinations.  
6.1.2 Consumption of Study Product (Oral AC)  
Participants will report to the University of Minnesota Health Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) on a daily basis and consume the assigned combination of oral AC. Each 
participant will drink an assigned combination every day for 3 consecutive days  
(M/T/W ) and  switch to a different assigned combination for the 3 days  (M/T/W) the 
following week .
 Subjects will drink AC in sitting position.  Subjects must stay in the 
research unit for 15 minutes  after consuming AC to be observed for aspiration.  
6.1.3 Experience Rating  
After drinking the solution, e ach subject will rate their experience using a 5 -point scal e 
(1=terrible, 2=bad, 3=okay, 4=good, 5=great) every day  (Appendix III) . They will be asked 
to do this daily starting day 1 (Mon of week 1) through day 12 (Friday of week 2).  
6.1.4 Compensation  
Each of the healthy volunteers participating this pilot study will receive an Amazon gift card for $50 .

 6.2 Subject  Monitoring  
Healthy volunteers  will be observed for fifteen minutes  after consuming the AC .  Upon 
leaving the research unit, t hey will have access to the CRA via phone.  For 2 days after 
each round of study product consumption, a member of the study team will contact the 
subject and screen for all grade 2 or higher  AEs and SAEs .  
Subjects with an adverse event will be followed until the event has resolved or stabilized with sequ elae.  
6.3 Management of Selected Expected Toxicities  
Toxicity data is based on studies using pharmaceutical grade AC for treatment of intentional overdose/poison control. These doses are much higher than the planned 
doses  of medical  grade AC on this protocol . Lower doses are thought to be more 
tolerable.  
• The most common toxicity of AC (doses used for poisoning treatment) is 
nausea/vomiting, ranging from 15 -27%. 
• Pulmonary aspiration is the most serious complication, occurring in <1 % of 
patients. AC will not be a dministered to patients at risk for aspiration .  
It should be noted that the cause of aspiration is multifactorial, and part of the risk 
reported in studies should be contributed to the effect of toxin or the loss of protective 
reflexes  in cases of poisoning . We do not expect these to be present  in our pa rticipants . 
6.4 Supportive Care  
No specific supportive care is needed.  
6.5 Duration of Study Participation  
Participants will be involved for 12 days  over a 2 week period  including 6 days of active 
study participation and 4 days of study team follow -up.  
6.6 Withdrawal from Study  
Participants  have the right to withdraw consent at any time by informing a member of 
the study staff or by following the instructions provided in the HIPAA document .

AC mixed with 4 oz. of e ither tap water  or apple juice . The solutions will be 
administered as per section  
8.1.7 Toxicities  
GI Effects  
May cause vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and GI obstruction or fecal impaction 
in dehydrated patients.  
Generally should not be used when decreased peristalsis pres ent (reduced or 
absent bowel sounds); if risk of GI obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage exists; 
if surgery has occurred recently; or if electrolyte imbalance or volume depletion 
exists.  
Pulmonary Effects  
Aspiration of activated charcoal may lead to more severe complications than 
aspiration of gastric contents alone. Aspiration from vomiting or misdirected 
nasogastric catheter has resulted in granulomatous reactions, bronchiolitis 
obliterans, tissue reaction to suspension agents (sorbitol, povidone), inc reased 
lung permeability, and rarely, death.  
Use of Fixed Combination  
When used in fixed combination with other agents, consider the cautions, 
precautions, and contraindications associated with the concomitant agents.  
Common Adverse Effects  
Vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, black stools.  
9 Event Monitoring, Documentation and Reporting  
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified and graded according to NCI's Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE V5) and reported on the schedule 
Activated Charcoal in Healthy Volunteers   
   
October 18, 2019  Page 16 of 23 2019LS014  
 below. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page.  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_50 ). 
The following definitions of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting via the SAE Report Form in 
addition to routine documentation in the OnCore AE case report form (CRF).  
Note:  throughout this section the generic term “study drug” refers to study product , medical  
grade  Oral AC . 
9.1 Event Terminology  
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Serious Adverse Event:   An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the vie w of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life -threatening adverse experience  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medica l 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Unexpected Event:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in protocol -related documents (e.g. protocol, consent 
documents, investigator brochure, package insert), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has  been observed or given the characteristics of the subject population 
being studied.   
 
Attribution:  is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and 
the study drug. Attribution is assigned as follows:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study drug  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study drug  
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study drug  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug  
Activated Charcoal in Healthy Volunteers   
   
October 18, 2019  Page 17 of 23 2019LS014  
 • Unrelated – The AE is clearly not related to the study drug  
Attribu tion must be assigned by the treating physician or the PI.  
 
The following definitions are from the Masonic Cancer Center’s Standard Operating 
Procedure (SOP)  Deviation Reporting : 
 
Major Deviation:  A deviation or violation that impacts the risks and benefits of the 
research; may impact subject safety, affect the integrity of research data and/or affect a 
subject’s willingness to participate in the research. Deviations that place a subject at risk, 
but do not result in harm are considered to be major deviatio ns. 
 
Minor Deviation:  A deviation or violation that does not impact subject safety, compromise 
the integrity of research data and/or affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the 
research.  
9.2 Event Documentation  
Participants  will be monitored for adver se events from the 1st dose of study treatment 
through day 12. After that time point, events meeting the definition of serious and at 
least possibly related to study treatment will be documented upon knowledge.  
We will collect the following Grade 2-5 adverse event s attributable to AC : 
• Aspiration of activated charcoal  
In addition any event meeting the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) regardless 
of attribution that occurs during this period will be documented in the source document and recorded in OnCore.  
9.3 SAE and Death Documentation  
Any event meeting the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) requires documentation using the MCC SAE Report Form in OnCore.

 10 Study Data Collection and Monitoring  
10.1 Data Management  
This study will collect regulatory and clinical data using University of Minnesota CTSI’s 
instance of OnCore® (Online Enterprise Research Management Environment). The Oncore 
database resides on dedicated secure and PHI compliant servers. All relevant AHC IS procedures related for PHI compliant servers (as required by the Center of Excellence for 
HIPAA Data) apply to Oncore databases.  
The data will be integrated and extracted to researchers through the CTSI Informatics 
team and will be delivered t hrough secure and compliant mechanisms (e.g. AHC IE data 
shelter, BOX, sftp, etc). If data de -identification is needed, then compliant AHC IE data de -
identification tools will be used. The informatics team will grant the IRB approved study team members acc ess to data.  
Key study personnel are trained on the use of OnCore and will comply with protocol specific instructions embedded within the OnCore . 
10.2 Case Report Forms  
Participant data will be collected using protocol specific electronic case report forms (e -
CRF) developed within OnCore based on its library of standardized forms. The e -CRF will 
be approved by the study’s Principal Investigator and the Biostatistician prior to release 
for use. The Primary Clinical Research Coordinator or designee will be res ponsible for 
registering the patient into OnCore at time of study entry, completing e -CRF based on the 
patient specific calendar, and updating the patient record until patient death or end of 
required study participation .  Clinical deviations per current IRB reporting requirements  OnCore

 10.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan ( DSMP)  
The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be in compliance with the University of 
Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center's Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), which can be 
accessed at http://z.umn.edu/dmsp.  
 For the purposes of data and safety monitoring, this study is classified as high  risk. 
Therefore the following requirements will be fulfilled:  
  At least quarterly review of the study’s progress by the Masonic Cancer Center Data 
and Safety Monitoring Council (DSMC).  
 The PI will comply with at  least twice yearly monitoring of the project by the Masonic 
Cancer Center monitoring services.  
 The PI will oversee the submission of all reportable adverse events per section 9.3 to 
the Masonic Cancer Center’s SAE Coordinator, the University of Minnesota IRB, and the FDA.  
 
In addition, at the time of the continuing review with the University of Minnesota IRB, a 
copy of the report with any attachments will be submitted to the Cancer Protocol Review 
Committee (CPRC).  
 
IND Annual Reports  
In accordance with r egulation 21 CFR § 312.33, the Sponsor -Investigator will submit a 
progress report annually. The report will be submitted within 60 days of the anniversary 
date that the IND went into effect.  
10.4 Study Monitoring  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the 
study’s Principal Investigator and/ or any designees, the local IRB, government regulatory 
bodies, and University of Minnesota compliance groups. The investigator will make available all study related documents (e. g. source documents, regulatory documents, 
data collection instruments, study data, etc.). The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.) will be available for trial related monitoring, audits, or regulatory inspections.  
10.5 Record Retention  
The investigator will retain study records including source data, copies of case report form, 
consent forms, HIPAA authorizations, and all study correspondence in a secured facility for at least 6 years after the study file is closed with the IRB  and FDA .

 11 Study Endpoints  
11.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the average palatability rating (on a 1 -5 scale) of each treatment 
combination . 
11.2 Secondary Endpoint  
Safety, defined by the incidence of grade 2 and above AEs deemed at least probably related 
to AC  by day 12.  
12 Statistical Considerations  
12.1 Study Design  
This is a pilot study designed to test tolerability and safety of oral AC in 12 healthy 
volunteers . 
 
We will follow a predetermined treatment assignment using the balanced 
incomplete block design shown in Section 6.1.1.  Twelve healthy subjects will be assigned two dose and solution combinations to take for thre e days each.  Each 
subject will receive each d ose once and each solution once.   Different subjects 
will receive different combinations  or different sequences .  Each of the four 
combinations will be given to six subjects total, allowing straightforward 
comparisons.  Each solution (or dose) precedes eac h of the others for exactly half 
of the subjects, to minimize confounding due to the ordering  of the treatment 
assignments.  
12.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size  was chosen so that each combination could be given the same 
number of times.   
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
We will average each subject’s score over the 3 days of each treatment. If a 
subject misses one or more days, we will impute the average of the known days 
for the unknown days. We will also record the reported reason for not taking AC,  
and based on that we may adjust the imputation procedure on a case -by-case 
basis. Since the goal is to pick the most tolerable/palatable combination, we will choose the one with the highest average score; no statistical hypothesis tests are 
required. We w ill also consider the combination with the fewest percentage of 
Activated Charcoal in Healthy Volunteers

 “terrible” or “bad” ratings, although this is expected to be associated with 
average score.   
13 Ethical and Regulatory Considerations  
13.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate regulatory requirement(s). Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the 
validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected. Master files should be 
established at the beginning of the study, maintai ned for the duration of the study and 
retained according to the appropriate regulations.  
13.2 Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The IRB will review all appropriate s tudy documentation in order 
to safeguard the rights, safety and well -being of the patients. The study will only be 
conducted at sites where IRB approval has been obtained. The protocol, informed consent, written information given to the patients, safety up dates, annual progress 
reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by the investigator.  
13.3 Informed Consent  
All potential study participants will be given a copy of the IRB -approved Consent to 
review. The investigator or designe e will explain all aspects of the study in lay language 
and answer all questions regarding the study. If the participant decides to participate in 
the study, he/she will be asked to sign and date the Consent document. Patients who 
refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.

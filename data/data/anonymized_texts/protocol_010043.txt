Title  A Parallel Group Double -Blind Randomized Placebo 
Controlled Trial  to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
ALD403 Administered Intravenously in Patients with Frequent 
Episodic Migraines  
Sponsor  Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Investigational Product  ALD403,  a humanized anti -(calcitonin gene -related peptide ) 
(CGRP) monoclonal antibody 
Primary Objective  To evaluate the efficacy of repeat doses of ALD403 
administered intravenously (IV) compared to placebo in 
patients  with  Frequent Episodic M igraine  (FEM) . 
Secondary Objective s To evaluate the safety of repeat doses of ALD403 administered 
IV compared to placebo in patients  with FEM.  
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics  (PK) and immunogenicity of 
repeat doses of ALD403 administered IV to  patients  with 
FEM . 
Methodology  This is a phase 3, a parallel group, double -blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled trial. Subjects will be randomized into one 
of three ALD403 dose levels (30 mg, 100 mg, and 300 mg) or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by migraine days 
during screening ( ≤9 days vs. >9 days).  S ubjects  will be 
allocated  equally to each treatment group.  
The total study duration is 60 weeks with 12 scheduled visits.  
The visits will occur on Screening, Day 0, and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, 24, 28, 36, 48 and 56. Following the screening  visit, 
subjects will be followed for four weeks to confirm eligibility . 
Once subjects are eligible, they  will be randomized and treated  
on Day 0, which is 29-35 days after the screening  visit.  
Patients must complete  eDiary  from Screening through W eek 
48.   
Study drug treatment inc ludes  four infusions of ALD403 or 
placebo  on Day s 0, 84 (Week 12), 168 (Week 24) and 252

Report Form (CRF) through Week 56. The following
medication s are restricted  through Week 24: Any
prophylactic headache medication is prohibited and its
regular use (greater than 7 days) is not allowed within
2 months prior to screening through random ization
(medication details in Section 15.1).
•Short-term (no more than 7 days in a month) menstrualmigraine pr
ophylactics are allowed.
•Additional restriction applies to the followingmedications: b a 
rbiturates and opiates are allowed for
≤ 4 days per month through Week 24, provided thesubject does not meet the criteria for Medication
Overuse Headache overall  and has been on a stable
regimen (≤ 4 days per month) for at least 2 monthsprior to screening.
•Any botulinum toxin injections for migraine or for any

Sample 
Size The planned sample size for this study is 800 randomized and 
treated subjects.  These su bjects will be allocated into 
4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.  Pair- wise testing of each 
ALD403 group vs. placebo will be performed. Testing will be 
at the 5% alpha level. Two hundred subjects per group 
provides at least 95% power for the change from baseline test s 
individually assuming  a treatment effect of at least 1 day and a 
common standard deviation of 2.7 days or less.  For the key secondary 75% responder rate endpoints 95% power is achieved for the pair -wise comparisons, the 75% responder 
rates are 24% for placebo and 42% for ALD403. 
Statistical Analysis  The primary  periods for efficacy and safety for this study  are 
through Week 12 and 24, respectively.   The primary efficacy 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 104 evaluations will encompass results from Weeks 1 -12.  
Following Week 24, the study will continue so that long term 
safety data can be captured.  The efficacy analyses are based 
upon migraine days.  A migraine day is defined as any day with a migraine or probable migraine as outlined in the I HS 
classification IC HD-II. (migraine without aura, Section 1.1
11). 
Specifically, a migraine is defined as a self -reported headache 
which  meets each of the following conditions:  
1) lasted 4 to 72 hours
2) had at least 2 of the following: unilateral location ,
pulsating qual
ity, m oderate or severe pain intensity
and/or aggravation by or causing avoidance of
routine physical activity , and
3) had at least 1 of the following: nausea and/or
vomiting  and/or photophobi
a and phonophobia.
A probable migraine is defined as a headache that meets only 
2 of the 3 criter
ia listed above.  The migraine days reported 
during the initial 28 -days following screening will be used as 
baseline. Following treatment, migraine data will be 
summarized and analyzed in 4 week intervals, 12 week 
intervals  and a 24 week interval .  A 75% responder for a given 
four week interval will be a subject with at least a 75% 
reduction in migraine days during that interval.  A 75% 
responder over a 12 week interval will be a subject who achieves an average reduction  of 75% o ver the twelve weeks.  
The 50% and 100% responder rates are similarly defined.  The 
12 weeks average change from baseline in frequency of migraine days is the average change from baseline in each of 
the 4 weeks intervals that make up weeks 1 -12. Subjects wh o 
do not complete their migraine eDiary will have their missing 
data imputed.   
Efficacy and safety en
 dpoints will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  Testing of the  key secondary responder 
rate endpoints and the primary Weeks 1 -12, change from 
baseline in migraine day endpoint will be performed.  The 
testing of the primary endpoint will be with an ANCOVA.  
The key secondary responder rate and percentage of subjects 
with a migraine on the day after dosing  endpoints will be tested

Pharmacokinetic  and 
Immunogenicity Analys es The c oncentrations of Free ALD403 will be measured in 
plasma from all ALD403 treated subjects using validated assay 
methods.  
The PK analysis of plasma will include determination of the Free ALD403 conce
ntrations at the following times:  Day 0 
Weeks  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48 and 56.  The PK plasma  
samples will be collected pre -dose within 1 hr before dosing on 
Day 0, and Weeks 12, 24 and 36. For subjects receiving placebo, selected samples will be analysed.    
Blood will be taken for the detection of anti-ALD403 antibody, and when appropria
te neutralizing anti-ALD403 antibody, at 
the following times: Day 0, Weeks  4, 8, 12 16, 20, 24, 36, 48 
and 56. Subjects who test positive for specific anti-ALD403 antibodies a 
t the time of the last study visit will be asked to 
provide additional blood samples for immunogenicity 
testing.  The anti -ALD403 antibody blood samples will be 
collected  pre-dos
e within 1 hour before dosing on Day 0, and 
Weeks  12, 24 and 36.

5.1 Investigational Product 
ALD 403 is a  humanized anti -(calcitonin g ene-r elated peptide) (CGRP) monoclonal antibody 
(anti-CGRP) that is being developed by Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. for the prophylaxis of 
migraine.  
5.2 Background 
According to the International Classification of Headache Disorder, migraine is a common 
disabling primary headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4 to 72 hours. Migraine 
headaches range from moderate to very severe and are debilitating. Episodic migraine affects 17 
percent of women and 6 percent of men.  Migraine frequency is divided into episodic and 
chronic e pisodic migraine is characterized by  <15 migraine days and chronic migraine by ≥15 
headache days per month of which 8 or more must be migraine days. All migraine types significantly affect the physical, psychological, and social well-being of patients, and can impose 
serious lifestyle restrictions. Each year lost work time and diminished productivity from 
migraine costs American employers $225.8 billion. Forty percent of adults with episodic 
migraine and all patients with chronic migraine might benefit from preventive medication; yet, 
only about 12 percent of adults with migraines take preventive medication. This is largely due to 
poor tolerability and/or lack of efficacy of currently marketed drugs for the prevention of 
migraine. There is therefore a need for new therapeutic alternatives
1. 
CGRP is a member of the calcitonin  fami ly of peptides , which in humans exists in two forms, α-
CGRP and β-CGR
P. α- CGRP is a 37 -amino acid  peptide and is formed from the alternative 
splicing of the 
calcitonin/CGRP gene located on chromosome 11. The less -studied β- CGRP 
differs i
n three amino acids (in humans) and is encoded in a separate gene in the same vicinity of 
the genome. 
CGRP is one of the most abundant peptides produced in both peripheral and central neurons . It is 
the most potent pept
ide vasodilator  and can function in the transmission of pain. In the spinal 
cord, the function a
nd expression of CGRP may differ depending on the location of synthesis. 
CGRP is derived mainly from the cell bodies of motor neurons when synthesized in the ventral 
horn of the spinal cord and may contribute to the regeneration of nervous tissue after injury.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 104 Conversely, CGRP is derived from dorsal root ganglion when synthesized in the dorsal horn of 
the spinal cord and may be linked to the transmission of pain. In the trigeminal vascular system, 
the cell bodies on the trigeminal ganglion  are the main source of CGRP where it is thoug ht to 
have a role in cardiovascular homeostasis and nociception.2 
CGRP  is thought to have a multiplicity of actions within the brain, including the facilitation of 
pain transmission and the induct
ion of the nociceptive  state, both of which may contribute to the 
mechanism of migraine . 3, 4 
During migraine attacks, there is an increase i n the plasma levels of C GRP in the external jugular 
vein. 5 In addition, intravenous (IV) infusion of CGRP causes migraine and headache in patients 
with migraine, suggesting that the increase in CGRP observed during spontaneous migraine attacks plays a cau sative role .
6 
CGRP is thought to play an important role in migraine by facilitating the transmission of migraine pain, thereby cont
ributing to the induction of the pronociceptive stage through 
modulation of the central nervous system (CNS) .4, 5  Studies in  animals and humans indicate that 
the trigeminal ganglion and the tr igeminal nucleus caudalis  are likely to be sites of action of 
CGRP in migraine. In addition, CGRP is expressed in many locations within the CNS, including regions that may be relevant to migraine pain .
 7, 8 
CGRP dilates intracranial and extracranial blood vessels, and can additionally activate adjacent mast cells, which leads to the
 secretion of vasoactive, proinflammatory, and sensitizing 
mediators, thereby contributing to migraine pathoge nesis . 9, 10 
5.3 Investigational Product 
ALD403 is a genetically engineered humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that binds to human-α-CGRP with an affinity of 1.5E-11 M and  human-β-CGRP with an affinity of 
5.7E-11 M.  
5.3.1 Summary  of Nonclinical Stu
 dies 
A nonclinical testing program has been conducted supporting the use of ALD403 in clinical 
trials . More detailed discussion i
s provided in the current version of the ALD403 Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 104 ALD403 is a genetically engineered humanized IgG1 antibody that binds to α- and β- forms of 
human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat CGRP. The amino acid sequence for α- and β- CGRP  is 
identical in cynomolgus monkeys and humans (data on file); therefore the  in vitro binding 
characteristics of cynomolgus monkey and human CGRP to ALD403 would be 
indistinguishable. Rat α-CGRP is one amino acid different from human α-CGRP and rat β- CGRP  
is 3 amino acids different from human β-CGRP. Based on comparable binding affinity and in vitro potency for rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human α- and β-CGRP, the rat and cynomolgus 
monkey were selected for nonclinical safety assessments . 
Pharmacodynamic activity by ALD403 in the species selected for toxicological investigations 
(rats, rabbit
s, and monkeys) was confirmed in vivo by conducting st udies to determine the ability 
of ALD403 to inhibit CGRP-mediated neurogenic dermal vasodilation.  In rats, changes in dermal blood perfusion were measured using Laser Doppler, while in rabbits and monkeys a 
Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA) imaging system was utilized.  The parenteral 
administration of ALD403 inhibited increases in dermal blood perfusion induced by topical 
capsaicin in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and intravenous ALD403 administration in rabbits 
inhibited increased dermal blood perfusion secondary to intradermal β- CGRP challenge.  
The toxicokinetic profile for ALD403 has been evaluated follow ing singl
 e and once weekly 
repeated -dose IV administrations for four weeks in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and following 
administration once every two weeks for 6 -months in cynomolgus monkeys.  
The plasma concentration profiles for ALD403 following single or repeated- dose IV 
admini
strations in rats or cynomolgus monkeys were characterized by an apparent mono-
exponential decline. The plasma half -life for ALD403 ranged between 102-155 hours following 
single administration in rats, and 142 to 323 hours following single or multiple weekly administrations in cynomolgus monkeys. The distribution for ALD403 appeared limited to the 
vascular compartment, and the systemic exposure was dose proportional from 10 to 
150 mg/kg/dose. No gender differences were observed among any of the toxicokinetic parameters evaluated.  
In the single -dose nonclinica
 l toxicology studies, the no- observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL)  
for IV administration of ALD403 to rats and cynomolgus monkeys was 100 mg/kg. 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 104 Toxicological investigations  in rats  and monkeys indicated that repeated -dose IV administration 
of ALD403 at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks was well tolerated , with no signs 
of adverse effects related to treatment. Under the conditions of these studies, the no- observed -
adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) for once weekly IV administration of ALD403 to rats or monkeys 
for four weeks was 100 mg/kg. 
A chronic multiple -dose toxicol ogy study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the 
potential effects b y ALD403 following 6-months administration via slow bolus injection once 
every two weeks (a total of fourteen dosing occasions) at 0, 20, 50, or 150 mg/kg/dose followed 
by a three month recovery period in select animals.  The foll owing parameters were evaluated in t his study: c
 linical signs, body weights, food 
consumption, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, ophthalmology, 
electrocardiology, clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, 
and urinalysis), insulin analysis, flow cytometry parameters, toxicokinetic parameters and anti -
drug antibody (ADA) formation, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic examinations.  
Following the sixth dosing occasion on study day 71, one low-dose (20 mg/kg/dose) female 
animal exhib
ited an anaphylactoid -like reaction and died within approximately 30 minutes. 
Collectively, the c linical, gross, and microscopic findings were consistent with an ADA-
mediated anaphylacto id event as the cause of death.  Humanized monoclonal antibodie s are 
known for their potential to illicit severe immunologic reactions in monkeys and therefore,  the 
death of one animal was considered a class effect and was not included in the determination of 
the no-adverse- effect -level (NOAEL).  
There were no ALD403- related clinic al signs or changes in  body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmology, electrocardiology, blood pressure, heart  rate, body temperature, clinical 
pathology, insulin, or flow cytometry parameters. There were no ALD403- related effects on 
organ weights or organ weight ratios. Additionally, there were no ALD403- related macr oscopic 
or microscopic changes . 
The presence of  ADA was confi rmed in 5/10 (50%) animals from the 20 mg/kg group, 5/10 
(50%) animals from the 50 mg/kg group, and 11/14 (79%) animals from the 150 mg/kg group.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 104 Considering that the ALD403 exposure did not decrease after repeated administration and that 
the exposure of ADA positive animals was not notably or consistently different from ADA 
negative animals, the presence of ADA did not appear to impact exposure. 
Administration of ALD403 via intravenous (slow bolus) injection once every 2 weeks for approximate ly 
6-months (for a total of 14 doses) did not result in any treatment -related effects 
upon the parameters evaluated in this study.  T he NOAEL for ALD403 following chronic 
administration in monkeys was considered to be 150 mg/kg/dose (Day 183 mean C max of 
19,600/6,160 μ g/mL; mean AUC  (0-2wk) of 1,610,000/904,000 μ g·h/mL for males/females, 
respectively).  
ALD403 is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal materials, and genotoxicity
 assessments have not been conducted. The carcinogenic potential for ALD403 has 
not been thoroughly investigated. The results of toxicological and clinical investigations to date with ALD403 have provided no indications of effects with the potential to support or induce the 
proliferation of malignant cells . 
Range -finding embryo-fetal development studies with ALD403 have been completed  to suppor
 t 
the selection of dosages for use in definitive studies.   T he administration of ALD403 by 
intravenous (slow bolus) injection to pregnant female rats on Days 6, 12 and 18 post coitum or 
pregnant female New Zealand White rabbits on Days 7, 13 and 20 post coitum, at 75 or 
150 mg/kg/dose was well tolerated, and there was no evidence of embryo -fetal mortality 
(embryolethality ), alterations in growth (fetotoxicity), or structural abnormalities ( teratogenicity ) 
in either species.  The definitive embryo -fetal development studies with ALD403 in pregnant rats 
and rabbits are currently in  progress.   
The local tolerance of ALD403 was assessed following repeated -(once weekly ) dose studies in 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys utilizing ALD403 administered IV. Following the end-of-
treatment,  no gross or microscopic lesions were observed in the ALD403 injection sites excised 
from rats. In the injection sites obtained from cynomolgus monkeys, only procedure- related 
findings were observed and included  (in order of decreasing incidence) minimal and/or mild 
superficial perivascular infiltrates, fibroplasia/fibrosis, myointimal hyperplasia of the injected 
vein, hemorrhage, and sporadic observ ations in the epidermis and skeletal muscle.

5.3.3 Dose Ju
stification 
In study ALD403- CLIN -002, a single  intravenous infusion of 1000 mg ALD403 produced 
sustained efficacy  in terms of mean change from baseline in migraine days and the responder 
analysis.  The mean Free ALD403 (ALD403 available for binding to the CGRP ligand) plasma 
concentrations observed at weeks 12 and 24 in subjects receiving 1000 mg ALD403 were

24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 104 25.6 and 3.4 µg/mL, respectively.  Results from a prior study, ALD403- CLIN -001, demonstrated 
marked  suppression of capsaicin-induced skin blood flow at doses ranging from 30-1000 mg 
ALD403 given as a single intravenous infusion.   Prolonged suppression of capsaicin -induced 
skin blood flow for 12 weeks was observed following IV infusion of ≥ 100 mg ALD403.     
The ALD403- CLIN -006 study  design will explore ALD403 given by repeat IV administration at 
doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg every 12 -weeks.  
For subjects participat ing in ALD403- CLIN -006 at the highest dose level, 300 mg ALD403 
administered by IV infusion every 12 -weeks, the estimated systemic exposure to Free ALD403 
following the last (fourth) administration is C max = 110.2 µg/mL  and AUC  (0-12wk) = 
46,648 µg*hr/mL.  These ALD403 exposure levels are at least 56- and 19-fold less than the 
mean C max and AUC (0-2Wk) systemic exposures, 19,600 µg/mL  in males and 6,160 µg/mL  in 
females , and 1,610,000 µg*hr/mL in males and 904,000 µg*hr/mL in females, respectively, 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following a chronic 6-month evaluation of ALD403 
administered IV at the no -observed-adverse- effect -level (NOAEL) of 150 mg/kg once every 
2-weeks.
The high dose of 300 mg administered during ALD403- CLIN -006 is expec ted to provide 
efficacious treatment in FEM .  The low and mid doses, 30 and 100 mg ALD403, respectively, 
were selected to explore the potential for dose- related efficacy following ALD403 treatment.   
5.4 Risks and Benefits 
ALD403 may prevent migraine from occurring in patients treated in this trial.  No specific toxicities or adverse effects related to the blockade of CGRP by ALD403 have been identified in 
either the nonclinical toxicology program or the clinical trials with ALD403 that have been 
completed to date.  
There may be unknown adverse e
 ffects and unforeseeable risks associated with study drug 
administration  or unexpected interactions with another drug that have not yet been identified. 
As with all protein therapeutics, there is a risk of a serious allergic reaction.  In completed 
ALD403 trials
 conducted to date, no serious allergic reactions have been observed with the 
administration of ALD403 in humans.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 104 In the completed ALD403 clinical trials with headache patients, the most common  observed 
adverse events (>5%) with receiving ALD403 or placebo included upper respiratory tract 
infection, back pain, dizziness, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, and headache.  The majority of 
these adverse events were categorized as mild to moderate.  
Long term data with ALD403 is limited. 
•Healthy volunteer trials have included limited dosing, short duration of follow up and
have not include long term follow-up.
•Trials in migraine patients have also included limiting dosing.  These trials are currentlyongoi
ng and no new significant findings have been noted during the follow-up period to
date.
The safety findings  to date indicate  t hat ALD403 Inject ion is well tolerated, with ALD403 
demonstrating a favorable benefit -risk profile based on review of nonclinical, clinical, and 
scientific literature data.  
The sponsor will continue to monitor for significant new information and suspected adverse 
reactions ass
ociated with the use of ALD403.  
5.5 Compliance Statement 
This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and all applicable 
federal and local regulations.

Subject eligibility will be re -confirmed on Day 0, prior to randomization.  Any subject found to 
be no longer eligible for the study on Day 0 , will not be randomized nor dosed.  
The subjects randomized and dosed will continue the study for 56 weeks.  The se 56 weeks are 
divided i
nto two periods, i.e., a primary efficacy and safety period (Weeks 1 -24) and a long term 
safet y period (Weeks 25-56). Subjects will complete the eDiary daily through Week 48.   
Approximately 800 subjects will be randomized and treated. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, 
and immunogenicit
y assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events 
presented in Section 2.   
7.3 Data Monitoring Committee 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), which includes appropriately qualified members who are 
independent of the Sponsor, will be formed to consider safety data generated during the clinical 
trial. These members will be appointed externally by the Sponsor, and will not be connected with 
management of the clinical trial.  
The primary focus of the DMC will be the safety experience of the clinical trial subjects. Based on the reviews a
nd assessments of the data, the DMC will inform the Sponsor of any safety 
concerns and provide recommendations about stopping, modifying, or continuing the clinical trial. The DMC may also advise the Sponsor on the validity of continuing the trial and the 
scientific merit of the clinical trial.  The DMC is not tasked with stopping the study early for 
efficacy.  DMC analyses will be conducted per iodically through-out the study. 
7.4 Methods to Minimize/Avoid Bias 
To minimize bias, this clinical trial is randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled.  At the 
point of in fusion, there are no obvious differences between ALD403 and placebo, and there are

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 104 no known ALD403- specific safety or tolerability signals that could potentially unblind subjects 
and clinical trial staff.  ALD403 is expected to have a fairly substantial impact on migraine 
frequency;  however, the placebo effect in migraine studies is also reasonabl y large therefore, 
reduction in migraines is insufficient to deduce treatment assignment.

8.3 Registration  and Treatment Assignment 
8.3.1 Registration Procedure, Subject Numbering  
Each participating investigative site will be assigned a 3 -di git site number ( e.g., 101, 102). A t the 
Screening Visit once the ICF is signed , a subject will be assigned a unique subject number. The 
first part of the subject number identifies the site and the second part identifies the subject. 
8.3.2 Randomization and Treatment Assignment  
Randomization will occur 29 to 35 days af ter the screening visit  after eligibility assessments are 
completed  and eligibility verified . Sites will complete the randomization in an Interactive Web  or 
Voice Response System (IWRS  or IVRS ) and the randomization assignment will be obtained by  
the clinical trial site’s unblinded pharmacist or Investigational Product consignee.   Subjects will 
be randomized in equal ratios to one of the dose groups.  Stratified pe rmuted block 
randomization will be used. Stratification will be by migraine days during the screening  period  
(≤9 days vs. >9 days).

9 Clinical Trial Treatments  
9.1 Investigational Product  
ALD403 is an anti -(calcitonin gene- related peptide) humanized monoclonal antibody (anti-
CGRP mAb) that is being developed by Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., for the prophylaxis of 
migraine.   
ALD4 03 Injection, 100 mg/vial, is pre sented in 2-mL Type I glass vials as a single -use 
preservative-free solution for IV administration.  ALD403 is formulated at a concentration of 
100 mg/mL with a pH of 5.8.  Those subjects randomized to active will receive an IV infusion of 
ALD403 Injection in 100 mL of 0.9% saline.   
9.2 Control Drug 
Placebo will be supplied as a single -use preservative- free solution in a 2- mL Type I glass vial 
formulated  with the same excipients  as ALD403, without the active ingredient. Those subjects 
randomized to placebo will receive  an IV infusion Placebo in 100 mL of 0.9% saline. 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 104 9.3 Investigational Product Dosing and Administration 
The pharmacist or Investigational Product consignee responsible for dispensing and preparing 
the ALD403 and P lacebo IV infusions will be unblinded and will not be responsible for other 
aspects of the clinical trial where blinding is necessary. The infusions will be prepared using aseptic techniques.  
The doses of ALD403 or P lacebo ( total vol
 ume of 100 mL ) will be administered IV over a 
period of 1 hour (± 15 minutes) on Day 0 and Week 12, 24 and 36, by the blinded Investigator or 
designee.  Subjects must be monitored for 4 hours after the dosing completion.  If the subject 
experiences a headache or migraine on dosing day, dosing may occur if it doesn’t compromise 
the safety of the subject in the judgment of the Investigator.   
Further instructions on the preparation and procedure associated with administering the IV can 
be found in the Pha
rmacy Manual. 
9.3.1 Packaging and Labeling 
Before th
e shipment to the investigative sites, Investigati onal Product and Placebo will be 
labeled with the protocol number, contents (“ALD403” or “Placebo”), directions for storage, the Sponsor, and any other information required by regulatory agencies, such as a statement that it is 
limited to investigational use. Investigational Product and P lacebo to be administered to the 
subject will be labeled  by the investigators  in a manner (afte r dose preparation) that protects 
blinding. 
9.3.2 Blinding  
This clinica
l trial is double-blind, meaning the subjects and site personnel are blinded to 
treatment ass
ignment, except for clinical trial site’s unblinded pharmacist or Investigational 
Product consignee. The study site must have a written plan in place to ensure blinding is 
adequately maintained for the study.  If the blind is broken, the date, time and reason must be 
recorded. The blind should only be broken for reasons in which knowledge of the Investigational 
Product is critical to the subject safety  and /or trial  management. The Principal Investigator will 
report any cases of unbli nding to the sponsor within 24 hours of the incident.  
Immediately prior to PK/immunogenicity  sample ana lysis, the bioanalytical laboratory will be 
unblinded in order to obtain the treatment assignments . The study will remain blinded until the

will be unblinded.  
9.3.3 Storage and Handling of Investigational Product 
Investigat
ional Product /Placebo  will  be stored at a central depot  or at the clinical site at -20°C 
(- 10°C to -25°C) in accordance with any accompanying instructions.   P lease refer to the 
Pharmacy Manual  for additional storage and handling procedures. Diluent (0.9% saline) will be 
stored according to institutional standards. 
Investigators shall take adequate precautions, inc luding storage of the Investigational Product 
and P lacebo  in a securely locked , substantially constructed cabinet or other securely locked, 
substantially constructed enclosure, access to which is limited to  maintain blind,  prevent theft or 
diversion of the substance into illegal channels of distribution. 
9.3.4 Accountability  and Disposi tion of Investigational Product 
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate Investigational Product and P lacebo 
accounta
bility records throughout the c linical trial. The  site must maintain a record of  
Investigational Product Accountability Log on which the unblinded responsible pharmacist , or 
designee,  will record the receipt , lot number/retest date, quantity, dispensation and return  of 
Investigational Product to the Pharmacy , as well as any  destruction of Investigational 
Product /Placebo  including empty Investigational Product /Placebo  containers (e.g., vials) or 
returns to the Sponsor.  Where more than one secure area is being used for storage at a site, all 
movement of I
nvestigational Product through the Chain of Custody must be recorded in 
accountability records such that full reconciliation may be completed at the end of the trial.  
Included with each Investigational Product or Placebo shipment  is a form listing  lot numbers and 
quantity shipped. The Investigator, responsible pharmacist, or designee, will sign and return to 
Alder BioPharmaceuticals , Inc., or designee, a statement that certifies the receipt and integrity of 
these supplies. A copy will be retained for the site clinical trial file.  
After completion of the clinical trial, the Investigator is responsible for either returning o r 
destroying  (if authorized by Sponsor) all unused Investigational Product/P lacebo. The 
Invest igator must verify that no remaining supplies are in his/her possession. All used/partially 
used vials/IV bags will be destroyed onsite according to the site SOPs.  Where the Sponsor has

If the clinical trial is terminated, suspended, discontinued, or completed, the Investigator or 
designee shal
l return the unused supplies to the Sponsor or designee, or otherwise provide for 
disposition of the unused supplies (as authorized by the Sponsor ).  
9.4 Concomitant Medications 
Any concomitant therapy , used from the time the subject signs the informed consent through 
Week 56, must be recorded on the CRF, including medications required for treatment of any AEs 
or SAEs.  The Medical Monitor or designee should be notified in advance of (or as  soon as 
possible after) any instances in which restricted  therapies are administered.  Use of regular 
prescription medications for condition other than migraine must be preapproved by Medical 
Monitor. 
The following medications are restricted  through  Week 24 : 
•Any prophyla ctic headac he medication  (any preventive medication or supplement with
evidence of efficacy from at least 1 placebo -controlled trial, see Section 15.1) is
prohibited.
•Barbi
turates and prescripti on opiates are allowed for ≤ 4 days per month through Week
24, provided the subject does not meet the criteria for Medication Overuse Headache and
has been on a stable regimen (≤ 4 days per month) for at least 2 months prior to
screening.  Drugs containing non- prescription codeine (16 mg or less) are permitted.
•Botulinum toxin for migraine or for any other medical/cosmetic reasons requiring
injections in t
he head, face, or neck are prohibited 4 months prior to screening  through
Week 24.
•Devices, neuromodulation, neurostimulation , or injectable  therapy (trigger point

11 Assessment of Safety 
11.1 Adverse Events 
11.1.1 Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medica l occurren ce in a patient or clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. (ICH E6) 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 104 11.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Event s 
The Investigator is required to monitor the occurrence of adverse events for each subject from 
the time of inf
ormed consent through the course of the clinical trial.  Adverse events may be 
reported by the subject, reported by a caregiver, or reported by the investigative site through Investigator site personnel open-ended questioning, through physical examination, laboratory 
test, documentation in medical records, or by other means.  Adverse events include: 
•Any new undesirable medical experience or an unfav orable and uninte
 nded change of an
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related
to the Investigational Product.
•Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by the Investigator to be clinically
significa
nt.  For example,  abnormal ECG or abnormal lab findings.
A new  or worsening of a pre -existi ng or chronic condition is considered an adverse event and 
must be reported as such.  Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed 
consent into the clinical trial, will not be considered an adverse event unless the condition 
worsens.  Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre-existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
Pre-existing medical conditions of clinical significance must be included in the subject’s medical 
history and r
ecorded on the medical history eCRF page.  
Each event recorded on the AE eCRF is required to be assessed by the Investigator with regard 
to the follow
ing; se riousness, severity, and relationship to Investigational Product, as outlined 
below. 
Seriousness  
An adverse event or suspected  adverse event  is considered serious if in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in; 
•Death
•Is life -thre
atenin g (this mean s that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more
severe)
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 104 •Inpatient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization
•A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal life
 functions.
•Congenital anomaly/ birth defect
•Importan
t medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening  or require
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical
judgement, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require medical or
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. ( 21 CFR
312.32(a ) and ICH E2A)
Severit
y 
The severity of an AE will be g raded as follows: 
oGrade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnosticobservations onl
y; intervention not indicated.
oGrade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated;limiting age -app 
ropriate instrumenta l Activities of Daily Living (ADL ).
oGrade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threateni ng;
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting
self-care ADL.
oGrade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
oGrade 5 D
eath related to AE.
Relationsh
ip to Investigational Product 
The Investigator is required to assess the causality/relationship between each AE and the 
Investigati
onal Product as not related or related and record the assessm ent on the source 
documents and in the eCRF AE page. Medical judgment should be used to determine the likely relationship of the AE to the Investigational Product considering all relevant factors including 
(but not limited to) relevant history, concomitant medical condition and concomitant 
medications.  Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, biologic

24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 104 plausibility, association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or 
absence) of a more likely cause.   
Not Related:  It is plausib le that the AE has an etiology other than the Investigational 
Product (e.g., pre-existing condition, underlying disease, concomitant medical condition, 
or concomitant medication).  
Related:  The AE cannot reasonably be explained by the subject ’s clinic al state, 
concomitant\medical condition or concomitant therapies, and a temporal relationship 
exists between the event onset and administration of the Investigational Product.  
11.1.3 Recording Adverse Events  
Event rep
orting will extend from time of informed consent until completion of the final visit. 
Serious adv
erse events occurring after the end of th e clinical trial must be reported if the 
Investigator considers there to be a causal relationship with the Investigational Product.  
SAE Notif ication Form should be used to report any related  SAEs which o ccur after the end of 
the clinical trial.   
Adverse events (AEs) should be recorded on the AE eCRF, whether believed by the Investigator 
to be related o
r not related to the Investigational Product.  
AE reporting should contain; 
•a brief description of the event,
•date of onset
,
•date of res
olution,
•severity,
•act
ions t
aken or treatment required,
•relations
hip to Investigational Product,
•outcome, and
•whethe
r the
 event is considered serious.
Whenever possi
ble, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis into a
 single event term.  For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be 
grouped together as “upper respiratory tract infection”.

Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 104 Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant 
should be recorded as an AE, unless it is associated with a clinical syndrome that has already 
been reported as an AE.   
11.1.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs t
hat occur during the period of observation, whether considered to be related to the 
Investigati
onal Product or not, must be reported within 24 hours of awareness or knowledge of 
the event.  The date the site personnel became aware of the serious adverse event must be 
recorded in the source document.  To report the SAE, complete the eCRF AE page and indicate 
the reason for seriousness.  The minimum information required for an initial report is: 
•Sender of report (name, address of Investigator)
•Subject id
entification (screenin g/randomization number, initials, NOT subject name)
•Protocol number
•Descript
ion of SAE (e.g., event term)
•Seriousn
ess criteria
•Relations
hip assessment
After rec
eipt of the initial report, the Medical Monitor or designee will review the information  
and, if necessa
ry, contact the Investigator to obtain further information for assessment of the 
event.  The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for information processing and reporting in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
The Sponsor or designee will determine if an SAE requires expedited reporting to regulatory agencies.  The 
clinical trial site personnel are responsible for reporting these events to their 
EC/IRB according to the institution’s EC/IRB reporting requirements  and in accordance with 
applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
Should the EDC System not be available, serious adverse events must be reported on the paper SAE Notifica
tion Form. Additional details can be found in the Site Manual .  This does not 
replace the EDC reporting system; information must be entered in the EDC system once the 
system returns  to normal function.

Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 104 11.1.5 Unexpected and Related Serious Adverse Events  
Unexpected SAEs are those which:  
•Are not previously reported as associated with ALD403, as referenced in the
Investigat
or’s Brochure.
•May be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an AE listed in theInvestigat
or’s Brochure, but differ from the event due to greater severity, frequency or
specificity.
The Sponsor or designee will report, to the appropriate regulatory authorities according to local and regulatory
 requirements, unexpected SAEs which are considered related to ALD403 
(suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [SUSARs]).  The clinical trial site personnel are responsible for reporting these events to their EC/IRB in accordance with applicable local and 
regulatory requirements. 
11.1.6 Follow- up of Ad
 verse Events  
Irrespective of the suspected causality, AEs will be monitored until resolution, stabilization  in 
the judgment of
 the Investigator, or the subject is lost to follow up or withdraws from the trial. 
11.1.7 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Serum che
mistry tests include albumin, alkal ine phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), urea  nitrogen, calcium, bicarbonate, creatinine, 
globulin, glucose, phosphorus , potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, total protein, 
triglycerides, magnesium and uric acid . 
Hematology tests include  hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet count, 
red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC morphology,  and white blood cell (WBC) count  with 
differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils). 
11.1.8 Pregnancy  
In the event t
hat a female subject becomes pregnant following administration of Investigational 
Product(s) or m
ay have been pregnant at the time of Investigational Product(s) exposure, or the 
partner of a male subject  becomes pregnant following administration of Investigational 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 104 Product(s), the pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor within five business days of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy information will be reported to the 
Sponsor using the Exposure In- Utero Forms.  
Although pregnancy per se  is not considere d an AE, the outcome of a pregnancy that results in a 
birth defect or congenital anomaly or hospitalization for any reason  is considered to be an SAE.  
Every attempt should be made to follow a pregnancy to conclusion.    
Follow-up information is to be collected by the Investigator and provided to the Sponsor 
regarding;  
•the
 course of the pregnancy including; perinatal and neonatal outcome, or premature
terminati
on of the pregnancy, or miscarriage
•offspring information including; birth weight, and birth defects (if any)
11.1.9 Suicidal I
deation and Behavior  
R
ecent meta -analyses , spontaneous reports, and published case reports regarding suicidal 
ideation and behavior arising from drugs tes ted in clinical trials ha ve been noted as an area of 
general concern . Based on this information, the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has provided guidance to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical 
trials to ensure that subjects in clinical trials who are experiencing suicidal ideation and behavior 
are properly recognized and adequately treated and to ensure the colle ction of more timely and 
more complete data on suicidal ideation and behavior than have been collected in the past 13.  
The C -SSRS (Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale)  will be used for this purpose.  Any 
subject who answers ‘yes’ to questions 4 or 5 of the C- SSRS during the screening visit will be 
referred to a mental health specialist  by the investig ator.  During the course of the trial after 
dosing, any subject who answers ‘yes’ to questions 4 or 5 of the C- SSRS will be  discontinued 
from the study treatment and  referred by investigators to a mental health specialist . 
11.2 Management of Reactions to ALD403 
There are no specific antidotes to ALD403. 
Each medical emergency should be treated appropriately by the Investigator using proper 
standard of car
e, according to their typical clinical practice and local  guidelines for that 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 104 
 
 emergency condition .  Emergen cy equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential 
adverse events must be available for immediate use .    
 Should a medical condition arise that the Investigator believes is related to the Investigational 
Product, clinical judgment should be used to provide the appropriate response including the 
consideration of discontinuation of Investigational Product. 
If a subject experiences a potential systemic allergic reaction  as assessed by the PI, the site will 
collect additional blood specimen(s) using the anaphylactic kit (unscheduled kit Type E) at the 
time of the event as per the PPD laboratory manual .  This assessment includes serum histamine, 
serum tryptase, immunoglobulin E, and complement components. As a guideline, i f a site does not have a formal “crash cart”, the following should be considered 
as a require ment  at the site:  
• Clinical personnel should be CPR certified  
• Clinic should have an automated external defibrillator  
The site s hould have the following emergency medications available: antihistamines , 
bronchodilators, IV saline , corticosteroids , acetaminophen , and epinephrine. 
12 Assessment of Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Immunog enicity  
12.1 Efficacy 
12.1.1 eDiary  
Subjects will complete a daily headache eDiary from the time of screening to Week 48.  The 
diary should be completed each trial day whether or not the subject had a headache. These daily  
entries  record if the subject took acute migraine medication on that day.  The compliance data 
from the eDiary will be made available to the trial site for  review. Sites are to review the diary 
results with the subject and if the subject has not completed the diary daily, counsel the subject 
on the importance of daily completion of the diary.  
The eDiary data from the 28 days following screening visit will be used to determine eligibility 
criteria,  and the baseline migraine and headache results.

24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 104 12.1.2 Endpoints    
Headache episodes will be self -reported by  the subject.  An episode is a single headache event 
that the subject reported as having a start and an end and which lasts at least 30 minutes .  The 
term headache will encompass both headaches and migraine headaches.  The migraine and 
headache endpoints will be summarized in four week , twelve  week and the twenty -four week 
interval .  Specifically, migraine and headache endpoints will be summarized for the four week 
intervals : Week s 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, 17-20, 21-24, … 44-48, the twelve week intervals 1 -12, 
13-24, 25-36, 37-48 and Weeks 1 -24, 25-48.
Migraine Day 
A migraine day is defined as any day with a head ache that mee ts the migraine or probably 
migraine  characteristics as outlined in Section 7.  Specifically , a migraine is defined as a self -
reported headache which : 
1. L asted  4 – 72 hours
2. had at lea
st 2 of the following
a.Unilateral location
b.Pulsating q
uality
c. Moderate or severe pain intensity
d. Aggravation by
 or causing avoidance of routine physical activity
3. had at least
 1 of the following
a.Nausea and/or vomiting
b. Photophobia and phonophobia
A pr
obable migr ai
ne is a heada che that meets only 2 of the above criteria. 
Frequency, Change and Percent Change of Migraine Days / Headache Days  
The frequency of migraine days is the number of migra ine days within four week intervals and 
the average four week frequency in twelve and twenty- four week intervals.  Change from 
baseline is the difference in frequency between baseline and the counts within these four week 
intervals.  The 12 and 24 week change is the difference in the frequency between baseline and 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 104 the average of the, 4 week intervals.  The percent change is 100 times the ratio of the change and 
the baseline frequency.  Similar measures will be produced based upon headache frequency . 
Migraine/ Headache Responder Rate 
Three responder rates  will be utilize d: 50%, 75% and 100%.  A responder is a subject who 
achieves a ≥ 50% reduction, ≥ 75% reduction, or 100% reduction in migraine days, respectively. 
These reductions will be evaluated by comparing the baseline frequency of migraine d ays to the 
migraine frequency in four week intervals.  
Results from these four week intervals will be combined to produce 12 and 24 week responder 
endpoints.  A responde
r will be a subject who achieves the specified percent  reduction in 
migraine  headache d ays within these intervals based upon the averag e change from baseline 
measures .    
Migraine Hours / Headache Hours 
Migraine hours are the sum of the duration of migraines within four week intervals, and the 
average four w
eek duration within 12 and 24 week intervals.  Headache hours are similarly 
defined but include all headaches. Subjects with no migraines/headaches will have a duration of zero.  
Migraine Attack / Headache Episode 
A migr
aine attack is defined as 1 continuously recorded migraine.  One a ttack may re sult in 
multiple migraine days.  Headache episodes are similarly defined.   
Migraine / Headache Severity 
Headache severity will be collected on a 3 point scale: mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain.  
Subjects with
 no migraines/headaches will b e included with a rate of zero.  
Acute Medication Usage 
The percent 
of migraines and headaches with acute medication usage will be summarized. 
Subjects wi
th no migraines/headaches will be included with a rate of zero.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 104 Acute Migraine Medication Usage 
The number of days within 4 week intervals that subjects used acute migraine medication (i.e. 
triptan or e rgota
mine ) will be summarized in 4, 12 and 24 week intervals.  The 12 and 24 week 
results will be the average of the individual 4 week results that make up those wider intervals 
(e.g. the secondary endpoint of Weeks 1 -12 will be the average of the Weeks 1-4, 5- 8 and 
9-12 results).  The change from baseline for these measures will be the difference between thepost baseline interval and baseline.
Percentage of subjects with a migraine on the day after dosing The percent of subjects with a migraine on the day after first dose  will be summar
 ized.  
Time to First Migraine  
Time to the first migraine after dosing will be a nalyzed based upon the migraine data entered 
into the eDiary.   SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36 v2.0) The SF -36 v2.0 is a health survey containing 36 questions consisting of eight scaled scores to 
measure quali
ty of life over the past 4 weeks , see Appendix 15.3.  The eight sections measured 
are vitality
, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role 
functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health.   EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L is 
 a des criptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five 
dimensions/questions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) 
each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no 
problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a 
particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ -5D-5L additionally includes a VAS sc ale.  Each item will 
be summarized separately.

questions are directed to the “most severe type of headache.”  Each item is measured on a Likert 
type scale option with response categories: “Does not apply to me”, “never,” “rarely,” “less than 
half the time,” and “half the time or more, ” see Appendix  15.5.     ASC items were scored as 0 
(i.e., never, rarely, or does not apply to me), 1 (less than half the time), and 2 (half the time or 
more), yielding scores that ranged from 0 to 24.  In this study, if a single item is missing it will 
be scored as a zero.  If more than one item is missing the total score will be missing.  The

12.3 Immunogenicity 
Serum  blood samples will be taken pre-dose on Day 0, and Week s 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48 and 
56 to test for antibodies to ALD403. The immunogenicity will be assessed in  serum from all 
ALD403- treated subjects using validated assay methods.  Immunogenicity will not be assessed 
in placebo subjects.  
If a subject terminates early from the clinical trial, all efforts will be made to collect blood samples to anal 
yze antibodies against  ALD403 unless consent has been withdrawn. For any 
samples that  are positive for anti-ALD403 antibody, there may  be additional testing to 
characterize the potential for neutralizing ( NAb ) ALD403 activity.  Subjects who test positive for 
specific anti -ALD403 antibodies at the time of the last study visit will be asked to provide up to 
2 additional blood samples for immunogenicity testing at approximately 3 month intervals for up 
to 6 months. 
Additional sample handling, proces sing, storage, labelling and shipping instructions will be 
provided to the site in a laboratory manual.   
13 Statistical Considerations  
13.1 Decision Rule  
A serial  procedure will be used to account for multiplicity of dose level for the primary endpoint 
and the secondary endpoints.  This procedure will start with the 300 mg vs placebo comparison 
for the primary endpoint .  If this is significant, testing will continue to a subset of the key 
secondary endpoints for 300 mg (first the Weeks 1-4 75% responder endpoint, then the Weeks  1-12 75% responder endpoint, and then the Weeks 1 -12 50% responder endpoint).  The 
procedure will then move on to the primary endpoint for the 100 mg group and subsequently to the same subset of key secondary endpoints as tested for the 300 mg dose.  The procedure will 
then move on to the remaining key secondary endpoint for 300 mg and 100 mg (i.e., p ercentage 
of subjects with a migraine on the day after dosing ).  Only if all of these secondary endpoints

24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 104 reach statistical significance will the 30 mg group be tested .  This testing algorithm is presented 
below. 
Statistical testing will be conducted at the 5% alpha level.  
13.2 Sample Size  
The planned sample size for this study is 800 randomized and treated subjects.  These subjects 
will be allocated into 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.  Pair -wise testing of each ALD403 
group vs. placebo will be performed. Two hundred subjects per group provides at least 95% 
power for each  change in frequency of migraine days (Weeks 1 -12) test  individually assuming a 
treatment effect of at least 1 day and a common standard deviation of 2.7 days or less.  Ninety percent power is retained for standard deviations up to 3 days.  For the key secondary 75% 
responder rates endpoints 95% power is achieved for the pair- wise comparisons assuming rates 
of 24% for placebo and 42% for ALD403.  For the 50% responder rate endpoints 95% power is achieved for the pair -wise comparisons assuming rates of 50% for placebo and 68% for

13.3 General Considerations 
13.3.1 Definition of Baseline  
Baseline for migraine and headache endpoints w ill be based upon the data recorded in the 
headache eDiary during the 28-days following screening. For other variables, the baseline 
assessment will be the latest available valid measurement taken prior to the administration of 
Investigational Product. This will generally be Day 0.  
13.3.2 Handling of Mis sing Data 
Summary statistics will be reported based upon observed data except for the diary data which will utilize the 
imputation outlined below . Additionally, if the start date of an AE or con comitant 
medication is incomplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of trial medication, except if an incomplete date ( e.g., month and year) clearly indicates that the 
event started prior to treatment.  
Summary statistics will be reported based upon observed data except for the diary data which 
will utilize the
 imputation outlined below . Additionally, if the start date of an AE or concomitant 
medication is incomplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of 
trial medication, except if an incomplete date ( e.g., month and year) clearly indicates that the 
event started prior to treatment.  
Subjects who do not complete the eDiary daily will have missing data. It is expected that most 
missing d iary d
ata will be sporadic.  If the diary has been completed at least 21 days in a 28 day 
interval , then normalization will be used. The results will be normalized to 28 days by 
multiplying the observed results  by the inverse of the completion rate (i.e. if a subject does not 
complete the diary on 5 days they will have completed the diary on 82% of the days and the normalized results  will be the observed results  times 1.22).  If the diary has been completed on 
less than 21 days in the 28 day interval then the results for the 28 day interval will be a weighted

24-Apr-2017
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 104 function of the observed data for the current four week interval and the results from the previous 
interval.  The weights will be proportional to  how many days the diary was completed and will 
provide greater weight to the results from the current interval as the diary completion rate increases.  Specifically, the results will be derived as  
28�𝑊𝑊𝑋𝑋
𝑐𝑐+(1−𝑊𝑊)𝑋𝑋𝑝𝑝�, 
where W is the days the diary was completed/20, X c is the available average daily results for the 
current interval and Xp are the average daily results for the previous interval.  
13.3.3 Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations t
o be analyzed are as follows: 
Full Analysis Population: Randomized subjects who re ceived Invest igational Product/placebo . 
Subjects will be summarized within the treatment group to which  they were randomized. This 
population will be used for efficacy analyses. 
Safety Population: Includes all s ubjects who  received Investigational Product/ placebo . Subjects 
will be summarized within the treatment group for which they actually received treatment. This 
population will be used for the safety analyses. 
13.4 Statistical Methods  
Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequency and percentage.   
13.4.1 Subject Dispos ition , Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
An accounting of all randomized trial subjects by disposition will be presented. This summarization 
will include a summary of all subjects who have received trial drug. 
Demographic, baseline characteristics, migraine history and concomitant medications  (coded by 
the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary) will be summarized descriptively by treatment 
group.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 104 13.4.2 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  The migraine and headache 
endpoints will be sum
marized by four , twelve and twenty -four week intervals with the remaining 
endpoints being summarized by study week.  
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Hypothesis testing will be performed for the primary endpoint: change from bas eline in migraine 
days from Weeks 1-12.  This endpoint will be calculated as outlined in Section 12.1.2 and will 
utilize the missing
 data rules provided in Section 13.3.2.  The hypotheses tested are  
Ho: ∆plb = ∆403 H a: ∆plb ≠ ∆403 
where ∆403 is the change in migraine days for subjects in the ALD403 treatment arm and ∆ plb is 
similarly defined for the placebo subjects.  The change from baseline is expected to be negative 
as migraines are being reduced.  While the test outlined above is two sided, as is the alpha level 
used for this study (i.e. 5%), clinically relevant results require a larger reduction of migraines on the ALD403 arms.   
An ANCOVA model will be used to  test for a dif
 ference between treatment arms.  This model 
will include the change from baseline measure as the response variable.  Treatment and the 
stratifica tion variable: baseline migraine days (continuous predictor) will be the independent 
variables.   
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Summary statistics including confidence interval for the treatment differences will be used to 
summarize  the res
ults for the secon dary endpoints. Testing will be performed for the key 
secondary endpoints and for the change in acute migraine medication days endpoint.  For the key 
secondary endpoints  (responder rates and  percentage of subjects with a migraine on the day after 
dosing ) this testing will utilize a CMH /extended CMH test.  The test s will be stratified by the 
randomization stratification factor .  The change in acute migraine medication day endpoints wi ll 
be tested using an ANCOVA model similar to the one used for the primary endpoints:  change from baseline measure as the response, treatment and baseline acute migraine medication days as

The missing data rules provided in Section 13.3.2 will be used for the key secondary endpoints 
except for th
e percentage of subjects with a migraine (prevalence) on the day after dosing 
endpoint.  Subjects who did not complete the diary on the day following dosing will be included in the prev alence rate calculation based upon their month 1 daily migraine rate.  Hence, subjects 
with a migraine will be included in the  rate calculation as a value of 1, subjects who completed 
the diary and did not have a migraine will be included as a zero and subjects who did not 
complete the diary will be included with a value between 0 and 1 equal to the number of month 1 
migraine day s / 28.  
13.4.3 Pharmacokinetic  Analyses 
Ana
lysis of Drug Concentrations 
The concentrat
ions of Free ALD403 will be listed and summarized  by time point and  dose group, 
and descriptive statistics will be provided. In this analysis, concentrations below the lower lim it 
of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to zero.   
Plots of the individual concentrations of Free ALD403 wil l be presented over time (linear and 
log scales). Plots of the mean  or median concentration will be presented over time (linear and log 
scales).  Whe n the scale is linear, concentrations below the lower limit of quantification will be 
set to zero. In the log- scaled figures, concentrations below the LLOQ will be imputed as 
LLOQ/2.   Population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed on the results for Free 
ALD403 concentrations obtained during this study in combination with the results from previous 
studies of ALD403 in normal subjects and migraine patients.

Investigator abide by the principles of the GCP guidelines of the ICH and applicable federal and 
local regulations. The clinical trial also will be conducted  in keeping with local legal 
requirements . 
14.7  Informed Consent 
Before each subject is admitted to the clinical trial , informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject (or his/her legally authorized representative) according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. The consent forms must be dated and retained by the 
Investigator as part of the clinical trial records. The Investigator will not undertake any 
investigation specifically required for the clinical trial until valid consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented in the CRF. E ach 
subject will receive a fully -signed copy of each consent form that he/she signs for the clinical 
trial. 
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need 
 to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate 
ethics committee , and signed by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the clinical trial as well as 
those currently enrolled in the clinical trial. If subject or subject’s partner , becomes  pregnant 
during their  participation in the trial, a separate pregnancy  informed consent form will be 
obtained, to follow the pregnancy, any complications, and the health of the baby.  The pregnancy consent should be obtained at the time the investigator becomes aware of the pr egnancy.  
14.8  Protocol Approval and Amendment 
Before the start of the clinical trial, the clinical trial protocol and/or other relevant documents 
will be approved by the ethics committee , in accordance with local legal requirements. The 
Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject 
is enrolled in the clinical trial.

This scale is intended to be used by individuals who have received training in its administration. The 
questions contai
ned in the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale are suggested probes. Ultimately, the 
determination of the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual 
administering the scale.  
Definitions of behavioral suicidal events in this scale are based on those used in The Columbia 
Suicide History Form , developed by John Mann, MD and Maria Oquendo, MD,  Conte Center for the 
Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD), New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside

Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to 
kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual 
suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically fr om the beha vior or circumstances. For 
example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to  head, jumping 
from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but  they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be 
inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm 
yourself?
Hav
e you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end  your life?  
D
id you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel 
better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt 
would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather  than an 
in
terrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from 
pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to ju mp, is grabbed and 
taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

5.3.2 Summary 
of Clinical 
Trials  23-26A double -blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, ascending 
dose phase 1 study (Protocol 
ALD403 -CLIN -001) to 
determine the safety and tolerability of ALD403 was conducted in two parts. In Part 
A (dose escalation), 1 of 7 
ALD403 dose levels (range 1 
mg to 1000 mg) or placebo was administered intravenously to healthy male subjects, and 
ALD403 300 mg or placebo 
was administered intravenously to healthy female subjects. Additionally, ALD403 100 mg or placeb o was subcutaneously 
(SC) administered to a cohort of healthy male subjects.  
In Part B, sumatriptan 6 mg was administer ed
 SC 4 hours after 
either ALD403 300 mg IV or 
placebo IV to healthy subjects.   
In this trial, a total of 55 
subjects recei
ved a single 
intravenous dose of ALD403 
(range 1 mg to 1000 mg) and 31 
subjects received a single dose of placebo, 12 subjects received a single subcutaneous dose of ALD403 (100 mg) and 6 
subjects received a single 
subcutaneous dose of placebo.  
A total of 179 treatmen t 
emergent ad
verse events 
(TEAEs) were reported during the trial period in 73 subjects (70.2%).   Only one serious adverse event (SAE) was 
reported.  This event was 
considered unrelated to ALD403.  There were no TEAEs that resulted in study Detailed descriptions of the

fatal.  
ALD403 inhibited capsaicin induced increases in skin blood flow (mediated by CGRP) in a dose dependent manner. The terminal eli mination half -life of 
ALD403 was approximately 28 days.  
In a second study of frequent 
episodic mig
raine (Protocol 
ALD403 -CLIN -002), subjects 
with 5  to 14 migraine days per 
month were randomized to 
receive a single intravenous 
dose of ALD403 1000 mg or 
placebo in a double -blind 
fashion. The primary endpoint was the mean change in 
frequency of migraine headache 
days from baseline to Weeks 5 -
8. Subjects were followed for
24 weeks for additional safety
and efficacy analyses.
Of 174 subjects randomized, 
163 s ubjects recei 
ved either 
ALD403 (81) or placebo (82). There were no significant 
differences in baseline 
demographics or characteristics between the two treatment groups. The mean change in 
migraine days between Weeks 
5-8 and baseline was -5.6 (66%
decrease)  vs. -4.6 (52%
decrease) for ALD403 and
placebo, respectively (one -sided
p = 0.034). The proportion of

for ALD403 and placebo was 
16% vs 0%, respectively ( p < 
0.001). There were no 
differences in the type or 
frequency of adverse events, vital signs, or laboratory safety data between the two treatment 
groups.  A single intravenous 
dose of ALD403 1000 mg 
demonstrated efficacy for the preventive treatment of migraine in subjects with 
frequent episodic migraine.  
Overall, 89 subjects 
experienced a total of 199 AEs.  Most AEs were transient and 
mild to moderate in severity. In 
the ALD403 treatment group, 46 (56.8%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE, and in the placebo group, 43 (52.4%)  subjects had 
at least 1 TEAE. Three subjects (2 in the ALD403 group; 1 in the placebo group) had a total of 6 SAEs, all of which were considered unrelated. There 
were no TEAEs that resulted in 
study drug infusion interruption, death, or study discont inuation; no TEAEs 
were considered to be life-
threatening/disabling, or fatal.  
A second clinical trial 
(ALD403 -CLIN -003) 
in healthy 
volunteers has been completed.  The trial was a multiple dose, placebo -controlled trial to 
determine the safety, tolerabilit y, pharmacodynamics, 
and pharmacokinetics of ALD403 administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers.

subjects with placebo.  A total of 58 out of 60 subjects received three doses of assigned 
study treatment with an interval 
of one month between each 
dose. Two out of 60 subjects only received one dose of assigned study treatment. One subject who received one dose 
withdrew from the trial due to a 
job change and one subject expe rienced an unrelated 
serious adverse event and withdrew from treatment.  
There were no changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or ECGs in subjects dosed with ALD403 or placebo. Treatment -emergent adverse 
events were reported in 52 (86.7%) of 60 subjects.  No significant differences were observed between subjects who received ALD403 and subjects 
who received placebo in terms 
of incidence, type, severity, relationship or frequency of TEAEs with the exception of injection site reactions.  Only 
subjects  who received ALD403 
experienced injection site 
reactions.  These reactions were mild to moderate and included erythema, pruritus and 
induration.

5.4 Risks and 
Benefits  27-28Migraine patients may gain 
benefit from the prevention of 
their migraine with ALD403. No specific toxicities or adverse effects related to the blockade of CGRP by ALD403 have 
been identified in either the 
nonclinical toxicology program or the three clinical trials with ALD403 that have been completed to date. Given the 
limited number (N=184) of 
subjects who have received ALD403 as of this protocol, there may be uncommon treatment related adverse 
effects that have not yet been 
identified. As with all protein  
therapeutics, there is a risk of a serious allergic reaction.  However, no serious allergic 
reactions have been observed 
with the administration of ALD403 in humans, to date.  ALD403 may prevent migraine 
from occurring in patients 
treated in this trial.  No specific 
toxicities or adverse effects related to the blockade of CGRP by ALD403 have been 
identified in either the 
nonclinical toxicology program or the clinical trials with ALD403 that have been completed to date.  
There may be unknown adverse 
e
ffects and unforeseeable risks 
associated with study drug administration  or unexpected 
interactions with another drug 
that have not yet been 
identified.  
As with all protein therapeutics, there is a ri
sk of a serious 
allergic reaction.  In completed 
ALD403 trials conducted to 
date, no serious allergic reactions have been observed with the administration of ALD403 in humans.  
In the completed ALD403 clinical tri
als with headache 
patients, the most common observed adverse events (>5%) with receiving ALD403 or 
placebo included upper 
respiratory tract infection, back 
pain, dizziness, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, and 
headache. The majority of these 
adverse events were 
categorized as mild to moderate.  Risk section

12.1.1 eDiary  57 Subjects will complete a daily 
headache eDiary from the time of screening to Week 48.  The diary should be completed each trial day whether or not the subject had a headache. The 
compliance data from the 
eDiary will be made available to the trial site for review. Sites are to review the diary results with the subject and if the 
subject has not completed the 
diary daily, counsel the subject on the importance of daily completion of the diary.  Subjects will complete a daily 
headache eDiary from the time of screening to Week 48.  The 
diary should be completed each trial day whether or not the subject had a headache. These 
daily entries should also record 
if the subject took acute migraine medication on that day.  The compliance data from the eDiary will be mad e 
available to the trial site for review. Sites are to review the diary results with the subject and if the subject has not completed the diary daily,

13.1 Decision 
Rule  62-63 A serial procedure will be used 
to account for multiplicity of dose level for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints.  This procedure will start with the 300 mg vs 
placebo comparison for the 
primary endpoint.  If this is significant, testing  will continue 
to the key secondary endpoints for 300 mg (first the Weeks 1 -4, 
75% responder endpoint and then the Weeks 1 -12 75% 
responder endpoint).  The procedure will then move on to the 100 mg group the primary 
endpoint and subsequently the 
secondary endpoints and then A serial procedure will be used 
to account for multiplicity of dose level for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints.  This procedure will start with the 300  mg vs 
placebo comparison for the primary endpoint.  If this is significant, testing will continue to a subset of the key secondary endpoints for 300 
mg (first the Weeks 1 -4 75% 
responder endpoint, then the 
Weeks 1 -12 75% responder 
endpoint, and then the Weeks 1-12 50% responder endpoint).
The procedure will then moveon to the primary endpoi nt forChange in the 
multiplicity rules to reflect the new key secondary endpoints.

subsequently to the same subset 
of key secondary endpoints as 
tested for the 300 mg dose.  The procedure will then move on to the remaining key secondary endpoint for 300 mg 
and 100 mg (i.e., percentage of 
subjects with a migrai ne on the 
day after dosing).  Only if all of these secondary endpoints reach statistical significance 
will the 30 mg group be tested.

13.2 Sample 
Size 63-64 The planned sample size for 
this study is 800 randomized

methods.   
The missing data rules provided in Section 13.3.2 will 
be used for the key secondary endpoints except for the percentage of subjects with a migraine (prevalence) on the 
day after dosing endpoint.  
Subjects who d id not complete 
the diary on the day following dosing will be included in the prevalence rate calculation 
based upon their month 1 daily 
migraine rate. Hence, subjects with a migraine will be included in the rate calculation as a value of 1, subjects who 
completed the diary and did not 
have a migraine will be 
included as a zero and subjects who did not complete the diary will be included with a value 
between 0 and 1 equal to the 
number of month 1 migraine days / 28.

Statistical Design and Power  
Study design 
This study is a non- randomized, Phase I clinical trial. Participants will be high school students 
and teachers in southwest Montana. In the first year, 30 teachers from the same school district will be recruited to participate in a virtually - delivered trauma -informed yoga intervention (heart 
rate variability data will be gathered from a group of high school students to assess utility for the measure in year 2). In the second year, we will expand the intervention to high school students in Livingston city and rural Park County schools, recruiting 30 students in each area to participate in a synchronous, virtually -delivered, trauma- informed yoga intervention during their 
health enhancement classes.  In addition, 30 teachers from the  rural Park County schools  will 
be recruited to participate in the same virtually -delivered, trauma- informed yoga intervention 
offered to Livingston teachers  concurrently.  
In each year, participant assessments (surveys, salivary cortisol, and heart rate 
variability(HRV)) will be ad ministered prior to intervention and immediately after the 
intervention at 6 weeks. Follow -up assessments will be conducted in the fall semester 
following each intervention to measure persistence of the treatment. Thus, Livingston 
teachers  may have up to six time points  of data collection, while  Park  County  students  and 
teachers  and Livingston  students  will have up to three.  In addition,  salivary cortisol and HRV 
will be collected at the midpoint  of the intervention  (3 weeks)  each year.  Measures  collected 
are detailed in Table 1.

Power considerations  
This is an early -phase trial, the results of which will be used to inform full power analyses  for 
future clinic al trials. We do not expect to be powered to detect small intervention effects.  
However, as a preliminary assessment of power, we consider the power of a paired t -test 
comparing pre - and post - intervention scores on the various response measures, including 
survey scales, cortisol, and HRV. We compute power in terms of Cohen’s d, a sta ndardized 
effect size measure that describes the impact of the intervention in terms of the number of 
standard deviations that the effect is equivalent to (so an effect of 5 points on a scale with SD 20 would have a Cohen’s d of 0.25). On this scale, an effect size of 0.2 is typically considered “small”, 0.5 “moderate”, and 0.75 “large”. This may not align with clinically meaningful 
differences in outcome measures, however.  
For comparisons within intervention groups in their first (and sometimes only) year of 
intervention, we expect to have 30 participants in each group (Livingston students, Livingston 
teachers, rural students, rural teachers). Assuming a Type I error rate of α = 0.05, we achieve 
80% power to detect a Cohen’s d of 0.53, and 90% power to detect a Cohen’s d of 0.61. Thus, 
the study is adequately powered to detect moderate -to-large effects of the intervention. The 
study design will allow  us to estimate the magnitude of effects, intra-class  correlations  by school 
and classroom, and the variability of intervention impacts —all the inputs needed to perform a 
formal power analysis for a future Phase III trial. Full power curves for n = 30 and n = 15 participants are given in Figure  1.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
For each outcome,  we will compute  the change in the scale  score or biomarker  value  from 
baseline  to post- intervention (post  – pre) and compute unadjusted  averages  and standard 
deviations.  These  computations  will be done within  participant  group  (Livingston  students, 
Livingston teachers, rural students, rural  teachers).  
We will also obtain adjusted estimates using mixed effects linear regression models of 
post-test score on pre -test score with demographic factors and random effects for school and 
intervention group  nested within  school  (Laird  & Ware  1982).  This will allow  us to estimate intra- 
class correlations for intervention group and school, which will be required for sample size 
estimation in a full efficacy  trial. 
We propose the following model for the individual response (anxiety, depressive 
symptoms, etc.), d enoted Yijk, where i = 1,…, I indexes school, j = 1,…, J indexes intervention 
group (only  needed if there  are multiple  health education classes  receiving  the intervention in a 
school), and k = 1,…, N indexes participants within  groups.  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛿𝛿 + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 
𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 ~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜏𝜏2) 
𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖)~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜔𝜔2) 
𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜎2) 
Thus,  αi represents  a random  effect for school  i, with variance  τ2β ,j represents  a random  effect 
corresponding to group j in school i, with variance 𝜔𝜔2. We model this as a function of Zijk, the 
pre-intervention score for participant k in group j in school i , and X ijk, the set of other modeled 
covariates, centered at their means. This means that the intercept parameter θ gives the 
expec ted effect of the program  for a student  or teacher  with “average”  demographics  and other 
covariate values  after  controlling  for within -school  and within -group correlation.  We can use the 
estimates  of the random -effects  variances  and the residual  variance  to produce estimates  of the 
intra-class correlations for school and for intervention  group.  
This is a Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model. As all primary and secondary response 
v
ariables are continuous and may reasonably be expected to be normally di stributed we can 
implement the model using restricted maximum likelihood (Laird & Ware 1982) using the lme4 package in R (Bates et. al., 2015).  

 
Biomarker analyses. Salivary cortisol and HRV will also be collected mid- intervention. 
To fully characterize temporal patterns in these outcomes, we will use a different LME model 
that captures the full trajectory over time. In this case, we propose the following model for the 
individual response, denoted Yijkt, where i = 1,…, I indexes school, j = 1,…, J indexes 
intervention group (only needed if there are multiple health education classes receiving the 
intervention in a school), k = 1,…, N indexes participants within groups,  and t = 1,…3 indexes 
the time point of the observation.  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  = 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛿𝛿 + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖)  + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  
𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜏𝜏2) 
𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖)~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜔𝜔2) 
𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜗𝜗2) 
𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜎2) 
Thus,  αi represents  a random  effect  for school  i, with variance τ2, βj(i) represents  a random  effect 
corresponding to group j in school i, with variance 𝜔𝜔2, and γk(ij) represents a random effect 
corresponding to student  k in group  j and school i , with variance 𝜗𝜗2. We model  this as a function 
of Tijkt, the time of the tth cortisol or HRV measure for participant k in group j in school i , and Xijk, 
the set of other baseline covariates included in the model, centered at their means. We can 
also consider a random slope model with varying  slopes for each student over time if model 
diagnostics suggest this more complex model will be a better fit to the data.

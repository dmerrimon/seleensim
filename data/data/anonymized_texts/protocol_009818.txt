 Page 6 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  1. Objectives  
 
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stimulation parameter selection reflects a balance 
between efficacy and cognitive adverse effects. ECT stimulation parameters associated 
with more antidepressant efficacy (non -focal electrode placement, longer pulse width) a re 
associated with increased risk of cognitive adverse effects. Amplitude is currently fixed at 
800 or 900 milliamperes (mA) in standard clinical practice with no clinical or scientific 
basis.  Amplitude determines the intensity of the induced electric fiel d (E-field).  With a 
fixed extracranial amplitude, the ECT “dose” as represented by the E -field is highly 
variable due to anatomic differences in skin, skull, fluid, and brain tissue. This anatomic 
variability is prominent in older (age 50+) depressed patie nts and can compromise both 
antidepressant efficacy (insufficient stimulation of mood -related circuitry) and safety 
(inducing cognitive impairment due to excessive stimulation of cognitive related circuitry).  
 
Our long-term goal  is focused on advancing tre atment for older adults with depressive 
disorders  by refining neuromodulation  stimulus parameters to improve efficacy and 
cognitive safety.  Our BRAIN Initiative project (MH111826) used right unilateral electrode 
placement (RUL) and randomized older ECT sub jects to 600, 700, and 800  mA treatment 
arms. Our results demonstrated a trade -off between antidepressant (improved with higher 
amplitudes) and cognitive (improved with lower amplitudes) outcomes. Subjects in the 
600 mA arm had worse depression outcomes, l ess neuroplasticity, and cognitive safety, 
while subjects in the higher amplitude arms (700 and 800  mA) had improved 
antidepressant outcomes, more neuroplasticity, and cognitive deficits.  
 
Amplitude titration, as proposed here, can reduce the variability related to fixed amplitude 
dosing and optimize clinical and cognitive outcomes. The goal of this project is to change 
standard ECT parameter selection from a fixed amplitude with variable pu lse number 
(combination of pulse train duration and frequency) to an individualized and empirically 
determined amplitude with fixed pulse number . To achieve this goal, we will focus on the 
relationship between amplitude titrated seizure threshold and treat ment -responsive changes 
in hippocampal neuroplasticity with RUL fixed amplitude ECT. Fixed amplitude ECT 
results in variable E -fields and inconsistent changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity. In 
contrast, computational and pre-translational investigations have demonstrated that 
amplitude titration results in consistent E -fields. Seizure titration amplitudes (based on 
historic data, 233 to 544  mA) are below the amplitude range of FDA -approved ECT 
devices (500 to 900  mA) and will require an adaptor to reduce t he amplitude (FDA 
Investigational Device Exemption).  Amplitude titration will also be below the 
hippocampal neuroplasticity threshold and insufficient for antidepressant response.  The 
difference between RUL amplitude titration and RUL fixed amplitude (800  mA) ECT will 
determine the degree of target engagement with the hippocampus. To illustrate, subjects 
with low amplitude seizure threshold of ~250 mA (800/250, high fixed/titration amplitude 
ratio) will have significant changes in hippocampal neuroplasticit y. Subjects with high 
amplitude ~500  mA (800/500, low fixed/titration ratio) will have minimal changes in 
hippocampal neuroplasticity. The relationship between amplitude titration and fixed 
amplitude hippocampal neuroplasticity will be used to develop the amplitude multiplier 
required for consistent and clinically effective ECT dosing. Amplitude titration with 
 Page 7 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  multiplier will be associated with the “sweet spot” for hippocampal neuroplasticity: 
sufficient for antidepressant response but not excessive thus re sulting in cognitive safety.  
 
Older depressed subjects (n = 40) will first receive RUL amplitude titration (first treatment) 
and then RUL fixed amplitude (800  mA) and fixed pulse number ECT (subsequent 
treatments) . We will 1) verify results from pre-translational investigations that 
demonstrated the relationship between current pulse amplitude and a whole brain E -field 
metric ( I/Ebrain), and 2) determine the relationship between current pulse amplitude and 
treatment -responsive changes in hippocamp al neuroplasticity from RUL fixed -amplitude 
(800 mA) ECT.  
 
H1:  Amplitude seizure titration will have a positive correlation with I/Ebrain.  
 
H2, Go/No -Go criterion : The ratio of amplitude titrated seizure threshold to fixed 
amplitude ECT will demonstrate a linear relationship with treatment -responsive changes 
in hippocampal neuroplasticity. This relationship will determine the “neuroplasticity 
multiplier” to bridge from amplitude titration to hippocampal neuroplasticity.  
 
2. Background  
 
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stimulation parameter selection reflects a balance 
between efficacy and cognitive adverse effects. ECT stimulation parameters associated 
with more antidepressant efficacy (non -focal electrode placement, longer pulse width) a re 
associated with increased risk of cognitive adverse effects. Amplitude is currently fixed at 
800 or 900 milliamperes (mA) in standard clinical practice with no clinical or scientific 
basis. Amplitude determines the intensity of the spatial distribution of the electric field (E -
field). With a fixed extracranial amplitude, the ECT “dose” as represented by the E -field is 
highly variable due to anatomic differences in skin, skull, fluid, and brain tissue. This 
anatomic variability is prominent in older (age 50+) depressed patients and can 
compromise both antidepressant efficacy (insufficient stimulation of mood -related 
circuitry) and safety (inducing cognitive impairment due to excessive stimulation of 
cognitive related circuitry). Amplitude titration, as pro posed in this current proposal, can 
reduce the variability related to fixed amplitude dosing and optimize clinical and cognitive 
outcomes. The goal of this project is to change standard ECT parameter selection from a 
fixed amplitude to an individualized an d empirically determined amplitude. To achieve this 
goal, we will focus on the relationship between amplitude titration and treatment -
responsive changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity with RUL fixed amplitude ECT. Fixed 
amplitude ECT results in variable E -field or ECT dose. Over the course of an ECT series, 
the variable ECT dose will result in inconsistent changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity. 
In contrast, pre-translational investigations have demonstrated that amplitude titration 
results in a consistent E-field or ECT “dose”. Seizure titration amplitudes (based on historic 
data, 233 to 544  mA) are below the amplitude range of FDA -approved ECT devices (500 
to 900  mA) and will require an adaptor to reduce the output amplitude (Investigational 
Device Exempti on). Amplitude titration will also be below the hippocampal 
neuroplasticity threshold and insufficient for antidepressant response.  The difference 
between RUL amplitude titration and RUL fixed amplitude (800  mA) ECT will determine 
 Page 8 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  the degree of target enga gement with the hippocampus. To illustrate, subjects with low 
amplitude titration of ~250 mA (800/250, high fixed/titration amplitude ratio) will have 
significant changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity. Subjects with high amplitude titration 
~500  mA (800/5 00, low fixed/titration ratio) will have minimal changes in hippocampal 
neuroplasticity. The relationship between amplitude titration and fixed amplitude 
hippocampal neuroplasticity will be used to develop the amplitude multiplier required for 
consistent a nd clinically effective ECT dosing. A randomized controlled trial will then 
compare hippocampal neuroplasticity, antidepressant, and cognitive outcomes between 
amplitude titration with neuroplasticity multiplier (fixed pulse number) and traditional 
fixed a mplitude ECT (800  mA, variable pulse number) in  older depressed subjects . 
 
3. Study Design  
 
Subjects will receive their baseline imaging, clinical, and neuropsychological assessment 
24 to 48 hours prior to the first ECT session (V1). Subjects will first recei ve RUL amplitude 
titration (first treatment) and then RUL fixed amplitude (800  mA) and fixed pulse number 
ECT (subsequent treatments) . We will 1) verify results from pre -translational 
investigations that demonstrated the relationship between current pulse amplitude and a 
whole brain E -field metric ( I/Ebrain), and 2) determine the relationship between current 
pulse amplitude and treatment -responsive changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity from 
RUL fixed -amplitude (800  mA) ECT.  Treatments will continue thrice weekly until clinical 
response, which typically occurs between six and twelve treatments 14. Subjects will 
receive their second assess ment (V2) one day after the sixth ECT treatment and the final 
assessment (V3) one day after the ECT series. Subjects who do not demonstrate 
improvement by the V2 assessment (< 25% reduction from baseline IDS-C30 total score ) 
will transition to traditional BT for the remainder of the ECT series. The anesthesiologist 
will determine the appropriate dose of methohexital (general anesthetic) and 
succinylcholine (depolarizing neuromuscular blocker). Anesthetic medications, 
electroen cephalographic seizure duration, motor seizure duration, and maximum ictal heart 
rate will be recorded for each treatment.  
 
Subjects (n = 40) will receive amplitude titrated seizure threshold during the first treatment 
with RUL 105. The Soterix 4X1 High Definition ECT Multi -channel Stimulation Interface 
(“Soterix Interface”) is a passive amplitu de reducer for the MECTA 5000Q. The Soterix 
Interface reduces the amplitude range to 200  mA and permits 50  mA incremental dosing 
throughout the 200 to 900  mA dosing range. Pulse width (1.0  ms), pulse train duration 
(8 s), and frequency (20  Hz, 320  pulses) will be fixed for amplitude titration. Subjects will 
receive stimulations starting with 200  mA with 50  mA increases until seizure activity is 
initiated. Clinical judgement will define seizure adequacy based on duration and 
morphology.  In addition, subjects  will receive amplitude titrated motor threshold after 
administration of general anesthesia during the second ECT treatment (exploratory aim, 
see “Motor Titration” below). After amplitude titrated seizure threshold, subsequent 
treatments will be completed with RUL fixed 800  mA with the same pulse width (1.0  ms) 
and pulse number (8  s, 20  Hz, and 320  pulses). If the subject fails to demonstrate 
improvement at V2 (< 25% reduction from baseline IDS-C30 total score ), the subject will 
then receive traditional BT for the remainder of the ECT series.

4. Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria  
 
Entry criteria will include men and women of all backgrounds.  
 
Inclusion criteria : 1) Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 (SCID -5) will confirm 
diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD; with or without psychotic features); 2) 
clinical indications for ECT with right unilateral electrode placement including treatment 
resistance or a need for a rapid and definitive response, 3) right -handedness,  4) age range 
betwee n 50 and 80 years , and 5) English -speaking (many of the neuropsychological tests 
are only available in English) . Antidepressant medications will be continued as clinically 
indicated. To maintain feasibility and retention, as needed medications will be perm itted 
for anxiety (lorazepam, total dose 2mg/day) and insomnia (trazodone, total dose: 
150mg/day). Late-life depression is often associated with cognitive impairment. 
Cognitive impaired older adults will be included in the study sample.  
 
Exclusion criteri a: 1) Defined neurological or neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., 
traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease); 2) other psychiatric conditions 
(e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder); 3) current drug or alcohol use disorder (except 
for nicotine); 4) contraindications to MRI ; 5) prisoners; and 6) pregnancy (pre -
menopausal participants will receive pregnancy test, which is clinically indicated for 
ECT and not part of study protocol).  
 
5. Number of Subjects  
 
We will recruit  40 subjects  who meet inclusion criteria.  
 
6. Study Timelines  
 
Our total sample size (n = 40) allows for a conservative 20% attrition rate leaving a final 
sample size of 32. This recruitment rate of 20 subjects per year will complete subject 
recruitment 2 years after st udy initiation. We have a successful recruitment and retention 
history for ECT -imaging investigations of approximately 20 subjects per year with this 
demographic for the last decade and are well poised to meet the recruitment/enrollment 
goals delineated in  this project proposal . 
 
7. Study Endpoints  
 
After recruiting a minimum of 32 subjects, we will assess the following relationships: 1) 
amplitude -determined seizure threshold and whole brain conductivity metrics ( I/Ebrain); 
and 2) amplitude titration and chang es in right hippocampal volume with 800  mA ECT . 
 
8. Research Setting  
 
All data collection will take place at the UNM Center for Psychiatric Research, the Mind  
Research Network or the ECT service at the University of New Mexico. All clinical  
 Page 10 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  assessments and neuropsychological testing will be conducted in an interview room. These 
rooms are scheduled by research staff. The MRI  scanner is located at the Mind Research 
Network. The optional EEG monitoring will be conducted at the ECT clinical servi ces: the 
UNMH Post Anesthesia Care Unit (inpatient) or UNM Outpatient Surgical Imaging 
Services (outpatient).

Soterix High Definition ECT Multi -
channel Stimulation Interface 
(information from Soterix Operator’s 
Manual) : The S oterix 4X1 HD -ECT Multi -
Channel Stimulation Interface (“Soterix 
Interface”) is an accessory to a 2 -channel 
ECT stimulator and does not function as a 
stand -alone electrical stimulator or 
generator. The Soterix Interface is designed 
to be used as an interfac e device and the 
stimulation leads. The device is designed to 
be operated in either SCAN or PASS 
modes. The SCAN mode is used to 
determine lead quality values prior to switching to the PASS mode. The PASS mode 
provides the option for attenuating ECT device  output. When the attenuation feature is 
enabled, the PASS mode only attenuates the stimulus current amplitude leaving other

attenuated current range is between 200 – 500 mA with 2  mA increments (50  mA dose 
increments will be used in this proposal). The Patient Stimulus cable (output cable of the 
ECT device) is used to connect the device to the Soterix Interface, which will then connect 
to right unilateral stimulation elec trodes (traditional stimulation handles with 5  cm 
spherical diameter). The Research Strategy delineates how the Soterix Interface will be 
used in this project. We have received FDA Investigational Device Exemption approval to 
use the Soterix Interface for this investigation.

N/A 
 
12. Study Procedures  
 
Study Protocol:  Subjects will receive their baseline imaging, clinical, and 
neuropsychological assessment 24 to 48 hours prior to the first ECT session (V1). 
Treatments will continue thrice weekly until clinical response, which typically occurs 
between six and twelve tre atments 14. Subjects will receive their second assessment (V2) 
one day after the sixth ECT treatment and the final assessment (V3) one day after the ECT 
series. Subje cts who do not demonstrate improvement by the V2 assessment (< 25% 
reduction from baseline IDS-C30 total score ) will transition to traditional BT for the 
remainder of the ECT series. The anesthesiologist will determine the appropriate dose of 
methohexital (general anesthetic) and succinylcholine (depolarizing neuromuscular 
blocker). Anesthetic medications, electroencephalographic seizure duration, motor seizure 
duration, and maximum ictal heart rate will be recorded for each treatment.  
 
Subjects (n = 40) wi ll receive amplitude titrated seizure threshold during the first treatment 
with RUL 105. The Soterix 4X1 High Definition ECT Multi -channel Stimulation Interface 
(“Soterix Interface”) is a passive amplitude reducer for the MECTA 5000Q. The Soterix 
 Page 12 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  Interface reduces the amplitude range to 200  mA and permits 50  mA incremental dosing 
throughout the 200 to 900  mA dosing range. Pulse width (1.0  ms), pulse train duration (8  s) 
frequency (20  Hz, 320  pulses) and will be fixed for amplitude titration. Subjects will 
receive stimulations starting with 200  mA with 50  mA increases until seizure activity is 
initiated. Clinical judgement will define seizure adequacy based on duration and 
morphology.  In addition, subjects will receive amplitude titrated motor threshold after 
administration of general anesthesia during the second ECT treatment (exploratory aim, 
see “Motor Titration” below). After amplitude titrated seizure threshold, subsequent 
treatments will be completed with RUL fixed 800  mA (traditional amplitude) with the same 
pulse width (1.0  ms) and pulse number (8  s, 20  Hz, and 320  pulses). If the subject fa ils to 
demonstrate improvement at V2 (< 25% reduction from baseline IDS-C30 total score ), the 
subject will then receive traditional bitemporal electrode placement  for the remainder of 
the ECT series.  
 
Clinical Assessments:  The clinician -rated 30 -item Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (IDS -C30) will be the primary depression severity measure 83. The 
number of subjects transitioning to bitemporal electrode placement after the mid -ECT 
assessment (V2, see Study Protocol) will be the secondary depression outcome. The IDS -
C30 includes depressive items in accordance with t he DSM -5. Each item is scored from 0 - 
3 and summed for a total score between 0 – 84. The initial visit (V1) will also include the 
Maudsley Staging Method to measure antidepressant treatment resistance within the 
current depressive episode 84, ECT Appropriateness Scale to assess the indication for ECT 
85, Medical History form to gau ge overall medical burden, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile 
to measure vascular burden 86, and Edinburgh Handedn ess Inventory to define handedness 
87. Additional characteristics of the current and past depressive episodes will also be 
recorded during the initial visit: age of onset, age of first treatment, number of depressive 
episodes, and depressive episode duration.  
Rationale : The IDS -C30 has excellent psychometric properties 88, includes symptoms 
relevant to depression subtypes (melancholic and atypical), and converts to other  
depression rating scales relevant to NIH data sharing.  
 
Neuropsychological Assessments:  The Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) 
Verbal Fluency test will be the primary cognitive measure 89. The Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MOCA), a measure of global cognitive function that is se nsitive to gross 
neurocognitive abnormalities, will screen for preexisting cognitive impairment 90,91. The 
Test of Premorbid Function (TOPF) will estimate premorbid intellectual function for use 
as a covariate in cognitive analyses 92. The Dot Counting Test will measure performance 
validity 93. The Autobiographical Memory Test will assess multiple aspects (free recall, 
retrieval pattern, cognitive efficiency) of retrospective autobiographical memory 94-96. The 
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised (HVLT -R) will measure verbal learning and 
memory 97,98. To minimize practice effects, each time point will use a different published 
HVLT -R ver sion 99. The DKEFS Color -Word Interference test will measure processing 
speed, inhibition, initiation, and cognitive flexibility  89,100 -103. The DKEFS Verbal Fluency 
test will measure phonemic and semantic fluency, and cognitive flexibility. The DKEFS 
Tower Test will m easure planning and problem solving 89. Lastly, the NIH Toolbox Flanker 
Inhibitory Control and Attention Test will measure attention and inhibition 104.

Neuroimaging Acquisition and Data Processing  
Imaging data will be collected on a 3 -Tesla Siemens PRISMA scanner with strong 
gradients and minimal shading artifa ct and a 32-channel coil using multiband sequences 
at the Mind Research Network (MRN) . The imaging acquisitions relevant to this project 
include the following:  
1. sMRI (T1) : Repetition time (TR) = 2530 milliseconds (ms), echo time (TE) = 1.64, 3.5,

3. High -resolution T2 : TR = 8020  ms, TE = 80  ms, flip angle = 150.0  °, slices = 30, field 
of view = 150, matrix 384 × 384, voxel size = 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.2 mm and total acquisition 
time = 7:05.  
 
Preprocessing steps with each imaging modality include the following:  
1. FreeSurfer Segmentation (T1 an d T2) : FreeSurfer  6.0 is a set of software tools that 
utilize the T1 and T2 weighted scans to study the cortical and subcortical anatomy. In 
the cortical surface stream, the tools construct models of the boundary between white 
matter and cortical gray matt er as well as the pial surface. Once these surfaces are 
known, an array of anatomical measures becomes possible, including subcortical 
volumes, cortical thickness, surface area, curvature, and surface normal at each point 
on the cortex.  
2. Medial Temporal Lobe Segmentation (High resolution T2) : The Automatic 
Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) uses T1 - and high -resolution T2 -
weighted MRI to segment and label hippocampal subfields and medial temporal lobe 
cortices. The automatic labeling te chnique uses multi -atlas segmentation and 
similarity -weighted voting with a learning -based correction 110,111. An unbiased 
deformation -based morphometry pipeline will then estimate longitudinal changes in 
hippocampal subfields 112. Deformable image registration with a cross -correlation 
similarity metric generates a point -by-point correspondence map between images at 
two time points (baseline and follow -up). To avoid bias, registration is per formed in a 
“half -way” space, and equal amounts of deformation and interpolation are applied to 
the baseline and follow -up images. A mesh representation of the ASHS segmentation 
of the medial temporal lobe substructures in the baseline image is used to mea sure 
change in volume between baseline and follow -up. 
3. Electric Field Modeling : Our research team has extensive experience with t E -field 
modeling approaches. The Realistic vOlumetric Approach to Simulate Transcranial 
Electric Stimulation  (ROAST) and Simula tion of Non -Invasive Brain Stimulation 
(SimNIBS) were both used for our preliminary data 30,31. Here, we describe the 
SimNIBS methods, which informed our power analyses. SimNIBS creates subject 
specific, anatomically realistic volume conductor model. The T1 and T2 -weighted 
scans are segmented into skin, bone, eyes, cerebral spinal fluid, ventricles , and grey 
and white matter with a combination of FMRIB Software Library (FSL) 113 and 
 Page 14 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) Computational Anatomy Toolbox 114,115. 
SimNIBS then turns this segmentation into a tetrahedral head mesh using GMSH, a 
three -dimensional finite element (FE) mesh generator, with unique conductivity values 
for each tissue type. Electrodes are added to the head mesh in either RUL or BT 
orientatio n and simulated with corresponding current. SimNIBS then uses a FE solver 
to calculate the voltages and electric fields corresponding to the stimulation throughout 
the head mesh.  
 
FDA Investigational Device Exemption:  Investigational Device Exemption appr oval from 
the Food and Drug Administration for the Soterix Interface was received on July 10, 2020. 
Additionally, we have obtained a letter of support from Dr. Abhishek Datta, Scientist and 
Chief Technology Officer of Soterix Medical. We have a successful recruitment and 
retention history for ECT -imaging investigations of approximately 20 subjects per year 
with this demographic for the last decade and are well poised to meet the 
recruitment/enrollment goals delineated in this project proposal. Future invest igations will 
focus on the optimal strength of hippocampal volumetric increases to further clarify the 
“sweet spot” of antidepressant response in conjunction with cognitive safety.  
 
13. Data Analysis  
 
Preliminary Data : Amplitude titration has been completed wi th non -human primates but 
has yet to be completed with human subjects and modern ECT parameters. I/Ebrain bridges 
the gap from amplitude titration in non -human primates to changes in hippocampal 
neuroplasticity in human subjects.   I/Ebrain is the ratio of electrode current strength ( I) to 
the E -field strength in the brain ( Ebrain) 21. Ebrain will be computed as the 90th percentile of 
E-field magnitudes from all voxels in the brain, serving as an estimate o f the peak induced 
field strength while avoiding the influence of tissue boundary effects that could bias the 
absolute maximum E -field values. For example, one subject with 800  mA extracranial 
amplitude produces 0.8 V/cm 90th percentile E -field strength. T he ratio would be 
1000  mA/V/cm, which means 1000  mA produces 1  V/cm. A second subject with the same 
800 mA extracranial amplitude produces 1.2 V/cm 90th percentile E -field. The ratio would 
be 667  mA/V/cm, which means 667  mA produces 1  V/cm. Ebrain is a who le brain E -field 
metric as the location of seizure duration is unknown.  
 The relationship from amplitude titration to hippocampal neuroplasticity is 
illustrated here ( Figure 4 ). First, we demonstrate that amplitude -titrated seizure threshold 
increases with  I/Ebrain in non -human primates ( 4A). Second, we demonstrate that increased 
I/Ebrain is related to decreased hippocampal E -field (current dependent metric, input current 
set here at 1  mA) ( 4B1). For fixed amplitude ECT, I/Ebrain is inversely related to 
hippocampal volume change. Ehippo is the 95th percentile E -field in the hippocampus and  
will be an exploratory measure of this investigation. However, the focus on amplitude 
titrated seizure threshold requires Ebrain, a whole brain E -field metric, as the regions 
involved in seizure induction are unknown. Third, we demonstrate that increased 
hippocampal E -field is related to increased hippocampal neuroplasticity across all 
amplitudes (600, 700, and 800  mA) and electrode placements (RUL and BT) ( 4B2). This 
relationship is a replication of the GEMRIC data (Figure 2) with our U01 data. Fourth, we  
 Page 15 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  performed an analysis of a subset of our data comparing  I/Ebrain with hippocampal 
volumetric change with 800  mA subjects ( 4B3).

Figure 4: The multi -step relationship from amplitude titration to hippocampal neuroplasticity.  
A) Non -human primate data. Ielectrode /Ebrain  (see description in Preliminary Data).  Increased  
I/Ebrain is related to increased amplitude required for seizure titration (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001).  
B1) U01 data , all subjects . Ielectrode /Ebrain is inversely related to hippocampal E -field magnitude 
with an amplitude intensity of 1 mA, which is baseline for E -field modeling ( r =-0.79, Cohen’s 
f2 =1.66). 
B2) U01 data , all subjects. Electrode placement (RUL and BT) and amplitude (600, 700, 
800 mA) are based on the subject’s last treatment. Right hippocampal E -field magnitude is 
directly related to right hippocampal neuroplasticity for all amplitude strengths (600, 700,  and 
800 mA) and electrode placements (right unilateral and bitemporal) (r = 0.49, Cohen’s f2 = 
0.33). 
B3) U01 data , subjects from the 800  mA arm . Ielectrode /Ebrain is inversely related to right 
hippocampal neuroplasticity for 800  mA subjects  (r = -0.62, Cohen’s f2 = 0.62). 
C1) Hypothesized relationship . Increased  Ielectrode /Ebrain is related to increased amplitude 
required for seizure titration (verification of non -human primate data depicted in 4A). 
C2) Hypothesized relationship  (Go-No-go). The ratio of fixed amplitude ECT (800  mA) relative 
to amplitude seizure titration will be associated with right hippocampal neuroplasticity.

Summary, interpretation, and alternatives : To illustrate the application of these principles, 
we use our preliminary data ( 4B3) and hypothesized relationships ( 4C1 and 4C2). We also 
use the example of 2% hippocampal growth as optimal for antidepressant response 
(optimal hippocampal growth will be determined with a receiver operating curve (ROC) 
curve predicting  Inventory of Depre ssive Symptomatology (IDS -C30) total score decrease 
during the R61). With traditional 800  mA amplitude, the 2% volume increase is related to 
an I/Ebrain of ~ 625  mA/V/cm ( 4B3) and fixed/amplitude ratio of ~ 2.7 ( 4C2). Subject #1 
(orange star) has a low ( 250 mA) seizure threshold (ST) ( 4C1), I/Ebrain of ~ 600  mA/V/cm 
(4C2) and a fixed/amplitude ratio of 800/250 = 3.2 ( 4C2). Subject #1 will need an input 
current of 2.7 × 𝑆𝑇=2.7 ×250  𝑚𝐴 =675  𝑚𝐴 for 2% hippocampal volume increase. 
In contrast, Subject #2  (green star) has a high (350  mA) seizure threshold, I/Ebrain of ~ 
750 mA/V/cm and a fixed/amplitude ratio of 800/350 = 2.3. In order to achieve the 2% 
volumetric increase, Subject #2 will require an increased X/amplitude ratio from 2.3 to 2.7. 
Subject #2 will need an input current of 2.7 × 𝑆𝑇=2.7 ×350  𝑚𝐴 =950  𝑚𝐴 for 2% 
hippocampal volume increase. We stress that the fixed/amplitude ratio ~ 2.7 for 2% 
hippocampal volume increase is conceptual and will be determined during the R61.  
 
H1: Amplitude seizur e titration will have a positive correlation with I/Ebrain (Figure 4C1 ). 
This is a replication of the data from the non -human primate data. The relationship between 
I/Ebrain and amplitude titration is the foundation for the rationale of this proposal.  
Statistical approach for H1 : Let ( x, y)i be the observed vector of response for I/Ebrain and 
seizure threshold for each patient, I = 1, …, n.  The Pearson correlation will be ca lculated 
and the standard one -sided t -test with 2 degrees -of-freedom will be conducted for testing 
whether the correlation is positive, H 0: ρ > 0.  
Power calculation for H1 : The observed correlation in Figure 4A is r = 0.84 for non -human 
primates and we expect that the more conservative Cohen’s “large” effect size r = 0.5 is a 
realistic lower bound for our population, thus a sample size of n = 29 provides 80% power 
at a 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 significance level.  
 
Go/No -Go cr iterion (H2) : The ratio of amplitude titration to fixed amplitude ECT will 
demonstrate a linear relationship with treatment -responsive changes in hippocampal 
neuroplasticity. This relationship will determine the “neuroplasticity multiplier” to bridge 
from amplitude titration to hippocampal neuroplasticity.  
Statistical approach for H2 : We will perform a multiple regression accounting for 
covariates age and sex, %Vol Scaled Change = β 0 + β 1 M + β 2 age + β 3 sex, where the effect 
size is f2 = R2 / (1 − R2), with  R2 the coefficient of determination with the interpretation of 
"the proportion of variance explained" in the response by the model over the grand mean. 
We will test whether the regression model explains a significant proportion of variance in 
the response , expecting that the key relationship is between %Vol Scaled change and 
multiplier M.  
Power calculation for H2 : The relationship we are expecting in Figure 4C2 is derived from 
Figures 4B3 and 4C1. Starting with Figure 4B3, the relationship of I/Ebrain on %V olScaled 
change has a correlation of r = −0.62 with an effect size f2 = 0.624, well above the Cohen's 
"large" effect size of f2 = 0.35. Figure 4C1 is Figure A with the axes reversed, thus the 
 Page 18 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  correlation is r = 0.84. We will assume that the relationship between %Vol Scaled Change 
and multiplier M will remain consistent with Cohen's "large" effect size. Then a sample 
size of n = 36 provides 80% power at a 0.05 significance level.  
 
The Holm Procedure, a multi -step step -down procedure useful for endpoints with any 
degree of correlation, will adjust the two hypotheses below for multiple comparison 37. For 
our situation, this means H1 is tested at the 0.05 / 2 significance level and H2 is tested at 
0.05 / (2 −1) = 0.05; however, H2 is tested only if H1 is significant.  
 
The Go/No -Go criterion is set to “Go” if we can reject the null hypothesis that H 0: β1=0 at 
a 0.05 significance level in the model specified in Hypothesis H2, that is, that multiplier M 
remains a significant predictor of %Vol Scaled Change after adjusting for age and sex . 
 
14. Provisions to Monitor the D ata to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
 
Data safety and monitoring will be carried out to ensure and maintain the scientific integrity  
of this project and to protect the safety of our participants. S afety monitoring is the process 
during the study that involves review of accumulated outc ome data for groups of subjects 
to determine if any of the procedures practiced should be altered or stopped. Ultimately, 
the PI (Abbott) will be responsible for monit oring the sa fety of the study and complying 
with the reporting requirements. An independent D ata Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) will review the study data on a biennial basis wi th the PI to ensure participant 
safety (re: subject recruitment at 2 0 subje cts/year, DSMB meetings every ~ 10  
participants). The Data Safety and Monitoring Board wi ll include Dr. Sarah Pirio 
Richardson (DSMB Chair/Dept. of Neurology), Dr. Kathleen Reyes  (Dept. o f 
Anesthesiology), and Dr. Eric Clause (PI at Mind Research Network).  The board members 
have no conflicts of interest or roles with the current project. Drs. Pirio Richardson and 
Claus have experience participating in ECT -related DSMB, and Dr. Reyes has extensive 
clinical experience with ECT. Continuous, close monito ring of  participant safety will 
include prompt and frequent reporting of safety data (i.e., adverse/serious adverse events) 
to the DMSB, the University of New Mexico Health Scien ces Center Institutional Review 
Board (UNMHSC IRB) and/or appropriate NIH staff with oversight responsibility. The 
focus of adverse event reporting will be the first treatment of the ECT series, which is the 
only experimental treatment for this phase of the project. The first treatment will be 
amplitude titration (as opposed to the more tr aditional titration based on pulse number or 
frequency). The amplitude titration will result in reduced amplitudes (hypothesized range 
will be between 250 and 550mA, traditional ECT is conducted at 800mA). A dverse events 
may include expected side effects r elated to ECT: headaches, nausea (from anesthesia), 
and muscle aches (from anesthesia). Unexpected side effects (to be determined) will also 
be reviewed with the DSMB. In addition, relevant published data related to the study 
protocol will also be presente d to the DSMB. The DSMB will evaluate the adverse effects 
of the first treatment in relation to the expected side effects related to a traditional ECT 
series. The PI will provide a summary of the safe conduct of the study to  NIH and FDA on 
an annual basis as part of the progress report. All AEs occurring during the course of the 
study will be collected, documented, and reported to the UNMHSC IRB. The rev iew of 
data may result in early termination of the study, amendment to the protocol, or chan ges to 
 Page 19 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  the da ta collection plan or study forms if it appears that there are adverse ev ents directly 
related to the first (experimental) treatm ent. Significant adverse events directly related to 
the experimental treatment (amplitude titration, treatment#1) such as hospi talization and 
death will warrant suspension or termination of research. Should the pro tocol, data 
collection plans or study forms be amended as a result of data review, the IRB will be 
notified and the  amendment approved prior to study amendment i mplementation. In 
addition, the participants will be notified of any significant new findings  that develop 
during the course of research that may affect their wish to continue participati on in the 
study.  
 
15. Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
If at any time a participa nt decides to withdraw from the study, the participant will be 
debriefed by the study coordinator or principal investigator as to the reason for their 
withdrawal. The participant will then be thanked for their time and compensated for the 
extent of their p articipation. If the participant wishes to withdraw, they will be asked if they 
will allow data already collected on them to be used in the study analysis. If not, the data 
associated to their identifying code will be purged from the study database. A part icipant 
could be excluded and withdrawn from the research study in the event that a pre -determined 
condition exists, including a defined neurological or neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., 
traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease), other psychia tric conditions (e.g., 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), current drug or alcohol use disorder (except for nicotine), 
and/or contraindications to MRI.  
 
16. Data Management /Confidentiality  
 
Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of participants ’ records. However,  
complete confidentiality of records cannot be guaranteed as records may be examined by 
authorized personnel from the UNM Human Research and Review Committee.  
Participants will be informed of this possibility prior to signing the consent  forms.  
Otherwise, records will be kept strictly confidential and wil l not be inspected by any other 
agency unless required by law. Behavioral and computerized data from the MRI scanning 
sessions will not contain participants’ names or any other identifyin g information per 
HIPAA requirements. Data will be de -identified as appropriate to the UNM Human 
Research and Review Committee and HIPPA require ments by assigning a randomized 
eight -digit number to each participant upon entry into the study. This number wi ll be used 
for all correspondence between study investigators and a ll data collection and analysis after 
the initial screening visit. MRN has a state -of-the ar t IT network with all necessary security 
mechanisms in place. Any personal inform ation entered in to computers is password 
protected and monitored for suspicious activity. I n order to contact subjects for telephone 
visits and/or other matters, it will be necessar y to retain names and telephone numbers of 
active subjects. However, these direct identifi ers will not be stored with any clinical data 
or subject information in order to protect confidentiality. Any direct identif iers will be 
stored in locked cabinets, on a secure MRN serve r, and/or the COINS database on a secure 
HIPAA compliant cloud based ser ver, separate fro m any clinical data. These will only be 
accessible by key study personnel. A link between study code numbers and direct  
 Page 20 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  identifiers will be retained in order to contact subjects for v isit appointments or at a later 
date to inform them of n ewly received information. This link wi ll be retained for the 
duration of the study. Subjects will be identified only by unique Pa tient ID numbers in 
Case Report Forms (CRFs) and electronic CRFs. The CRFs will be  maintained in a locked 
cabinet housed in th e Center for Psychiatric Research. These do cuments will only be 
accessible by authorized study staff and will comply with HIPPA require ments for the 
storage of health information. Moreover, all information will be i n double -locked rooms 
per HIPAA specifications. At the time of study closure, all participant identifiers (name, 
address, etc.) will be made inaccessible to the research team. MRN retai ns the link between 
identifiers and URSI indefinitely for the potential  future benef it to the research participant. 
Specifically, it may become medically advantageous in the future for a former participant 
to have access to the clinical information that may be pr esent in radiological scans and 
reviews. The results of this res earch may be presented at meetings or in publications; 
however, participants’ identity will not be disclosed. The part icipant will be provided with 
a copy of the consent form to take home.  
 
17. Data and Specimen Banking  
 
Data will be stored in locked cabinets at the UNM Center for Psychiatric Research.  
Subjects' charts will be stored without direct identifiers. Only research staff designated by  
Dr. Abbott will have access to these records. Other than the research team, the study  
sponsor and the HRRC will be per mitted access to t he records. In order to contact subjects 
for telephone visits and/or other matters, it will be necessary to retain names and  telephone 
numbers of active subjects. However, these direct identifiers will not be stored  with any 
clinical data  or subject information in order to protect confidentiality. Any direct  identifiers 
will be stored in locked cabinets and on a secu re MRN server, and/or the COINS database 
on a secure HIPAA compliant cloud based ser ver, separate from any clinical data. The se 
will only be accessible by key study perso nnel. A link between study code numbers and 
direct identifiers will be retained in order to contact subjects for visit  appointments or at a 
later date to inform them of newly received information. Information  collected will be 
labeled with a study number and will be entered in to a secure MRN  server, and/or the 
COINS database on a secure HIPAA compliant cloud -based server.  Data linking scan to 
identity will be maintained at the Min d Research Network  indefinitely allowing the 
neuroradiologist to compare future scans wi th previous ones.  Research data (not including 
scan data) will be de -identified after th e study is complete  and closure documents are 
submitted to the UNM IRB.  
 
Electronic Data: Collaborative Neuroinf ormatics Suite (COINS). This cloud -based  
neuroimaging and neuropsychology software suite offers versatile, automatable data  
upload/import/entry options, rapid and secure sharing of data among PIs, querying and  
export all data, real -time reporting, and HIPAA and IRB compliant study -management  
tools suitable to large institutions as well as smaller scale neuroscience and  
neuropsychology researchers. Network is accessed on a secure MRN server, and/or a  
HIPAA compliant cloud -based server whic h has firewalls in place. Controlled access is  
granted to only study team members.  
 
 Page 21 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  As per NIMH mandate, the de -identified data will be submitt ed to the National Institute of 
Mental Health Data Archive (NDA). NDA is a data repositor y run by the National In stitute 
of Mental Health (NIMH) that allows researchers studyin g mental illness to collect and 
share de -identified information with each other. Duri ng and after the study, the UNM 
research team will send de -identified information to ND A. Other researchers nationwide 
can then file an application with the NIMH to obtain access to de -identified study data for 
research purposes. Experts at the NIMH who know ho w to protect health and science 
information will look at every request carefully to minimize risks to y our privacy. In 
addit ion, de-identified information will be available at the Min d Research Network Data 
Sharing Repository for future research. Both the NDA  and Mind Research Network Data 
Repositories are clearly described in the “Data Sharing” section of the consent form.  
 
18. Risks to Subjects  
 
Participation in this study may involve minor risks and/or discomforts associated with  
possible breach of confidentiality risk, neuropsychological testing, MRI, and lower  
amplitude ECT.  
 
Due to the coronavirus public health crisis, participants will receive regular COVID -19 
testing as part of their standard ECT treatment procedure.  Participation in this study may 
entail increase risk of exposure to COVID -19 during interactions with research staff. 
However, research staff adhere to all safety operating procedures  required by UNM HSC, 
NMDOH and the CDC .   
 
MRI:  Radio and magnetic waves associated with MRI scans are not associated with any  
known adverse effects. MRI is non -invasive, non -contrast, and considered minimal risk  by 
the FDA and OHRP. However, the scanner is a large magnet, so it could move  objects 
containing ferrous metal in the room during the scan. All participants are  screened using 
the MRI safety screening form prior to be being scanned. Participants  with any MRI 
scanning contraindications will be excluded from study participation.  Participants may be 
bothered by feelings of claustrophobia (uncommon). The MRI also  makes loud ‘drum’ 
beating noises during the study. Headphones are provided for  protection. Rarely, large or 
recent tattoos can heat up during an MRI scan and cause  skin irritation like a su nburn 
(uncommon). No long -term harmful effects from MRI are  known. However, since the 
effect of MRI on early development of the fetus is  unknown, participants who are pregnant 
will not be allowed to go in the MRI. Femal es 18 years of age or older who suspe ct they 
may be pregnant will be asked to take a urine pregnancy t est before being allowed to 
participate in the study. The test results will only be shared with participant. The MRI risks 
include identification of incidental findings and potential cost for  follow -up or clinical 
scans.  
 
Neuropsychological tests and clinical assessments:  The neuropsychological tasks  involved 
in the protocol entail no foreseeable risk, besides perhaps fatigue or mild to  moderate 
demands on attention and cognition.  
 
 
 Page 22 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  19. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
 
The potential benefits of the proposed research for the research participants are minimal. 
Any abnormal findings on structural MRI scans will be reported to the participant and/or 
their doctor per the participant’s request. This may l ead to early detection of previously 
unknown abnormalities. However, for the large majority of participants, the proposed 
research will not have any benefit.  
 
20. Recruitment Methods  
 
The UNM ECT Treatment Program receives referrals from inpatient and outpatient  
providers at the UNM Mental Health Center. The treatment  team will clinically determine 
who will be eligible for the study and document this in t he subject’s study records. The 
research team will only approach patients for the study  protocol who  speak English and 
have been identified by the primary treatment team. Patients  diagnosed with Major 
Depression are eligible for ECT treatment will be recru ited from the UNM ECT Treatment 
Program.  
 
21. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
 
The Center for Psychiatry Research handles all confidential data carefully and works to  
maintain subject privacy and confidentiality. From the standpoint of privacy and  
confidentiality, the subject's welfare will be safeguarded by responsible, systematical ly 
controlled procedures in the collection of information for both clinical and research  
purposes. In terms of privacy, subjects will first arrive at the research clinic, housed in  
UNM HSC Center for Psychiatric Research in the Neurob iology Building, 1101 Yale Blvd 
NE, 2nd floor. Interaction with subjects will be in the Psyc hiatry Research Clinic and will 
only be with relevant staff and/or with family members that they choose to be present. 
Interviews are held in closed door offices and wil l be conducted in  a manner most 
comfortable to subjects. Subjects may refuse to answer any question at any time.  Recorded 
information for research purposes will be identified only by subject initials and  a study 
code number. Subject data will be kept in locked cabinets in the research clinic  with limited 
access granted only to designated research personnel. These processes will  be in place 
throughout the entire research process, from initial consenting to research,  through research 
procedures, and follow -up. The study PI wi ll maintain confidentiality of  all records to the 
extent permitted by applicable laws. Records may be inspected by  representatives of the 
study sponsor, the HRRC and other regulatory agencies. If results  are presented or 
published, subjects’ identities wil l remain confidential.  
 
22. Economic Burden to Subjects  
 
The costs of the MRIs and office visits required by the research will be covered by the  
study. Subjects will be not placed under economic burden due to this trial.  
 
23. Compensation  
 
 Page 23 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  This study will require attending three visits that will last approximately 2.5 hours for each. 
Subjects will be compensated $50.00 for completion of each visit (total subject  
compensation will be $150 for the three assessment time -points). Subjects will receive  
compensat ion ($50 merchandise card) at each visit. Social security numbers will not  be 
required for subject payment. The cost of gas/transportation and the inconvenience of  
participating in this study, make these compensation rates fair and reasonable.   Subjects 
will be reimbursed an additional $50 merchandise  card for participating in the optional 
EEG  to offset additional  set-up time.  
 
24. Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
 
UNMHSC will provide subjects with emergency treatment, at their own cost. No  
commitment i s made by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center 
(UNMHSC) to provide free medical care or money for injuries to participants in this study. 
In the event that you have an injury or illness that is caused by a subject’s participation in 
this stu dy, reimbursement for all related costs of care will be sought from their insurer, 
managed care plan, or other benefits program. If the subject does not have insurance, they 
may be responsible for the costs. Subjects will also be responsible for any associ ated 
copayments or deductibles required by their insurance.  
 
25. Consent Process  
 
Discussion of the proposed study will occur separate from the evaluation for the ECT  
procedure. Potential subjects will have ample time to ask questions regarding the nature  of 
this study and will be clearly informed that this imaging investigation is optional.  Informed 
consent will be discussed with each participant with plenty of opportunities to  ask 
questions. The study PI (Abbott) or Co -PI (Quinn), boa rd-certified p sychiatrists with 
additional fellowship training and certification, will assess decisional capacity for each  
subject during the consent process. The PI’s have extensive experience with the  assessment 
of decisional capacity in both research and clinical dom ains. All subjects must have 
decisional capacity to consent to this protocol. Prior to discussion of research participation, 
the UNM ECT service (Board certified psychiatrists) will assess decisional capacity for  the 
procedure. This assessment will include  decisional capacity (ability to communicate 
choice, appreciate risks/benefits, reason, and manipulate information) and voluntarism

26. Documentation of Consent  
 
Notes will be kept documenting  the informed consent process. Narrative forms will be 
securely filed  with other subject information to document each visit and contact, in addition 
to required s tudy measures and procedures. Subjects will be given a copy of their s igned 
consent form and HIPAA. A member of the research team will review the HIPA A 
authorization during the consent.  
 
27. Study Test Results/Incidental Findings  
 
 Page 24 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  Subjects who receive abnormal MRI scan findings by the neuroradiologist  will be  notified 
of an official report by e -mail letting the participant kno w new results are available and the 
study PI will communicate the results to the patient. T he participant can securely log in to 
the Mind Research Network COINS homepage to access  their MRI radiology report. No 
sensitive or identifying information is sent via  e-mail. If an abnormality that requires 
follow -up is identified, such as a Doctor Refer ral recommendation, a hard copy of the 
report will be mailed to the participant in addition to th e e-mail notification. With the 
patient’s permis sion, the study PI will communicate the r esults to the patient’s primary care 
providers.  
 
28.  Progress or Results with Subjects  
 
The MRI scan is being done to answer research questions, not to examine the subject’s  
brain for medical reasons. This MRI sc an is not a substitute for a clinical scan (the type a  
doctor would order). The research scan may not show problems that may be picked up by 
a clinical MRI scan. However, all research MRI scans will be read by a neuroradiologist (a 
doctor with experience r eading MRI scans) unless they have been scanned at MRN in the 
previous six months. If the scan is read, the subject will receive the official report by email. 
If we find an abnormality that requires urgent follow -up, we will contact the subject by 
phone to  help answer questions and get the right follow -up care. The MRN Medical 
Director or the research team is always available to answer any questions you may have 
about the subject’s scan.  
 
29. Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations  
 
Sample inclusion will not includ e gender restrictions. It is expected that our sample will  
reflect the gender distribution of our ECT service over the last 5 years. Recruitment will  
reflect the demographics of the state of New Mexico. Prisoners will be excluded from the  
study. The age ra nge of 50 to 80 years was selected because to limit the variability of age -
related volume changes. Subjects with pre -existing diagnoses of neurodegenerative  
diseases or cerebrovascular pathology will be excluded. However, some older subjects  may 
have signi ficant cognitive deficits prior to treatment related to their depressive episode 
(“pseudo -dementia”). These subjects may not have decisional capacity for this  
investigation but are representative of a community sample receiving ECT in this age  
range. Dr. A bbott (PI) and Quinn (Co -PI) will assess decisional capacity of all subjects  
participating in this investigation. Subjects that do not have decisional capacity for this  
investigation will be able to participate in this research if they can assent to the pr ocedure 
and a legally authorized representative (court appointed mental health treatment guardian) 
consents to the research protocol.

31. Research Involving American Indian/Native Populations  
 
 Page 25 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  The proposed research inclusion criteria will be open to all patients with major depressive  
disorder meeting the inclusion criteria  including the clinical indication for ECT . The UNM 
ECT service is part of a tertiary referral  service and the demographics of this servic e reflec t 
the state of New Mexico. This investigation will not have targeted recruitment outside of 
routine clinical referrals to the UNM ECT service.  
 
32. Transnational Research  
 
N/A 
 
33. Drugs or Devices  (see section 9. Resources Available)  
 
The research involves an investigational device. T he Mecta Spectrum 5000Q paired with 
Soterix Medical 4X1 HD -ECT Multi -Channel Stimulation Interface is intended to reduce 
ECT current amplitude for amplitude -seizure titration  and has received approval from the 
Food and Drug Administration (refer to “supporting documents”). Digitimer DS8R 
Biphasic Constant Current Stimulator  will be used for motor titration  during the 
second treatment.  
 
These device s will be solely handled and operated  by credentialed UNM ECT providers  at 
the UNMH Post Anesthesia Care Unit (inpatient) or UNM Outpatient Surgical Imaging 
Services (outpatient).  
 
Additionally, the research proposal will use DC-EEG device . The SMARTING 
(https://mbraintrain.com/smarting/) is a sm all, mobile EEG device that incorporates motion 
sensors that detect head and body movements. This EEG system will include a 24 -channel 
recording cap. EEG data will be wirelessly recorded to mobile app and is capable of 
measuring low frequency EEG (< 0.01) pertinent  for this proposal.  
 
34. Principal Investigator’s Assurance  
By submitting this study in the Click IRB system, the principal investigator of this study 
confirms that:  
☒ The information supplied in this form and attachments are complete and correct.   
☒ The PI has read the Investigator’s Manual and will conduct this research in accordance 
with these requirements.   
 ☒ Data will be collected, maintained and archived or destroyed per HSC Data Security 
Best Practices, including:  
1. Best Practice for data collection  is for it to be directly entered onto a data collection 
form that is in a secured access folder on an HS drive behind a firewall, or in a secure 
UNM Data Security approved system such as RedCap.  
2. Data collection of  de-identified data , if don e in a clinical setting or other setting that 
does not allow direct entry into a secured system, may be done temporarily using a 
personal or university owned electronic storage device or hard copy document.  The 
 Page 26 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  important security safeguard is that no ident ifiers be include if the data is entered 
or stored using an untrusted device or storage.  
3. Permanent (during data analysis, after study closure ) storage must reside on HSC 
central IT managed storage. Processing of data (aggregation, etc.) are to be carried 
out in such a way as to avoid creating/retaining files on untrusted storage 
devices/computers. Trusted devices are HSC managed and provide one or more of 
following safeguards: access logs, encryption keys, backups, business continuity and 
disaster recovery capabilities.  
4. Alternate storage media  must be approve d by HSC IT Security as meeting or 
exceeding HSC central IT provided security safeguards.

44. Vulnerable Populations (Checklist)  
 
A. Adults with Cognitive Impairments  
1. Describe why the objectives of the study cannot be met without inclusion of 
adults with cognitive impairments.  
 Page 28 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  Older subjects with major depressive disorder often present with significant 
cognitive impairment. In the context of ECT response,  these patients often have 
resolution of depression -related cognitive  impairment.  
 
2. Describe how capacity to consent will be evaluated.  
Prior to discussion of research participation, the UNM ECT service (Board -
certified psychiatrists) will assess decisional capacity for the procedure. This 
assessment will include decisional capacity (ability to commun icate choice, 
appreciate risks/benefits, reason, and manipulate information) and voluntarism 
capacity. If the patient does not have decisional capacity, the subject will not 
be able to participate in this research.  
 
3. If subjects may regain capacity to cons ent, or if subjects may have fluctuating 
capacity to consent, describe your plans to evaluate capacity to consent 
throughout the research and to obtain consent to continue participation if 
capacity is regained.  
In the context of fluctuating consent capacit y, the PI and Co -PI will reassess 
decisional capacity at each study visit. If the subject maintains the minimal 
threshold to continue with the proposed study, the study team will also include 
input from surrogate decision maker (power of attorney and/or tr eatment 
guardian) to provide additional safeguards. If the subject no longer maintains 
decisional capacity at a study visit, the subject will be withdrawn from the 
protocol.  
 
4. Describe your plans, if any, to provide information about the research to 
subjec ts and the steps you will take to assess understanding.  
The study PI (Abbott) and Co -PI (Quinn) are board -certified psychiatrists with  
fellowship training in geriatric psychiatric and psychosomatic medicine and 
will be involved with the consent process for al l study participants. They will 
assess  decisional capacity at all three study time points.  
 
5. Describe your plans to obtain assent, including whether assent will be  
obtained from none, some, or all subjects.  
All subjects must have decisional ca pacity to consent to this protocol.  
 
6. Describe why risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits 
to the subjects.  
The risks of low -amplitude seizure and motor titration will be minimal relative 
to the traditional (higher) ECT amplitud es. The experimental portion of this 
protocol is relevant only to the first treatment with the remaining treatments 
completed at the traditional 800  mA amplitudes. Subjects will also receive more 
comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessments by  participating 
in this research protocol relative to routine clinical care.  
 Page 29 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  7. If this study involves a health or behavioral intervention, describe why the 
relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk of the research is at least as 
favorable to the subjec ts as that presented by alternative procedures.  
This investigation proposes use amplitude titration relative to the traditional 
pulse -number based titration and fixed amplitude ECT. This difference is only 
relevant to the first treatment. The remaining tre atments will be completed with 
traditional 800  mA ECT.  
 
8. Describe your plans for monitoring the well -being of subjects including any 
plans to withdraw subjects from the research if they appear to be unduly 
distressed.  
Subjects that appear to be distressed will be encouraged to  withdraw from the 
study protocol. If subjects appear to be unduly distressed,  the study PI will 
withdraw these subjects from the protocol. Data regarding  subject drop -out 
will be documented and presented to the DSMB .

Transfer is detailed on the Sponsored Projects website:  De-identified data will be 
uploaded to NIMH Data Arc hive through the COINS (https://coins.trendscenter.org) 
system.  
 
H. For data being transferred/shared with outside locations or entities, describe the  following:  
• Where is data storage and how will it be maintained in a secure manner (i.e. encryption, 
password protection, use of Qualtrics or REDCap, etc)? https://coins.trendscenter.org. 
Data is encrypted and password protected.  
• What is method in which data will be collected and stored (i.e. electronic, hard copy, 
etc)? Data will be initially recorded in paper charts and then electronically uploaded to 
COINS site.  The data will be then be uploaded at 6 -month intervals from COINS to 
the NIMH Data Archive.   
• How long will the data be stored? Paper charts will be kept for the duration of the 
study. COINS and NIMH Data Archive (de -identified data) will be kept indefinitely.  
• Who will have access to data?  Study team will have access to the COINS data; Other 
invest igators must access NIMH Data Archive through established protocols 
(https://nda.nih.gov/get/access -data.html).  
 
I.  Please list all specific data elements, variables, etc. to be sent out and/or received.  Indicate 
if the data contain identifiers and health in formation. Please note that identifiers that MUST 
be removed to make health information de -identified are as follows: Names, All geographic 
subdivision smaller than a State, All elements of year (except year), Telephone, Fax 
numbers, E -mail addresses, Soci al Security, Medical record number, Health plan 
beneficiary, Account numbers, Certificate/license numbers, Vehicle identifiers and serial 
numbers, Device identifiers and serial numbers, Web URLs, IP address numbers, 
Biometric identifiers, full face photogr aphic images, and Any other unique identifying 
number, characteristic or code.)  All identifying elements outlined above will not be 
included in COINS or uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive.  All subjects participating in 
this protocol have provided permissi on for the transfer of their de -identified data to the 
NIMH Data Archive.  
 
J. If the research requires the access, use, or disclosure of any of the 18 individually 
identifiable protected health information (PHI) identifiers that can be used to identify, 
 Page 32 of 32 Version Date : 11/19/2020  conta ct, or locate a person (e.g., name, medical record number, etc.), are the subjects going 
to consent to or authorize the disclosure of their individually identifiable health 
information? Not applicable.   
a. Or is HIPAA authorization altered or waived? Not applicable  
 
K. What is the classification of the data : de-identified, limited data set, protected health  
information, or other  type?  De-identified.  
 
L. Does the request to transfer/share data include clinical data that belongs to the UNM Health 
Systems?  The included information will be generated for research purposes only (including 
imaging data acquired at Mind Research) and does not belong to UNM.  
 
M. Does the data to be tran sferred/shared include information about patients seen at external 
health system or at a third party medical provider? Not applicable.  
  
N. Is the external entity a “covered entity”? Not applicable.  
 
O. Is the data that is going to be transferred/shared owned or partially owned by another party 
or have any type of restrictions including regulatory restrictions (i.e. HIPAA, FERPA, 
etc.)? De -identified data transferred to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) will be coded using 
a unique code known  as a Global Unique Identifier (GUID). Use of the GUID minimizes 
risks to study participants because it keeps one individual’s information separate from that 
of another person without using names, addresses, or other identifying information. The 
unique cod e also allows the NDA to link together all submitted information on a single 
participant, giving researchers access to information that may have been collected 
elsewhere. The GUID is a computer -generated alphanumeric code [example: NDA -
1A462BS] that is uni que to each research participant (i.e., each person’s information in the 
NDA —or each subject’s record —has a different GUID). The process of assigning a GUID 
prevents direct identifiers from ever being transmitted or stored in the NDA. We will ensure 
that n o direct identifiers are transmitted in this process.  
 
P. Is the data publicly  available? If yes, please provide details:  As per the NIMH Data Archive 
site, “ Summary information on the data shared in NDA  is available in the NDA Query Tool 
without the need for  an NDA  user account.  To request access to record -level human 
subject data, you must submit a Data Access Request . 
 
Q. Does the data include information about substance abuse treatment, sexually transmitted 
diseases, genetic testing results, HIV/AIDS testing results, and/or mental health?  Mental 
health data will be included with this data.

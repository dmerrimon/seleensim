Name of Investigational Product: AVE-901 (Tramadol)  
Name of Active Ingredient: Tramadol for intravenous infusion  
Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Multi center, Single-Arm, Open-Label Study to Evalu ate the Safety of 
Tramadol Infusion (AVE-901) in the Management of Postoperative Pain Following Sur gery 
Study center:  Up to approximately 10 centers in the United States  
Studied period:  
Estimated date first patient enrolls: Q4 2017 
Estimat ed date last patient enrolls: Q2 2019 
Estimated date primary analysis: Q2 2019 Phase of development:  3 
 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this st udy is to evaluate the safety o f intravenous (IV) tramadol (AVE -901) 
50 mg for the management of postoperative pain.  Safety endpoints wil l include: 
x Adverse events (classified by the MedDRA System Organ Class (SO C) and preferred 
term).   
x Clinical laboratory, vital sign, and ECG changes 
x Local tolerability of the infusion site via pain, swelling, ten derness, and erythema.   
Throughout the protocol, AVE -901 will be used to indicate the treatment. 
Study Design:  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, re peat- dose trial to assess the safety of 
AVE -901 in the management of postoperative pain. Eligible patients  will be patients that are 
undergoing elective surgery and are  willing to be confined in a healthcare facility and receive AVE-
901 for the treatment of p ost-surgical pain for at least 24 hours.  Approximately 250 patients will be 
enrolled into the study. Each patient will undergo the Screening Visit (Day -28 t o Day -1), the Pre -
operative assessment (within 24 hours prior to surgery), the Su rgery (Day 0), the Primary treatment 
period (hour 0 through hour 168), End of Treatment visit, and t he Follow -up Visit (Day 14).  
Screening will occur up to 2 8 days prior to surgery.  Following the pre- operative assessments, after 
the patient has met eligibility criteria, patients will be enrolled into the study. 
Surgery will occur on Day 0.  There are no restrictions on the agents to be used for induction, 
neuromuscular blockade, maintenance of anesthesia, or on hypnot ics, sedatives,  analgesics (including 
narcotics)  or anxiolytics. 
Following surgery, each patient  will receive their study medication infusion at T0, T2, T4, and  then 
every 4 hours for up to 168 hours after the first study drug ad ministration (a total of up to 43 doses 
per patient).  The dosing time should always tie back to T0 for all doses.  Th e late st (last) dose that is 
allowed is at Hour 164 .  Patients will be confined at an appropriate healthcare or re search facility for 
as long as they are still using AVE-901. Following the first do se of study drug, the patients will be DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

Study Periods and Methodology  
There are 5 periods in this study:   
x Screening  
x Preoperative  
x Surgery  
x Treatment Period/Post Surgery  
x Follow-up.  
Procedures for each s tudy period are described below.  
Screening:  
Screening will occur from Day -28 through Day - 1 and will be conducted as a clinic visit. Patients 
will have the purpose and procedures of the study explained to them and, those who elect to 
participate in the study, will provide written informed consent  and be screened for participation 
according to the eligibility criteria. Screening will include e ligibility assessment, medical history, 
physical examination, demographics, height and weight, BMI, vital signs (heart rate, systolic blood 
pressure, and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, tempe rature, pulse oximetry), ASA Physical 
Status, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology panel, chemistry panel, urinalysis, serum 
pregnancy test (in females of childbearing potential), and prio r/current treatments.  All screening 
laboratory eva luations must be within acceptab le limits as determined by the investigator prior to 
enrollment.   For patients that screen within 5 days of surgery, central laboratory values may not be 
available to assess eligibility.  For these patients it is acce ptable for sites to draw local labs to assess 
eligibility  in addition to the central lab which will still be used as the  baseline in the study.  The local 
laboratory listed on the FDA 1572 Form must be used for all local blood draws. At a minimum the 
following analytes must be reviewed from the local laboratory prior to dosing; magnesium, calcium, 
potassium , sodium, serum creatinine, ALT, AST and hemoglobin.  
Preoperative:  
Preoperative assessments to confirm the patient’s eligibility w ill be performed within 24 hours of 
scheduled surgery start time.  This visit will include reassess ment of eligibility criteria, interim 
medical history, vital signs, physical exam, ASA Physica l Status, urine pregnancy test (in females of 
childbearing potential), and concomitant treatments.     
Note : If the patient ’s scheduled surgery has time considerations, patients may have Screening and 
Preoperative Visits combined into one visit if required (at the time of pre-op).  The procedures 
associated with the Screening Visit will be acceptable for both  visits. Both central and local labs 
should be drawn for eligibility.  DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

Surgery:  
Surgery will occur on Day 0.   Sites will follow their standard operating procedures.  
Treatment Period /Post Surgery:  
Patient s will receive their first dose of study medication (T0) within  8 hours of meeting the 
postsurgical eligibility criteria . Patients will be dosed at Hour T0, T2, T4, and then every 4 hours 
thereafter, for  a total of up to 43 doses administered over the 168- hour treatment period (with the last 
possible dose at Hour 164).   Treatment is anticipated to occur from Hours 0 to 48, and may extend 
through to Hour 168.  .  
Safety will be assessed by recording vital signs including: ECG’s , respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse 
oximetry (SpO 2), temperature, and blood pressure as per the schedule of event s. 
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA  – Appendix 1) of efficacy will be obtained at Hour 24 and End of 
Treatment.  If the patient continues treatment beyond Hour 24, PGA will be conducted at Hour 24 and 
End of Treatment  (total of 2 PGAs). If the patient ends treatment prior to Hour 24, PGA will be 
conducted as part of the End of Treatment visit  (total of 1 PGA).  
At the End of Treatment assessment, patients will undergo a brief p hysical examinatio n, vital signs 
measurements , ECG, PGA and clinical laboratory evaluations for safety. AEs and concomitant 
medication use will be recorded.  
Follow up:  
A final safety assessment will be conducted on Day 14 (± 2 days) from the first dose via a telephone 
call to check on general well-being, including spontaneous reports of adverse events and concomitant 
medications . 
Concomitant Medication:  
Medications deemed necessary for the patient’s welfare are permitted .  The following drugs are 
EXCLUDED from use:  
x Moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D, inducers of C YP3A4 , drugs which 
may increase serotonergic tone including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, 
trazodone, cyclobenzaprine triptans, 5-HT3 antagonists including ondansetron, and amphetamines; and drugs which may lower seizure threshold.
 
x Any opioid based analgesic (post dosing).   
Postoperative adverse events (AEs) such as nausea, vomiting and  pruritus should be managed using 
standard of care, excluding medications specifically noted in t he study protocol.  
Number of patients (planned):  
A total of approxima tely 250 patients in United States (US) who meet all of the inclusion and none of 
the exclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled.  Every patie nt treated will receive  AVE-901.

Statistical methods:  
Sample Size  
A sample size of approximately 250 patients will be enrolled.  This sample size of 250 patients will 
provide approximately 90% power to detect at least one incidence of uncommon adverse events 
(those events with a true underlying incidence of 1%).  
General Statistical Methods  
This is an open -label study in which the objective is to assess the safety of Tramadol for post- surgical 
pain in patients having elective surgery.  The statistical meth ods utilized will be consistent with this 
objective.   
Outcomes will be tabulated utilizing descriptive methods only (e.g., mean, standard deviat ion, 
median, min, max for continuous variables, and number and perce nt for categorical varia bles). 
The baseline for all variables w ill be the last measurement obt ained prior to the patient receiving the 
first dose of study drug.  
Patient disposition (including the number and percent of patien ts who are enrolled, who receive 
treatment, who prematurely discontinue and reasons for disconti nuation, and who complete the study) 
will be tabulated.  The number (%) of patients by exposure (num ber of doses given, total dose given, 
time from first dose to last dose) will be tabulated.   
Study Populations  
The Safety Population is defined as all patients who receive at least one dose of study medication.  
This will be the primary population for which conclusions will be drawn. 
Alpha Levels  
No inferential testing is planned for this safety -based study.  If inferential statistics are used, they will 
only be applied to allow for better understanding of any treatment effects , but will not be used for 
hypothesis testing.

Subgroups  
Incidences of treatment-emergent AEs, serious AEs, and discontinuations for A Es, will be provided 
by the following subgroups:  
x Surgery type 
x Gender 
x Race 
x Age (using the median age of the treated population) 
Safety  
All AEs will be classified with respect to the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred 
term.  The number and percent of patients who report treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
will be sum marized . Additional summaries by severity , relationship, and subgroup will be presented.  
Serious AEs (SAEs) wi ll be summarized similarly.   
For purposes of analysis, TEAEs will be defined as any AE with a start time ‘on or af ter the start of 
the first IV infusion’.  Thus, the start day AND start time of AEs will be collected.  Adverse events 
occurring prior to the  start of the first treatment infusion will be classified as Medical History for the 
purposes of the analysis.  Events occurring > 168 hours (7 days ) after the END of the last infusion 
will be classified as Post -Treatment AEs. 
As the infusions are given intermittently according to the dosi ng instructions, an assessment of onset 
of TEAEs within 1 hour after the start of any infusion will be tabulated separately .  The incidence of 
TEAEs will also be tabulated by infusion number (e.g., Infusion 1, Infusio n 2, etc.) to explore the 
safety profile over multiple doses.  Summaries of the time to onset of TEAEs will also be included. 
Exploratory analyses of use of anti -emetics may be performed.   
Clinical laboratory , and vital sign data will be summarized descriptively by time point.  Local 
tolerability of the infusion site will be assessed via AE’s . 
Other safety data presentations will be descriptive in nature, with no formal inferential testing 
planned.

   4. INTRODUCTION 
Effective postoperative pain cont rol is a critical need as most  patients undergoing surgical 
procedures experience pain immediately following the procedure,  and require treatment for 
several days.  For instance, patients undergoing total knee art hroplasty (TKA) or bunionectomy 
typically demonstrate a need for short-term analgesia, which is  critical for earlier mobilization 
and rehabilitation. In this setting, reducing pain intensity wi thout providing extensive medical 
oversight required for some met hods of treatment (such as neuraxial anesthesia) and prevention 
of effects such as opiate-indu ced respiratory depression and dependency would be highly 
beneficial ( Sinatra 2002 ). 
Several options are available f or postoperative pain management  (Singelyn 1998; Sinatra 2002).  
Options include intermittent “on- demand” analgesi a, including oral and via patient controlled 
analgesia (PCA) or by nurse-administered bolus injections of sy stemic opioids such as morphine. 
Second, continuous epidural analgesia with opioids and/or local  anesthetics is effective, although 
this requires continued presence of the epidural catheter and o versight by an anesthesiologist. A 
third alternative is to provide  a combination of nerve blocks w ith long-acting local anesthetics 
and/or opioids initiated intra- operatively and continued into the immediate postoperative period. 
4.1. Tramadol Infusion 
Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic with a dual mechanism of action, comprised of 
μ-opioid activity and monoamine (serotonin and noradrenalin) reuptake inhibition. Tramadol is 
an analog of the phenanthrene g roup of opium alkaloids, which i ncludes morphine and codeine, 
and is structurally related to these opioids ( Grond 2004 ). Like codeine, there is a substitution of 
the methyl group on the phenol ring that imparts a relatively weak affinity for opioid receptors. 
Tramadol was originally devel oped by the German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH 
in the late 1970s and is marketed g lobally under the trade name s TRAMAL® and others outside 
of the United States (US). The  approved doses of tramadol are 5 0 mg or 100 mg administered as 
a slow injection every 4-6 hours ( Tramadol Core Product Label, 2008 ). 
In the US, tramadol is approved by the Food and Drug Administra tion (FDA) and marketed as an 
oral tablet (the only available formulation) for moderate to mo derately severe pain in adults. 
Tramadol was first approve d in the US in April 1995 under the t rade name ULTRAM® (Ortho-
McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, I nc). Tramadol is also an activ e agent in an extended release 
(ER) product, Ultram® ER, and as a combination product with ace taminophen, ULTRACET®. 
In the US, tramadol is only available as immediate release tabl ets or extended release tablets. 
Tramadol injection (IV/IM/SC) i s approved and used for the mana gement of moderate to severe 
acute postoperative pain in several regions, including Europe, India and Australia/New Zealand; 
however, this dosage form is not a vailable in the US. Tramadol ampoules or vials for parenteral 
(intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM] and subcutaneous [SC]) ad ministration and preservative-
free solutions for injection by the various spinal routes (epid ural, intrathecal, caudal, etc.) are 
available forms in these regions. Other tramadol formulations a pproved in several countries 
include tablets, capsules, effervescent powders, and suppositor ies (Grond 2004; Rosenberg 
2009).  DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

   There is extensive data demonstrating that tramadol use is not associated with the classic-opioid 
side effects seen with more potent opioids. There are numerous reports of the safety and efficacy 
of tramadol in this setting ( Scott 2000 ; Grond 2004 ). 
4.2. Nonclinical Summary 
Tramadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic of the amino cyclohexanol group with opioid-
like effects. Tramadol is extensively metabolized following adm inistration, which results in a 
number of enantiomeric metabolites that display different opioi d-receptor binding properties, and 
monoaminergic reuptake inhibition ( Grond 2004).  
Both enantiomers of tramadol and (+)-M1 are responsible for the  analgesic effect. The primary 
metabolite [(+)-M1 or (+)-O- desmethyltramadol] of tramadol confers significant μ -opioid 
activity; (+)- tramadol confers weak μ -opioid activity and significant serotonin reuptake 
inhibition; and (−) -tramadol is responsible for t he inhibition of noradrenaline re -uptake ( Gillen 
2000; Raffa 2008). Nonclinical studies have shown that antinociception induced by tramadol is 
only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, indicating that non-opioid 
mechanisms are also involved in its pharmacodynamic action ( Collart 1992 ). 
Consistent with the known clinical effects of opioids, non-clin ical safety pharmacology studies 
have shown that tramadol at high doses affects the central nervous system (CNS), producing 
sedation, impaired mobility, vomiting (dogs), decreased activity, and convulsions (Matthiesen et 
al., 1998). Also consistent with clinical effects, changes in b lood pressure have been observed in 
cardiovascular studies in rats at high doses ( Raimundo 2006 ). 
The toxicity of tramadol has been summarized by Matthiesen ( Matthiesen 1998 ). The single dose 
toxicity of tramadol was simila r in all species tested, indepen dent of the route of administration. 
Notable acute findings included restlessness, unsteady gait, re duced spontaneous activity, 
exophthalmus, mydriasis, salivation, vomiting (dog), tremor, convulsions, slight cyanosis and dyspnea. The principle findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies  in rats and dogs were 
behavioral/clinical signs and convulsions at doses of ≥25 mg/kg/day. The kidney and liver were 
identified as potential target organs in rats, with mild effect s (minimal tubular vacuolization and 
perivenular hydropic de generation, respectively) following repeat intraperitoneal dosing at high 
doses of tramadol. 
There was no evidence of genotoxic potential for tramadol in st andard in vitro and in vivo 
studies ( Matthiesen 1998 ). Carcinogenicity bioassays in mice and rats showed no evidenc e of 
carcinogenic potential. An extensive reproductive and teratolog y program revealed no safety 
concerns with respect to fertility or teratogenic effects after  oral administration ( Matthiesen; 
Yamamoto 1972 ). Toxicity to offspring only occurred at doses associated with maternal toxicity. 
In conclusion, none of the results in non-clinical toxicity stu dies indicated a safety concern 
regarding administration of AVE- 901 at the intended clinical do se. 
4.3. Pharmacokinetic Profile 
Following oral administration, tramadol is rapidly and almost c ompletely absorbed. The 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of tramadol were evaluated in healthy mal e volunteers (n=10) in a 
crossover design using 100 mg (PO) or IV doses ( Lintz 1986 ). Peak serum concentrations 
(Tmax) were reached approximately 2 hours after oral dosing and  the peak serum concentration DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

   (Cmax) for PO tramadol was 280±49 ng/mL. The terminal half-life was 5.1 hours for PO and 5.2 
hours for IV administration. The a rea under the serum tramadol concentration-time curve (AUC) 
was 2488±774 ng·h/mL for PO and 3709±977 ng·h/mL for IV adminis tration. Total clearance 
was 467±124 mL/min for PO and 710±174 mL/min for IV administration. The absolute 
bioavailability of the oral dose was 68±13%, based on comparison of the AUC values, while the 
estimated absorption of the oral dose was 86-88%. The difference between absorption and 
bioavailability was attributed to first pass metabolism, which was estimated to be ~20%. 
However, the absolute bioavailability approaches 90-100% with c ontinuous dosing, probably due 
to saturation of first pass metabolism (Liao et al., 1992). Oth er studies have corroborated these 
findings ( Grond 2004 ). 
Tramadol undergoes hepatic meta bolism and both the parent drug and the active metabolite are 
excreted by the kidneys. The only known active metabolite, M1 (O desmethyltramadol), is 
produced by the action of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 isozyme of the  cytochrome P450 enzyme 
system. It has a half-life of approximately 6.7 hours after ora l administration (single dose of 100 
mg), compared to a half-life of 5.6 hours for tramadol. Hepatic  impairment results in decreased 
metabolism of both the parent compound and the active metabolit e. Elimination half-life 
increases approximately 2-fold in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients who 
metabolize drugs poorly via CYP2D6 (Caucasian population preval ence ~ 8%) may obtain 
reduced benefit from tramadol due to reduced formation of M1 ( Ultram® Prescribing 
Information, Ortho McNeil-Janssen, 2009). 
A Phase 1 study was performed to determine a treatment regimen of IV tramadol that would be 
comparable to the approved 100 mg dose of oral tramadol at stea dy state [Study title: “A Phase 
1, Open-Label, Single Center, Three-Period, Multi-dose Crossove r Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics of Two Different AVE-901 (Tramadol Infusion) R egimens versus Oral 
Tramadol Tablets” (Study AVE-901-101)]. 
The two different IV regimens were evaluated and compared to th e oral regimen. A total of 18 
patients, ages 24 to 55 years (inclusive) were enrolled (3 patients to each of the 6 sequences). 
The study included 11 males and 7 females. 17 patients complete d all 3 treatment sequences. 
The treatment regimens evaluated were: 
1. 75 mg IV REGIMEN: IV tramadol 75 mg administered at Hour 0, followed by 75 mg at Hour 3 and Hour 6, and 75 mg every 6 hours thereafter through Hour 42 
2. 50 mg IV REGIMEN: IV tramadol 50 mg administered at Hour 0, followed by 50 mg at Hour 2, 50 mg at Hour 4, and 50 mg every 4 hours thereafter thr ough Hour 44 
3. ORAL REGIMEN: Oral tramadol 100 mg (50 mg tablets x 2) at Hour 0, 6, and every 6 
hours thereafter through Hour 42 
Examination of the parent (tramadol) as well as the primary met abolite, M1 (O-
desmethyltramadol), was perform ed over the 48-hour treatment pe riod.  A focus of the analysis 
was on assessment of C
max values (to ensure the C max for the IV formulation was similar to that 
of the oral formulation) as well as on early concentrations during the first doses (to ensure adequate medication would be pr ovided during the initial 6 to 1 2 hours of treatment as the drugs 
reached steady-state concentrations). Overall exposure to tramadol was estimated primarily from average trough plasma concentrations.   DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

   Figure 1 provides the mean plasma tramadol time-concentration profiles for the 100 mg oral, 50 
mg IV, and 75 mg IV regimens from Study AVE 901-101. Mean plasma tramadol concentrations 
were higher after the 75 mg IV regimen compared to the 50 mg IV  regimen and 100 mg PO q6h.  
As evidenced from the trough/pre-dose samples between 24 and 42  h, the mean tramadol trough 
concentrations were very similar for the 50 mg IV regimen and 1 00 mg PO q6h but somewhat 
lower for the 75 mg IV regimen.   
Tramadol peak and trough concentr ations for the 50 mg IV and th e 100 mg PO q6h regimens 
were very similar at the end of the pharmacokinetic sampling period, between approximately 44 
and 48 h.

at 6 h, but there was appreciable overlap of the trough concent rations for the 75 mg IV and 50 
mg IV regimens between 24 and 42 h. The pre-dose concentrations  as well as the concentrations 
after the last dose at 42 h were higher for 100 mg PO q6h compa red to both IV arms, presumably 
due to first pass metabolism which results in a higher fraction of the active metabolite in 
systemic circulation after oral administration.

The 50 mg IV regimen provided favorable C max and AUC values over the full 48 hour treatment 
period. Specifically:   
x Overall C max was comparable between the 50 mg IV and 100 mg PO regimens 
x Exposure to tramadol at steady state (or near steady state, in the case of the oral 
regimen), based on C max and AUC, was also comparable between the 50 mg IV 
regimen and 100 mg PO q6h.   
x The 50 mg IV regimen, as compar ed to the 75 mg IV regimen, resulted in less peak to 
trough fluctuation with lower C max. This regimen also provided a pharmacokinetic 
profile very similar to the 100 mg oral dose regimen

   x Exposure to O-desmethyltramadol was higher after 100 mg PO q6h compared to 
either IV treatment, 50 mg IV or 75 mg IV regimens, based on AUC and C max values 
Based on these findings, the 50 mg IV regimen will be studied i n this current protocol. 
4.4. Rationale for this Study 
This open-label safety study will be conducted in parallel with  two efficacy Phase 3 studies, one 
in an orthopedic model ( AVE-901-102) and the other in a soft tissue model ( AVE-901-103 ). 
Data from this current study will be combined with data from th ose two efficacy studies into an 
overall safety database for tramadol infusion. 
A brief summary of the two doubl e-blind studies follows. 
x Protocol AVE-901-102:  Orthopedic surgery study in a Phase 3, m ulticenter, double-
blind, randomized, placebo-control led, multiple-dose, parallel- group trial to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 2 doses (50 mg and 25 mg) of IV Tramadol 
hydrochloride injection (AVE-901) versus placebo in the management of postoperative pain in consentin g patients undergoing an orthope dic surgery 
(bunionectomy). The primary object ive of this study is to evaluate the analgesic 
efficacy of intravenous (IV) Tramadol (AVE-901) in the manageme nt of 
postoperative pain following ort hopedic surgery. The Sum of Pai n Intensity 
Differences (SPID) through 48 hours post first dose (SPID48) at  rest will be used as 
the primary measure of efficacy.  Up to approximately 405 patie nts will be 
randomized.  This study has commenced and expected to be comple ted second 
quarter 2018 
x Protocol AVE-901-103:  Soft tissue surgery study is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-
blind, randomized, placebo-control led, multiple-dose, parallel- group trial to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability and efficacy of IV Tramadol (AVE-901) versus placebo in the 
management of postoperative pain i n consenting patients undergo ing elective 
abdominoplasty. The primary objective of this study is to evalu ate the analgesic 
efficacy of intravenous (IV) Tramadol (AVE-901) in the manageme nt of 
postoperative pain following soft tissue surgery. The Sum of Pain Intensity 
Differences (SPID) through 24 hours post first dose (SPID24) at  rest will be used as 
the primary measure of efficacy.  Up to approximately 360 patie nts will be 
randomized.  A smaller morphine compa rator arm will be included  in the study. DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

   6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
6.1. Overall Study Design 
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, u ncontrolled, repeat-dose trial to 
assess the safety of AVE-901 in t he management of postoperative  pain. Eligible patients will be 
patients that are undergoing elect ive surgery and are deemed ap propriate to receive IV AVE-901 
for the treatment of post-surgical pain.  Approximately 250 pat ients will be enrolled into the 
study. Each patient will undergo the Screening Visit (Day -28 t o Day -1), the Pre-operative 
assessment (within 24 hours prior to surgery), the Surgery (Day  0), the Primary treatment period 
(hour 0 through hour 168), End of Treatment visit, and the Follow-up Visit (Day 14).   
Note: Patients may have Screeni ng and Preoperative visits combi ned into one visit if required to 
accommodate timelines for scheduled surgeries. The procedures a ssociated with the Screening 
Visit should be completed.  Screening will occur up to 28 days prior to surgery.  Eligible patients will be made aware of the 
use of additional pain medication, and of the various post-trea tment safety measures.  These 
patient training procedures may be conducted on different days as appropriate during Screening. 
Surgery will occur on Day 0.  There are no restrictions on the agents to be used for induction, 
neuromuscular blockade, maintenance of anesthesia, or on hypnot ics, sedatives, or anxiolytics. 
Following surgery, each patient will receive their study medica tion infusion at T0, T2, T4, and 
then every 4 hours for up to 168 hours a fter the first study drug administration (a total of up to 43 
doses per patient).  The latest (last) dose that is allowed is at Hour 164.  Patients will be confined 
at the healthcare facility for as long as they are still using AVE-901. Following the first dose of 
study drug, the patients will be allowed to use non-opioid pain medication per the treating physician’s discretion, if additi onal pain relief is required.  
6.2. Number of Patients 
A total of approximately 250 patien ts in United States (US) at approximately 8-10 study sites 
who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are p lanned to be enrolled.  Every 
patient treated will receive A VE-901.  Patients who withdraw from the trial are not planned to be 
replaced. 
6.3. Treatment Assignment and Randomization 
No randomization will be utilized in this study; all patients w ill receive tramadol infusion per the 
treatment dosing regimen. 
6.4. Criteria for Study Termination 
If the Investigator, Study Medical Monitor, or Avenue Therapeut ics discovers conditions arising 
during the study, which indicate that the clinical investigatio n should be halted, the study must 
be terminated after appropriate consultation between Avenue The rapeutics, Study Medical 
Monitor, and the Investigators.  Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

   x The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable ri sk to the patients 
enrolled in the study, 
x Failure of the Investigator to enter patients at an acceptable rate, 
x Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements and good clinic al practices, or; 
x A decision on the part of the Avenue Therapeutics to suspend or discontinue 
development of the drug. 
6.4.1. Individual Patient Stopping Rules 
If a patient experiences a serious or severe adverse event asse ssed as possibly, probably or 
definitely related to study drug, the Investigator will review the patient’s  medical record, consult 
with the Medical Monitor if necessary and determine whether the  patient should have study 
treatment either temporarily interrupted or permanently discont inued.

x Screening (Days -28 to -1) 
x Pre-operative (within 24 hours of scheduled surgery) 
x Surgery (Day 0) 
x Treatment Period/Post Surgery (Hours 0 up to Hour 168) 
x Follow –up (approximately Day 14) 
Procedures for each study period are described below. 
6.6.1. Screening 
Screening will occur from Day -28 through Day -1 and will be co nducted as a clinic visit. 
Patients will have the purpose and procedures of the study expl ained to them and, those who 
elect to participate in the study, will provide written informe d consent and be screened for 
participation according to the eli gibility criteria. Patients will undergo protocol specific 
education including but not limited to the various post-treatme nt efficacy and safety measures.  
The following information and procedures will be performed and documented as part of the 
screening assessment: 
x Demographics, including gender, race and ethnic origin, date of birth, height, weight 
and calculated BMI. (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health /educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm)

   For patients that screen within 5 days of surgery, central labo ratory values may not be available 
to assess eligibility.  For these patients it is acceptable for  sites to draw local lab to assess 
eligibility, in addition to the central lab, which will still b e used as the baseline in the study.  If 
local labs are used to access elig ibility at screening, at a mi nimum the following analytes must be 
reviewed from the local laboratory prior to dosing; magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium, 
serum creatinine, ALT, AST, hemoglobin. The local laboratory li sted on the FDA 1572 Form 
must be used for all local blood draws.  
 Central labs supersede local lab s for eligibility. If during th e screening process the central labs 
are received prior to the subject being dosed/treated, even though local labs were drawn, the central lab values will be use d to indicate eligibility. If central labs show exclusionary lab values 
discrepant from the local labs and the subject has not yet been  treated, subject will be deemed a 
screen failure and will not be treated. If the subject is treated based on local lab values and the 
central lab values show exclusionary labs after subject is dose d, the PI will inform the Medical 
Monitor and discuss patient safety and suitability to continue treatment.   
 
6.6.2. Preoperative 
Preoperative assessments to confir m the patient’s eligibility w ill be performed within 24 hours of 
scheduled surgery start time.  Thi s visit will include reassess ment of: 
x Inclusion/exclusion eligibility criteria 
x Physical examination  
x ASA Physical Status 
x Medical history within 2 years 
x Prior and ongoing medications (taken in previous 30 days) 
x Vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature (after 
seated or supine for 5 minutes) and SpO2 
x Urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential 
6.6.3. Surgery 
Surgery will occur on Day 0.  Standard of care procedures shoul d be followed. 
6.6.4. Treatment Period/Post Surgery 
Patients will receive their first dose of study medication (T0)  within 8 hours of meeting the 
postsurgical eligibility. Treatment is anticipated to occur fro m Hours 0 up to Hour 168.  The 
latest (last dose) that is allowed is at Hour 164. Patients will be dosed at Hour T0, T2, T4, and 
then every 4 hours thereafter, for a total of up to 43 doses ad ministered over the 168-hour 
treatment period. Assessments w ill have a + 10 minute window. 
Antiemetic treatments (with the  exception of Zofran or other 5-HT3 antagonists) are allowed.

   8.3. Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance with study medication during the treatment  periods is expected to be high, 
as patients will be dosed directl y in the clinic under well-con trolled conditions.  The date and 
time of study drug administration will be recorded on the eCRF.   
8.4. Overdose 
Tramadol products in excessive  doses, either alone or in combination with other CNS 
depressants, including alcohol, are a cause of drug-related dea ths. Acute over dosage with 
tramadol can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolenc e progressing to stupor or 
coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, seizures, bradycardia, 
hypotension, cardiac arrest, and death. Serious potential conse quences of over dosage with 
tramadol are CNS depression, respiratory depression and death. Some deaths have occurred as a 
consequence of the accidental i ngestion of exce ssive quantities  of tramadol alone or in 
combination with other drugs, while others were associated with  abuse of tramadol.  Review of 
case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when tramadol is abused concurrently with alcohol  or other CNS depressants, including other opioids (Ultram® 
Prescribing Information, 2009). 
Of note, while naloxone will re verse some, but not all, symptoms caused by over dosage with 
tramadol, the risk of seizures is  also increased with naloxone administration. In animals 
convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of tramadol could be suppressed with 
barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did 
not change the lethality of an overdose in mice.  Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an 
overdose because it removes le ss than 7% of the administered do se in a 4-hour dialysis period 
(Ultram® Prescribing Information, 2009). 
Additional details may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
8.5. Randomization, Blinding and Unblinding

11.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
11.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
11.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  Adverse events may include safety findings 
considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator.  A n adverse drug event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal l aboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated w ith the use of a medicinal produ ct, whether or not it is related to 
the medicinal product.  Reporting an adverse event does not nec essarily reflect a conclusion by 
the Investigator that the event is causally related to the drug . 
All adverse events should be captured and documented along with  any supporting 
documentation.  Adverse events should be spontaneously reported or elicited by non-suggestive 
probing.  Signs or symptoms associated with a worsening in eith er severity or frequency as 
compared to a baseline condition should be evaluated by the Inv estigator for clinical significance 
and adverse event reporting.  
Each adverse event in this study will be assessed for Grade, wh ere Grade of an AE refers to the 
severity of the AE.  Grade will  be assessed according to CTCAE Version 4.03 or higher.  The 
CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descript ions of severity for each AE 
that are based on this general guideline.  Table 6   provides the CTCAE grades and grade 
descriptions to be used in this study. DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

CTCAE Grade  CTCAE Grade Description 
Grade 1: Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observati ons only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2: 
Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive inte rvention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental ADL1. 
Grade 3: Severe Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; d isabling; 
limiting self -care ADL2. 
Grade 4: Life-
threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5: Death Death related to the AE . 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 
1 Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceri es or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
2 Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feedin g self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.  
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), Version 4.03 will be used for AE 
grading.  A complete CTCAE list can be downloaded at http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html.  
11.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during the study tha t fulfills one or more of the 
following: 
x Results in death 
x It is immediately life-threatening 
x It requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of exist ing hospitalization 
x It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacit y 
x Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
x It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patien t or may require 
medical intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes listed abov e 
Reporting serious adverse events requires additional detailed r eports and follow-up, depending 
upon the Investigator's estimate of a causal relationship betwe en the test agent and the adverse 
event(s), and whether the adverse event(s) is identified in nat ure, severity, and frequency in the 
Investigator's Brochure or other risk information supplied to the Investigator. 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be submitted promptly to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).  The investigator  must make an effort to obtain 
all hospital medical records incl uding discharge summary confir ming final diagnosis.  The death 
of a patient must be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the IRB.  All serious and non-DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

   serious adverse events should be thoroughly documented and foll owed out by the Investigator 
until the event resolves or until the termination visit.  The e vent may be followed longer, if 
deemed necessary.  For any death occurring during the trial, th e medical condition that led to the 
death should also be noted.  The “outcome” status should be not ed as “death” in these cases of 
SAEs that resulted in death.  In addition, all SAEs that occur from treatment through the follow-
up phone call should be recorded and reported as noted previous ly. 
11.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the dete rmination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE.  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her 
medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the ev ent may have been caused by the 
investigational product.  For purposes of the defin itions below, “temporal sequence” is defined 
as an association between adminis tration of a drug and the obse rved reaction or event such that 
the drug was present prior to the reaction or event. 
DEFINITE - The adverse event: 
x follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration , 
x abates upon discontinuation of the drug (dechallenge), AND 
x is confirmed by reappearance of the reaction on repeat exposure  (rechallenge). 
PROBABLE - The adverse event: 
x follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration , 
x abates upon discontinuation of the drug (dechallenge), and 
x cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical 
state. 
POSSIBLE - The adverse event: 
x follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration , and; 
x could have been produced by the patient's clinical state or by other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient. 
REMOTE  
x There is another more likely explanation for the adverse event,  such as a concomitant 
therapy or procedure.  The known pharmacology of the drug is no t consistent with the 
event and the temporal relationship to study drug is unknown or  may be consistent 
with the drug being present at the time of event. 
DEFINITELY NOT – The adverse event: 
x is definitely produced by the patient's clinical state or by ot her modes of therapy 
administered to the patient. T he temporal relationship indicate s that the drug was not 
present at the time of the event. DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

   11.4. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the patient/caregiver and/or in response to an open 
question from the study personnel or revealed by observation wi ll be recorded during the study at 
the investigational site.  The AE term should be reported in st andard medical terminology when 
possible.  For each AE, the Invest igator will evaluate and repo rt the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), severity, causality, action taken, serious, outcome (if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 11.2.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on a  pregnancy reporting form.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational 
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. The outcome of all pregnancies (s pontaneous miscarriage, electi ve termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be  followed up and documented even  if the patient was 
discontinued from the study. All reports of congenital abnor malities/birth defects are SAEs.   Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions witho ut complications should not be 
handled as AEs. 
11.5. Reporting Adverse Events 
Information about AEs and SAEs will  be collected from treatment  (i.e. from time of first dose) 
through the follow-up phone call.  AEs or SAEs occurring prior to first dose of study treatment 
will be considered Medical History.  AEs or SAEs occurring during or after the first dose of 
study treatment will be treatment-emergent (S)AE.  Any SAEs con sidered at least possibly 
related to the investigational product and discovered by the In vestigator at any time after the 
study should be reported.  The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source 
documents.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, sho uld all be communicated within 
one business day of receipt and t his should be completed on a follow-up SAE form and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or 
study file. 
The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulator y authorities of certain events.  It 
is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all SAEs that occur at his or her site.  
Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious,  drug-related events (7/15 Day 
Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical trial.  Each sit e is responsible for notifying its IRB 
or IEC of these additional SAEs. DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

will be descriptive in nature a nd no formal statistical tests w ill be performed. 
12.10.1. Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary ; patient incidence of each 
system organ class and unique term will be tabulated.  AE incid ence will also be tabulated 
according to relationship to study medication and severity.  Se rious AEs and AEs resulting in 
premature discontinuation will be tabulated.   
Adverse events starting before the first dose of treatment will  be recorded as Medical History.  
Adverse events starting after the first dose of treatment will be considered treatment-emergent 
adverse events.  
Local tolerability of the infusion site will be assessed for pa in, swelling, tenderness, and 
erythema via AE’s . 
12.10.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medicati ons will be reviewed and coded us ing the WHO Drug Dictionary, 
and tabulated by treatment.  Concomitant medications will be re ported in a fashion similar to that

   13. STUDY MONITORING, AU DITS, IRB, AND QUALITY 
13.1. Study Monitoring 
Before an investigational site ca n enter a patient into the stu dy, a Sponsor representative will 
visit the investigational study site to: 
x Determine the adequacy of the facilities 
x Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their resp onsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the res ponsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives.  This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor (or its delegate) 
and the investigator. 
During the study, a monitor or Sponsor representative will have  regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following: 
x Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
x Confirm that facilities remain acceptable 
x Confirm that the investigationa l team is adhering to the protoc ol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRF, a nd that investigational produ ct accountability checks 
are being performed 
x Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRF with the patient ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other recor ds relevant to 
the study.  This will require direct access to all original (or  faxed/copied, if requested) 
records for each patient (e.g. clinic charts) which may include  access to medical records 
for purposes of remote (i.e. not on- site at the Investigat or’s clinic) source data 
verification 
x Record and report any protocol  deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor (or its 
delegate) 
x Confirm AEs and SAEs have been pro perly documented on eCRFs and  confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sponsor (or its delegate) and those  SAEs that met criteria 
for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. 
The monitor will be available be tween visits if the investigato r(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
13.2. Audits and Inspections 
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, its delegate, a regu latory authority, an Independent 
Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the  site to perform audits or 
inspections, including source  data verification.  The purpose o f an audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study-related acti vities and documents to 
determine whether these activ ities were conducted, and data wer e recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Pr actice guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable r egulatory requirements.  The DocuSign Envelope ID: 8E82A4FD-9172-43C8-A2C7-6BB840869E46

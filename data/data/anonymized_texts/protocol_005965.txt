Objectives :  
Primary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of niraparib and a programmed cell death -1 
(PD-1) inhibitor in chemotherapy -naïve and PD -1 inhibitor -naïve patients with locally 
advanced and metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors  have high 
programmed death ligand -1 (PD-L1) expression (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] ≥  50%), 
as assessed by objective response rate (ORR)  
• To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor in 
chemotherapy -naïve and PD -1 inhibitor -naïve patients with locally advanced and 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 (TPS between 1 and 49%), as  assessed 
by ORR 
• To evaluate the efficacy of single agent niraparib in patients with loc ally advanced and 
metastatic squamous NSCLC (sqNSCLC) who have been previously treated with both 
platinum-based chemotherapy and either PD -1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, as assessed by ORR  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agen t niraparib and of the combination of 
niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor  
• To evaluate the following additional measures of clinical benefit of single agent niraparib 
and of the combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor :  
− Duration of response (DOR)  
− Disease control rate (DCR)  
− Progression -free survival (PFS)  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of niraparib following administration of single 
agent niraparib or the combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor

 Exploratory Objectives:  
• To explore blood and tu mor-based biomarkers that predict sensitivity or resistance to 
single agent niraparib and to the combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor  
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, open -label, multi -arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single 
agent niraparib in patients with locally advanced and metastatic sqNSCLC and of the combination of 
niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor in locally advanced a nd metastatic NSCLC (all histologies) patients.  
The study has 2 stages, each of which will evaluate separate cohorts of different cancer patients with a 
sample size that is deemed statistically significant to determine whether further examination may be 
warranted in the individual indications. In Stage 1, Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive niraparib plus the 
PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, and Cohort 3 will receive niraparib alone. In Stage 2, Cohorts  1A and 
2A will receive niraparib plus the PD -1 inhibitor TSR-042 (dostarlimab ). (As of Amendment 2, 
following a cross -program review and decision to move forward with other studies, the Sponsor 
decided that Cohort 3 would close to further enrollment. As of Amendment 3, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
had completed  enrollment,  Cohort 1A had closed after partial enrollment and Cohort 2A was not 
opened for enrollment .) 
Stage 1:  
 
Stage 2: 
 
*Completion of treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation as part of neoadjuvant/adjuvant

Cohorts 1 and 1A:  Locally advanced and metast atic NSCLC patients (all histologies) with no prior 
systemic chemotherapy or PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment, whose tumors have high PD -L1 
expression (TPS  ≥ 50%), and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitizing 
mutation and/or ROS-1 or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations will receive 
combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab or TSR-042 (dostarlimab) ).

 Cohorts 2 and 2A:  Locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC patients (all histologies) with no prior 
systemic chemotherapy or PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment, whose tumors have PD -L1 expression 
(TPS between 1% and 49%) and no known EGFR  sensitizing mutation and/or ROS -1 or ALK 
translocations, will  receive combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab or TSR-
042 (dostarlimab) ). Completion of treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation as part of 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy is allowed as long as therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to 
the diagnosis of metastatic disease.  
Cohort 3: Locally advanced and metastatic sqNSCLC patients who have been previously treated with 
both platinum and either PD -1 or PD-L1 inhibitor will receive single agent niraparib.  
This study will consist of a Screening Period (Day -21 to Day -1), a Treatment Period, an End of 
Treatment (EOT) Period occurring within 7 days of  the decision to discontinue treatment for any 
reason, a Safety Follow -up Visit occurring 30 + 7  days after the last dose of study drug, and a Follow -
up Assessment occurring every 90 ± 14 days, which will continue until death or the end of study data 
collection (a minimum of 6 months after the enrollment of the last patient, provided that this allows 
the opportunity for completion of all  90-day follow -up assessments).  
Patients must have a baseline tumor assessment by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, and other sites as clinically indicated. If the 
patient has had appropriate imaging scans (eg, routine clinical management) performed within 
28 days prior to Cycle  1/Day 1, then the results of those scans m ay be used if they are of diagnostic 
quality. Subsequent postbaseline tumor assessments will be done in locations with tumor lesions 
identified at baseline only, unless clinically indicated.  
Clinic visits will occur in each cycle (every 3 weeks  [Q3W] ± 3 days). For follow -up tumor 
assessments  in Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A, CT/MRI scans will be performed every 9 weeks ± 7 days 
from first treatment dose until Week 72 and every 12 weeks ± 7 days thereafter. For sqNSCLC 
patients in Cohort  3, follow-up tumor asses sment CT/MRI scans will be performed every 6 weeks  
(Q6W) ± 7 days from the first dose until Week  24, then every 9 w eeks ± 7 days until Week 52 
(12 months) and every 12  weeks ± 7 days until disease progression.  
Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) should be confirmed; tumor imaging for confirmation of response must be performed 
at the earliest 28 days after the first indication of response  but no later than 35 days after the response . 
The subsequent scan after the confirmatory scan should be obtained per original schedul e (9 weeks ± 
7 days from confirmatory scan  for Cohorts 1, 1A, 2 and 2A, and 6 weeks ± 7 days from confirmatory 
scan for Cohort 3). 
For Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A ( a PD-1 inhibitor and niraparib), patients with radiologic evidence of 
progressive disease (PD) who are clinically stable may continue treatment at the Investigator’s 
discretion while awaiting confirmatory tumor imagin g. Repeat imaging should be per formed at  
≥ 4 weeks. If repeat imaging shows stable  disease (SD), PR, or CR, patients can continue study 
treatment at the Investigator’s discretion. In the event that PD is confirmed, patients still may 
continue to receive st udy treatment even after confirmed radiologic progression if the patient is 
clinically stable and the Investigator  deems that the patient is deriving clinical benefit. This allowance 
to continue treatment despite radiologic progression takes into account t he observation that some 
patients may have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherapy but 
with subsequent disease response.  
For Cohort 3 (single agent niraparib), patients with radiologic evidence of PD should be disco ntinued 
from treatment.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 Tumor assessment should occur according to study schedule regardless of whether study treatment is 
interrupted. If a patient discontinues treatment for a reason other than progression, death, withdrawal 
of consent, or lost to follow -up, scans should continue at the specified intervals until progression is 
confirmed or until the start of subsequent anticancer treatment.  
Each patient will have an EOT visit within 7 days of the decision to discontinue treatment for any 
reason, a Safety  Follow-up Visit occurring 30 + 7 days after the last dose of study drug, and a 
Follow-up Assessment every 90  ± 14 days, which will continue until death or the end of study data 
collection (a minimum of 6  months after the enrollment of the last patient, provided that this allows 
the opportunity for completion of all 90 -day follow -up assessments).  
Treatment with nir aparib will continue until progression. Treatment with pembrolizumab or TSR-042 
(dostarlimab)  will continue for a maximum of 24  months in patients without disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity.  
For Cohorts 1, 1A, 2 and 2A, local assessment of PD -L1 is acceptable on either archival or fresh 
tissue. PD-L1 status will be confirmed retrospectively in a central immunohistochemistry laboratory 
using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved in vitro companion diagnostic indicated as an 
aid in identifyi ng NSCLC patients for treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor.  
An archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue is required for exploratory 
biomarker analysis. If archival tissue is not available, a fresh biopsy is needed.  Archival FFPE sample 
should be submitted within 30 days of patient’s first dose. ( For Cohort 3  only: if diagnosis was made 
by cytology and archival tissue is not available, patient will not need to provide tumor tissue.)  
Number of Patients (Planned):  
Stage 1: 59 (Cohort 1 = 16, Cohort 2 = 20, Cohort 3 = 23)  
Stage 2: 83 (Cohort 1A = 36, Cohort 2A = 47)  
(As of Amendment 2, following a cross -program review and decision to move forward with other 
studies, the Sponsor decided that Cohort 3 would close to further enrollment. As of Amendment 3, 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 had completed  enrollment , Cohort 1A had closed after partial enrollment and 
Cohort 2A was not opened for enrollment ).

 Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Niraparib : 
Niraparib will be administered orally once a day, continuously throu ghout the 21-day cycle. 
Two capsules of 100 mg strength (200 mg/day) will be taken at each dose administration. Patients 
will be instructed to take their niraparib dose in the morning at approximately the same time each day. 
Niraparib may be taken with or without fo od or water. Patients must swallow and not chew the 
capsules.  
For those patients experiencing nausea and who are at Cycle 5 and beyond, bedtime administration 
may be a potential method for managing nausea. For those patients experiencing nausea who are no t 
yet at Cycle 5, please seek approval from Medical Monitor to permit bedtime administration.  
For Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A, niraparib will be administered upon completion of pembrolizumab or 
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  infusion per respective cohorts.  
Niraparib will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 of every cycle (every 21 days) thereafter until the 
patient discontinues study treatment. The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the packaging of 
niraparib and instructions for administration of niraparib.  
Niraparib dose may be escalated on or after Cycle 3/Day 1 from 200 mg daily (2 capsules) to 300  mg 
daily (3 capsules) if platelets ≥100,000/μL, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and neutrophils ≥ 1,500/μL for all 
laboratory tests performed during the first 2 cycles after di scussion with Medical Monitor or designee.  
Dose interruption will be allowed for no longer than 28 days. In addition, dose reduction will be 
allowed based on treatment side effects. Dose reductions to 100 mg daily (1 capsule) will be allowed. 
No further do se reductions will be allowed. The timing of efficacy or safety evaluations should not be 
affected by dose interruptions or reductions.  
Pembrolizumab:  
Pembrolizumab infusion will be administered before niraparib dose at the study site on Day 1 of each 
21-day treatment cycle after all procedures and assessments have been completed. Pembrolizumab 
may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 1 due 
to administrative reasons.  
Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200  mg IV using a 30 -minute infusion. Sites should 
make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. Given the 
variability of infusion pumps from site to site, however, a window between - 5 minutes and 
+ 10 minutes is permitted. Dose interruption will be allowed for no longer than 28 days.  
Refer to United States Prescribing Information for specific instructions for the preparation of the 
pembrolizumab infusion and administration of the infusion solution.  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab) : 
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  infusion will be administered before niraparib dose at the study site on Day 1 
of each 21 -day treatment cycle (Q3W) in Cycles 1 through 4 and on Day 1 of every other cycle 
(Q6W) thereafter , beginning on Cycle 5 Day 1 (ie, Cycle 5, Cycle 7, Cycle 9, etc.). 
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be administered after all procedures and assessments have been 
completed, unless otherwise indicated. TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  may be administered up to 3 days 
before or after the schedul ed Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 1 due to administrative reasons.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Confidential  Page 15 of 132 
 TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be administered at a dose of 500  mg IV Q3W in Cycles 1 through 4 and 
at a dose of 1,000 mg IV Q6W  thereafter , beginning on Cycle 5 Day 1, for the r est of the treatment 
using a 30 -minute infusion. Sites should make every effort to target infus ion timing to be as close to 
30 minutes as possible. Given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, however, a window 
between - 5 minutes and +  15 minutes is permitted. Dose interruption to manage adverse reactions 
will be allowed for no longer than 28 days.  
The Pharmacy Manual contains information for specific instructions for the preparation of the TSR-
042 (dostarlimab)  infusion and administration of the infusi on solution.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, 
Investigator’s decision, or death. Treatment with niraparib will continue until disease progression. 
Treatment with p embrolizumab or TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will continue for a maximum of 24 months 
in patients without disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Those patients deemed to derive clinical benefit from niraparib monotherapy treatment at the time of 
final analysis and who are no longer receiving a PD -1 inhibitor will have the option to continue 
treatment with niraparib through the extension “rollover” protocol, if available, and at the discretion 
of the Investigator and Sponsor.  
Long-Term Follow -Up Assessment: Every 90 days, via telephone.  
Planned study conduct duration:  
• Stage 1: It may take 8 to 12 months to complete enrollment in each cohort. For each 
cohort, analysis will be done after the last patient enrolled in that cohort has discontinued 
treatment or co mpleted 2 postbaseline tumor assessments (approximately 3 to 5 months 
from baseline), whichever occurs earlier.  
(As of Amendment 2, following a cross -program review and decision to move forward 
with other studies, the Sponsor decided that Cohort 3 would close to further enrollment. 
As of Amendment 3, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 had completed  enrollment , Cohort 1A had 
closed after partial enrollment and Cohort 2A was not opened for enrollment .) 
• Stage 2: It may take 12 to 14 months to complete enrollment in each cohort. For each 
cohort, analysis will be done after the last patient enrolled in that cohort has discontinued 
treatment or completed 2 postbaseline tumor assessments (approximately 3 to 5 months 
from baseline), whichever occurs earlier.  
Criteria for Eval uation: 
Efficacy: 
The primary endpoint is the ORR, which is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed best 
overall response of CR or PR in the analysis population. Tumor assessment will be done by the 
Investigator per RECIST v1.1.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
• DOR, defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until the subsequently 
documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs earlier.  
• DCR defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000-02-001, Amendment 3, Version 4.0   
Confidential  Page 16 of 132 
 • PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of disease progression or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier.  
Safety: 
Safety and tolerability of single agent niraparib and of the combination of niraparib and a PD-1 
inhibitor will be evaluated throughout the study, including assessment of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs, clinical laboratory assessments (CBC, serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis), vital signs, electrocardiograms, physica l examination, and use of concomitant 
medications.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The PK of niraparib when given alone and in combination with pembrolizumab or TSR-042 
(dostarlimab)  will be evaluated. Samples for PK determination will be collected from patients in 
plasma for single agent niraparib (Cohort 3) and serum and plasma for the combination of niraparib 
and pembrolizumab or TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  (Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and  2A).  
Biomarkers:  
Biomarker analysis will be carried out on tumor tissue and blood to include b ut not be limited to 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor cells (CTC) to identify prognostic or predictive 
biomarkers and to explore potential mechanisms of either de novo or treatment -emergent resistance.  
Biomarkers will be evaluated in arc hival or fresh tumor samples obtained during screening to confirm 
histology morphology, presence of tumor, and to conduct biomarker analysis. Archival FFPE sample 
should be submitted within 30 days of patient’s first dose. ( For Cohort 3  only: if diagnosis was made 
by cytology and archival tissue is not available, patient will not need to provide tumor tissue.)  
Blood samples for the analysis of tumor -related circulating biomarkers such as CTC will be collected 
at Cycle 1/Day 1 predose. Blood samples for the analysis of ctDNA will be obtained at Screening, 
Cycle 2/Day 1 predose, as well as EOT.  
Statistical Methods:  
Data from Stage 1 will be used to determine whether further enrollment of Stage 2 patients is 
warranted. The criteria for continuing Stage 2 enrollment are provid ed in Section 9. For each cohort, 
if the number of responders by the end of Stage 1 is the same or less  as defined by the crite rion, the 
cohort will be terminated. Only cohorts with number of responders larger than that defined by the 
criteria will continue Stage 2 enrollment. (As of Amendment 2, following a cross -program review and 
decision to move forward with other studies, the  Sponsor decided that Cohort 3 would close to further 
enrollment. As of Amendment 3, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 had completed  enrollment , Cohort 1A had 
closed after partial enrollment  and Cohort 2A was not opened for enrollment .) 
Number of responders, ORR, and its 80% and 95% binomial exact confidence interval will be 
reported by cohort and stage.  
Results for DCR  and PFS will be summarized in a descriptive manner. DCR will be analyzed using 
the same methods for ORR. Kaplan -Meier estimates including median and its 95% confidence 
interval will be tabulated for time -to-event variables. In addition, Kaplan -Meier curves will also be 
presented for time -to-event variables . 
Pharmacokinetics:  
PK parameters will be summarized by cohort and dose schedule using descriptive statistics. The 
concentration -time data for niraparib will be used to perform a population PK analysis. The 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 relationship between measures of niraparib exposure and measures of efficacy, including, but not 
limited to, ORR, PFS, DOR, and DCR, will be explored. The relationship between niraparib exposure 
and key safety variables, including, but not limited to,  AEs of special interest in the population will be 
explored.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background  
1.1.1. Lung Cancer  
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality globally and the second most 
common cancer in both men and women. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers. In the 
United States (US), there are projected to be  222,500 new cases of lung cancer (116,990 in men 
and 105,510 in women) and 155,870 deaths from lung cancer (84,590 in men and 71,280 in 
women) in 2017.1  
The 2 major forms of lung cancer are  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  and small cell lung 
cancer. NSCLC is a heterogeneous disease that consists of adenocarcinoma, large -cell 
carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (sqNSCLC), and comprises approximately 80% to 85% 
of all lung cancers.2 Despite advances in early detection and standard treatment, NSCLC is often 
diagnosed at an advanced stage, has poor prognosis, and is the leading cause of cancer deaths 
worldwide.  
Platinum-based doublet therapy, maintenance chemotherapy, and anti -angiogenic agents in 
combination with chemotherapy have contributed to improved patient outcomes in advanced 
NSCLC.3 The identification of point mutations (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], 
BRAF), gene fusions due to chromosomal translo cations (anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK], 
ROS-1), and gene amplifications (mesenchymal epithelial transition factor [MET]) as oncogenic 
drivers in a small subset of patients has led to the new era of personalized medicine, taking 
targeted therapy to the f rontline setting for these patients .4 
For most NSCLC patients without targetable oncogene drivers, first -line platinum -based 
chemotherapy wa s until recently the only standard treatment approach.3 However, the recen t 
understanding of the interactions between immune system and tumor growth has led to the 
development of a new class of immunotherapies. Approval of pembrolizumab in the US and 
European Union in 2016 and 2017, respectively, as the first -line treatment appr oach for NSCLC 
patients whose tumors express  high programmed death ligand -1 (PD-L1) [Tumor Proportion 
Score, (TPS) ≥50%] led to a change in the lung cancer management paradigm.5-7 Pembrolizumab 
was also approved for patients with PD -L1 TPS ≥ 1% as second -line treatment.7 Other 
immunotherapies such as the programmed  cell death -1 (PD-1) inhibitor nivolumab and the 
PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab were similarly approved for NSCLC patients following 
platinum-based chemotherapy .8-10  
Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung accounts for 20% to 30% of NSCLC. Despite the 
differences in disease characteristics between squamous and nonsquamous, both have 
historically been treated similarly . However, clinical studies have shown poorer tolerability and 
efficacy of new therapeutic d rugs in patients with squamous histology.11,12  
Patients with sqNSCLC rarely have EGFR, BRAF, ALK, or ROS -1 alterations in their tumors , 
and molecular testing is not routine.  
Until the recent approval of pembrolizumab, the standard first -line therapy for sqNSCLC 
consisted of 4 to 6 cycles of platinum -based doublet chemotherapy not containing 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 pemetrexed.11,13,14 In the second -line setting, gemcitabine, docetaxel with or without 
ramucirumab, afatinib as well as the recently approved immunotherapies pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, and atezolizumab5-10 are considered the standard treatment options for patients.15 
1.1.2. Overview of PARP and Homologous Recombination Deficiency  
Normal cells repair up to 10,000 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) defects daily; single -strand 
breaks being the most common form of DNA damage. Cells unable to repair their DNA are 
susceptible to the accumulation of mutations that ultimately lead to cancer development.  
Poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 and PARP2 are zinc -finger 
DNA-binding-enzymes that play a crucial role in single -strand DNA repair.16 Upon formation of 
DNA breaks, PARP binds at the end of b roken DNA strands, a process that activates its 
enzymatic activity. Activated PARP catalyzes the addition of long polymers of ADP -ribose onto 
PARP and several other proteins associated with chromatin, including histones and various DNA 
repair proteins. Thi s results in chromatin relaxation, fast recruitment of DNA repair proteins, and 
efficient repair of DNA breaks. In this manner, PARP plays a key role in sensing DNA damage 
and activating the base excision repair and single -strand break repair pathways.16-18  
Niraparib is a potent, orally active PARP 1/2 inhibitor being developed as an agent for tumors 
with defects in the homolog ous recombination DNA repair pathway. PARP inhibitors prevent 
single-strand break repair leading to double -stranded breaks (DSB) and γH2AX foci formation. 
DSB repair occurs preferentially through the homologous recombination pathway.17 This 
pathway is disrupted in several conditions, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) 
deficiency (10% –15% prevalence in NSCLC), phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) 
deficiency, Fanconi deficiency, a nd breast cancer gene 1 or 2 (BRCA1/2) deficiency .19,20 BRCA 
deficient cells are highly sensitive to single -agent PARP inhibition.17  
Treatment with PARP inhibitors represents a novel opportunity to selectively kill a subset of 
cancer cells by exploiting their deficiencies in DNA repair. For example, a tumor arising in a 
patient with a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) has a defective homologous 
recombination DNA repair pathway and woul d be increasingly dependent on the other DNA 
repair pathways for maintenance of genomic integrity.  
1.1.2.1. Nonclinical Experience with PARP Inhibitors in NSCLC  
Homologous recombination deficiencies, which render tumor sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, 
were evaluated  across 15 different cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), showing 
that squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung were among the highest ranking 
cancer types with homologous recombination deficiencies.21 Moreover, deficiency in the Fanconi 
anemia pathway, a major mechanism of homologous recombination DNA repair, was found in 
22% of NSCLC cases studied.22  
TESARO in -house analysis of TCGA data also showed that more than 10% of NSCLC patients 
harbor aberrations in BRCA1/2, ATM, or other genes in homologous recombination repair 
(HRR) while a study of BRCA1 protein levels using immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that 
11-19% of NSCLC patients are BRCA1 deficient.23  
Synthetic lethality between PARP inhibitor and HRR deficiency was observed in several NSCLC 
in vitro models. One study showed that BRCA1 -deficient NSCLC cells, genera ted by ribonucleic 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 acid (RNA) interference, were more sensitive to PARP -1 inhibition. This study also showed that 
BRCA-deficient, platinum -resistant cells were still sensitive to PARP inhibition.23 Another study 
reported that lung cancer cells deficient in ERCC1, an endonuclease essential for HRR, were 
highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.24  
In an effort to evaluate the in vivo activity of niraparib in NSCLC models, a large  panel of 
patient-derived xenograft models, comprising 35 adenocarcinomas and 28 squamous cell 
carcinomas, was treated with niraparib (50 mg/kg PO once daily [QD] for adenocarcinoma and 
75 mg/kg PO 5 -on/2-off for squamous cell carcinoma) or vehicle control  (0.5% Methyl 
Cellulose, PO QD). The results showed that more than 50% tumor growth inhibition was 
achieved in 7 adenocarcinoma models (20%) and 7 squamous cell carcinoma models (25%) 
[Study E0322 -U1502, Study E0322 -U1505 (US), Study E0322 -U1505 (China), S tudy P381B 
and Study 16079 -64] (Study references on file).  
1.1.2.2. Clinical Experience with PARP inhibitors  
Clinical studies have shown that PARP inhibitors are active in recurrent ovarian cancer.16,25-30 
PARP inhibition a ppears to be most active in patients with gBRCAmut and in patients who are 
sensitive to platinum -containing therapy. However, clinical benefit has also been observed in 
gBRCA wild type.26-29 Maintenance treatment of high -grade serous ovarian cancer patients with  
recurrent platinum sensitivity showed that the PARP1/2 inhibitor niraparib significantly 
improved progression -free survival (PFS) in gBRCAmut patients (21 months for niraparib vs. 
5.5 months for control). Furthermore, in the gBRCA wild -type population, si gnificantly 
improvement in PFS was observed for both HRD (homologous recombination deficient patients 
identified by myChoice HRD assay developed by Myriad) positive ( 12.9 months for niraparib 
versus (vs.) 3.8 months for placebo, hazard ratio [ HR]=0.38, p=0 .0001) and HRD negative 
(HRDneg) patients ( 9.3 months for niraparib vs. 3.9 months for placebo, HR=0.45, 
p<0.0001).30,31 Niraparib has been recently approved in the US for the treatment of platinum -
sensitive patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.32  
The use of PARP  inhibitors in lung cancer may not be limited to alterations in the BRCA genes 
as in tumors carrying intrinsically high genomic instability, targeting PARP might induce a 
saturation of the systems controlling DNA damage, leading to uncontrolled accumulatio n of 
mutations and subsequent cell death.33 Data from niraparib Phase 1 development p rogram 
showed that clinical benefit was observed in 2 of 2 patients with NSCLC.30 One patient with 
gBRCAmut was treated with 110 mg niraparib QD and had stable disease  (SD) for 6 months, 
and another patient was treated with 40 mg niraparib QD and had SD for 11 months. 
Additionally, preliminary data from a randomized Phase 2 study in advanced NSCLC patients 
treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel or the combination of the PA RP inhibitor veliparib plus 
chemotherapy  demonstrated that addition of veliparib was associated with improvements in 
outcomes: 5.8 months vs. 4.2 months (PFS), 11.7 months vs. 9.1 months overall survival (OS) 
[HR= 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.54 -1.18; P=0.27]. Improvements in PFS and OS 
were more pronounced in squamous histology: 6.5 months vs.  4.1 months (PFS) [HR=0.54; 
95% CI=0.26-1.12; P=0.098], 10.3 months vs. 8.4 months (OS) [HR= 0.73; 95% CI=0.43 -1.24; 
P=0.24].34 The reasons behind the efficacy in squamous histology may be related to the higher 
genomic instability observed in this pati ent population, which is more vulnerable to agents that 
enhanced DNA damage.34-36 A Phase 3 trial in squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC have 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

the treatment of NSCLC.  
1.1.3. Overview of PD -1 Inhibitors  
The recognition of tumors by the immune system has been appreciated for multiple decades and 
provides an impetus to utilize the immune system to control tumor growth. Studies have reported 
the presence of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a positive prognostic feature in multiple 
tumors supporting a role for the immune system in limiting tumor growth. Despite evidence of 
immune reactivity, tumors are able to grow  in the presence of an immune system suggesting a 
suboptimal immune response.37-39  
The PD-1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune  
control.40 The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an immunoglobulin superfamily 
member related to CD28 and CTLA -4, which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upo n engagement of its ligands. PD -1 is expressed on activated lymphocytes, 
including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+, T  cells, B cells, Tregs, and natural killer cells.41 
Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -/CD8- (double-negative), 
T cells, as w ell as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.42-44  
The ligands for PD -1 (PD-L1 and programmed death -ligand 2 [PD -L2]) are constitutively 
expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types.45 PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on 
various nonhematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, wher eas PD-L2 protein 
is predominantly expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.45 The binding of PD -1 ligands to PD -1 inhibits T cell activation 
triggered through the T cell receptor. PD -L2 is thought to control immune T cell activation in 
lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T cell functi on in peripheral 
tissues. While healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were shown to 
express abundant levels,46,47 which, via its interaction with the receptor plays a critical role in 
immune evasion by tumors.48 As a consequence, the PD -1/PD-L1 pathway is an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention in cancer.49  
1.1.3.1. Clinical Experience  with PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in NSCLC 
Lung cancer had been considered a poorly immunogenic malignancy, however, in recent years, 
immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic agents in NSCLC. There 
are currently three PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors available for the treatment of  lung cancer: nivolumab, 
pembrolizumab and atezolizumab.5-10,50 Keynote-024 Study showed that treatment with PD -1 
inhibitor pembrolizumab  achieved statistically significant clinical benefits in terms of 
progression free survival, OS and objective responses in advanced NSCLC patients whose 
tumors express high PD -L1 (TPS ≥ 50%), which led to the approval of pembrolizumab as the 
first-line treatment for that patient population. Pembrolizumab was approved as second -line 
treatment in advanced NSCLC PD -L1 positive patients [TPS ≥ 1%] who progressed during or 
after platinum -based therapy. The PD -1 inhibitor nivolumab and the PD -L1 inhibitor 
atezolizumab were also approved as second -line treatment for advanced NSCLC after showing 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 significant improvement in OS compared to docetaxel during or after first -line platinum 
treatment.  
1.1.3.2. Clinical Experience with TSR -042 (Dostarlimab)   
As of April 2018, there were 4 ongoing Phase 1 studies with TSR -042: Study 4010 -01-001 
(TSR-042 monotherapy), Study 4020 -01-001 (TSR -042 combination therapy), Study 
3000-01-002 (TSR -042 combination therapy), and Study 4040 -01-001 (TSR -042 combination 
therapy). 
1.1.3.2.1. TSR-042 (Dostarlimab) Monotherapy  
GARNET (Study 4010 -01-001) is an ongoing, first -in-human Phase 1 study of TSR-042 
(dostarlimab)  that aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics (PDy), 
and clinical activity of TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  in patients with recurrent or advanced solid 
tumors. A total of 21  subjects were dosed in the dose escalation phase of the study (Part 1). Dose 
escalation continued to a maximally administered dose of 1 0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
observed. In Part  2A of the study, the safety and tolerability of TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  was 
evaluated at 2  fixed dosing schedules: 50 0 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) and 1,000 mg every 
6 weeks (Q6W). For both doses, the mean last measurable concentration (C last) was 
approximately 40 μg/mL, which is approximately 16 -fold higher than the lowest TSR-042 
(dostarlimab)  serum concentration at which m aximal receptor occupancy has been observed. 
These results led to a proposed TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
regimen of 500 mg Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by 1,000 mg Q6W for all subsequent cycles , 
which is being evaluated in expansion  cohorts for microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) and 
microsatellite stable (MSS) endometrial cancer (EC), non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 
non-endometrial MSI -H or polymerase ε -mutated cancer in Part 2B of study.  
As of 21 January 2018, 135  subjects with heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors have been 
treated with TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  in GARNET. Preliminary data indicate that t he majority of 
these subjects (92.6%) reported at least 1  treatment -emergent adverse e vent (TEAE), with events 
of fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite being the most frequently reported. Study drug -related 
TEAEs of Grade ≥  3 were reported in 13 subjects (9.6%). The majority of these events occurred 
in only 1 subject each, with the except ion of aspartate aminotransferase increased (3  subjects), 
alanine aminotransferase increased (2  subjects), and fatigue (2 subjects). Serious adverse events 
(SAEs) occurred in 38 subjects (28.1%), for 5 of these subjects the event was considered study 
drug-related. Eight subjects had an adverse event (AE) leading to study drug discontinuation. 
Six subjects had an AE leading to study drug discontinuation which was considered study 
drug-related. Three subjects had an AE leading to death. None of the AEs leadin g to death were 
considered to be related to the study drug.  
Preliminary efficacy data from 15 subjects with MSI -H EC and 24 subjects with NSCLC who 
had at least 1 tumor assessment  were presented at AACR (April 2018) . Responses were assessed 
by Investigator s using immune -related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(irRECIST). Among the 15 subjects with MSI -H EC, the objective response rate (ORR) was 
47% and consisted of all partial responses (PRs), 20% with SD and 33% had disease progression 
(PD). Among the 24 subjects with NSCLC, the ORR was 29% and consisted of all PRs, 42% had 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 SD and 17% had PD. Although preliminary , efficacy data from subjects with NSCLC  treated 
with TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  appears to be comparable to the reported efficacy of other  PD-(L)1 
inhibitors in  the advanced and recurrent population , including nivolumab (ORR 19 -20%),8,51 
pembrolizumab (ORR 19%)50 and atezolizumab (ORR 14%).52  
1.1.3.2.2. Investigational Therapeutic Combinations with TSR -042 (Dostarlimab)  
In addition to the GARNET TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  monotherapy, three additional studies 
involving TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  and other therapeutic agents are being conducted.  
Study 4020 -01-001 is an open -label, first -in-human Phase 1 study of another mAb, TSR -022 - 
anti-TIM3, that is being conducted in 2 parts in patients with advanced solid tumors. In Part 1C 
of this study, TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be administered in combination with TSR -022. 
Study 3000 -01-002 is an open -label, Phase 1b study of TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  that is being 
conducted in 4  parts in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. The study will evaluate 
DLTs, safety, and tolerability of TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  in combination with niraparib with or 
without bevacizumab or carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab.  
Study 4040 -01-001 is an open -label, first -in-human Phase 1 study of another mAb, TSR -033 - 
anti-LAG3, that is being conducted in 2 parts in patients with advanced solid tumors. In Part 1C, 
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be administered in combination with TSR -033 to establish the RP2D 
regimen for this study drug combination. In Part 2 of the study, the efficacy of TSR -033 plus 
TSR-022 with or without  TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be evaluated in patients with advanced 
solid tumors.  
As of 21 January 2018, a total of 51  subjects with heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors have 
received TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  in combination with other therapeutic agents. The majority 
(80.4%) of subjects receiving TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  combination therapy reported at least 
1 TEAE, with events of fatigue and dyspnoea being the most frequently reported. One DLT 
(Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase increased) was reported in a subject in Part B of 
Study 3000-01-002. Serious AEs occurred in 14  subjects, none of these events were considered 
study drug -related. One  subject had at least 1  AE leading to study drug discontinuat ion (alanine 
aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased). Both events were 
considered study drug -related. No subject had an AE leading to death.  
Given the encouraging clinical activity in patients with diverse tumor types and the m anageable 
safety profile of TSR-042 (dostarlimab) , the benefit -risk profile for TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  as a 
treatment for patients with advanced cancers appears positive.  
1.1.4. Combination of PARP Inhibitors and PD -1 Inhibitors  
1.1.4.1. Nonclinical Experience Combining PARP inhibitors and PD -1 Inhibitors  
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the combination of PARP inhibitors with anti -PD-1 
agents may provide additional benefits. PARP inhibitors have been shown to elevate PD -L1 
expression, in a cell -autonomous fashion,  and to enhance the antitumor activity of an anti -PD-1 
antibody in preclinical syngeneic breast cancer models.53 Additionally, there is reason to believe 
that PARP inhibition could potentially synergize with anti -PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy by 
enhancing local immune surveillance in the tumor microenvironment via induction of DNA 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 damage. The intracellular accumulation of self DNA fragments resulting f rom inefficient DNA 
repair and/or genomic instability has been linked to activation of innate immunity pathway. 
Multiple molecular mechanisms have been elucidated by which both tumor and immune cells 
could be leveraged to sense the accumulated cytosolic DN A fragments and subsequently enable 
innate immune responses via production of type I interferons.54-58 Elevated type I interferon level 
within tumor immune microenvironment promotes immune  surveillance by engaging and 
enhancing immune cell functions to exert antitumor activities.59 The resulting immune -
stimulating tumor microenvironment will adaptively induce PD -L1 expression to coun teract 
antitumor immune responses which can be blocked by targeting PD -1/PD-L1 signaling. By 
suppressing the enzymatic activity of PARP1/2, PARP inhibitor impairs the base excision repair 
process, resulting in accumulation of DNA damages within the cells, which in turn may promote 
immune surveillance through elevation of interferon -α production.  
The efficacy and tolerability of the combination of niraparib and anti -PD-1 inhibitor was 
evaluated in several preclinical models. The combination was well -tolerated in all of these 
studies. Given the lack of syngeneic model in homologous recombination deficient NSCLCs, the 
combination was first tested in a homologous recombination deficient ovarian cancer model 
derived from BRCA -null genetic background, where PARP i nhibition has been shown to 
increase immune cell infiltration.60,61 In this study, niraparib (50 mg/kg PO QD) and an 
anti-PD-1 antibody (5 mg/kg intravenously [IV] biweekly [BIW]) were  administered either alone 
or in combination. The combination was well tolerated, with no treatment -related death. Almost 
all the tumors achieved complete regression upo n niraparib, anti -PD-1 antibody, and the 
combination treatment in the study. Complete regression was first observed on treatment day 16, 
in 2 of 6, 1 of 6 and 4 of 6 mice from niraparib,  anti-PD-1, or the combination group, 
respectively, suggesting that th e therapeutic approach of combining niraparib with an anti -PD-1 
agent may provide additional benefit for patients with homologous recombination deficient 
tumors (CrownBio BRKRAS, Study reference on file).  
The combination of niraparib and PD -1 inhibitor was  also evaluated in several syngeneic models 
representing BRCA1/2 -wild type tumors, one of which was the breast cancer model LPA1 -T22. 
In this study niraparib and an anti -PD-1 antibody were administered either alone or in 
combination for 15 days. While the tumors were slightly responsive to niraparib or anti -PD-1 
antibody alone, with average tumor growth inhibition around 50% for niraparib and 30% for 
PD-1 antibody, synergistic antitumor activity with near complete tumor growth inhibition 
(> 95%) was achieve d with the combination (G. Mills report, Study reference on file). In a 
similar study using the lung squamous syngeneic model KLN205, stronger tumor growth 
inhibition was observed for the combination (52.3%) than for niraparib alone (36.7%) or 
anti-PD-1antibody alone (30.5%) (Pharmaron KLN205, Study reference on file). Together, these 
data support the therapeutic approach of combining niraparib with an anti -PD-1 agent in either 
BRCA1/2 -mutant or wild type tumors.  
1.1.4.2. Clinical Experience Combining Niraparib and Pembrolizumab  
TOPACIO ( Study 3000 -PN162-01-001) is an open-label, single -arm Phase 1/2 study evaluating 
the safety and efficacy of the combination of niraparib and pembrolizumab in patients with 
advanced triple -negative breast cancer or ovarian cancer. TOPACIO was initiated in April  2016 
and is currently ongoing. In the Phase 1 portion of the study, 14 patients were enrolled in Dose 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 Level 1 (200 mg) or Dose Level 2 (300 mg). Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, 4 of 8 patient s with ovarian cancer responded, 3 of whom were gBRCA  
wild type; 4 patients with ovarian cancer had SD (range 3 -6 cycles), and 1 patient with breast 
cancer had SD for 10 cycles. Dose limiting toxicity was myelosuppression (neutropenia, anemia 
and predomina ntly thrombocytopenia) consistent with  the known adverse events (AEs) 
associated  with single agent niraparib ( Section 1.2.1). The recommended Phase 2  dose was 
determined as niraparib 200 mg PO daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1 of each 
21-day cycle. This dose was implemented in the ongoing Phase 2 portion of the study.  
As of January 2018, 60 of 62 patients in the recurrent ovarian cancer cohor t were evaluable for 
response assessment with ≥ 1 on -study scan; the ORR was 25%, and the disease control rate 
(DCR) was 68%. Among the 11 tumor BRCA mutation evaluable patients, the ORR and DCR 
were 45% and 73%, respectively. The most common Grade ≥  3 TEAEs were anemia (19%) and 
thrombocytopenia (9%). In the metastatic triple -negative breast cancer cohort, 45 patients were 
evaluable with ≥ 1 on -study scan; the ORR was 29%, and the DCR was 49%, including 
3 (7%) patients with complete response (CR), 10 (22%)  patients with PR, 9 (20%) patients with 
SD, and 23 (51%) patients with progressive disease (PD). Ten of 13  responders have ongoing 
responses. Results from the 12 patients with BRCA mutations included 1 CR, 7 PRs, 1 SD, and 
3 PDs. Median PFS in the BRCA mu tation group is 8.1  months. ORR in any BRCA status was 
33% in PD -L1-postive patients (combined proportion score ≥ 1%) versus 15% in PD -L1-negative 
patients. Treatment -related Grade ≥  3 AEs occurred in 27 patients (50%), most common were 
thrombocytopenia (1 3%) and anemia (11%). No new safety signals were identified with this 
combination in either of the 2 cohorts.  
1.1.4.3. Clinical Experience Combining Niraparib and TSR -042 (Dostarlimab)  
Study 3000 -01-002 is a Phase 1b dose -finding study of niraparib, niraparib/bevac izumab, 
carboplatin/paclitaxel, or carboplatin -paclitaxel/bevacizumab in combination with TSR-042 
(dostarlimab)  in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. The study was initiated on 12 
October 2017 and is the first to assess TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  and niraparib combination 
treatment. In Part A of this study, the objectives are to evaluate the DLTs of TSR-042 
(dostarlimab)  and niraparib combination treatment during the first cycle of treatment, to establish 
an RP2D of niraparib in combination with TSR-042 (dostarlimab) , and to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  and niraparib combination treatment. An initial cohort of 
12 patients was enrolled at niraparib dose level 1 (200  mg), which has been determined to be 
safe. Nirapari b dose level 2 (300  mg) is currently open for enrollment of an additional cohort of 
6 to 12 patients. Study 3000 -01-002 is currently ongoing, and no results have been made 
available yet.

patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
a complete or PR to platinum -based chemotherapy. For more details, refer to Zejula United 
States Prescribing Information (USPI) .32  
Nonclinical data, including cell -derived and patient-derived xenograph studies demonstrating 
response to niraparib in both BRCA mutated and BRCA wild -type tumors, are discussed in detail 
in Section  1.1.2.1 and in the Investigator Brochure (IB).  
There are 3 ongoing Phase 3 niraparib studies: Study PR -30-5010-C (BRAVO), 
Study PR-30-5017-C (PRIMA), and Study PR -30-5011-C (NOVA). There is also 1 ongoing 
Phase 1/2 study (Study 3000 -PN162-01-001 [TOPACIO]) and 1 ongoing Phase 2 study (Study 
PR-30-5020-C [QUADRA]).  
NOVA is a double-blind, placebo -controlled study in patients with platinum -sensitive ovarian 
cancer who have received at least 2 platinum -based regimens.31 A total of 553 patients were 
categorized according to the presence or absence of a gBRCAmut (g BRCA cohort and 
non-gBRCA cohort) and the type of non -gBRCA mutation, and were randomly assigned in a 
2:1 ratio to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo QD. The primary end point was PFS. The 
study enrolled 203 patients in the gBRCAmut cohort and 350 patients in the non -BRCAmut 
cohort. Among t he 350 patients in the non -gBRCAmut cohort, 162 had tumors that were defined 
as HRD-positive (HRDpos) and 134 had tumors that were HRDneg. HRD status was not 
determined for 54 patients.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced. Table 3 shows the results for the 
PFS primary endpoint for each of the 3 primary efficacy populations (ie, g BRCAmut  cohort, 
HRDpos cohort, and overall non -gBRCAmut cohort). In addition, median PFS in patients with 
HRDneg tumors was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the nir aparib arm, vs. 3.8 months 
(95% CI: 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo arm, with an HR of 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.361, 0.922) (p=0.0226).

 The primary data to support the safety of treatment with  niraparib are derived from the NOVA 
main study in which a total of 546 patients received study treatment.  
All 367 patients who received niraparib and 171 (96%) of 179 patients who received placebo 
experienced at least 1 TEAE. The high rate of TEAEs in the  placebo group indicates the burden 
of prior chemotherapy and the patient’s underlying ovarian cancer. Review of the data across 
study cohorts for TEAE incidence showed that, in general, the results were similar in the 
gBRCAmut  and non-gBRCAmut  cohorts. In  the overall safety population, for the niraparib vs. 
placebo treatment arms, the incidences of Grade 3/4 TEAEs (74% vs. 23%), serious adverse 
events (SAEs) (30% vs. 15%), TEAEs leading to treatment interruption (69% vs. 5%), TEAEs 
leading to dose reductio n (67% vs. 15%), and TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation (15% 
vs 2%) were higher for niraparib. There were no on -treatment deaths reported.  
The most commonly observed nonhematologic TEAEs (all grades) observed in niraparib 
compared to placebo -treated patients were nausea (74% vs. 35%), fatigue (46% vs. 32%), 
constipation (40% vs. 20%), and vomiting (34% vs. 16%). The majority of the nonhematological 
TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly observed hematologic TEAEs 
(all grades) of  niraparib were anemia (49%), thrombocytopenia (46%), and neutropenia (18%). 
Although Grade 3/4 hematologic laboratory events were common at the initiation of treatment, 
no severe clinical sequelae were observed, and relatively few patients discontinued du e to these 
AEs. Dose adjustment based on individual tolerability during the first 3  cycles substantially 
reduced the incidence of these events beyond Cycle 3, indicating the overall effectiveness of the 
approach to dose modification. These TEAEs can be mon itored routinely using standard 
assessments of hematological laboratory parameters, as is routine for patients with ovarian 
cancer receiving anticancer therapies. In the NOVA study, niraparib dose adjustment tended to 
occur early with most patients reachin g their individual adjusted dose level at the end of Month 3 
(ie, Cycle 3) of treatment. Approximately 36% patients were kept on 300  mg and approximately 
64% patients had dose adjustment after 3 cycles in NOVA. However, in the Phase 1 portion of 
the TOPACI O study (combination of niraparib and pembrolizumab), no patients were able to 
tolerate the 300 mg dose of niraparib.  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are potential adverse 
class effects associated with PARP inhibitors.62 MDS and AML therefore represent a potential 
risk to patients receiving niraparib. In the Phase 3 NOVA study, the incidence of MDS/AML in 
patients who received niraparib (5 of 367; 1.4%) was similar to its incidence in patients who 
received placebo (2 of 179; 1.1%). Guidance on monitoring patients for new events of 
MDS/AML and the follow -up of patients with suspected MDS/AML is provided in 
Section 7.1.14 and Section 8.2.7. 
Study PR -30-5011-C1 (NOVA corrected QT interval [QTc] substudy n=26) is an open -label 
evaluation of the effects of niraparib on QTc measurements in patients with histologically 
diagnosed ova rian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. There were no 
reports of clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, including QTc 
interval prolongation, attributed to niraparib . Administration of niraparib at the the rapeutic dose 
did not prolong the QT interval. There was no correlation between the exposure level ( ie, plasma 
concentration) of niraparib and QTc changes ( ie, ΔQTcF). 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 1.2.2. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with hi gh specificity of 
binding to PD -1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2 ligands. Based on 
preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity 
for PD-1.  
Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA) is in cl inical development as an IV immunotherapy for 
numerous  advanced malignancies. In NSCLC, pembrolizumab  demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS when compared to chemotherapy and has been approved as 
first-line treatment for metastatic  NSCLC patients with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor 
aberrations and whose tumors express  high PD-L1 (TPS ≥ 50%).6 Pembrolizumab is also 
indicated for patients with metastatic NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, 
whose tumors express  PD-L1 (TPS ≥ 1 %) with disease progression on or after 
platinum-containing chemotherapy.5,7 
The safety of pembrolizumab was determined  in patients with advanced NSCLC who had 
documented disease progression following treatment with platinum -based chemother apy. A total 
of 991 patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=339) or 10 mg/kg (n=343) every 3 weeks or 
docetaxel (n=309) at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of 
pembrolizumab occurred in 23% of patients; and the profile wa s similar for the 2 mg/kg and 
10 mg/kg dose. The most common AEs were (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), 
pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis 
(1%). Other clinically important adverse reactions wer e fatigue (25%), diarrhea (14%), asthenia 
(11%), and pyrexia (11%). For more details refer to KEYTRUDA USPI.  
1.2.3. TSR-042 (Dostarlimab)  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  is an IgG4 humanized mAb that binds with high affinity to PD -1, 
resulting in inhibition of binding to PD -L1 and PD -L2. This antibody was generated based on a 
proprietary platform that utilizes affinity maturation to select highly specific antibodies with 
desired functional characteristics. The functional antagonist activity of TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  
was confirmed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, demonstrating enhanced interleukin -2 (IL 
2) production upon addition of TSR-042 (dostarlimab) .  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab) has shown an acceptable clinical and nonclinical safety profile. No 
signals have been identified in the clinical and nonclinical studies. A 1 -month toxicity and TK 
study in cynomolgus monkeys showed no TSR-042 (dostarlimab) -related effects on any  
parameters evaluated, including neurological examinations, electrocardiography, blood pressure, 
and respiration.  
As of 21 January 2018, a total of 186 patients have received at least 1 dose of TSR-042 
(dostarlimab) . Additional safety data are presented in  the current TSR -042 (dostarlimab) IB. 
1.3. Rationale for Current Study  
Given that preclinical data suggest a possible synergistic interaction between immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and PARP inhibitors along with a potential overlap for PD -l- and PARP -sensitive 
patient populations, this study is designed to evaluate the combination of niraparib and a PD-1 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 inhibitor in a treatment -naïve NSCLC population with PD -L1 tumor expression (Cohorts  1, 1A, 
2, and 2A).  
Although substantial advances have been made in the mana gement of nonsquamous NSCLC, an 
unmet need exists for effective treatment of sqNSCLC. Niraparib is being explored in this study 
as a potential treatment option for patients with sqNSCLC who previously achieved clinical 
benefit from platinum chemotherapy (C ohort 3). 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
3.1.1. Overview  
This is a multicenter, open -label, multi -arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
single agent niraparib in patients with locally advanced and metastatic sqNSCLC and of the 
combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor  in locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC (all 
histologies) patients.  
The multi -arm design will evaluate separate cohorts of diff erent cancer patients with enough 
statistical power to determine whether further examination may be warranted in the individual 
indications. A 2 -stage design will be used for all cohorts. In Stage 1, Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive 
niraparib plus the PD -1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, and Cohort 3 will receive niraparib alone. In 
Stage 2, Cohorts 1A and 2A will receive niraparib plus the PD -1 inhibitor TSR-042 
(dostarlimab) . (As of Amendment 2, following a cross -program review and decision to move 
forward with othe r studies, the Sponsor decided that Cohort 3 would close to further enrollment. 
As of Amendment 3, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 had completed  enrollment , Cohort 1A had closed 
after partial enrollment and Cohort 2A was not opened for enrollment.  In Amendment 3, OS  was 
removed as a secondary endpoint, following completion of the primary endpoint and Sponsor 
review of portfolio prioritization. ) Enrollment in Stage 2 must not be gin until the clinical study 
site has received the necessary approval of this amendment from the ethics committee of record 
for that site. Enrollment in Stage 2 will not be allowed under previous versions of the protocol.

at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of metastatic disease.  
Cohort 3: Locally advanced and metastatic sqNSCLC patients who have been previously  treated 
with both platinum and either PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor will receive single agent niraparib.  
Data from Stage 1 will be used to determine whether further enrollment of Stage 2 patients is 
necessary. The criteria for continuing Stage 2 enrollment are provided  in Statistical Analysis 
Section 9. 
3.1.2. General Study Conduct  
This study will consist of a Screening Period (Day -21 to Day -1), a Treatment Period, an End of 
Treatment (EOT) Period occurring within 7 days of the decision to discontinue treatment for any 
reason, a Safety Follow -up Visit occurring 30  + 7 days after the last dose of study medication, 
and a Follow -up Assessment Period occurring every 90 ± 14  days, which will continue until 
death or the end of study data collection (a minimum of 6 months after the enrollment of the last 
patient, provided that this allows the opportunity for completion of all 90 -day follow -up 
assessments).  
Following informed c onsent, all patients will undergo screening procedures within 21 days prior 
to the first dose of study treatment to determine eligibility for study entry. Screening procedures 
include medical, surgical, cancer, smoking, and medication history; complete phy sical 
examination, including vital signs, height, and weight; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status; clinical laboratory assessments (complete blood count [CBC], 
serum chemistry, and urinalysis); pregnancy test for women of childbear ing potential (a urine 
pregnancy test may be performed if the serum pregnancy result is not available before dosing); 
and electrocardiogram (ECG).  
Patients must have a baseline tumor assessment by computed tomography (CT, preferred 
method) or magnetic reso nance imaging (MRI, if clinically indicated) of the chest, abdomen, and 
other sites as clinically indicated, to determine extent of disease and confirm presence of 
measurable disease. If the patient has had appropriate imaging scans (eg, routine clinical 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 management) performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1/Day 1, then the results of those scans 
may be used if they are of diagnostic quality. Subsequent postbaseline tumor assessments will be 
done in locations with tumor lesions identified at baseline only, u nless clinically indicated. 
Response will be assessed as per RECIST v1.1 by  the Investigator.  
In Stage 1, patients will begin treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab (Cohorts 1 and 2) or 
niraparib monotherapy (Cohort 3) on Cycle 1/Day 1. In Stage 2, pa tients will begin treatment 
with niraparib and TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  (Cohorts 1A and 2A) on Cycle 1/Day 1. Patients 
enrolled during Stage 1 will continue with their original study treatment until discontinuation 
from treatment. Clinic visits will occur in each cycle (every 3  weeks ± 3 days). A dditional on -
treatment assessments will be conducted on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of all 
subsequent cycles. Safety assessments conducted throughout the Treatment Period include 
symptom-directed physical exa mination, vital signs, ECOG performance status, clinical 
laboratory assessments (CBC, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)  (Table 13 and Table 14). 
For follow -up tumor assessments, CT/MRI scans will be performed every 9 weeks ± 7 days from 
the date of first dose until Week 72, and every 12 weeks ± 7 days t hereafter for Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, 
and 2A. For sqNSCLC patients in Cohort 3, follow - up tumor assessment CT/MRI scans will be 
performed every 6 weeks ± 7 days from the date of first dose until Week 24, then every 
9 weeks ± 7 days until Week 52  (12 months ), and every 12 weeks ± 7 days until progression. 
The same modality (CT or MRI) should be used throughout the study for a given patient.  
Per RECIST v1.1, CR or PR should  be confirmed; tumor imaging for confirmation of response 
must be performed at the earliest 28 days after the first indication of response  but no later than 
35 days after the response . The subsequent scan after the confirmatory scan should be obtained 
per original schedule (9 weeks ± 7 days from confirmatory scan for  Cohorts 1, 1A, 2 and 2A, and  
6 weeks ± 7 days from confirmatory scan for Cohort 3). 
For Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A ( a PD-1 inhibitor and niraparib), patients with radiologic evidence 
of PD who are clinically stable may continue treatment at the Investigator ’s discretion while 
awaiting confirmatory tumor imaging. Repeat imaging should be performed at ≥ 4 weeks. If 
repeat imaging sho ws SD, PR, or CR, patients can continue study treatment at the Investigator’s 
discretion. In the event that PD is confirmed, pati ents still may continue to receive study 
treatment even after confirmed radiologic progression if the patient is clinically stable 
(Section 7.3.1.2) and the Investigator deems that the patient is deriving clinical benefit. This 
allowance to continue treatment despite radiologic progression takes into account the observation 
that some patients may have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of 
immunotherapy but with subsequent disease response. Before making a decision to continue 
treatment after radiological progression, the Investigator will discuss with the patient that this is 
not considered standard in the treatment of ca ncer and will discuss alternative treatment options 
including available approved therapies and other clinical trials. The Investigator will document 
this discussion in the source documents.  
For Cohort 3 (single agent niraparib), patients with radiologic ev idence of PD should be 
discontinued from treatment.  
Tumor assessment should occur according to study schedule regardless of whether study 
treatment is interrupted.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 If a patient discontinues treatment for a reason other than progression, death, withdrawal of 
consent, or lost to follow -up, scans should continue at the specified intervals ( ie, every 9 weeks 
for the first 72 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter for Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A; every 6  weeks 
for the first 24 weeks, every 9 weeks until Week 52  [12 months], and then every 12  weeks until 
progression for Cohort 3) until radiological progression is confirmed or until the start of 
subsequent anticancer treatment.  
Each patient will have an EOT assessment within 7 days of the decision to discontinue  treatment 
for any reason, a Safety Follow -up Visit occurring 30  + 7 days after the last dose of study drug, 
and a Follow -up Assessment every 90  ± 14 days, which will continue until death or the end of 
study data collection ( a minimum of 6  months after the enrollm ent of the last patient, provided 
that this allows the opportunity for completion of all 90 -day follow -up assessments).  
Blood samples will be collected prior to, during, and after treatment to evaluate PK of niraparib 
when given alone and in combination wi th a PD-1 inhibitor  in accordance with Section 7.4 and 
Section 8.1. Plasma samples will be collected from patients receiving single agent niraparib 
(Cohort 3), and serum and plasma will be collected from patients treated with the combination of 
niraparib and  pembrolizumab (Cohort s 1 and 2) or niraparib and TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  
(Cohorts 1A and 2A).  
Blood samples for the analysis of tumor -related circulating biomarkers such as circulating tumor 
cells (CTC) will be collected at Cycle 1/Day 1 predose. Blood sam ples for the analysis of 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be obtained at Screening, Cycle 2/Day 1 predose, as well 
as EOT. 
PD-L1 status must be available for patients in Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A. Local assessment of 
PD-L1 is acceptable on either archival  or fresh tissue (see Laboratory Manual for details on 
sample collection and management). PD -L1 status will be confirmed retrospectively in a central 
IHC laboratory using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved in vitro companion 
diagnostic indicated  as an aid in identifying NSCLC patients for treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor.  
An archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue is required for exploratory 
biomarker analysis and will be obtained during screening to confirm histology morphology , 
presence of tumor , and to conduct biomarker analysis. If archival tumor tissue is not available, a 
fresh biopsy is needed. Archival FFPE sample should be submitted within 30 days of patient’s 
first dose. ( For Cohort 3 only : if diagnosis was ma de by cytology and archival tissue is not 
available, patient will not need to provide tumor tissue).  
All patients will undergo an EOT assessment  within 7 days of the decision to discontinue  
treatment  for any reason  and a Safety Follow -up Visit occurring 30  + 7 days post -treatment. 
Thereafter, all patients will enter the post -Treatment Period for telephone assessment of survival 
status every 90  ± 14 days.  
Treatment with niraparib will continue until disease progression. Treatment with a PD-1 
inhibitor (pemb rolizumab or TSR-042 (dostarlimab) ) will continue for a maximum of 24  months 
in patients without disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
All AEs will be collected and recorded for each patient from the day of signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) u ntil 30 days after last study drug administration (Section  7.1.4); SAEs are 
required to be captured at least through 90  days after cessation of stud y treatment (or to a 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

pregnancies are to be captured through 180  days post -treatment (Section  7.1.6). Adverse events 
of special interest (AESIs), as well as study -drug-related SAEs, will be collected until study 
closeout or as otherwise indicated in Section  7.1.7 . AESIs must be reported as soon as the 
Investigator becomes aware of them. All AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient, irrespective of 
the suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, until abnormal 
laboratory values have returned to baseline or normalized, until stabilized and there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up, or until 
the patient has died.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

even if they withdraw from treatment.  
• Patient becomes pregnant  
• Sponsor decision to terminate study  
• Death 
• Confirmed CR in a patient who was treated for at least 24 weeks with study treatment 
and had at least 2 cycles of treatment beyond the date when the initial CR was 
declared 
Details of required niraparib dose modifications, including interruptions, dose reductions, and 
permanent discontinuations, related to toxicity, are provided in Section  6.3.1. 
Details of required pembrolizumab dose interruptions and permanent discontinuation related to 
toxicity are provided in Section  6.3.2. 
Details of required TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  dose modifications, including interruptions, dose 
reductions, and permanent discontinuations, related to toxicity, are provided in Section  6.3.3. 
Note: If a patient is required to be discontinued from one of the study medications in the 
combination, treatment with the other study medication may be continued per decision of the 
Investigator in consultation with Sponsor.  
Patients who discontinue from all study treatments will continue to receive follow -up 
assessments ( Table 13 and Table 14) as part of the study unless they are discontinued from the  
study (Section  4.3.2). 
4.3.2. Discontinuation from the Study  
Patients may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of co nsent by the patient, who is at any time free to discontinue their 
participation in the study

• Loss to follow -up 
• Sponsor decision to terminate study  
Patients who withdraw from study drug will be asked to continue the study visits and 
assessments as outlined in the schedule of procedures (Section  8, Table 13 and Table 14). If a 
patient is lost to follow -up, attempts should be made to contact the patient to determine the 
reason for discontinuation. For patients who are lost to follow -up, at least 3 documented 
attempts, including one via certified mail, should be made to contact the patient before 
considering the patient lost to follow -up. 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 4.3.3. Replacement of Patients  
If a patient discontinues study treatment due to withdrawal of consent prior to the first 
assessment of disease (either sche duled radiological assessment at 9 [Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A]  
or 6 weeks [Cohort 3] post-treatment  initiation), the patient may be replaced for the purposes of 
efficacy analysis after consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator. The analysis 
population will include all patients who received any study medication and did not withdraw 
consent prior to having at least 1 postbaseline tumor assessment.  
4.4. Patient Identification and Randomization  
4.4.1. Patient Identification  
All patients who enter into the Screening Period of the study (defined as the point at which the 
patient signs the ICF) will receive a unique patient identification number. This number will be 
used to identify the patient throughout the study and must be used on all study documentation 
related to that patient. A patient will be considered enrolled when the patient has been consented, 
screened, and all eligibility criteria have been confirmed in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF). The patient identification number must remain constant throughout  the entire study; it 
must not be changed at the time of enrollment.

 6. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
6.1. Study Drug  
6.1.1. Niraparib  
Niraparib ([ 3S]-3-[4-[7-(aminocarbonyl) -2H-indazol-2-yl] phenyl] piperidine [tosylate 
monohydrate salt]) is an orally available, potent, highly selective PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor. 
The excipients for niraparib are lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. Niraparib will be 
supplied as 100 -mg capsules.  
6.1.2. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype 
designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. 
Pembrolizumab for injection may be supplied as 50 -mg lyophilized powder single -use vials or 
100 mg/4 mL (25 mg/mL) solution in a single -dose vial.  
6.1.3. TSR-042 (Dostarlimab)  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  is a humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype that binds with high 
affinity to PD -1, resultin g in inhibition of binding to PD -L1 and PD -L2. TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  
for IV infusion is supplied as a solution of 160 mg (20  mg/mL) or 500 mg (50  mg/mL) in a 
single-dose vial.  
6.2. Administration  
6.2.1. Niraparib  
Niraparib will be supplied as 100 -mg capsules and will be administered PO QD continuously 
starting on Cycle 1/Day 1. The starting dose of 2 capsules of 100 -mg strength (200 mg/day) will 
be taken at each dose administration. Patients will be instructed to take their niraparib dose in the 
morning at approximatel y the same time each day, except for days when PK sampling will be 
performed. On these days, patients will be instructed to hold their niraparib dose until the 
pre-dose PK sample has been taken. Niraparib may be taken with or without food or water. 
Patients must swallow and not chew the capsules.  
For those patients experiencing nausea and who are at  Cycle 5 and beyond, bedtime 
administration may be a potential method for managing nausea. For those patients experiencing 
nausea who are not yet at Cycle 5, please seek approval from Medical Monitor to permit bedtime 
administration.  
On days where a PD-1 inhibitor is administered (Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A), niraparib will be 
administered upon completion of PD -1 inhibitor infusion on Day  1 of each cycle.  
Niraparib will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 of every cycle (every 21 days) thereafter until 
the patient discontinues study treatment. The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the 
packaging of niraparib and instructions for the administration of niraparib . 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 6.2.2. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab infusion will be administered before niraparib dose at the study site on Day 1 of 
each 21-day treatment cycle after all procedures and assessments have been completed as 
detailed in  Table 13 and Table 14. Pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3  days before or 
after the s cheduled Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 1 due to administrative reasons.  
Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg IV using a 30 -minute IV infusion. Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as pos sible. Given 
the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, however, a window between - 5 minutes and 
+ 10 minutes is permitted.  
Refer to USPI for specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion and 
administration of the infus ion solution.  
6.2.3. TSR-042 (Dostarlimab)  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  infusion will be administered before the niraparib dose at the study site 
on Day 1 of each 21 -day treatment cycle (Q3W) in Cycles 1 through 4 and on Day 1 of every 
other cycle (Q6W) thereafter , beginning on Cycle 5 Day 1  (ie, Cycle 5, Cycle 7, Cycle 9, etc.). 
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be administered after all procedures and assessments have been 
completed, unless otherwise indicated. TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  may be administered up to 3 days 
before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 1 due to administrative reasons.  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be administered at a dose of 500 mg IV Q3W in Cycles 1 through 4 
and at a dose of 1,000 mg IV Q6W, starting in Cycle 5, for the rest of the treatment using a 30 -
minute infusion. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 
minutes as possible. Given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, however, a window 
between - 5 minutes and +  15 minutes is pe rmitted. 
The Pharmacy Manual contains information for specific instructions for the preparation of the 
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  infusion and administration of the infusion solution.  
6.3. Dose Modification  
Study treatment dosing interruptions are permitted in the c ase of medical/surgical events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy (eg, surgery, unrelated medical events, patient 
vacation, or holidays). Patients should be placed back on study therapy within 28 days of the 
scheduled interruption, unless o therwise discussed with the Sponsor.   
All treatment interruptions and dose reductions (including any missed doses) and the reasons for 
the reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.3.1. Niraparib  
Dose interruption of niraparib may be implemented  at any time per the Investigator’s judgment. 
See the following sections for permitted duration of interruption prior to required discontinuation 
from treatment.  
Niraparib dose reduction will be allowed based on treatment side effects. Dose reductions to 
1 capsule daily (100 mg) will be allowed ( Table 5). No further dose reductions will be allowed. 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 The timing of efficacy or safety evaluations should not b e affected by dose interruptions or 
reductions.  
6.3.1.1. Niraparib Dose Modifications for Nonhematologic Toxicity  
Treatment with niraparib must be interrupted for any treatment -related nonhematologic Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 o r 4 event unless it is deemed by the 
Investigator to be pembrolizumab -related Table 7), in which case treatment with niraparib may 
continue without interruption. If toxicity is appropriately resolved to Grade 1 or less within 
28 days of interruption, the patient may restart tr eatment with niraparib with a dose level 
reduction according to Table 5 unless prophylaxis is considered feasible. If the event recurs at a 
similar or worse grade, treatment should be interrupted.  
If the toxicity requiring dose interruption has not resolved to CTCAE Grade 1 or less during a 
maximum 4 -week (28-day) dose interruption period, or the patient has already undergone a dose 
reduction (to a mini mum dose of 100 mg QD), or both, the patient must permanently discontinue 
treatment with niraparib. Once the dose of niraparib has been reduced, any re -escalation must be 
discussed with the Sponsor. Note that treatment with pembrolizumab may continue if 
discontinuation criteria as outlined in Section  6.3.2 have not been met.

Laboratory Abnormality  Intervention  
Weekly CBC is to be obtained for the first 4 weeks from the start of niraparib treatment, followed by 
assessment at least every 4 weeks for the first year. If niraparib requires a dosing hold or dose 
reduction, weekly CBC is to be performed for the 4 weeks  following restart of niraparib. If patients 
have not recovered within 28 days or have persistent cytopenia following dose modification, further 
investigation s including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics must be done in 
addition to mon thly monitoring, and consideration given as to whether to discontinue niraparib 
treatment.  
Platelet count <  100,000/μL   Niraparib must be interrupted until platelet count is 
≥ 100,000/μL with twice -weekly CBC monitored until recovery. 
After recovery, niraparib may then be resumed at same or 
reduced dose (Table 5); with monitoring of blood counts once 
weekly for 4 weeks. 
If nadir platelet count was <75,000/µL, resume niraparib at a 
reduced dose after recovery.  
Second occurrence of platelet 
count < 100,000/μL   Niraparib must be interrupted until platelet count is 
≥ 100,000/μL with twice -weekly CBCs monitored until 
recovery. Niraparib may then be resumed at a reduced dose 
(Table 5); after recovery, blood counts are monitored once 
weekly for 4 weeks to ensure the safety of the new dose level. 
(Dose not to be decreased below 100 mg daily) . Discontinue 
niraparib if the platelet count has not returned to acceptable 
levels wit hin 28 days of the dose interruption period, or if the 
patient has already undergone dose reduction to 100 mg once 
daily. 
Platelet count <  25,000/μL  Niraparib must be interrupted until platelet count is 
≥ 100,000/μL with twice -weekly CBCs monitored until 
recovery. Niraparib may then be resumed at a reduced dose 
(Table 5); after recovery, blood counts are monitored once 
weekly for 4 weeks to ensure the sa fety of the new dose level. 
Discontinue niraparib if the platelet count has not returned to 
acceptable levels within 28 days of the dose interruption period, 
or if the patient has already undergone dose reduction to 100 mg 
once daily.  
Neutrophil < 1,000/μL Niraparib must be interrupted until neutrophil counts are 
≥ 1,500/μL with twice -weekly CBCs monitored until recovery. 
Niraparib may then be resumed at a reduced dose ( Table 5); after 
recovery, blood counts once weekly for 4 weeks to ensure the 
safety of the new dose level. (Dose not to be decreased below 
100 mg daily)  
Hemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL  
 Niraparib must be interrupted until hemoglobin is ≥  9 g/dL with 
once- or twice-weekly CBCs monitored until recovery. Niraparib 
may then be resumed at a reduced dose ( Table 5); after recovery, 
blood counts once weekly for 4 weeks to ensure the safety of the

Hematologic adverse reaction 
requiring transfusion  For patients with platelet count ≤ 10,000/μL, prophylactic 
platelet transfusion per guidelines should be  considered.  60,61 If 
there are other risk factors such as coadministration of 
anticoagulation or antiplatelet dr ugs, consider interrupting these 
drugs and/or prophylactic transfusion at a higher platelet count.  
RBC transfusion is at the discretion of the Investigator  
Resume niraparib at a reduced dose (dose not to be decreased 
below 100 mg daily) . 
Confirmed diagnosis of 
MDS/AML  Permanently discontinue niraparib.  
Abbreviations: AML=acute myeloid leukemia; CBC = complete blood count ; MDS=myelodysplastic syndrome ; 
RBC=red blood cell. Note: If blood counts do not recover within 28 days to normal values (ie, plat elets 
≥ 100,000/μL, hemoglobin ≥  9g/dL, neutrophils ≥  1,500/μL) niraparib should be discontinued.  
If clinically indicated, use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) is allowed 
according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) gui delines.63 If clinically 
indicated, red blood cell transfusions are allowed according to institutional guidelines.  
If the hematologic toxicity does not recover to the specified level within 4 wee ks (28 days) of 
dose interruption and/or the patient has already undergone 1 dose reduction (to a minimum dose 
of 100 mg QD), then niraparib should be discontinued.  
Any patient requiring transfusion of platelets or red blood cells (1 or more units) or 
hematopoietic growth factor support may undergo a niraparib dose reduction upon recovery if 
study treatment is resumed.  
Once the dose of study treatment has been reduced, any re -escalation must be discussed with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee.  
It is strongly recommended that the patient be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation 
(1) if transfusions are required on more than 1 occasion or (2) if the treatment -related 
hematologic toxicities have not recovered to CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 within 4 week s. If a diagnosis of 
MDS/AML is confirmed by a hematologist, the patient must permanently discontinue niraparib.  
Note that treatment with pembrolizumab may continue following discussion with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor or designee if discontinuation cri teria as outlined in Section  6.3.2 have not been 
met. 
The reason for interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of niraparib should be recorded in the 
eCRF. 
6.3.1.3. Niraparib Dose Escalation  
Niraparib dose may be escalated on or after Cycle 3/Day 1 from 200 mg daily (2 capsules) to

 6.3.1.4. Niraparib Extended Treatment  
Those patients deemed to derive clinical benefit from niraparib monotherapy treatment at the 
time of final analysis and who are no longer receiving their study -assigned PD-1 inhibitor will 
have the option to continue treatment with niraparib through the extension “rollover” protocol, if 
available, and at the discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor .  
Eligibility  to receive continued nirapa rib treatment through the extension “rollover” protocol will 
be at the discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor and will follow review of the enrolling 
study’s inclusion criteria and completion of the required screening assessments. Continued 
treatment in the study will be based on documented evidence of clinical benefit determined by 
local standard of care disease assessment frequency.  
6.3.2. Pembrolizumab  
AEs (both nonserious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an 
immunologic eti ology. These AEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after 
the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must  be withheld for drug -related toxicities and severe 
or life-threatening AEs per  Table 7. See also Section  7.1.7.  
Table 7 provides detailed information for dose interruptions and discontinuations rel ated to 
toxicity for pembrolizumab. No dose reductions of pembrolizumab are permitted. Note that 
treatment with niraparib may continue following discussion with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
or designee if discontinuation criteria as outlined in Section  6.3.1 have not been met.  
The reason for interruption or discontinuation of pembrolizumab should be recorded in the

AEs (both nonserious and serious) associated with TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology. These AEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several 
months after the last dose of treatment.  
In general, TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  must be withheld for drug -related Grade 3 toxicities, as well 
as for certain immune related adverse events of interest (irAEIs), but may be resumed upon 
recovery to Grade  ≤1; TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be permanently discontinued for any drug -
related Grad e 4 AE. TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  must be permanently discontinued for certain irAEIs 
as described in Table 8. This guideline does not include a complete l ist of all irAEs associated 
with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The recent joint ASCO and NCCN guideline for

In addition to the irAEs listed in Table 8, treatment with dostarlimab may be associated with 
other irAEs, including events that may be less commonly associated with PD -1 or PD-L1 
inhibitors but can similarly result fr om activation of cellular immune response (eg, pancreatitis). 
For these events, the general guidance from ASCO/NCCN should be considered. Patients should 
receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating Investigator, 
including but not limited to the items outlined below:  
• In general, treatment can continue with close monitoring for Grade 1 toxicities.  
• Withhold treatment for most Grade 2 toxicities and consider resuming when 
symptoms and/or laboratory values revert to Grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids (initial 
dose 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) must be administered.  
• Withhold treatment for Grade 3 toxicities and initiate high -dose corticosteroids 
(prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone IV 1 to 2 mg/kg /day). 
Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4 to 6 weeks. If 
symptoms do not improve within 48 to 72 hours of high -dose corticosteroids, 
infliximab may be offered for some toxicities.  It is highly recommended that 
Investigators dis cuss any AEs with the Sponsor prior to using infliximab . 
• When symptoms and/or laboratory values revert to Grade 1 or less, rechallenging 
with immunotherapy may be offered, however caution is advised, especially in 
patients with early -onset immune -mediated events. Dose adjustments are not 
recommended.  
6.4. Study Drug Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Niraparib 100 -mg capsules may be packed in high -density polyethylene bottles with child -
resistant closures or in blister cards.  
Pembrolizumab is obtained from commer cial sources according to local practice standards, and it 
is provided as a commercially available dosage formulation. Pembrolizumab is an approved 
treatment for Cohort 1; it is expected that pembrolizumab will be supplied as standard of care for 
this cohort. Please refer to pembrolizumab USPI for instructions and precautions regarding 
preparation.  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  for injection is supplied in vials containing either 160 mg at a 
concentration of 20  mg/mL or 500 mg at a concentration of 50 mg/mL.  
The label text of the study treatments will comply with Good Manufacturing Practice and 
national legislation to meet the requirements of the participating countries. The study treatment 
will be open -label and nonpatient -specific. 
All study treatment supplies mus t be stored in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual 
instructions and package labeling. Until dispensed or administered to the patients, the study 
treatment will be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized personnel only.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Confidential  Page 68 of 132 6.5. Study Drug Account ability 
The Investigator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate dispensing records of the 
study treatments throughout the clinical study. Study drug accountability should be maintained 
by each site based on capsules dispensed vs. returned to t he clinic at each visit and the number 
days since last visit.  
Details of maintaining drug accountability, including information on the accountability log, will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
All dispensation and accountability records will be available for Sponsor review. The Study 
Monitor will assume the responsibility to reconcile the study treatment accountability log. The 
pharmacist will dispense study treatment for each patient according to the protocol and 
Pharmacy Manual, if applicable.  
6.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
At the end of study, when all patients have stopped protocol treatment, complete drug 
reconciliation per batch should be available at the site for verification in order to allow drug 
destruction or return procedure. After r eceiving Sponsor approval in writing, the investigational 
site is responsible for destruction of study drug according to local regulations. If a site does not 
have the capability for on -site destruction, the Sponsor will provide a return for destruction 
service to a third party. Both the unused and expired study medication must be destroyed, upon 
authorization of the Sponsor, according to local regulations and procedures, and a copy of the 
destruction form must be filed in the study binder.  
The drug provide d for this study is to be used only as indicated in this protocol and only for the 
patients entered in this study.  
6.7. Previous and Concomitant Medications  
Any medication the patient takes during the study other than the study treatments, including 
herbal and other nontraditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication. All 
concomitant medications must be recorded in the eCRF. The following information must be 
recorded in the eCRF for each concomitant medication: generic name, route of administration, 
start date, stop date, dosage, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a 
concomitant medication must be recorded in the eCRF.  
At screening, patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the last 30  days. At 
each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked what concomitant medications they are 
currently taking or have taken since the previous visit.  
Niraparib weakly induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in vitro and is an insensitive substrate 
for P-glycoprotein; therefore, in vestigators should be advised to use caution with drugs that are 
sensitive substrates for CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic range, ie, theophylline and tizanidine.  
The niraparib safety profile includes risk for thrombocytopenia; therefore, the Investigators  
should be advised to use caution with anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs ( Table 6). 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the screening and treatment 
phase of this study:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Chemotherapy or immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than niraparib, pembrolizum ab, or TSR-042 
(dostarlimab)  
• Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A only: Live vaccines within 30  days prior to the first dose of 
study treatment and while participating in the study. Examples of live vaccines 
include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mum ps, rubella, chicken pox, 
yellow fever, rabies, Bacille Calmette -Guerin, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal 
influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed. 
However, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, Flu -Mist) are li ve attenuated vaccines 
and therefore are not allowed.  
• Prophylactic cytokines (G -CSF) should not be administered in the first cycle of the 
study but may be administered in subsequent cycles according to current ASCO 
guidelines.63  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to manage symptoms of 
suspected irAEIs. (Note: Use of inhaled steroids, l ocal injection of steroids, topical 
steroids, and steroid eye drops are allowed.) If medically deemed necessary (eg, acute 
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, prophylaxis for IV 
contrast if indicated), Investigators are allowed to  use their judgment to treat patients 
with systemic steroids. In such cases, systemic steroids should be stopped at least 
24 hours prior to the next dose of TSR-042 (dostarlimab) . 
If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specific ally prohibited during 
the study, discontinuation from study therapy may be required. The Investigator should discuss 
any questions regarding this with the Sponsor. The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the Investigator and /or the patient’s primary physician. The decision to 
continue the patient on study therapy, however, requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the patient.  
6.7.2. Radiation Therapy  
Radiation therapy to pre -existing small areas of painful  metastases that cannot be managed with 
local or systemic analgesics is allowed as long as no evidence of disease progression is present. 
The patient must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.  
6.7.3. Contraception  
Pembrolizumab, TSR-042 (dostarlimab), and niraparib are known to have properties that require 
the patient to use contraception. For details on niraparib and TSR-042 (dostarlimab) , please refer 
to the respective IBs.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

pembrolizumab and niraparib have transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm. 
Therefore, nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding women may only be enrolled if they are willing to use 
2 highly effective contraception methods or ar e considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly 
unlikely to conceive is defined as (1) surgically sterilized; (2) postmenopausal (a woman who is 
≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for >  1 year will be considered postmenopausal); 
(3) amenorrheic for < 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation; or 
(4) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study. Female patients should start using 
birth control from screening throughout the study period up to 180  days after the last dose of 
study treatment ( Table 9). See Appendix  D for a list of acceptable contraceptive methods.   
Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient.  
Male patients must use an adequate met hod of contraception and not donate sperm starting with 
the first dose of study treatment through 120  days after the last dose of study treatment ( Table 9).

6.7.4. Rescue Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines During Treatment with 
Pembrolizumab  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed nec essary by the treating 
Investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential 
immunologic etiology are outlined below. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be 
necessary, as symptoms may worsen when the steroi d dose is decreased. For each disorder, 
attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral 
infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended 
to be applied when th e Investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: it may be necessary to perform additional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
The following text details specific guidance by type of AE.  
• Pneumonitis:  
− For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks. 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000-02-001, Amendment 3, Version 4.0   
Confidential  Page 71 of 132 − For Grade 3 to 4 events, immediately treat with  IV steroids. Administer additional 
anti-inflammatory measures, as needed.  
− Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration.  
• Diarrhea/Colitis:  
− Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and sym ptoms of enterocolitis 
(such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, and with or without 
fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
• All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher 
diarrhea, consider gastrointestinal consultation and endoscopy to confirm or 
rule out colitis.  
• For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
• For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists >  1 week, treat with IV steroids 
followed by high -dose oral steroids.  
• When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less,  steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis) or 
≥ Grade 3 hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic 
acidosis: 
− For Type 1 diabetes  mellitus or Grade 3 to 4 hyperglycemia  
• Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and 
for Grade 3 to 4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or 
ketonuria.  
• Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel,  urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
• Hypophysitis:  
− For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks. Replacement of appropr iate hormones may be required as the steroid 
dose is tapered.  
− For Grade 3 to 4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed 
by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continue d over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Confidential  Page 72 of 132 • Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism:  
− Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for 
changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during 
treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and 
symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
• Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 to 4 hypothyroidism):  
− In hyperthyroidism, nonsel ective beta -blockers (eg, propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
− In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of care.  
• Grade 3 to 4 hyperthyroidism  
− Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by oral 
corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hepatic: 
− For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
− Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids.  
− For Grade 3 to 4 events, treat with IV corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
− When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Renal failure or nephritis:  
− For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
− For Grade 3 to 4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
− When symptoms i mprove to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Uveitis: 
− Symptomatic (any grade):  Hold treatment and consult ophthalmologist for

6.7.5. Rescue Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines During Treatment with 
TSR-042 (Dostarlimab)  
During treatment with TSR-042 (dostarlimab) , patients should receive appropriate supportive 
care measures for AEs as deemed necessary by the treating Investigator, including but not 
limited to the items outlined below. Prophylactic cytokines ( eg, G-CSF) should not be 
administered in the first cycle of the study but may be administered in subsequent cycles 
according to current ASCO guidelines.65 Note: It may be necessary to perform additional 
procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of the evaluation of 
the AE. The following sections detail specific guidance by type of AE.  
• Pneumonitis  
− Treat with systemic corticoster oids, oral for Grade 2 (eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent) and IV for Grade 3 or 4 (eg, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent).  
− Administer additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
− Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve  to Grade ≤1 over ≥4  weeks. 
− If Grade 2 and no improvement or worsening over 2 weeks, treat as Grade 3 or 4.  
− Consider prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration.  
• Diarrhea/Colitis  
− Monitor carefully f or signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
− All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink  liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  
− For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists >3 days, administer oral corticosteroids 
(eg, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/da y of prednisone or equivalent). If symptoms persist or 
worsen with steroids, treat as Grade 3 or 4.  
− For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists >3 days, treat with IV steroids 
(eg, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) followed by high -dose oral 
steroids. 
− Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4  weeks. 
• Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus or Grade 3 or 4 Hyperglycemia  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

time durin g treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the 
start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical 
evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
− Grade 2 HYPERthyroidism: Consi der nonselec tive beta-blockers 
(eg, propranolol) as initial therapy.  
− Grade 3 or 4 HYPERthyroidism: Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by oral corticosteroids (eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). 
Taper corticosteroids  when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4  weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
− Grade 2 to 4 HYPOthyroidism: Thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyronine, is indicated per sta ndard of care.

7.1. Safety Endpoints  
Safety parameters evaluated during this study will include AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, 
clinical laboratory values (CBC, serum chemistry,  thyroid function [Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A 
only], and urinalysis), vital signs, ECGs, physical examination findin gs, and use of concomitant 
medications.  
All safety parameters will be performed in accordance with the schedules of events presented in 
each cohort -specific supplement.  
7.1.1. Definitions  
7.1.1.1. Adverse event (AE)  
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavora ble 
and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the product.  
AEs may include the onset of ne w illness and the exacerbation of pre -existing medical 
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
Disease progression will n ot be recorded as an AE.  
7.1.1.2. Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
− Note: This means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time o f the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
− Any AE that prolongs hospitalization will be considered an SAE.  
− Exception: Preplanned hospitalization (eg, for observation, protocol compliance, 
elective procedures, social reasons) will not be considered an SAE; however, the 
reason for the planned hospitalization should be captured in medical history 
section in the eCRF. Co mplications experienced during these hospitalizations 
must be reported as AEs.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000-02-001, Amendment 3, Version 4.0   
Confidential  Page 79 of 132 • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event(s)  
− Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in determining whether 
situations or events should be considered SAEs. An important medical event may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the patient or require intervention to prevent one  of the above 
outcomes. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. See 
Section 7.1.6.1 for information about SAE reporting.  
7.1.1.3. Treatment -emergent adverse event  
A TEAE is any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event 
already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study 
treatment.   
7.1.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction is a serious adve rse reaction, the nature and 
severity of which are not consistent with the information about the medicinal product set out in 
the Investigator’s Brochure, Reference Safety Information section.  
7.1.2.1. Adverse event of special interest  
Any AE (serious or non -serious) that is of scientific and medical concern specific to the study 
treatment, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the 
Sponsor is appropriate.  The AESIs for niraparib are MDS, AML, and second primary cancers 
(new malignancies other than MDS/AML).  
To date, n o AESIs have been identified for TSR-042 (dostarlimab) . 
7.1.2.2. Special Situations: Abuse, Misuse, Medication Errors, Overdose, and Accidental 
or Occupational Exposure:  
• Abuse: is the persistent or sporadic, intentional ex cessive use of the study treatment, 
which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects.  
• Misuse: medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance 
with the authorized/approved product information.  
• Medication error:  is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate 
study treatment use or patient harm while the study treatment is in the control of the 
health care professionals or patients. Such incident may be due to health care 
professional practice , product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for 
administration, and systems, including the following: prescribing, order 
communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, 
administration, education, monitoring, and use.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000-02-001, Amendment 3, Version 4.0   
Confidential  Page 80 of 132 • Overdose: is a deliberate or accidental administration of study treatment to a study 
patient at a dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per the study 
protocol and under the direction of the Investigator.  
• Accidental/Occupational exposure:  is the unintentional exposure to a study 
treatment as a result of one’s professional or nonprofessional occupation, or 
accidental exposure to a nonprofessional to whom exposure was not intended (ie, 
study product given to wrong patient).  
See Section  7.1.12.1 for information about special situations reporting.  
7.1.3. Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigator with regard to intensity and causality with regard to 
study treatment as outlined in the following sections.  
7.1.3.1. Expectedness  
Expectedness (whether an AE is “expected” or “unexpected”) will be determined by the Sponsor. 
An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, seve rity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the risk information provided in the Reference Safety Information for niraparib 
and TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  in the respective IBs and for pembrolizumab in the USPI.  
7.1.3.2. Intensity  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to CTCAE. In general, CTCAE (v4.03) 
severity grades are:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated; easily tolerated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). (Instrumental ADL 
refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, or 
managing money.)  
• Grade 3: Severe or medica lly significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL. (Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, 
using the toilet, taking medicati ons, and not bedridden.)  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
A distinction should be made between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by th e criteria above in Section  7.1.1. For example, a mild degree 
of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalization for monitoring purp oses may 
be considered an SAE but is not necessarily severe. Similarly, an AE that is severe in intensity is 
not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe in intensity but may 
not be considered an SAE.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Clinical Study Protocol 3000-02-001, Amendment 3, Version 4.0   
Confidential  Page 81 of 132 7.1.3.3. Causality  
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE. One of 
the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the 
definitions and all contributing factors:  
• Definitely related : A clinical event, includin g laboratory test abnormality, that occurs 
in a plausible time relationship to treatment administration and that concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the 
treatment should be clinically plausible.  
• Possibly related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
• Unlikely related : A clinical event, incl uding laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration that makes a causal relationship 
improbable, or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide likely 
explanations.  
• Unrelated : A clinical event, incl uding laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typically explained by 
extraneous factors (eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or 
chemicals).  
7.1.4. Collecting and Recording Adve rse Events  
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification (eg, physical examination, laboratory 
assessment, ECG, reported by patient), must be documented in the eCRF.  
All AEs, SAEs, and drug -related SAEs will be collected and recorded in the eCRF for each 
patient from the day of signed informed consent until the time points outlined in  Table 12. All 
AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient, irrespectiv e of the suspected causality, will be 
monitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to 
baseline or normal levels, until the event has stabilized and there is a satisfactory explanation for 
the changes observed, un til the patient is lost to follow -up, or until the patient has died.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; SAE = serious adverse event; AESI = adverse event of special interest.  
Note: Collection and reporting will begin on the day of informed consent.  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the specified follow -up period post -treatment 
discontinuation and considers the SAE related to investigational product, the Investigator sh ould 
report the SAE to the Sponsor according to timelines for reporting SAEs described in this 
section. 
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by the study patient, or discovered by the study staff 
during physical examinations or by asking an open, nonleadin g question such as, “How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?” The Investigator will document the nature of AE, date 
of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (and time, if known), 
severity of the AE, action taken with study drug as a result of the AE, assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to study drug and/or 
study procedure.  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in th e 
opinion of the Investigator, the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, disease, or 
syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than 
each individual symptom.  
Concomitant illnesses that existed be fore entry into the study will not be considered an AE 
unless the illness worsens during the Treatment Period. Pre -existing conditions will be recorded 
in the eCRF as well as on the SAE Report Form medical history section.  
7.1.5. Reporting Disease Progression  
The event of disease progression is an efficacy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE. 
Disease progression should be reported within the eCRF. If AEs/SAEs occur in relation to 
disease progression, the AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting r equirements 
described in Section  7.1.4 and Section  7.1.6. 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Confidential  Page 83 of 132 7.1.6. Serious Adverse Events  
7.1.6.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report all SAEs and all follow -up information to the Sponsor on an SAE 
Report Form within 24  hours of becoming aware of the initial event or follow -up informati on. 
The Investigator must provide a causality assessment and must sign and date all SAE Report 
Forms. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review source document and describe pertinent 
information on the SAE Report Form. If supporting documentation is requested (eg, hospital 
reports, consultant reports, death certificates, and autopsy reports), the Investigator should 
highlight all relevant and pertinent information within such documents, ensure that any patient’s 
personal identifiers (including medical record number) are removed, and submit the documents 
with the SAE Report Form to the Sponso r. The Sponsor (or designee) will return a confirmation 
of receipt of all email reports (if received from other than a “no reply” dom ain) within 1 business 
day.  
After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, if 
necessary, contact the Investigator to obtain further information. The Investigator must promptly 
respond to queries from the Sp onsor. 
7.1.6.2. Submission and Distribution of Serious Adverse Events  
Per regulatory requirements, if an event is assessed by the Sponsor as a suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), it is the responsibility of the Sponsor to submit the SUSAR to 
regulatory authorities according to applicable regulations. In addition, the SUSAR will be 
distributed to the Investigators/sites, utilizing a Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences report form or the MedWatch 3500A form. The Investigator/ site will submit a 
copy of the report to their respective Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) as per the governing institutional requirements and in compliance with local 
laws and guidelines.  
7.1.7. Adverse Events of Special Int erest 
Selected nonserious AEs and SAEs are also known as AESI and must be recorded as such on the 
eCRF and reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor as soon as the Investigator becomes aware of 
them, as noted for SAEs in Section 7.1.6.1. 
In conjunction with the survival assessment, AESI (regardless of causality) and study -drug 
related SAEs will be collected until study closeout ( Table 12, Section 7.1.4 and Section 8.2.6). 
AESIs for niraparib  and pembrolizumab, are outlined in Section  7.1.7.1 and Section 7.1.7.2,

elevated AST or ALT value that is ≥  3 × ULN concurrent with an elevated  total bilirubin value 
that is ≥ 2 × ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase value that is < 2 × ULN, as 
determined by protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.  
Note: These criteria are based upon Hy’s law and avai lable regulatory guidance documents.66 
The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study site guidance for assessment and 
follow-up of these criteria can be found in the Investigato r Trial File Binder (or equivalent).  
7.1.8. Hypertension, Including Hypertensive Crisis  
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of niraparib. 
Preexisting hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting niraparib tr eatment. 
While receiving treatment, hypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive 
medicinal products with or without niraparib dose adjustment.  
BP and heart rate should be monitored at least weekly for the first 2 months of niraparib 
treatment in the maintenance setting, then monthly for the first year and periodically thereafter 
during treatment with niraparib. Niraparib should be discontinued in case of hypertensive crisis 
or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately  controlled with antihypertensive 
therapy. 
7.1.9. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  
There have been rare reports of niraparib -treated patients developing signs and symptoms that 
are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare 
neurologic disorder that can present with the following signs and symptoms  including seizures, 
headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without 
associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, 
preferably MRI. In patients developing PRES, treatment of specific symptoms including control 
of hypertension is recommended, along with discontinuation of niraparib. The safety of 
reinitiating niraparib therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known.  
7.1.10. Allergic Reaction  
Niraparib capsules contain ta rtrazine, which may cause allergic -type reactions . 
7.1.11. Lifestyle Considerations  
Cases of photosensitivity have been reported for patients on niraparib treatment. Participants 
must be informed on measures to decrease exposure to ultraviolet light, such as mini mizing time 
in direct sunlight unless wearing hats and long -sleeves and application of sun protection creams.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Confidential  Page 85 of 132 7.1.12. Protocol-defined Overdose  
A niraparib overdose is defined as a deliberate or accidental administration of study treatment to 
a study patient, at a  dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per the study 
protocol and under the direction of the Investigator.   
An overdose of pembrolizumab is defined, for this study, as a dose ≥  1,000 mg (5 times the 
dose). No specific information is av ailable on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In 
the event of overdose, the patient should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
For fixed doses, an overdose of TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  is defined as any dose that is ≥  20% than 
1000 mg Q6W.  
7.1.12.1. Reporting of Overdoses and Special Situations  
All occurrences of abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, and accidental or occupational 
exposure with any study treatment must be r eported on a Special Situations Report Form  to the 
Sponsor within 5 calendar days of becoming aware of the occurrence, regardless of whether it is 
categorized as an AE. If the occurrence is associated with an SAE, an SAE Report Form , along 
with the Special Situations Report Form , must be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
awareness.  
7.1.13. Pregnancy Reporting and Follow -up 
Pregnancies occurring in patients enrolled in a study or in a female partner of a male patient must 
be reported and followed to outco me. If a female patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while 
on study treatment, the patient will immediately be removed from the study. Any pregnancies of 
female study patients and partners of male study patient that occur within 180 days following the 
last dose of study treatment must be captured in the eCRF ( Table 12). 
The Investigator should complete the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and  forward it to 
the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy. If there is an 
associated serious outcome, then both the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and SAE 
Report Form should be completed.  
The site will follow -up with the patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until 
the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The Investigator will make every effort to 
obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus  or 
newborn to the Sponsor. The Pregnancy Outcome report form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy 
outcome. If an SAE occurred, then the SAE Report Form must be completed and  submitted as 
well. 
In the event the pregnancy outcome occurs following the end of the study and database lock, the 
Investigator will report the pregnancy outcome to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours after 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known to t he Investigator in accordance with the procedure for 
reporting SAEs (Section  7.1.6.1). 
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a possibility that the study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Elective abortions witho ut 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

be reported to the Sponsor. Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not 
be considered an SAE. Pregnancy is not considered an SAE unless  there is an associated serious 
outcome. Spontaneous abortions should always be reported as SAEs.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE Report Form (eg, maternal 
serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, sti llbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, and birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance with the 
procedure for reporting SAEs.  
The Pregnancy Notification form, the Pregnancy Outcome form, and any related SAE Report 
Forms must be reported to the Sponsor as outlined for SAEs in Section 7.1.6. 
7.1.14. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following laboratory variables will be determined in accor dance with the schedule of events 
(Table 13 and Table 14). These tests will be performed by the local laboratory at the clinical site.

triiodothyronine  (FT3), and free thyroxine  (FT4) (Applies only to Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, 
and 2A) 
• Serum pregnancy testing  (a urine pregnancy test may be performed if the serum 
pregnancy result is not available before dosing)  
Any laboratory values assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE. If SAE 
criteria are met or the laboratory abnormality is an AESI ( Section 7.1.7), the event should be 
recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting process (Section  7.1.6). 
Hematological testing may occur more frequently than is specified in Table 13 and Table 14 
when additional testing is medically indicated per Investigator judgment or if the event meets the 
criteria for niraparib dose modification  (Section 6.3.1). Additional tests may be performed at a 
laboratory facility other than the study site, but test results must be reported to the stud y site, the 
study site must keep a copy of test results with the patient’s study file, and the results must be 
entered into the eCRF.  
It is strongly recommended that any suspected MDS/AML case reported while a patient is 
receiving treatment or followed for  post-treatment assessments be referred to a local 
hematologist, who must perform bone marrow aspirate and biopsy testing. A whole blood 
sample will also be collected for cytogenetic analysis (mutations of select myeloid -associated 
genes). Testing complete d as part of standard of care is sufficient as long as the methods are 
acceptable to the Sponsor's Medical Monitor or designee. The study site must receive a copy of 
the hematologist's report of aspirate/biopsy findings, which must include a classification  
according to World Health Organization (WHO)67 and other sample testing reports related to 
MDS/AML. Report data will be entered in the appropriate eCRF pages and the site must keep a 
copy of all reports with the patient’s study file. The hematologist’s report should also be reported 
with the MDS/AML SAE Report Form and specialized questionnaire within 24 hours of 
becoming aware per Section  7.1.6. 
Further details on sample collection and analysis can be found in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.1.15. Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations, including height (screening only), weight , and vital signs (blood pressure 
[BP], pulse, and temperature), will be performed in accordance with the schedule of events 
(Table 13 and Table 14). 
Any physical examination or vital signs assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as 
an AE or SAE. If SAE criteria are met or the abnormality  is an AESI (Section  7.1.7), the event 
should be recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting process (Section  7.1.6). 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale (see  Appendix  B) in accordance with 
the schedule of events ( Table 13 and Table 14). The same observer should assess performance 
status each time.  
7.1.17. Additional Safety Assessments  
All patients will undergo ECGs in accordance with the schedule of events ( Table 13 and 
Table 14). Patients will be supine a nd rested for approximately 2 minutes before ECGs are 
recorded. 
Any ECG findings assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE. If SAE criteria 
are met the event should be recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting process 
(Section 7.1.6). 
7.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics consist of those variables that are assessed at 
screening/baseline.  
7.2.1. Patient Eligibility  
Compliance with i nclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed as outlined in Section  4.1 and 
Section 4.2. 
7.2.2. Patient Demography  
Patient demography consists of age at screening, race, ethnicity, smoking status (nonsmoker, 
former smoker, and current smoker), and sex.  
7.2.3. Disease History

7.2.4. Medical and Surgical History  
Major medical and surgical history (including medication history), including history of 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, or anemia will be collected. Details of any prior 
invasive malignancy will be collected. Medica l and surgical history will be obtained by 
interviewing the patient or by reviewing the patient’s medical records.  
7.2.5. Previous and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Previous and concomitant medication will be documented as described in Section  6.7. 
Medications will be coded using the most up -to-date version of the WHO Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical classification.  
All concomitant procedures (includ ing transfusions) will be recorded from the time of the first 
dose of any study drug through the Safety Follow -up Visit (30 + 7 days after the last dose of 
study drug).  
7.3. Clinical Activity Endpoints  
7.3.1. Evaluation of Tumor Response  
7.3.1.1. Overview  
The efficacy of single agent niraparib as well as the combination treatment of niraparib and a 
PD-1 inhibitor will be evaluated by assessment of tumor response to treatment according to 
RECIST v1.168 per Investigator assessment ( Appendix  C).  
Response to treatment will be based on Investigator evaluation of radiographic images. All 
radiographic images/scans at the time points specified in  Table 13 and Table 14 as well as any 
unscheduled images/scans should be archived by  the study sites for potential future evaluation.  
Tumor imaging (chest, abdomen, and other sites as clinically indicated ) should be performed by 
CT (preferred). MRI should only be used when CT is contraindicated and preferably for imaging 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

Confidential  Page 90 of 132 of the brain, but  the same imaging technique should be used in a patient throughout the study. 
CT scan is the more commonly used modality and is preferred for the majority of patients. An 
MRI can be utilized if clinically appropriate. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT may be 
used according to RECIST guidelines ( Appendix  C) and as clinically indicated.  
7.3.1.2. Timing of Radiographic Evaluations  
All patients will undergo se rial radiographic evaluation to assess tumor response. Initial tumor 
imaging at screening must be performed within 21 days prior to the date of the first dose of study 
treatment . Scans performed prior to the signing of the ICF as part of routine clinical m anagement 
are acceptable for use as initial tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality and performed 
within 28 days prior to first dose date.  
For patients in Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A, the first on -study imaging tumor assessment should be 
performed 9 w eeks (63 ± 7 days) after the first dose of study treatment. Subsequent tumor 
imaging will be performed every 9  weeks (63 ± 7 days) until Week 72, or more frequently if 
clinically indicated. After Week 72, patients should have imaging performed every 12 wee ks 
(84 ± 7 days) until progression (Section  8). 
For sqNSCLC patients in Cohort 3, the first on -study imaging tumor assessment should be 
performed 6 w eeks (42 ± 7 days) after the first dose of study treatment. Subsequent tumor 
imaging will be performed every 6  weeks (42 ± 7 days) until Week 24 (6 months), or more 
frequently if clinically indicated. After Week 24, patients should have imaging performed e very 
9 weeks (63 ± 7 days) until Week 52 (12 months) and then every 12 weeks (84 ± 7 days) until 
progression (Section  8).  
Imaging should not be delayed for delays in cycle starts or extension of combination treatment 
cycle intervals.  
Per RECIST v1.1 (see  Appendix  C), CR or PR should be confir med by a repeat tumor imaging 
assessment. The tumor imaging for confirmation of response m ust be performed at the earliest 
28 days after the first indication of response  but no later than 35 days after the response . The 
subsequent scan after the confirmato ry scan should be obtained per original schedule (9 weeks 
± 7 days from confirmatory scan for Cohorts 1, 1A, 2 , and 2A, and 6 weeks ± 7 days from 
confirmatory scan for Cohort 3). 
Continue to perform imaging until whichever of the following occurs:  
• Withdraw al of consent  
• Death 
• End of the study ( when responder or discontinuation status for all patients is known ) 
For Cohorts 1, 1A, 2, and 2A: In patients who have initial evidence of radiological PD, it is at the 
discretion of the treating physician whether to continue a patient on study treatment. This clinical 
judgment decision should be based on the patient’s overall clinical condition, including 
performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data. Patients may receive study treatment 
if they are clini cally stable as defined by the following criteria:  
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of 
disease (including worsening of laboratory values)  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000-02-001, Amendment 3, Version 4.0   
Confidential  Page 91 of 132 • No decline in ECOG performance status  
• Absence of rapid progression of disea se 
• Progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent 
alternative medical intervention  
When feasible, patients should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed by repeat 
imaging. In addition, patients may contin ue to receive study treatment even after confirmed 
radiologic progression if all the above conditions continue to be met and the Investigator deems 
that the patient is deriving clinical benefit. This allowance to continue treatment despite 
radiologic progression takes into account the observation that some patients can have a transient 
tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherapy but with subsequent disease 
response. Patients who are deemed clinically unstable are not required to hav e repeat imaging for 
confirmation of PD.  
For Cohort 3 (single agent niraparib), patients with radiologic evidence of PD should be 
discontinued from treatment.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than PD will continue post -treatment 
imaging studies for disease status follow -up at the same frequency as already followed, eg, every 
6, 9 or 12 weeks ± 7 days depending on the length of treatment with the study combination 
drugs, until disease progression, start of a nonstudy anticancer trea tment, withdrawal of consent 
to study participation, becoming lost to follow -up, death, or end of the study.  
All radiographic images/scans should be archived for potential future evaluation.  
7.3.1.3. Assessment of Response by RECIST  
RECIST v1.1 will be used by the Investigator as the primary measure for assessment of tumor 
response, date of disease progression, and as a basis for all protocol guidelines related to disease 
status. Details on RECIST v1.1, including evaluation of target and nontarget lesions and 
definitions of response are provided in  Appendix  C. 
7.3.2. Efficacy Endpoints  
7.3.2.1. Objective Response Rate  
The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed 
best overall response of CR or PR in the analysis population. Tumor assessments after the 
initiation of further anticancer therapy are excluded for the assessment of best overall response.  
7.3.2.2. Duration of Response  
DOR will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint and is defined as the time from first documented 
CR or PR until the subsequently documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs 
earlier.  
7.3.2.3. Disease Contro l Rate 
DCR will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint and is defined as the proportion of patients with 
a best overall response of CR, PR or SD.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

7.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from patients in all cohorts. An overview of blood 
sampling times for PK analysis is  presented in Table 15 and Table 16.  
7.4.1. Niraparib Concentrations  
Blood samples for PK assessment of niraparib w ill be collected in Cycle 1/Day 1, Cycle 2/Day 1, 
Cycle 4/Day 1, and Cycle 8/Day 1 (or EOT if patient discontinues before Cycle 8) in all patients  
in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3. Blood samples for PK assessment of niraparib will be collected in 
Cycle 1/Day 1, Cycl e 2/Day 1, Cycle 4/Day 1, and Cycle 9/Day 1 (or EOT if patient discontinues 
before Cycle 9) in all patients  in Cohorts 1A and 2A.  
The samples will be collected at predose (within 30 minutes prio r to dosing of niraparib) and 
4 hours ± 15 minutes post dosing  of niraparib in all cohorts ( Table 15).  
In a subset of patients, who consent to additional PK blood draws, (N = 8) in each cohort, blood 
samples for PK assessment of niraparib will be collected on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Cycle  4/Day 1 at 
predose (within 30 minutes prior to dosing of niraparib) at 0. 5 hour ± 5 minutes, 1  hour ± 
10 minutes, 2 hours ± 15 minutes, 4  hours ± 15 minutes, 8 h ours ± 1 hour, and 24  hours ± 
3 hours postdosing of niraparib. For all these time points the exact collection time needs to be 
recorded (Table 16). Niraparib will be analyzed in plasma using liquid chromatography with 
mass spectroscopic detection. The timing of each required sample collection for niraparib for PK 
blood draws will be recorded.  
Complete instructions for collection, processing, shipping, storage and handling of s amples are 
detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.4.2. Pembrolizumab Concentrations  
Blood samples for PK assessment of pembrolizumab will be collected on Cycle 1/Day  1, 
Cycle 2/Day 1, Cycle 4/Day 1, and Cycle 8/Day 1 (or EOT if patient discontinues before 
Cycle 8) in all patients in Cohorts 1 and 2. The samples will be collected at predose (within 
30 minutes prior to dosing of pembrolizumab) and 30 minutes ( - 5, + 20 minutes) from the 
beginning of infusion (immediately following the end of infusion) ( Table 15).  
Blood samples for pembrolizumab will only be analyzed to understand an AE in an individual 
patient. The samples will be collected according to the specifi ed schedule, stored, and analyzed 
as needed.  
For pembrolizumab, serum PK samples in an individual patient may be analyzed using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) if required for understanding of AEs. The timing 
of each required sample collection f or pembrolizumab for PK blood draws will be recorded.

7.4.4. Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
7.4.4.1. Niraparib  
In the subset of patients with intense PK sampling (N=8 per cohort), no ncompartmental methods 
will be used to evaluate the PK characteristics of niraparib and, as appropriate. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters to be determined may include area under the concentration × time curve (AUC), 
AUC at steady state (AUC ss), minimum concentra tion (C min), maximum concentration (C max), 
clearance after oral administration (CL/F), volume of distribution after oral administration 
(Vz/F), Cmin at steady state (C min,ss), and C max at steady state (C max,ss). Additional PK parameters 
may be estimated if  deemed appropriate.  
In patients where no intense sampling was performed, model predicted AUCs will be derived. 
Parameters of interest may include AUC, C min, Cmax, CL/F, V z/F, AUC ss, Cmin,ss, and C max,ss. 
Plasma concentrations and PK parameter estimates w ill be presented using descriptive statistics 
by cohort.  
7.4.4.2. Pembrolizumab  
If samples are analyzed for pembrolizumab concentrations to understand an AE, the plasma 
concentrations will be summarized by cohort.  
Model predicted AUCs may be derived. Parameters of  interest may include AUC, C min, Cmax, 
CL, Vss AUCss, Cmin,ss, and C max,ss. 
7.4.4.3. TSR-042 (Dostarlimab)  
The plasma concentrations for TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  will be summarized by cohort. Model

Screening, s hould be submitted  to confirm histological morphology , presence of tumor , 
and to conduct  biomarker analysis. A fresh biopsy is required if archival tumor tissue is 
not available. Open biopsies, punch biopsies, and core biopsies (3) are acceptable.  Fine 
needle aspirate, frozen sample, plastic embedded sample, cell block, clot, and cytological 
specimen (with the exception of Cohort 3) are not acceptable for analysis. ( For Cohort 3 
only: if diagnosis was made by cytology and archival tissue is not available, patient will 
not need to provide tumor tissue.) The archival tumor tissue sample should be submitted 
within 30 days of the patient's first dose. If a replacement biopsy is required in lieu of an 
archival FFPE sample, then the biopsy should be performed pri or to dosing (before 
Cycle 1 Day 1).  
2. Blood samples for the analysis of tumor -related circulating biomarkers such as CTC will 
be collected at Cycle 1/Day 1 predose. Blood samples for the analysis of ctDNA will be 
obtained at Screening, Cycle  2/Day 1 predose, as well as EOT.  
All samples will be collected and managed centrally when possible, and distributed either 
directly or subsequently to designated translational research laboratories for biomarker testing.

instructions can be found in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.5.2. Biomarker Testing on Tumor Samples  
PD-L1 status will be confirmed retrospectively in a central IHC laboratory using an FDA-
approved in vitro companion diagnostic indicated as an aid in identifying NSCLC patients for 
treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor to  confirm results from local testing . Additional markers for 
infiltrating immune cells may also be performed.  
DNA may be extracted from tumor and a nalyzed for specific genomic aberrations (eg, 
BRCA1/2, ATM) that impair homologous recombination repair, other mechanisms of DNA 
damage repair (DDR), as well as other oncogenic lesions (eg, KRAS mutation). Homologous 
recombination deficiency (HRD) status m ay also be evaluated using algorithms based on overall 
genomic instability. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) may also be assessed.  
RNA may be extracted and analyzed for gene expression signatures associated with sensitivity/ 
resistance to niraparib, PD -1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab or TSR-042 (dostarlimab) ), or the 
combination.  
Results from biomarker analyses will be correlated with efficacy outcomes.  
Remaining tumor tissue samples and tumor derived samples such as DNA and RNA may be 
stored for potential future bi omarker testing, including potential bridging to candidate companion 
diagnostic assays.  
7.5.3. Biomarker Testing on Circulating Biomarkers in Blood  
ctDNA may be extracted from plasma and analyzed for sp ecific genomic aberrations 
(eg, BRCA1/2, ATM) that impair HRR , other mechanisms of DNA damage repair, as well as 
other oncogenic lesions.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

4 Intensive nira parib PK sampling will be collected only for a subset of patients (N = 8/cohort) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4. See Section  8.3 and Table 16 for detailed 
schedule. Patients in this subset will be instructed to hold their niraparib dose, which will be taken in clinic on specified  days for PK sampling.  
5 Scans performed prior to the signing of the ICF as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as initial tumo r imaging if they are of diagnostic 
quality and are performed within 28 days prior to first dose date  
6 For details on tumor assessment per RECIST v1.1 see Section  7.3.1, Section 8.2, and Appendix  C. All radiographic images/scans at the specified time points as 
well as any unscheduled images/scans should be archived by the study sites for potential future evaluation.  
7 If screening assessments were performed within 72 hours of Day 1, repeat testing is not required.  
8 CBC and serum chemistry at the Follow -up Assessment should be co nducted only on Day 90 post -treatment to assess for possible AESI (Section  7.1.7). 
9 Serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential within 72 hours of first dose of study treatment. If the serum pregnan cy result is not available before 
dosing, a urine pregnancy test may be performed.  
10 Blood samples for TSH, T3 or FT3, and FT4 are to be collected at screening, every 6 weeks from Cycle 1/Day 1, and at EOT. Blo od samples for TSH, T3 or 
FT3, and FT4 should be collected at 30 -day post-treatment Safety Follow -up only if assess ment is clinically indicated.  
11 Any new anticancer treatment started during the study should also be collected.  
12 Collection of AEs begins when the ICF is signed.  
13 AEs are required to be captured through 30 days after cessation of study treatment (Section  7.1.4). However, SAEs are required to be captured through 90 days 
after cessation of study treatment (or to a minimum of 30 days post -treatment if the patient starts alternate anticancer therapy) (Section  7.1.6), and any 
pregnancies that occur within 180 days post -treatment are to be captured. AESIs should be collected until study closeout, regardless of causality  (Section 7.1.7).    
14 Pembrolizumab should be administered once every 21 days (200 mg intravenous) on Day 1 of each cycle. Pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days

 9. STATISTICS  
Details of the statistical analyses presented below will be provided in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP). A change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require a protocol 
amendment only if it alters a princ ipal feature of the protocol. The SAP will be finalized prior to 
database lock.  
9.1. Analysis Populations  
The modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population includes all patients who received any study drug 
and did not withdraw consent prior to having at least 1 postbaseline tumor assessment. The 
modified ITT population will be the primary analysis population for the efficacy analyses. 
The safety population includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. The 
safety population will be the primary analysis population for the safety analyses.  
9.2. Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics  
Patient disposition will be summarized, including the number of patients treated with single 
agent niraparib and combination of niraparib and a PD-1 inhibitor, the number of patients who 
discontinue and reason for discontinuation, and the number of patients include d for analysis. 
Patient demographics will be summarized descriptively for the overall modified ITT population  
and by subgroup.  
9.3. Sample Size Determination  
 The null hypothesis for this study is H 0: ORR ≤ Standard of Care Response Rate (RR s) vs. the 
alternative hypothesis: ORR ≥ Target Response Rate (RR t) for all cohorts. RR s and RR t for each 
cohort are specified in Table 17 below. 
As different study drugs w ill be used in Stage 1 and Stage 2, the sample size for each stage was 
calculated separately for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Sample size calculation was based on the 
primary efficacy endpoint ORR for each cohort assuming a 1 -sided alpha level of 0.10 and 80% 
power. 
For Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, the number of patients in Stage 1 was determined based on Simon’s 
2-stage design. The sample size for Stage 2 (Cohorts 1A and 2A) was calculated based on a 
1-stage design. Once enrollment for Stage 1 is completed, Stage 2 enro llment will start. Stage 1 
data will be used to determine if further enrollment for Stage 2 is warranted. (As of Amendment 
2, following a cross -program review and decision to move forward with other studies, the 
Sponsor decided that Cohort 3 would close to  further enrollment. As of Amendment 3, Cohort 1 
and Cohort 2 had completed  enrollment , Cohort 1A had closed after partial enrollment and 
Cohort 2A was not opened for enrollment .) The total sample size for this study will range from 
59 to 142.  
The criteria for rejecting the alternative hypothesis and declaring the experiment treatment as not 
efficacious at the end of Stage 1 and Stage 2 are listed in Table 18 below. For each cohort, if the 
number of responders by the end of Stage 1 is the same or less as defined by the criterion, the 
cohort will be terminated. For a cohort that proceeds to Stage 2, if the number of responders by 
the end of Stag e 2 is the same or less than the criterion, the alternative hypothesis will be rejected 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0
Niraparib

Confidential  Page 118 of 132 
 and the experimental treatment will be considered not efficacious for the indication in the cohort, 
unless the clinical judgment suggests otherwise. For example, if gre ater than 8 patients in Cohort 
1/Stage 1 respond, then enrollment in Cohort 1A/Stage 2 will continue until completion.

• Most commonly reported TEAEs (ie, those events reported by ≥10% of all patients)  
• Treatment -emergent SAEs  
Details for the safety analysis will be specified in the SAP.  
9.5. Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analysis will be done for this study. After the last patient in Stage 1 of each 
cohort is enrolled and has discontinued treatment or completed 2 postbaseline tumor assessments 
(approximately 3  to 5 months), whichever occurs earlier, the number of responders will be 
counted and compared to the criteria as specified in Table 18 in the sample size determination 
section. If the number of responders is equal or less than the number of responders specified in 
the criteria, enrollment will be discontinued and the cohort will be terminated for futility. Only 
cohorts with a number of responders larger than that defined by the criteria will be continued to 
finish the Stage  2 enrollment. In the case of responder criteria met before Stage 1 enrollme nt is 
finished, Stage 1 enrollment may be stopped and Stage 2 enrollment may begin. (As of 
Amendment 2, following a cross -program review and decision to move forward with other 
studies, the Sponsor decided that Cohort 3 would close to further enrollment. A s of Amendment 
3, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 had completed  enrollment , Cohort 1A had closed after partial 
enrollment and Cohort 2A was not opened for enrollment .) 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 9.6. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Noncompartmental or modeling methods will be used to evaluate the PK characteristics of 
niraparib and pembrolizumab or TSR-042 (dostarlimab)  as appropriate. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters to be determined may include AUC, AUC ss, Cmin, Cmax, CL/F, V z/F, Cmin,ss, and 
Cmax,ss as described in Section  7.4.4. 
Population PK modeling will be performed on the niraparib concentration -time data collected 
from this st udy to quantitatively describe the PK profile of niraparib in lung cancer patients, 
explore the PK variability, and identify any covariate effects such as demographic and 
pathophysiologic variables as well as co -medication on the PK of niraparib. In additi on, the 
exposure-response relationship between measures of niraparib exposure and measures of 
efficacy, including, but not limited to, ORR, PFS, DOR, and DCR, will be explored. The 
relationship between niraparib exposure and key safety variables, including  (but not limited to) 
AESI identified based on data, will be explored. In addition, tumor biomarkers (such as 
BRCA1/2 status, other HRR pathway mutations, HRD status, etc.) may be explored in the 
exposure-response analyses.  
The population PK and exposure -response analyses will be developed and reported separately 
from the clinical study report.  
9.7. Biomarker Analyses  
For each patient in the study, blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected, evaluated and 
archived to support exploratory biomarker analysis . BRCA1/2 and other HRR pathway 
mutations, HRD score, TMB, immune cell infiltrates, KRAS mutation status, and other 
exploratory biomarkers will be correlated with response.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 10. ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPEC TS 
10.1. Data Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor (or d esignee) will conduct a study initiation visit to verify the qualifications of the 
Investigator, inspect the facilities, and inform the Investigator of responsibilities and procedures 
for ensuring adequate and correct documentation.  
The Investigator must p repare and maintain adequate and accurate records of all observations 
and other data pertinent to the clinical study for each study participant. Frequent communication 
between the clinical site and the Sponsor is essential to ensure that the safety of the study is 
monitored adequately. The Investigator will make all appropriate safety assessments on an 
ongoing basis. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee may review safety information as it 
becomes available throughout the study.  
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored with respect to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and standard operating procedures for compliance with applicable government regulations. The 
Study Monitor will be an authorized individual designated by the Sponsor. The Study Monitor 
will have access to all records necessary to ensure integrity of the data and will periodically 
review the progress of the study with the Investigator.  
10.2. Access to Source Data/Documents  
An electronic data capture system to manage data collection will be utilized during this study. 
The electronic data capture system is a software tool designed to ensure quality assurance and 
facilitate data capture during clinical studies. The system is fu lly compliant with Code of Federal 
Regulations 21  Part 11.  
The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to 
the Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure 
completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of 
all data changes. The Investigator or designee will cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) 
for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accura cy and completeness of the data 
capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit.  
Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to identify any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the respective stud y sites by 
means of electronic or manual queries.  
The Investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents 
(medical records, ECGs, AEs, concomitant medication reporting, and raw data collection forms) 
designed to record  all observations and other pertinent data for each patient receiving study 
treatment.  
The Investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors, and the IRB/IEC to have direct access to all docume nts pertaining to the 
study. 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 10.3. Archiving Study Documents  
Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the 
integrity of the data collected. Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, 
maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to the appropriate regulations. 
According to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, essential documents 
should be retained for a minimum of 2  years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH 
region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development 
of the study treatment.  
10.4. Good Clinical P ractice 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH for GCPs and the Declaration of 
Helsinki (Version 2008). The clinical study will also be carried out in accordance with national 
and local regulatory requirement(s).  
10.5. Informed Consent  
Before each patient is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the patient according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. 
As part of this procedure, the Investigator must explain orally and i n writing the nature, duration, 
purpose of the study, and the action of the study treatment in such a manner that the patient is 
aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or AEs that may occur. The patient should be 
informed that he or she is free to w ithdraw from the study at any time. The patient will receive 
all information that is required by regulatory authorities and ICH guidelines. The Investigator or 
designee will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICF prior to the start of 
the study.  
The ICF must be signed and dated; 1 copy will be given to the patient and the Investigator will 
retain a copy as part of the clinical study records. The Investigator will not undertake any 
investigation specifically required for the clinical stu dy until written consent has been obtained. 
The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented.  
If a protocol amendment is required, then the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes 
to the protocol. If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the responsible 
IRB/IEC and signed by all patients subsequently enrolled in the clinical study as well as those 
currently enrolled in the clinical study.  
10.6. Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study, the  study protocol or other relevant documents, or both, will be 
approved by the IEC/IRB/Competent Authorities in accordance with local legal requirements. 
The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first 
patient is enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, 
receive approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC/Competent Authority 
approval prior to implementation (if appropriate) . In the US, following approval, the protocol 213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

 amendment(s) will be submitted to the investigational new drug application under which the 
study is being conducted.  
Specifically, enrollment in Stage 2 of this study (added under Amendment 2) must not begin 
before the clinical study site has received approval for Amendment 2 from the ethics comm ittee 
of record for that site.  
Administrative changes (not affecting the patient benefit/risk ratio) may be made without the 
need for a formal amendment. All amendments will be distributed to all protocol recipients, with 
appropriate instructions.  
10.7. Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection  
All clinical study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. Study documents 
(protocols, IBs, and other materials) wil l be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. 
The Investigator and members of his or her research team (including the IRB/IEC) must not 
disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor, except to the extent 
necessary t o obtain informed consent from patients who wish to participate in the study or to 
comply with regulatory requirements.  
The anonymity of participating patients must be maintained. Patients will be specified on study 
documents by their enrollment number or  birth date, not by name. Documents that identify the 
patient (eg, the signed informed consent document) must be maintained in confidence by the 
Investigator.  
10.8. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures approved by the Sponsor will be followed in o rder to 
comply with GCP guidelines. On -site checking of the eCRFs for completeness and clarity, 
cross-checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be 
performed.  
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor or its designee.  Monitoring will be done by personal 
visits from a representative of the Sponsor (Study Monitor) who will review the eCRFs and 
source documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to 
protocol design and regulatory re quirements by frequent site visits and by communications 
(letter, telephone, and fax).  
All unused study treatment and other study materials will be returned to the Sponsor after the 
clinical phase of the study has been completed.  
10.9. Audits and Inspections  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC, and/or the Sponsor’s clinical quality assurance group, or its 
designee, may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other study documentation for 
on-site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents mus t be guaranteed by the

 APPENDIX  C. RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS, V1.1  
Response Criteria by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), v1.1  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a  30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (thi s includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression s.) 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all  nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (<  10 mm short axis).  
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in compl ete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing no n-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase. 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Investigator).  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best res ponse recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both m easurement and confirmation criteria.  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

* See RECIST v1.1 publication for further details on what is evidence of a new lesion.68  
** Only for nonrandomized trials with response as primary endpoint.  
*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in nontarget lesions may be accepted as disease 
progression.  
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should 
be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

 APPENDIX  D. ACCEPTABLE METHODS O F CONTRACEPTION  
Patients of childbearing potential, who are sexually active, and their partners must agree to the 
use of 2 highly effective form s of contraception through out their participation during the study 
treatment and for 180 days after the last dose of study treatment(s) . Acceptable birth control 
methods include  the following : 
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral route  
− Intravaginal route  
− Transdermal route  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence, if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject  213352 | Protocol Amendment 213352 Am03 12 Feb 2021 | TMF-11819197 | 1.0

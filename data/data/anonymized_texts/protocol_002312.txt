	5	1		INTRODUCTION		Rapid	and	definitive	airway	management	is	an	essential	skill	for	all	emergency	physicians.	Orotracheal	intubation	is	the	most	common	means	to	obtain	a	definitive	airway,	and	is	classically	performed	using	an	endotracheal	tube	with	an	intubating	sylet	inserted	into	the	tube	for	rigidity.		The	tube	and	stylet	are	passed	under	direct	vision.	Using	these	methods,	the	majority	of	patients	in	the	emergency	department	can	be	successfully	intubated,	and	therefore	successfully	oxygenated	and	ventilated.		The	concept	of	first-pass	success,	that	is,	passing	the	endotracheal	tube	successfully	on	the	first	intubation	attempt,	is	paramount	in	emergency	airway	management.		It	has	been	shown	that	for	every	attempt	after	the	first,	complications	increase	dramatically.1		While	emergency	medicine	has	been	improving	airway	management	and	first	pass	success	over	the	past	several	years,	a	large	cross-sectional	sample	demonstrated	that	first	pass	success	remains	approximately	85%.2			First	pass	success	is	likely	lower	in	the	hands	of	less	experienced	operators,	such	as	emergency	medicine	residents	in	training.		Therefore,	there	is	substantial	room	for	improvement.		A	simple	adjunct	to	endotracheal	intubation,	the	gum	elastic	bougie	(GEB),	may	increase	first	pass	success	and	decrease	rates	of	intubation-associated	hypoxemia.			The	GEB	is	a	60	or	70-centimeter	stylet	with	an	approximately	30-degree	angle	at	its	tip.		When	used	during	an	intubation	attempt,	the	GEB	is	passed	between	the	vocal	cords;	then	the	endotracheal	tube	is	passed	over	the	GEB	into	the	trachea.		The	GEB	essentially	serves	as	a	flexible	guide	into	the	trachea.				It	can	enable	successful	intubation	in	difficult	airways	due	to	its	flexible	material,	allowing	the	intubating	provider	to	be	able	to	direct	its	tip	anteriorly	through	the	vocal	cords.	Proper	placement	of	the	GEB	can	be	performed	by	direct	visualization,	video	assisted	visualization,	and	also	both	the	feeling	of	“clicks”	as	the	GEB	passes	over	tracheal	rings	and	a	“hard	stop”	when	the	GEB	comes	into	contact	with	a	mainstem	bronchus	at	the	level	of	the	carina.3,4				1.1	Previous	published	literature			The	first	report	of	adjunctive	GEB	use	in	difficult	endotracheal	intubation	was	in	1949,	described	by	Macintosh.5	Although	it	did	not	receive	much	attention	in	the	literature	for	many	years	thereafter,	the	late	1980’s	and	early	1990’s	saw	multiple	case	reports	and	case	series	describing	the	effectiveness	of	the	GEB	in	these	clinical	scenarios.	3,6-8	As	the	GEB	became	more	popular,	several	larger	series	were	published	supporting	its	use.	One	series	of	2000	anesthesiology	incident	reports	of	difficult	intubations	concluded	that	the	most	successful	airway	adjunct	was	the	
`	
	6	GEB.9		Another	retrospective	trial	found	a	99%	success	rate	when	using	the	GEB	during	301	difficult	intubations	over	an	8-year	period.10					Several	prospective	studies	have	also	been	published	describing	the	use	of	the	GEB	in	difficult	airways.	One	prospective	trial	found	that	199	out	of	200	attempts	at	placing	the	GEB	in	the	trachea	were	successful.11	In	this	study,	the	providers	elected	to	use	the	GEB	due	to	a	poor	laryngeal	view	or	failed	attempts	at	conventional	sylet	intubation.	Another	prospective	observational	cross-over	study	described	the	use	of	the	GEB	in	cadaveric	airways.12		The	cadavers	were	manipulated	to	have	either	a	Cormack-Lehane	Grade	1	or	Grade	3	view,	and	emergency	medicine	residents	intubated	them	with	either	a	stylet	or	a	GEB.	The	authors	found	a	trend	toward	increased	success	in	the	GEB	group	in	the	Grade	3	view	cadavers	but	this	result	did	not	achieve	statistical	significance.		The	first	randomized	study	to	assess	the	efficacy	of	the	GEB	was	conducted	in	1993.13	This	study	simulated	cervical	spine	injuries	to	create	a	difficult	airway.		The	patients	in	this	study	had	manual	in-line	stabilization	maintained	during	intubation,	which	significantly	decreased	the	view	of	the	larynx.	Patients	were	randomized	to	direct	visualization	versus	intubation	using	a	GEB.	The	authors	found	that	all	patients	who	had	failed	intubation	in	the	direct	visualization	group	were	successfully	intubated	within	45	seconds	using	the	GEB.	Another	randomized	trial	describing	GEB	use	was	published	in	1996.14	The	authors	of	this	study	randomized	patients	to	a	GEB	versus	a	standard	stylet	during	direct	laryngoscopy.	The	authors	created	difficult	intubation	scenario	by	simulating	a	Cormack-Lehane	Grade	3	view	with	laryngoscope	placement.	Each	group	had	two	attempts	at	intubation	with	their	randomized	equipment	before	they	could	cross	over.	They	found	that	the	GEB	group	was	successful	96%	of	the	time	while	the	stylet	group	was	successful	66%	of	the	time	after	the	first	two	attempts,	demonstrating	compelling	evidence	for	the	use	of	the	GEB	in	difficult	airways.					Certain	types	of	difficult	airways	may	be	more	amenable	to	GEB-facilitated	intubation.		One	scenario	that	has	been	well	described	is	the	difficult	trauma	airway,	particularly	those	with	facial	and	neck	trauma.13,15,16		The	trauma	airway	provides	a	unique	set	of	complications	to	airway	control	including	active	hemorrhage,	distorted	anatomy,	and	cervical	immobility	due	to	cervical	collar	use.	Another	scenario	in	which	the	use	GEB	is	commonly	described	is	in	the	setting	of	pre-hospital	difficult	airways.17-20		Based	on	its	observed	success,	one	group	reported	that	the	GEB	became	part	of	a	pre-hospital	institutional	algorithm	for	difficult	airway	management.17		Most	of	the	evidence	describing	the	use	of	the	GEB	has	stemmed	from	the	anesthesiology	literature,	with	relatively	little	reference	to	its	use	in	the	emergency	departments.	Few	studies	describe	emergency	providers	utilizing	the	GEB	on	airway	task-trainers,21	manikins,22,23	and	cadavers,12	but	all	are	limited	by	artificial	airway	simulations.			
`	
	7	There	are	two	observational	trials	in	humans	published	in	2011	by	the	same	group	of	authors.24,25	These	trials	report	data	on	the	use	of	the	GEB	as	a	rescue	device	after	failed	intubation.	The	success	rates	described	in	these	trials	were	20	out	of	26	(76.9%)	and	70	out	of	88	(79.6%)	attempts,	respectively.	These	success	rates	are	lower	that	what	is	typically	cited,	but	the	authors	identified	limitations	including	the	fact	that	the	participants	in	their	study	were	residents	using	the	GEB	for	the	first	time,	suggesting	the	need	for	education	on	its	use	prior	to	utilization	in	the	emergency	department.			1.2	Rationale	for	further	investigation		Based	on	this	review	of	the	literature,	there	is	evidence	supporting	GEB	use	as	an	adjunct	for	difficult	airways.		However,	because	it	is	not	always	possible	to	anticipate	a	difficult	airway,	or	even	semi-difficult	airway,	before	an	intubation	attempt	begins,	the	bougie	may	improve	the	overall	success	of	routine	intubations	as	well,	especially	for	patients	with	any	difficult	airway	characteristics.					However,	while	the	GEB	has	significant	face	validity	in	its	ability	to	improve	intubation	success,	a	large	multi-center	study	demonstrated	that	only	3.5%	of	first	attempts	use	the	GEB.2		This	speaks	to	the	possibility	that	increasing	the	use	of	the	GEB,	a	simple,	low-cost	intervention,	may	improve	first	pass	success	and	decrease	intubation-associated	complications.				The	practice	in	the	Emergency	Department	at	Hennepin	County	Medical	Center	(HCMC),	however,	varies	from	nationwide	practice	in	that	the	GEB	is	available	for	every	first	intubation	attempt.		Based	on	the	treating	physicians	preference,	the	GEB	may	or	may	not	be	used	on	the	first	attempt.		Thus,	it	is	standard	of	care	at	HCMC	to	use	and	not	use	the	GEB	on	the	first	attempt.		We	have	experienced	faculty	members,	many	of	whom	are	airway	experts,	who	feel	strongly	on	both	sides,	with	some	stating	that	it	should	be	used	uniformly,	and	others	saying	that	it	should	be	reserved	for	intubations	that	are	not	successful	on	the	first	attempt.		Thus,	there	is	a	clinical	equipoise	on	whether	to	use	or	not	use	a	GEB	on	the	first	attempt.			To	our	knowledge	there	are	no	randomized	control	trials	studying	first	pass	success	and	peri-intubation	hypoxemia	with	and	without	the	use	of	a	GEB.		This	proposed	research	study	will	attempt	to	answer	the	question	of	whether	the	use	of	the	GEB	is	superior	to	non-use	of	the	GEB	in	emergency	department	airway	management.			1.3	Known	risks	of	the	interventions		While	the	procedure	of	endotracheal	intubation	has	many	inherent	risks,	there	are	no	significant	differences	in	risk	between	orotracheal	intubation	with		and	without	a	bougie.	
`	
	8		1.3.1	Known	risks	of	orotracheal	intubation	without	a	bougie		Risks	of	orotracheal	intubation	without	a	bougie	include:	inability	to	pass	the	ETT	and	stylet	past	the	hypopharnx	through	the	vocal	cords,	and	inability	to	slide	the	endotracheal	tube	over	the	stylet.		There	are	rare	case	reports	of	breakage	of	the	metal	tip	of	the	stylet.		Patients	intubated	with	an	endotracheal	tube	without	a	bougie	are	at	risk	for	airway	perforation,	oropharyngeal	trauma,	laryngeal	trauma,	tracheobronchial	trauma,	and	esophageal	intubation.				1.3.2	Known	risks	of	orotracheal	intubation	with	a	bougie		Risks	of	orotracheal	intubation	with	a	bougie	includes:	inability	to	pass	the	GEB	past	the	hypopharynx	through	the	vocal	cords,	and	inability	to	pass	the	endotracheal	tube	over	the	bougie	25.		There	are	rare	mechanical	complications	that	have	been	reported	with	the	GEB,	including	breakage	of	the	GEB	tip,26	and	fracture	of	the	material.27	Major	medical	complications	of	GEB	use	are	rare..	The	reported	complications	of	GEB	use	include	hemopneumothorax	28,	pharyngeal	wall	perforation,29	traumatic	bleeding	within	the	airway,30,31	and	tracheal	injury.32		Several	of	these	case	reports	describe	patients	with	post-surgical	and	complex	airway	anatomy,	and	GEB	use	as	the	sole	inciting	mechanism	for	the	trauma	is	debatable..						1.4	Proposed	Study	Population		Adult	patients	undergoing	orotracheal	intubation	in	the	ED	with	a	Macintosh	blade	(using	either	video	or	direct	laryngoscopy)	for	any	indication	will	be	randomized	to	use	of	the	GEB	during	the	first	intubation	attempt.	All	other	care	will	be	at	the	discretion	of	the	treating	emergency	physician.					2			STUDY	OBJECTIVES		2.1	Primary	outcome		The	primary	outcome	of	this	study	will	be	first	pass	success.				
`	
	9	First	pass	success	is	defined	as	placement	of	the	endotracheal	tube	(ETT)	into	the	trachea	on	the	first	attempt.		An	attempt	begins	when	the	laryngoscope	enters	the	mouth,	and	ends	if	either	of	the	following	occur:	1. the	laryngoscope	leaves	the	mouth,	regardless	of	whether	an	attempt	was	made	to	pass	the	endotracheal	tube	or	bougie.			2. if	the	operator	cannot	intubate	the	trachea	with	the	first	tube	device	(ETT	or	bougie),	and	switches	to	any	other	tube	device,	even	if	the	laryngoscope	blade	remains	in	the	mouth.							A	patient	will	be	considered	to	achieve	the	primary	outcome	if	they	are	intubated	successfully	on	the	first	attempt.		Tracheal	position	of	the	ETT	is	confirmed	immediately	using	a	standard	protocol	involving	multiple	modalities	(physical	exam,	capnography,	and	chest	x-ray,	among	others).				2.2	Secondary	outcomes		1)	First	pass	success	without	hypoxemia.				Hypoxemia	is	defined	as	a	pulse	oximetry	value	(SpO2)	less	than	90%	at	any	point	during	intubation,	or	a	drop	of	more	than	10%	from	baseline	if	starting	below	90%.		The	outcome	of	hypoxemia	will	be	recorded	beginning	when	the	first	attempt	begins	and	ending	one	minute	after	inflation	of	the	ETT	cuff.						A	patient	will	be	considered	to	achieve	this	outcome	if	1)	they	are	intubated	successfully	on	the	first	attempt,	and	2)	do	not	experience	hypoxemia	on	the	first	attempt.			2)	Time	to	intubation	(first	attempt	only).	Time	to	intubation	will	be	defined	as	the	time	elapsed	between	the	beginning	of	the	intubation	attempt	to	inflation	of	the	ETT	cuff	when	the	tube	is	in	the	trachea.				3)	Esophageal	intubation:	defined	as	passage	of	the	ETT	into	the	esophagus,	with	subsequent	ventilation,	and	then	removal.		Clinically,	esophageal	intubation	is	identified	by	the	absence	of	end-tidal	carbon	dioxide,	abnormal	physical	exam,	and	hypoxia.		This	does	not	count	passage	of	the	ETT	into	the	esophagus	during	the	attempt	if	the	ETT	is	removed	during	the	attempt.				4)	Hypoxemia,	as	defined	above.		
`	
	10	3		MEASUREMENT	OF	STUDY	OUTCOMES		3.1	Measurement	of	primary	outcome		A	trained	research	assistant	will	be	present	in	the	room	for	all	study	subjects.		This	trained	assistant	will	observe	the	intubation	and	record	the	number	of	attempts.		The	intubating	physician	will	also	be	asked	the	number	of	attempts	at	the	end	of	the	case.		In	cases	where	there	is	a	discrepancy	between	the	research	assistant	and	the	intubating	physician,	the	video	for	the	stabilization	case	will	be	reviewed	to	determine	the	actual	number	of	attempts.					3.2	Measurement	of	secondary	outcomes		For	secondary	outcome	1):	First	pass	success	will	be	measured	as	described	above.		For	hypoxemia,	a	research	assistant	will	record	the	SpO2	at	the	beginning	of	the	attempt	and	every	20	seconds	thereafter,	until	1	minute	after	inflation	of	the	ETT	cuff.		The	lowest	SpO2	will	also	be	recorded,	even	if	this	does	not	fall	at	a	20-second	interval.				For	secondary	outcome	2):	The	research	assistant	will	have	a	stopwatch	and	record	the	time	to	intubation,	as	defined	in	2.2.		For	secondary	outcome	3):	The	intubating	physician	will	fill	out	a	data	collection	sheet	after	the	intubation.		This	form	will	include	whether	there	was	an	esophageal	intubation,	as	defined	in	2.2.		For	secondary	outcome	4):.		Hypoxemia	will	be	measured,	as	described	above	in	secondary	outcome	1).					
`	
	11	4	INVESTIGATIONAL	PLAN		4.1	Overall	Study	Design	and	Plan		This	Phase	IV	study	is	designed	as	a	randomized,	unblinded,	two-arm	study	that	will	be	conducted	at	a	single	center.	The	primary	aim	is	to	determine	if	first	pass	success	differs	by	more	than	9%	(absolute	difference)	in	patients	who	use	a	GEB	during	the	first	intubation	attempt	compared	to	those	that	do	not.				4.1.1		Study	Population	and	Randomization		Adult	patients	undergoing	orotracheal	intubation	in	the	ED	with	a	Macintosh	blade	(using	either	video	or	direct	laryngoscopy)	for	any	indication	will	be	enrolled	into	the	study.				If	the	patient	meets	all	of	the	eligibility	criteria,	he/she	will	be	enrolled	and	randomized	at	a	1:1	ratio	to	undergo	intubation	with	or	without	a	GEB	for	the	first	attempt.	The	randomization	will	be	permuted-block	with	random	block	sizes	of	2,	4,	6,	8,	and	10.		The	randomization	will	be	stratified	into	two	groups:	1)	those	with	any	of	the	following:	cervical	collar,	obesity	(gestalt),	and	apparent	facial	or	neck	trauma;	and	2)	those	with	none	of	those	characteristics.		A	trained	research	coordinator	who	will	not	be	performing	any	data	collection	or	chart	review	during	the	study	will	generate	the	treatment	assignments.		The	study	allocations	will	be	sealed	in	sequentially	numbered	opaque	envelopes	and	stored	in	the	critical	care	area.		When	an	eligible	patient	is	enrolled,	the	next	sequential	envelope	will	be	opened	to	reveal	the	treatment	assignment.		Skipping	a	study	number	is	not	allowed.		4.1.2		Study	Treatment	and	Blinding		The	study	will	be	unblinded	because	it	is	not	possible	to	blind	physicians	to	this	study,	and	no	sham	intervention	is	possible.		4.2	Assessments		4.2.1		Outcome	Assessments		Described	in	section	3		4.2.2	Safety	Assessments		Any	adverse	events	related	to	the	use	or	non-use	of	the	GEB	should	be	observed	immediately	in	the	ED	during	the	intubation	process.		If	either	device	fails	to	
`	
	12	intubate	the	patient,	a	second	attempt	will	be	performed.		The	second	attempt	can	proceed	with	any	device	or	strategy	that	the	intubating	physician	feels	is	best	for	the	patient.		Direct	trauma	to	the	mouth,	upper	airway,	and	airway	are	possible	in	both	groups.	Full	assessment	of	the	mouth,	upper	airway,	and	airway	is	not	possible	without	exposing	the	patient	to	further	harm	from	repeated	laryngoscopy	and	bronchoscopy.		Therefore,	to	assess	any	direct	trauma,	the	intubating	physician	will	be	asked	if	there	was	any	direct	trauma	to	the	mouth,	upper	airway,	or	airway,	and	if	there	was	any	excessive	bleeding	during	or	after	intubation	while	in	the	ED.					4.3	Study	Duration		A	patient’s	participation	in	this	trial	will	begin	at	enrollment,	and	end	1-minute	after	successful	intubation.		No	further	data	will	be	collected	from	the	patient	or	electronic	medical	record.

To	be	eligible	for	enrollment,	the	patient	must	meet	all	of	the	inclusion	criteria	and	none	of	the	exclusion	criteria.		The	subgroup	of	patients	with	any	of	the	following	difficult	airway	characteristics	will	be	the	primary	analysis	population,	though	all	enrolled	patients	will	be	included	in	a	secondary	analysis.		Difficult	airway	characteristics	include:	cervical	immobility,	obesity,	large	tongue,	short	neck,	small	mandible,	facial	or	neck	trauma,	airway	edema,	blood	in	the	airway,	or	vomit	in	the	airway.			5.2	Inclusion	Criteria		Patients	must	meet	all	of	the	following	criteria	to	be	eligible	to	participate	in	the	study:		1.			The	patient	must	be	undergoing	orotracheal	intubation	in	the	ED	with	a	Macintosh	blade	(using	either	video	or	direct	laryngoscopy)		2.		The	patient	must	be	presumed	to	be	18	years	of	age	or	older	at	the	time	of	enrollment.		5.3	Exclusion	Criteria		Patients	who	meet	any	of	the	following	criteria	are	not	eligible	to	participate	in	this	study:		1. Known	anatomic	distortion	of	the	upper	airway	or	perilaryngeal	structures.	2. Prisoner	or	under	arrest	3. Known	or	suspected	to	be	pregnant,	based	on	the	opinion	of	the	treating	physician.			5.4	Subject	Withdrawal	Criteria		As	the	study	duration	is	very	short,	there	will	not	be	time	for	subject	withdrawal.			
`	
	14	6	STUDY	CONSENT		This	investigation	will	be	conducted	under	45	CFR	46.116	Waiver	of	Informed	Consent,	as	both	devices	are	standard	of	care.			45	CFR	46.116	(d)	is	copied	below:			(d)	An	IRB	may	approve	a	consent	procedure	which	does	not	include,	or	which	alters,	some	or	all	of	the	elements	of	informed	consent	set	forth	in	this	section,	or	waive	the	requirements	to	obtain	informed	consent	provided	the	IRB	finds	and	documents	that:			(1)	The	research	involves	no	more	than	minimal	risk	to	the	subjects;		(2)	The	waiver	or	alteration	will	not	adversely	affect	the	rights	and	welfare	of	the	subjects;		(3)	The	research	could	not	practicably	be	carried	out	without	the	waiver	or	alteration;	and		(4)	Whenever	appropriate,	the	subjects	will	be	provided	with	additional	pertinent	information	after	participation.		(e)	The	informed	consent	requirements	in	this	policy	are	not	intended	to	preempt	any	applicable	federal,	state,	or	local	laws	which	require	additional	information	to	be	disclosed	in	order	for	informed	consent	to	be	legally	effective.		(f)	Nothing	in	this	policy	is	intended	to	limit	the	authority	of	a	physician	to	provide	emergency	medical	care,	to	the	extent	the	physician	is	permitted	to	do	so	under	applicable	federal,	state,	or	local	law.			6.1	Research	involves	no	more	than	minimal	risk	to	the	subjects		The	use	or	non-use	of	the	GEB	both	are	the	current	standard	of	care	in	the	Emergency	Department.		The	decision	whether	to	use	a	GEB	depends	on	the	intubating	physician’s	preferences	and	biases.		The	resident	physicians	(who	perform	approximately	98%	of	the	endotracheal	intubations)	receive	extensive	training	in	intubating	with	and	without	a	GEB,	and	routinely	perform	endotracheal	intubation	with	and	without	a	GEB.		Though	patients	requiring	intubation	are	critically	ill	by	definition,	and	have	significant	risk	of	morbidity	and	mortality	throughout	the	hospital	stay,	this	risk	is	imparted	by	the	underlying	illness	or	injury,	and	should	not	be	altered	more	than	
`	
	15	minimally	by	the	use	or	non-use	of	a	GEB	for	intubation.		Because	both	methods	are	acceptable	as	standard	of	care	for	the	first	intubation	attempt,	there	is	currently	no	reason	to	think	that	one	has	any	higher	risk	than	the	other;	that	is,	there	is	minimal	added	risk	to	the	patient	beyond	the	risk	caused	by	their	severe	illness	or	injury.				6.2	The	waiver	or	alteration	will	not	adversely	affect	the	rights	and	welfare	of	the	subjects		There	is	no	reason	this	waiver	of	consent	could	adversely	affect	the	rights	nor	welfare	of	the	subjects.		All	subjects	will	receive	the	highest	level	of	care	provided	by	the	HCMC	Emergency	Physicians.		All	other	care	is	at	the	discretion	of	the	treating	physicians.		6.3	The	research	could	not	practicably	be	carried	out	without	the	waiver	or	alteration		Patients	who	require	emergent	endotracheal	intubation	in	the	ED	are	critically	ill	by	definition.		Many	are	obtunded	or	comatose;	others	are	dyspneic	and	unable	to	talk;	still	others	have	myriad	severe	illnesses	that	preclude	an	involved	discussion	regarding	the	study	along	with	its	risks	and	benefits.		For	these	reasons,	it	is	not	practical	to	obtain	informed	consent	for	this	investigation	for	the	vast	majority	of	critically	ill	patients.		A	patient	who	requires	emergent	endotracheal	intubation	has	a	pressing	need	for	medical	intervention	that	cannot	be	delayed	for	any	reason.		Orotracheal	intubation	must	be	completed	on	an	emergent	basis,	and	cannot	wait	for	the	consent	of	a	legally	authorized	representative	(LAR),	unless	the	LAR	is	at	the	bedside	of	the	patient.		Patients	who	are	critically	ill	often	become	critically	ill	unexpectedly.		There	are	a	multitude	of	acute	illnesses	that	occur	without	warning:	major	trauma,	head	trauma,	stroke,	spontaneous	intracranial	hemorrhage,	sepsis,	drug	overdose,	acute	coronary	syndrome,	and	many	others.		There	is	no	reasonable	method	to	prospectively	identify	individual	patients	likely	to	become	eligible	for	participation	in	this	clinical	trial.		If	only	critically	ill	patients	who	were	able	to	provide	informed	consent	were	included	in	this	study,	the	results	would	not	be	generalizable	to	critically	ill	who	could	not	provide	informed	consent,	as	this	is	a	more	ill	cohort.		Previous	randomized	trials	examining	emergency	intubation	have	been	completed	under	a	waiver	of	informed	consent.33,34		
`	
	16		6.3.1	Patient	objection		Because	this	trial	involves	no	more	than	minimal	risk	to	the	patient,	and	because	endotracheal	intubation	must	be	completed	emergently,	the	patient	will	not	be	approached	for	consent.		In	the	unlikely	event	the	patient	is	able	to	have	a	reasoned	conversation	prior	to	intubation,	the	patient	will	be	asked	if	he/she	would	like	to	decline	being	in	a	research	study.		If	the	patient	declines,	he/she	will	not	be	enrolled.			6.3.2	LAR	or	Family	member	objection		If	a	LAR	or	family	member	is	at	the	bedside	prior	to	endotracheal	intubation,	they	will	be	asked	if	they	object	to	the	patient	being	enrolled	in	an	emergency	airway	investigation.		If	they	object,	the	patient	will	not	be	enrolled		6.4	Notification	after	enrollment		As	the	soonest	feasible	opportunity	after	study	enrollment,	the	patient	or	the	patient’s	LAR	will	be	notified	of	the	study	enrollment.		Details	of	the	investigation	will	be	provided	on	an	information	sheet	with	the	contact	information	of	the	investigators	and	research	office.				Because	the	study	will	have	been	completed	1	minute	after	successful	intubation,	it	will	not	be	possible	to	withdraw	from	the	study.	 				
`	
	17	7	STUDY	PROCEDURES		Detailed	descriptions	of	patient	evaluations	required	for	this	protocol	are	described	in	this	section.		These	evaluations	will	be	performed	during	the	indicated	times	of	the	study	as	detailed.		7.1	Study	Entrance	Criteria		At	baseline,	each	patient	will	be	reviewed	for	eligibility	against	the	study	entrance	criteria.		Patients	who	do	not	meet	the	study	entrance	criteria	will	not	be	allowed	to	participate	in	the	study.			Patient	eligibility	according	to	the	study	inclusion	and	exclusion	criteria	will	be	confirmed	at	baseline.				7.2	Enrollment		If	the	patient	is	eligible	for	enrollment	and	neither	the	patient	nor	a	LAR	or	family	member	object	to	enrollment,	the	patient	will	be	enrolled	into	the	study.		Upon	enrollment,	the	study	allocation	will	be	revealed	and	disclosed	to	the	treating	physicians.			7.3	Baseline	and	ED	Data	Collection		Baseline	vital	signs	will	be	collected	immediately	after	randomization.		If	time	permits,	the	intubating	physician	will	be	asked	to	determine	which,	if	any,	difficult	airway	characteristics	the	patient	has.		This	data	will	be	recorded	on	a	structured	data	collection	form.		Attempts	at	endotracheal	intubation	will	be	collected	in	real	time.		Further	baseline	information,	and	information	regarding	difficult	airway	characteristics	(if	not	already	gathered),	will	be	obtained	after	the	patient	has	left	the	critical	care	area.		All	data	gathered	is	listed	in	Appendix	1.					7.4	Adverse	Event	Assessments		Any	adverse	events	(AE)	related	to	the	use	or	non-use	of	the	GEB	should	be	observed	immediately	in	the	ED	during	the	intubation	process.		If	either	device	fails	to	intubate	the	patient,	a	second	attempt	will	be	performed.		The	second	attempt	can	proceed	with	any	device	or	strategy	that	the	intubating	physician	feels	is	best	for	the	patient.		Direct	trauma	to	the	mouth,	upper	airway,	and	airway	are	possible	in	both	groups.	Full	assessment	of	the	mouth,	upper	airway,	and	airway	is	not	possible	without	exposing	the	patient	to	further	harm	from	repeated	laryngoscopy	and	bronchoscopy.		Therefore,	to	assess	any	direct	trauma,	the	intubating	physician	will	be	asked	if	there	was	any	direct	trauma	to	the	mouth,	upper	airway,	or	airway,	and	if	there	was	any	excessive	bleeding	during	or	after	intubation	while	in	the	ED.				
`	
	18	7.4.1	Adverse	Event	Monitoring	and	Period	of	Observation		AEs	will	be	monitored	continuously	while	the	patient	is	in	the	ED,	during	which	any	AE	related	to	the	study	would	be	evident..				7.4.2	Reporting	Serious	Adverse	Events		The	local	IRB	will	be	notified	of	any	related	severe	and	unexpected,	life-threatening,	or	fatal	SAE	as	soon	as	possible,	generally	within	24	hours	depending	on	the	day	of	week.		The	data	safety	and	monitoring	board	will	also	be	notified	as	soon	as	possible.					7.5	Safety-Related	Stopping	Rules		An	independent	data	safety	and	monitoring	board	(DSMB)	will	be	established	to	provide	an	ongoing,	independent	review	and	assessment	of	the	safety	data,	and	to	safeguard	the	interests	and	safety	of	the	participating	patients	in	the	study.		On	an	ongoing	basis,	the	DSMB	will	review	SAEs	that	are	judge	to	be	at	least	possibly	related	to	the	study.		The	DSMB	will	be	notified	immediately	of	the	SAE	and	requested	to	make	an	assessment	within	five	working	days.		Based	on	the	DSMB’s	assessment	of	the	event,	as	well	as	evaluation	of	the	overall	accumulating	safety	data	from	the	trial,	the	DSMB	will	make	a	recommendation	as	to	whether	the	study	should	be	halted	if	there	is	a	safety	concern	or	should	continue	as	planned.		See	section	8.7.2	for	possible	stopping	after	the	planned	interim	analysis.					
`	
	19	8	PLANNED	STATISTICAL	METHODS		8.1	General	Considerations		All	statistical	analyses	will	be	performed	with	STATA	Version	12.1	(StataCorp.	2011.	College	Station,	TX).			Unless	otherwise	specified,	summary	tabulations	will	be	presented	by	treatment	group.	For	categorical	variables,	the	number	and	percentage	of	patients	within	each	category	(with	a	category	for	missing	data	as	needed)	of	the	parameter	will	be	presented.	For	continuous	variables,	the	number	of	patients,	mean,	median,	standard	deviation,	minimum,	and	maximum	values	will	be	presented.	Time-to-event	data	will	be	summarized	using	Kaplan-Meier	estimates	of	the	25th,	50th,	and	75th	percentiles	with	associated	two-sided	95%	CI,	as	well	as	percentage	of	censored	observations.		Formal	statistical	hypothesis	testing	will	be	performed	on	the	primary	and	key	secondary	outcomes,	with	all	tests	conducted	at	the	2-sided,	0.05	level	of	significance.		8.2	Sample	size	calculation	Assuming	a	first	pass	success	rate	in	the	GEB	group	of	95%,	to	detect	an	absolute	difference	of	9%	(86%	without	use	of	GEB)	with	80%	power	between	groups,	374	patients	(187	per	group)	with	a	difficult	airway	characteristic	will	need	to	be	enrolled.		Approximately	1,500	patients	are	intubated	annually	in	our	Emergency	Department.		Because	of	logistic	considerations,	we	predict	that	only	1,000	patients	will	be	able	to	be	enrolled,	30-40%	of	whom	will	have	a	difficult	airway	characteristic.		Therefore,	we	plan	to	enroll	for	1	calendar	year,	or	until	we	enroll	1,000	patients,	whichever	occurs	first.		If	we	have	not	enrolled	374	patients	with	a	difficult	airway	characteristic	at	that	time,	we	will	discuss	with	the	IRB	about	extending	the	timeframe	of	the	investigation.	This	sample	size	calculation	was	performed	in	STATA	version	12.1	with	the	following	command:	sampsi	0.95	0.86,	p(0.8).		8.3	Method	of	Assigning	Study	Patients	to	Treatment	Groups	See	section	4.1.1.	8.4	Population	Description		
`	
	20	8.4.1	Analysis	Populations	The	intent-to-treat	(ITT)	population	will	be	the	primary	outcome	analysis	population.		This	group	will	include	all	patients	who	are	endotracheally	intubated	after	randomization,	excluding	those	intubated	with	a	device	other	than	a	Macintosh	Blade,	because	this	group	could	not	possibly	use	a	bougie	or	endotracheal	tube.		Patients	who	have	no	intubation	attempt	performed	will	not	be	a	part	of	the	ITT	population	and	will	be	considered	screening	failures.		This	will	sometimes	occur	because	emergent	endotracheal	intubation	is	planned,	but	the	patient’s	condition	sometimes	rapidly	improves,	obviating	the	need	for	intubation.		Because	this	is	a	patient	group	that	is	vastly	different	than	patients	who	are	intubated,	and	because	they	received	no	airway	procedure,	they	will	not	be	included	in	the	ITT	analysis.	The	primary	outcome	will	be	analyzed	for	the	subset	of	patients	in	the	ITT	population	who	have	any	difficult	airway	characteristic.		This	will	be	the	main	outcome	of	the	investigation.		The	data	from	all	enrolled	patients	will	also	be	presented	in	the	final	analysis,	as	it	is	plausible	that	the	GEB	improves	first	pass	success	significantly	in	even	routine	intubations.			8.4.2	Treatment	Compliance	It	is	anticipated	there	will	no	patient	compliance	issues.		The	actual	device	used	for	the	first	intubation	attempt	will	be	recorded,	and	the	number	of	times	this	deviates	from	protocol	will	be	recorded.		The	IRB	will	be	notified	of	all	protocol	deviations.	8.5	Outcome	Analysis		The	chi	square	test	will	be	used	to	compare	the	primary	outcome	between	the	two	treatment	groups,	with	the	primary	analysis	including	only	those	with	any	difficult	airway	characteristic,	and	a	secondary	analysis	of	all	enrolled	patients.		Secondary	outcomes	with	categorical	and	continuous	variables	will	be	analyzed	as	the	appropriate	confidence	interval	of	the	difference	between	the	two	groups,	again	stratified	by	the	presence	of	any	difficult	airway	characteristic.		Other	data	will	be	presented	descriptively.			8.6	Statistical/Analytic	Issues		8.6.1	Handling	of	Missing	Data		For	the	primary	outcome,	if	both	the	research	assistant	data	collection	form	and	the	treating	physician	post-intubation	collection	form	are	missing,	the	stabilization	case	
`	
	21	video	will	be	reviewed	to	determine	if	first	pass	success	without	hypoxemia	was	achieved.		If	the	video	is	not	available,	the	patient	will	be	excluded	from	the	analysis.				Secondary	outcomes:	if	data	for	these	outcomes	is	missing,	the	stabilization	case	video	will	be	reviewed	to	ascertain	the	true	value(s).	If	the	video	is	missing,	the	patient	will	be	excluded	from	analysis	of	the	relevant	outcomes.			8.6.2	Interim	Analysis	and	Data	Monitoring		An	interim	analysis	will	be	performed	after	500	patients	are	enrolled.		The	data	will	be	analyzed	for	the	primary	outcome	only.			The	trial	will	be	stopped	early	only	for	futility.		After	the	data	from	the	first	500	patients	is	analyzed,	a	sensitivity	analysis	will	be	performed.			An	analysis	will	be	performed	with	a	sample	size	of	1000	patients		(equal	allocation	in	both	arms)	with	the	following	assumptions:	• First	pass	success	rate	with	non-use	the	GEB	remains	the	same	in	the	second	half	of	the	trial	• First	pass	success	rate	with	use	of	the	GEB	is	15%	higher	(absolute	difference,	up	to	a	success	rate	of	100%)	than	observed	in	the	first	half	of	the	study		If	no	difference	is	found	in	first	pass	success	with	this	analysis,	then	the	trial	will	be	stopped	early	for	futility.		As	detailed	in	section	9.2,	an	independent	DSMB	will	be	established	to	provide	an	ongoing,	independent	review	and	assessment	of	the	safety	data,	and	to	safeguard	the	interests	and	safety	of	the	participating	patients	in	the	study.		Any	additional	analyses	for	DSMB	review	may	be	scheduled	at	the	discretion	of	the	DSMB.				
`	
	22	9	ADMINISTRATIVE	CONSIDERATIONS		9.1	Institutional	Review	Board	Approval		The	study	will	not	be	initiated	until	written	IRB	approval	has	been	obtained	for	this	investigation.	9.2	Data	monitoring	committee		An	independent	DSMB	will	be	established	to	provide	an	ongoing,	independent	review	and	assessment	of	the	safety	data,	and	to	safeguard	the	interests	and	safety	of	the	participating	patients	in	the	study.	The	DSMB	will	include	Michelle	Biros,	MD.	***	On	an	ongoing	basis,	the	DSMB	will	review	SAEs	that	are	judged	to	be	at	least	possibly	related	to	study	drug.	The	DSMB	may	also	be	asked	to	review	on	an	ongoing	basis	other	SAEs	of	concern.	The	DSMB	will	be	notified	immediately	of	the	SAE	and	requested	to	make	an	assessment	within	five	working	days.		Based	on	the	DSMB’s	assessment	of	the	event,	as	well	as	evaluation	of	the	overall	accumulating	safety	data	from	the	trial,	the	DSMB	will	make	a	recommendation	as	to	whether	the	study	should	be	halted	if	there	is	a	safety	concern	or	should	continue	as	planned.		9.3	Protocol	Violations/Deviations		The	investigator	will	conduct	the	study	in	compliance	with	the	protocol.	The	protocol	will	not	be	initiated	until	the	IRB	and	the	appropriate	regulatory	authorities	have	given	approval.	Changes	to	the	protocol	will	require	written	IRB	approval	opinion	prior	to	implementation,	except	when	the	modification	is	needed	to	eliminate	an	immediate	hazard(s)	to	patients.	The	IRB	may	provide	expedited	review	and	approval	for	minor	change(s)	in	ongoing	studies	that	have	the	approval	of	the	IRB.		Any	departures	from	the	protocol	will	be	fully	documented	as	a	protocol	deviation.	Protocol	deviations	will	be	required	to	be	submitted	to	the	IRB.	9.4	Premature	Closure	of	the	Study		If	the	investigator,	DSMB,	or	regulatory	authorities	discover	conditions	arising	during	the	study	that	indicate	that	the	clinical	investigation	should	be	halted	due	to	an	unacceptable	patient	risk,	the	study	may	be	terminated.

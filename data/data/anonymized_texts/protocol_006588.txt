Amendment 7, 19 Oct 2023: Current  Amendment  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and  the Council of the European Union.  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
Results of Part 3 IA demonstrate robust immunogenicity of a single 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 
dose. The pre -specified co -primary endpoints were also achieved , allowing inference of vaccine 
effectiveness of a single dose from the pivotal Study P301. Based on these results, Protocol 
Amendment 7 was initiated to remove Dose 2 administration of mRNA -1273.222 from Part  3. In 
addition, the safety of mRNA -1273 was demonstrated for both the 100 µg prima ry series given 
28 days apart as well as the 50 µg booster dose in Part 1 of this study, with a duration of at least 
6 months of follow -up. Further, extensive post -marketing experience with both mRNA -1273 and 
mRNA -1273.222 in adolescents has not identified  any new safety concerns . Therefore, the safety 
follow -up duration for participants in Part 3 was reduced from 1 year to 6 months for those 
receiving a single dose and for those participants receiving Dose 2, from 6 months to  1 month 
following Dose  2. 
Summ ary of Major Changes in Protocol Amendment 7: 
The Summary of Changes table provided below describes the major changes made in Protocol 
Amendment  7 relative to Protocol Amendment 6, including the sections modified and the 
corresponding rationales. The synop sis of Protocol Amendment 7 has been modified to

Confidential  Page 17 Part 1 Overall Study Design  
This is a three -part, Phase 2/3, study: P art 1A, Part 1B, and Part 1C. The study will evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and effectiveness of mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine in healthy adolescents 12  to 
<18 years of age.  
Participants in Part 1A, the Blinded Phase, will be randomly assigned to rece ive injections of either 
100 µg mRNA -1273 vaccine or a placebo control in a 2:1 randomization ratio.  Part 1B, the Open -label 
Observational Phase of this study, is designed to offer participants who received placebo in Part 1A of 
this study, and who meet Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) eligibility criteria, an option to receive 
mRNA -1273 in an open -label fashion. Part 1C -1, the Homologous Booster Dose Phase, is designed to 
offer participants in Part 1A and Part 1B who are at least 5 months from the last dose, the option to 
request a  booster dose ( BD) (50 µg) of mRNA -1273. Part 1C -2, the Heterologous Booster Phase, is 
designed to provide a BD (50  µg) of mRNA -1273 to eligible participants who completed primary  
coronavirus disease 2019  [COVID -19] vaccination  series with a non-Moderna  vaccine under EUA and 
are at least 3  months from the last dose.  
The goal of the study is to seek an indication for use of mRNA -1273 (100 µg intramuscular [ IM], given 
as 2 injections, 28 days apart) in the 12 to <  18 years age gro up. The basis for demonstrating vaccine 
effectiveness is proposed to be met by serum  antibody  (Ab) response measured in this adolescent age 
group. The approach to inferring vaccine effectiveness will depend on whether an accepted serum Ab 
threshold conferr ing protection against COVID -19 has been established. If an Ab threshold of 
protection has been established, effectiveness will be inferred based on the proportion of adolescent 
study participants with serum Ab levels (on Day  57) that meet or exceed the Ab  threshold. If an Ab 
threshold of protection has not been established, effectiveness will be inferred by demonstrating 
noninferiority of both the (i) geometric mean ( GM) value of serum neutralizing antibody ( nAb) and (ii) 
the seroresponse rate ( SRR) from a dolescent participants compared with those from young adults ( 18 
to 25  years of age) enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study  P301).  
Part 1A, the Blinded Phase - Randomized, Observer -Blind, Placebo -Controlled  
This study in adolescent s will monitor all participants for a total of 12 months following the second 
dose of vaccine or placebo. Safety assessments will include solicited ARs; 7  days after each injection), 
unsolicited AEs; 28  days after each injection,  medically attended adverse  events  (MAAEs ), serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ), and  adverse events of special interest  (AESIs ) including multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children [ MIS-C]) throughout the study period.  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants at baseline (Day  1), Day  57 (28  days after 
Dose  2), Day  209 (6 months after Dose  2), and Day  394 for measurement of  Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS -CoV -2) specific binding  antibody (bAb)  and nAb responses. Blood 
samples will also be tested for th e development of Ab directed against nonvaccine antigen (eg, Ab 
against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify infection with SARS -CoV -2. 
The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection among vaccine recipients and placebo recipients will be 
compared to asses s the potential for mRNA -1273 to reduce the rate of infection in vaccine recipients.  
Part 1A comprises 8  scheduled visits including a Screening Visit and 7  scheduled visits, of which Visit 
2 and Visit 4 will be virtual/telephone visits and the other visits  will be in -clinic visits. This study will 
be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.

Confidential  Page 18 Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase  
Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase of th e study, will be prompted by the authorization of a 
COVID -19 vaccine under an EUA for any persons under the age of 18  years. Participants will be 
transitioned to Part 1B of the study as their age group becomes EUA -eligible. This transition permits 
all ongo ing study participants to eventually be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any 
COVID -19 vaccine made available under an EUA and the option to offer all ongoing study participants 
an opportunity to schedule a Participant Decision Visit  to know their original treatment assignment 
(placebo vs. mRNA -1273 100 µg vaccine).  
Part 1B provides the opportunity for study participants to be informed regarding the EUA, be 
unblinded to their original assignment (mRNA -1273 or placebo), and for those who previously 
received placebo to actively request to receive 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (100 µg) vaccine. EUA -eligible 
study participants will receive a notification letter summarizing the basis for EUA of a COVID -19 
vaccine to receive an EUA and will be asked  to schedule a Participant Decision Clinic Visit.  
At the Participant Decision Clinic Visit, EUA -eligible participants will:  
• Be given the option to be unblinded as to their original group assignment (placebo vs. 
mRNA -1273 vaccine [100 µg]),  
• Be counseled abo ut the importance of continuing other public health measures to limit the 
spread of disease including social distancing, wearing a mask, and hand -washing,  
• Sign a revised informed consent form ( ICF) and assent, and  
• Provide a nasopharyngeal ( NP) or nasal swab for RT -PCR for SARS -CoV -2 and a blood 
sample for serology and immunogenicity.  
Participants that decline unblinding will remain in Part 1A and follow the Part 1A schedule of 
assessment ( SoA). 
After the Participant Decision Clinic Visit, parti cipants that consent to unblinding will follow the 
Part 1A SoA or Part 1B SoA as follows:  
• Participants received placebo in Part 1A and consent to receiving 2  doses of mRNA -1273 in 
Part 1B:  These participants will proceed to Part 1B and follow the Part  1B S oA until BD is 
offered.  
• Participants received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 in Part 1A:  Due to statistical considerations, 
these participants will be considered in the Open -label Observational Phase but will continue 
to follow the Part 1A SoA until BD is offered.  
Part 1C -1, Homologous Booster Dose Phase  
Part 1C -1 – Homologous Booster Dose Phase is designed to offer participants in Part 1A and Part 1B 
who are at least 5 months from the last dose, the option to request a BD (50 µg) of mRNA -1273.  
If eligible, each stud y participant will receive a notification letter and will be asked to schedule a BD -1 
Visit at their study site. Principal investigators should consider current local public health guidance for 
administration of COVID -19 vaccines under EUA and marketing au thorization (if any) when 
determining the scheduling priority of participants.

Supplemental SoA, according to the schedule. As this Supplemental SoA is intended to occur in 
addition to the original SoAs being follo wed by all participants in Part 1A or Part 1B, there is a 
possibility for study visits to overlap (ie, Part 1C -1 BD -Day 1 and study visit in Part 1A or Part 1B that 
coincides with Part 1C -1 BD -Day 1). If visits overlap according to respective visit windows , a single 
visit may be done with the combined study procedures completed once. Any subject who consented to 
receive a BD will follow Part 1C -1 SoA. In case a study visit in Part 1A or Part 1B coincides with 
Part 1C-1 BD -Day 1, participant should follow Pa rt 1C -1 SoA.

Note: Due to the emergence of a more divergent variant of concern (ie. Omicron), Study Part 3 was 
initiated to replace the investigative product mRNA 1273 with a bivalent vaccine mRNA -1273.222. As 
a result of this amendment, Part 1C -2 enrollment was discontinued effective 16 August 2022. Booster 
dosing in the study was also discontinued and was reflected in Protocol Amendment 5. However, 
participants were permitted to receive the updated COVID -19 vaccine outside of the study and to 
continue study participation for safety follow -up. 
Part 2 Study Design  
Part 2 is an open -label design. The study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of a 
50 μg primary series of mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in healthy adolescents 12  to < 18 years of 
age. 
This study in adolescents will monitor all participants for a total of 12 months following Dose 2 or 
booster dose (third dose) of vaccine. Safety assessments will include solicited ARs (7  days after each 
injection), unsolicited AEs (28  days after each injection), MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs (including 
MIS-C) throughout the study period, and AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or 
withdrawal from study.  
Blood samples will be collected from a ll participants at baseline (Day  1), Day 29 , and at specified 
visits presented in Part 2 SoA for measurement of SARS -CoV -2 specific bAb and nAb responses. 
Blood samples will also be tested for the development of Ab directed against nonvaccine antigen (eg, 
Ab against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify infection with SARS -CoV -2. Blood sample 
will be collected 3 days after Dose 2 or booster dose for future biomarker analysis  (ie, inflammatory 
and/or cardiac biomarkers) . 
The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection after mRNA -1273 vaccination will be evaluated.

Amendment 5 SoA. Participants were permitted to receive the updated COVID -19 vaccine outside of 
the study and to continue stu dy participation for safety follow -up. 
Part 3 Study Design  
Part 3 was initially designed as an open -label study to evaluate safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness 
of a 2 -dose 50 µg primary series of mRNA -1273.222 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine administered 6  months  
apart. An interim analysis was conducted which demonstrated robust immunogenicity of a single 50  µg 
mRNA -1273.222 dose. The pre -specified co -primary endpoints were also achieved allowing inference 
of vaccine effectiveness of a single dose of mRNA -1273.222  from the pivotal P301 study. Based on 
these results, the study design was amended to  primarily  evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and 
effectiveness of a single  dose 50 μg primary series of mRNA -1273.222 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine  in at 
least 300 healthy adolescents 12 to <18 years of age.  
Safety follow -up in Part 3 participants who receiv e 1 dose of vaccine will be 6 months after dosing and 
participants who receive  2 doses will be followed  for 1 month following Dose  2. Safety assessments 
will incl ude solicited ARs (7  days after each injection), unsolicited AEs (28  days after each injection), 
MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs (including MIS -C) throughout the study period and AEs leading to 
discontinuation from dosing and/or withdrawal from study.  
Blood samples for measurement of SARS -CoV -2 specific bAb and nAb responses will be collected 
from all participants at baseline (Day 1), Day 29 (28 days after Dose  1), Day 85 (3 months after 
Dose  1), and Day 181 (Dose 2 or 6 months after Dose 1  for particip ants who receive  a single dose ). An 
additional blood sample will be collected at  Day 209 (1 month after Dose 2)  for participants who 
receive Dose 2 . Blood samples will also be tested for the development of Ab directed against 
nonvaccine antigen (eg, Ab against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify infection with SARS -
CoV -2. Blood samples will be collected 3 days after Dose  1 and 3 days after Dose 2  (Day  184), for 
future biomarker analysis  (ie, inflammatory and/or cardiac biomarkers) . 
The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection after mRNA -1273 .222 vaccination will be evaluated.

Confidential  Page 22 Safety Oversight:  
Safety oversight will be under the direction of a Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) composed of 
external independent consultants with relevant expertise.  
An independent  cardiac event adjudication committee ( CEAC ) of medically qualified personnel, 
including cardiologists, will review all suspected cases of m yocarditis and pericarditis to determine if 
they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” events which are reported in ongoing 
interventional clinical trials per the CEAC charter. Any case that the CEAC assesses as representing 
probable or confirmed cases of myocarditis or pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, who will 
then determine if additional action is needed.  
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at the 
organizational meeting of th e CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition, responsibilities, 
procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
The contract research organization ( CRO ’s) medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the 
individual study s ite investigators will monitor safety throughout the study.

Study Treatment:  
Investigational Product:  
The IP (mRNA -1273 vaccine) is a  lipid nanoparticle  (LNP ) dispersion of a mRNA encoding the 
prefusion stabilized sp ike (S)  protein of SARS -CoV -2 formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipids 
(1 proprietary and 3 commercially available): the proprietary ionizable lipid SM -102; cholesterol; 
1,2-distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine (DSPC); and 1 -monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol -2,3-
dimyristylglycerol with PEG2000 -DMG. mRNA -1273 injection is provided as a sterile liquid for 
injection, white to off -white dispersion in appearance, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 20  mM Tris 
buffer containing 87  mg/mL sucrose and 10.7  mM sodium ace tate at pH  7.5 For Part  1A and Part 1B, 
each injection will have a volume of 0.5  mL and contain mRNA -1273 100  µg. For Part 1C -1, 
Part 1C-2, and Part 2, each injection will have a volume of 0.25  mL and contain mRNA -1273 50  µg. 
The Sponsor initiated  the development of modified  COVID -19 vaccine  leveraging the mRNA/LNP 
technology platform against SARS -CoV -2 variant,  which incorporate s key mutations present in 
Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5. The vaccine IP, mRNA -1273.222 , contains 2 mRNAs: CX -024414 
encoding  for the S -2P of Wuhan -Hu-1 and CX -034476 encoding for the S -2P of Omicron subvariants 
BA.4/BA.5.  
mRNA -1273.222 will be provided as a sterile solution for injection at a concentration of  0.1 mg/mL in 
20 mM Tris buffer with sucrose, at pH 7.5 . The solution will be  kept in 2R USP Type I  borosilicate 
glass vials with PLASCAP vial seal containing a 13 mm FluroTec -coated plug  stopper with a 0.8 mL 
nominal fill volume. For Part 3, each injection  preparation  will have a volume of 0.5 mL and contain 
50 µg mRNA -1273 .222.  
Mode of Administration:  
Doses will be administered by IM injection into the deltoid muscle according to the procedures 
specified in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. Preferably, all doses should be administered into 
the nondominant arm.  
Procedures  and Assessments:  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant:  
• Solicited local and systemic ARs that occur during the 7 days following each injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 6 sub sequent days) in Part 1A, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3. 
Solicited ARs will be recorded daily using electronic diaries ( eDiaries ) 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28  days following each injection (ie,  the 
day of injection and 27 subsequent day s) in Part 1A,  Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing (except  for participants who receive  a single 
dose in Part  3) and/or withdrawal from study participation from Day  1 through the last day 
of study participation in Part 1A, Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part  3

• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study  
Immunogenicity Assessments:  
The following analytes will be measured in blood samples for immunogenicity assessments:  
• Serum nAb le vel against SARS -CoV -2 as measured by pseudovirus and/or live virus 
neutralization assays  
• Serum bAb levels against SARS -CoV -2 as measured by a multiplex serology assay 
specific to the SARS -CoV -2 S, N, RBD  protein.  
Serum collected from all participants will  be tested for bAb against SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid protein 
at specified timepoints. In addition, serum samples from a selected subset of study participants who 
received mRNA -1273  or mRNA -1273.222  will be selected for testing of nAb and bAb against the 
SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
Exploratory Assessments and Biomarkers:  
Exploratory assessments may include assessment of biomarkers for safety, reactogenicity, 
inflammatory and cardiac function. Serologic markers of disease severity, immune response to 
SARS -CoV -2, RT -PCR of NP or nasal swab or saliva samples, and genetic sequences of SARS -CoV -2 
strains isolated from participants’ samples may also be measured.  
Efficacy Assessments:  
Vaccine effectiveness for adolescents of ages of 12 to <  18 years will be inferred based o n serum Ab 
responses obtained on Day 57 (28 days after the second injection of mRNA -1273)  and Day 209 
(28 days after the second injection of mRNA1273.222) . Inference will be based on assessing the 
adolescent Ab responses against the following:  
• If available  at the time of analysis , adolescent Ab responses will be assessed against an 
accepted serum Ab threshold conferring protection against COVID -19. 
• If an accepted threshold of protection is not available , adolescent Ab responses will be 
assessed by establish ing noninferiority of the GM value and SRR  of serum nAb from 
adolescent participants compared with those from young adults enrolled in the ongoing 
clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study  P301).

Confidential  Page 30 Statistical Methods:  
Part 1  
Hypothesis Testing (Part 1A)  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is established for the primary 
immunogenicity objective, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 
with serum Ab equal to or above the established threshold at Day  57 is ≤70% (ie, H 0: percentage of 
participants on mRNA -1273 ≤70% with serum Ab at Day  57 equal to or above the established 
threshold).  
The study would be considered as meeting the immunogenicity objective if the 95% confidence 
interval ( CI) of percentage o f participants on mRNA -1273 rules out 70% (lower bound of the 95%  CI 
>70%).  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available for the primary 
immunogenicity objective, the immunogenicity analysis of primary vaccine response will be performed 
using the noninferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on the 2 coprimary endpoints, respectively.  
Coprimary endpoint 1: Ab GM value at Day 57  
H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by Ab GM at Day 57 is inferior in 
adolescents (12 to <  18 years of age) compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) using 
mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.  
The noninferiority in Ab GM in adolescents compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) 
is demonstrated by that the lower bound of the 95%  CI of the GM ratio (GMR) rules out 0.667 (lower 
bound >0.667) using a noninferiority margin of 1.5. The GMR is the ratio of the GM value of 
adolescents on mRNA -1273 in this study, Study P203, at Day  57 compared with the GM value of 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age) on mRNA -1273 in Study  P301.  
Coprimary endpoint 2: Ab seroresponse rate at Day  57 
A definition of seroresponse will be provided in the SAP based on forthcoming information about 
assay performance.  
The null hypothesis:  
H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by seroresponse rate at Day 57 is inferior 
in adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age) compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) 
using mRNA -1273 Study P301 data.  
The noninferiority in sero response rate in adolescents compared with that in young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) is demonstrated by that the lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate 
difference rules out -10% (ie, lower bound > -10%) using the noninferiority margin of 10%.  The 
seroresponse rate difference is defined as the rate in adolescents receiving mRNA -1273 minus the rate 
in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 from Study P301.  
The study would be considered as meeting the primary immunogenicity obje ctive if noninferiority is 
demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Details regarding the assay to be used to assess noninferiority will be provided in the SAP.

Serum sa mples from all participants will be collected and banked, a subset of participants will be 
selected, and their samples will be processed for immunogenicity testing (the Immunogenicity Subset).  
Approximately 362 participants who receive mRNA -1273 will be se lected for the Immunogenicity 
Subset, with a target of 289  participants receiving mRNA -1273 in the per-protocol ( PP) 
Immunogenicity Subset (adjusting for approximately 20% of participants who may be excluded from 
the PP Immunogenicity Subset, as they may n ot have immunogenicity results due to any reason). The 
sample size of the Immunogenicity Subset may be updated with data from other mRNA -1273 studies 
or external data especially regarding a threshold of protection. In such a situation, the final sample siz e 
of the Immunogenicity Subset will be documented in the SAP.  
For the primary immunogenicity objective, with approximately 289  participants in the  PP 
Immunogenicity Subset, the study will have >  90% power to rule out 70% with a 2 -sided 95% CI for 
the perce ntage of mRNA -1273 participants exceeding the acceptable threshold if the true rate of 
participants exceeding the acceptable threshold is 80%.  
If an acceptable Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available at the time of analysis, 
for the pr imary immunogenicity objective, noninferiority tests of 2 null hypotheses based on 2 
coprimary endpoints, respectively, will be performed. The sample size calculation for each of the 2 
noninferiority tests was performed, and the larger sample size was chosen for the study.  
• With approximately 289 participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in Study  P203 and 
289 participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in young adults (18 to 25 years  of age) 
from Study P301, there will be 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority of the immune 
response as measured by Ab GM in adolescents in Study P203 at a 2 -sided α of 0.05, 
compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) from Study P301 rece iving 
mRNA -1273, assuming an underlying GMR value of 1 and a noninferiority margin of 1.5.

ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 32 Safety and reactogenicity will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including 
solicited ARs (local and systemic events), unsolicited AEs, SAE s, MAAEs, AESI, AEs leading to 
withdrawal, vital sign measurements, and physical examination findings. The number and percentage 
of participants with any solicited local AR, with any solicited systemic AR, and with any solicited AR 
during the 7 -day follow -up period after each injection (except Part 1B) will be summarized.  
The number and percentage of participants with any solicited local AR, with any solicited systemic 
AR, and with any solicited AR during the 7 -day follow -up period after each dose (except P art 1B) will 
be provided. A 2 -sided 95% exact CI using the Clopper -Pearson method will also be provided for the 
percentage of participants with any solicited AR.  
The number and percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, Grade  3 or higher

summarized. Unsolicited AEs will be presented by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) preferred term and system organ class.  
The number of ev ents of solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs/SAEs, and MAAEs will be reported in 
summary tables accordingly.  
Immunogenicity Analyses  
The SAP will describe the complete set of immunogenicity analyses, including the approach to sample 
participants into an Immunoge nicity Subset for analysis of immunogenicity. The PP Immunogenicity 
Subset is the primary analysis set for immunogenicity unless otherwise specified. The primary 
immunogenicity objective of this study is to use the immunogenicity response to infer efficacy  in 
adolescents (12  to < 18 years in this study). The primary immunogenicity analysis is performed in 
Part 1A. 
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is available based on data from 
other mRNA -1273 studies or external data, the nu mber and percentage of participants with Ab greater 
than or equal to  the threshold at Day  57 will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper -Pearson method. If the lower bound of the 95% CI on the mRNA -1273 group is >70%, the 
primary immunogenicit y objective of this study will be considered to be met.  
The percentage of participants with serum Ab greater than or equal to the threshold with 95% CI will 
be provided at each postbaseline timepoint. The CI will be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson 
method. 
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not established, the 
noninferiority of primary vaccine response as measured by Ab GM value and seroresponse rate in 
adolescents compared with those in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 will be 
assessed. The study is considered as meeting the primary immunogenicity objective if the 
noninferiority of the immune response to mRNA -1273 as measured by both GM value and 
seroresponse rate at Day 57 is demonstrated in ado lescents in this study at a 2 -sided α of 0.05, 
compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study  P301 receiving mRNA -1273.  
An analysis of covariance model will be carried out with Ab value at Day 57 as a dependent variable 
and a group var iable (adolescents in Study P203 and young adults [18 to 25 years of age] in Study 
P301) as the fixed variable. The GM values of the adolescents at Day 57 will be estimated by the 
geometric least squares mean (GLSM) from the model. The GMR will be estimate d by the ratio of 
GLSM from the model. A corresponding 2 -sided 95%  CI will be provided to assess the difference in

GM value will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR is >0.667 
based on the noninferiority margin of 1.5.  
The number and percentage (rate) of participants achieving Ab ser oresponse at Day 57 will be 
summarized. The difference of seroresponse rates between adolescents receiving mRNA -1273 in Study 
P203 and young adults (18 to 25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 in Study P301 will be calculated 
with 95% CI. The noninferiority  in seroresponse rate of adolescents in Study  P203 compared to young 
adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301 will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 
95% CI of the seroresponse rate  (SRR)  difference is > -10%, based on the noninferiori ty margin of 
10%.  
In addition, the GM level of specific nAb and bAb with corresponding 95% CI will be provided at each 
timepoint. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log transformed values 
then back transformed to the original  scale. The GM fold‑rise of nAb and bAb with corresponding 95% 
CI will be provided at each timepoint with Day  57 as the primary timepoint of interest. Descriptive 
summary statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided.

(Part 1B), and prior to BD if a BD is received. The analysis will include participants who are 
randomized to mRNA -1273 in Part 1A and remained in the study with or without unblinding, and 
participants who are originally randomized to placebo and later crossed over to receive mRNA -1273 in 
Part 1B after unblinding. Long -term analysis of applicable safety, efficacy,  and immunogenicity 
endpoints will be summarized descriptively by treatment cohort without treatment group comparison.

Coprimary Endpoint 2: Post Dose 1 Ab GM value against the ancestr al strain at Day  29 
(noninferiority testing)  
The null hypothesis H 0: GM value of Ab against the ancestral  strain at Day 29 post Dose 1 of 50  µg 
mRNA -1273.222 in adolescents who are baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive  is inferior to GM value at 
Day 57 post Dose 2 of 100 µg mRNA -1273 in young adults (18 to 25 years of age  baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 negative ) in Study P301.  
The noninferiority in Ab GM value against the ancestral  strain in adolescents who are baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 positive  compared with that in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young adults (18 to 
25 years of age ) is demonstrated by meeting the following success criterion:  
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR >0.667.

GM value against ancestral  strain at Day 57 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) post Dose 2 of 100 µg mRNA -1273  in Study P301.  
Part 3 Power and Sample Size  
With at least 300 adolescents enrolled in Part  3 to receive 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 , the study will have 
at least a 95% probability to observe at least 1 participant with an AE at a true AE rate of 1%.  
Assuming a true serum Ab GMR of 1.6 for GM value against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at Day 29 after 
Dose 1 of mRNA -1273.222 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive adolescents compared with GM value 
against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at Day 57 after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 primary series in young  adults 
who are  baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative in P301, with approximately 168  participants in the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset who are baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive in P203 Part 3 and 300 young adults 
in P301 who are baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative, there will be a t least >90% power to demonstrate 
superiority of the serum Ab GM value against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 after Dose 1 of mRNA -1273.222 in 
adolescents in P203 to that after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 in young adults in Study P301 at two -sided α 
of 0.05  using a superiority  margin of 1.0 . The standard deviation of the natural log transformed levels 
of Ab is assumed to be 1.5.  
Assuming a true serum Ab GMR of 1.1 for GM value against ancestral  strain at Day 29 after Dose 1 of

ancestral  strain at Day 57 after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 primary series in young adults who are  baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 negative in P301, this sample size will also provide at leas t >90% power to demonstrate 
noninferiority of GM value of Ab against ancestral  strain at Day 29 post Dose 1 of mRNA -1273.222 in 
adolescents in P203 to that after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 in young adults in Study P301 at two -sided α

With approximately 30% of participants in Part 3 who may be excluded from the PP Immunogenicity 
Subset -baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive (PPIS -POS), as the y may be baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative or 
have missing immunogenicity results due to any reason or protocol deviations impacting critical data, 
approximately 240 participants are required in Part 3 to provide 168 participants in the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset -baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive.  
Part 3 Analyses  
In the safety analysis, the number and percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs, severe AEs, 
treatment -related AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, AESIs, and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study 
participation in  Part 3 will be summarized.  
The number and percentage of participants with any solicited local AR, with any solicited systemic 
AR, and with any solicited AR during the 7 -day follow -up period after each injection will be provided.  
In the Part 3 immunogenici ty analysis, for the coprimary endpoints (Ab GM value against Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5 and the ancestral  strain at Day 29 after Dose 1 of 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 in baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 positive adolescents in Study P203 compared with those at Day 57 after Dose 2 of 
100 µg mRNA -1273 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative adults 18 to 25 years of age in Study P301) , 
the following analyses will be performed for the respective hypothesis testing:  
An ANCOVA model will be carried out with Ab value at Day 29 in P203 and Ab value at  Day 57 in 
P301 as a dependent variable and a group variable (baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive adolescents in 
Study P203 and baseline negative SARS -CoV -2 young adults in Study  P301) as the fixed variable, 
where a covariate may be included in the model (to be s pecified in the SAP). The GM value at Day 29 
in P203 and the GM value at Day 57 in P301, and respective GMR for P203 compared to P301 will be 
estimated from the model. A corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI of GMR estimated from the ANCOVA 
model will be provided t o assess the difference in immune response after Dose 1 (Day 29) for the 
adolescents in Study P203 compared to that after Dose 2 (Day 57) in the young adults (18 to 25  years 
of age) in Study P301.  
The first coprimary endpoint, superiority of immune respons e to mRNA -1273.222 against Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5 after Dose 1 compared to mRNA -1273 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 after Dose 2 as 
measured by GM value will be considered demonstrated if the respective GMR 95% CI lower bound is 
>1 based on a superiority margin of 1 . 
The second coprimary endpoint, noninferiority of immune response to mRNA -1273.222 against 
ancestral  strain after Dose 1 compared to mRNA -1273 against the ancestral  strain after Dose 2 as 
measured by GM value will be considered demonstrated if the respect ive GMR 95% CI lower bound is 
>0.667 based on the noninferiority margin of 1.5. The GM value and GMR with specified CIs will also 
be summarized using t -distribution of the log transferred values and then back transformed to the 
original scale, and by basel ine SARS -CoV -2 status.  
Secondary endpoints evaluating SRR with 95% CIs (using Clopper -Pearson method) will be 
summarized by baseline SARS -CoV -2 status at Day 29 in adolescents in Study P203, and at Day 57 in 
young adults in Study P301. Seroresponse at subj ect level is defined as Ab value change from baseline 
(preDose 1) below the LLOQ to ≥4  × LLOQ, or at least a 4 -fold rise if baseline is ≥LLOQ. The SRR

perce ntages of participants.  
The GM values for specific nAb and bAb, with corresponding 95% CIs, and GMFR from baseline with 
95% CIs will be summarized by timepoint. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution 
of the log transformed values then b ack transformed to the original scale. Descriptive summary 
statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided.  
The incidence rate of the first occurrence of symptomatic COVID -19, 14 days after Dose  1 will be 
summarized. The incidence rates with 95% CIs will be computed adjusting for person -years.  
Analysis Sets  
The analysis sets are defined in the following table:  
Analysis Set  Description  
Randomization Set  All participants who are randomized, regardless of the 
participants’ treatment status in the study.  
FAS All randomized participants who received at least 1  injection of 
IP. 
Immunogenicity Subset  A subset of participants in the FAS will be selected for 
immunogenicity testing.  
PP Immunogenicity Subset  A subset of participants in th e FAS will be selected for 
immunogenicity testing. The PP Immunogenicity Subset includes 
participants selected for the Immunogenicity Subset who received 
planned doses of study vaccination per schedule, complied with 
immunogenicity testing schedule, and ha ve no major protocol 
deviations that impact key or critical data. Participants who are 
seropositive at baseline will be excluded from the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset. The PP Immunogenicity Subset will be 
used for analyses of immunogenicity unless specified ot herwise.  
PP Set for Efficacy  All participants in the FAS who received planned doses of study 
vaccination, had no immunologic or virologic evidence of prior 
COVID -19, and have no major protocol deviations that impact 
key or critical efficacy data.  
Safety Set All randomized participants who receive at least 1  dose of IP. The 
Safety Set will be used for all analyses of safety except for the 
solicited ARs.  
mITT1 Set  All participants in the mITT Set excluding those who received the 
wrong treatment (ie, at lea st 1 dose received is not as randomized 
or planned).  
PP Immunogenicity Subset for 
BD phase  The PP Immunogenicity Subset for BD phase includes 
participants who received planned BD per schedule, complied 
with immunogenicity testing schedule, and have no major 
protocol deviations that impact key or critical data, with 
prebooster negative or positive SARS -CoV -2. The PP

will be used for the primary immunogenicity analysis.  
PP Immunogenicity Subset fo r 
Part 3  The PP Immunogenicity Subset for Part 3 includes participants 
who received planned dose per schedule, complied with 
immunogenicity testing schedule, and have no major protocol 
deviations that impact key or critical data, with baseline negative 
or positive SARS -CoV -2. The PP Immunogenicity Subset for 
Part 3 with baseline -positive SARS -CoV -2 status will serve as the 
population for the primary and secondary analysis of 
immunogenicity data at Day 29 in Part  3.  
Abbreviations: AR  = adverse reaction; bAb = binding antibody; COVID -19 = coronavirus disease 
2019; FAS  = full analysis set; IP  = investigational product; mITT  = modified intent -to-treat; 
PP = per-protocol; RT -PCR  = reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ; 
SARS -CoV -2 = Severe Acute Resp iratory Syndrome coronavirus  2.  
Note: Positive SARS -CoV -2 status at baseline is defined as a positive RT -PCR test for SARS -CoV -2, 
and/or a positive serology test based on bAb specific to SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid (as measured by 
Roche Elecsys Anti -SARS -CoV -2 assay) on or before Day  1. Negative status is defined as a negative 
RT-PCR test for SARS -CoV -2, and a negative serology test based on bAb specific to SARS -CoV -2 
nucleocapsid (as measured by Roche Elecsys Anti -SARS -CoV -2 assay) on or before Day  1. 
Multiplicity Adjustment  
A hierarchical sequential hypothesis testing (fixed -sequence) method will be used to adjust multiplicity 
to preserve the family -wise type I error rate (α = 0.05). The hypothesis testing for the 2 coprimary 
endpoints ( geometric mean titer [ GMT ] and SRR) for the primary series of mRNA -1273 in Part  1A 
was completed and statistically significant based on data snapshot dated 08  May 2021, and thus the α 
level of 0.05 can be passed to Part 1C -1 hypothesis testing. In Part 1C -1 Homologous Bo oster Phase, 
the hypothesis testing for the 2 coprimary endpoints (GMT and SRR against the ancestral  strain) after 
BD of mRNA -1273 will be tested at α level of 0.05. The testing in Part 1A and 1C -1 will continue 
through the sequence only until an endpoint is not statistically significant (did not meet specified 
noninferiority success criteria), in which case the testing will stop. If the hypothesis testing for the  2 
coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1-Homologous Booster Phase is statistically significant (meet ing the 
noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary endpoints), the α level of 0.05 will be passed to the 
hypothesis testing in Part  3. 
For the key secondary objective in Part 1C -1 Homologous Booster Phase to evaluate immune response 
elicited by the 5 0 µg prototype booster of mRNA -1273 against variant(s) of interest, the key secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed independently, given that prototype vaccine mRNA -1273 does not contain 
variant specific sequences.  
Part 3  
Since the hypothesis testing for the coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1 was statistically significant based 
on an interim analysis ( IA) with a data cutoff dated 16 May 2022, the α level of 0.05 (two -sided) was 
passed to Part 3 hypothesis testing.

immunogenicity data are available for the Immunogenicity Subset and at least 
1,500  participants (1,000  participants receiving mRNA -1273) have completed Day 57 
(1 month after Dose  2, Part 1A). This IA will be considered the primary analysis of 
immunogenicity for Part 1A.  
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or subset of participants who 
receive BD have completed BD -Day 29 after the BD in Part 1C -1. 
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or subset of participants who 
receive heterologous BD have completed BD -Day 29 after the BD in Part 1C -2. 
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety  may be performed after Day 57 immunogenicity data are 
available after all or a subset of participants in Part 2 have completed Day 57 (1 month after 
Dose 2, Part 2).  
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or a subset of participants  who 
receive 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 dose have completed Day 29 (1 month after  Dose  1). 
• At the Sponsor’s discretion, a clinical study report (CSR) may be developed for an IA.  
Final Analysis  
The final analysis of all applicable endpoints will be performed after  all participants have completed all 
planned study procedures. Results of this analysis will be presented in a final CSR, including 
individual listings.

1.1. Study Rationale   
Coronaviruses are a large family of vi ruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to 
more severe diseases, such as MERS and SARS. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are 
transmitted between animals and people. An outbreak of COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 
began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has spread throughout China and 
to over 215 other countries, territories, and areas including the USA  (WHO  2020a ). On 
11 Mar 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID -19 a pandemic.  
Following the outbreak of COVID -19, ModernaTX, Inc.  (hereafter referred to as the Sponsor)  
applied its mRNA vaccine platform and coronavirus research experience to rapidly develop the 
mRNA -1273 vaccine against SARS -CoV -2. At the time of study i nitiation, evidence suggested 
that the burden of COVID -19 has begun to increase in younger age groups (>408000 COVID -19 
cases and 88 deaths in children less than 18 years of age as of 21 Sep 2020), particularly as 
schools in the USA  started to reopen for i n person instruction ( CDC  2022a). Adolescents also 
likely represented a segment of the population contributing toward sustained community 
transmission of SARS -CoV -2 as well as spread of SARS -CoV -2 within households given their 
mobility and less likelihood of compliance with mask wearing and social distancing 
(Fontanet  et al 2020 ). 
Since then, there have been approximately 6.2 million COVID -19 cases and 772 deaths as of 
30 Aug 2022 in the US A (CDC  2022b ) in adolescents 12 -17 years of age. Since Mar 2020, 
approximately 1 in 4 hospitalized children and adolescents (0 to 17 years old) with COVID -19 
have required intensive care ( CDC  2022c ). While rates of severe disease have not increased 
since the start of the pandemic, the increase in absolute numbers of cases has added substantial 
burden, in terms of the increased number of emergency department and urgent care clinic 
encounters and hospitalizati ons in the adolescent population ( Klein  et al 2022 ; CDC  2022c ). 
In addition to the increased incidence and hospitalizations observed, COVID -19 disease in 
children and adolescents can include MIS -C, a unique complication in conjunction with severe 
disease ( Vogel  et al 2021 ). MIS -C shares some common features with Kawasaki disease, and is 
defined as fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and involvement of ≥2 organ syst ems in 
an individual <21 years of age with no plausible alternative diagnosis and evidence of current or 
recent SARS -CoV -2 infection. MIS -C is also associated with cardiac complications. Through 
01 Aug 2022, 8798 cases of MIS -C have been reported in the US A, with 71 MIS -C related 
deaths reported. The median age of patients with MIS -C was 9 years (range 5 to 13 years) 
(CDC  2022d ). 
Myocarditis has been well described as a complication of pediatric COVID -19. Children under 
16 years of age with COVID -19 are at an almost 37 -fold higher risk of myocarditis than the 
uninfected age - and gender -matched control population ( Boehmer  et al 2020 ). Of note, the 
frequency of myocarditis due to COVID -19 is higher than that of vaccine -associated 
myocarditis. Additionally, the clinical syndrome of COVID -19 related myocarditis is more 
severe and clinically meaningful than vaccine -associated myocarditis. Patients with 
vaccine -associated myocarditis generally have a mil der clinical course than patients with classic 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 55 myocarditis or MIS -C myocarditis, with a lower likelihood of cardiac dysfunction at presentation 
and more rapid recovery ( Patel  et al 2022 ). 
Long COVID, a sequela of COVID -19, affe cting up to 20% of persons infected with 
SARS -CoV -2, has also been described in children, including in those with a mild infection. This 
syndrome is manifested by symptoms that can include fatigue, muscle and joint pain, insomnia, 
concentration difficultie s, respiratory problems, persistence anosmia and ageusia, and cardiac 
palpitations that may occur within 6 months after infection ( Buonsenso  et al 2022 ; 
Buonsenso  et al 2021 ; Dembinski  et al 2021 ). 
Variants of concern such as Delta and Omicron have also emerged contributing to the substantial 
burden in the adolescent population. After the onset of the Omicron wave, the demographics of 
hospitalized patients wit h COVID -19 shifted to younger age groups ( Abdullah  et al 2022 ; 
Goga  et al 2021 ; United  Kingdom  Health  Security  Agency  2022). Furthermore, the peak number 
of hospitalizations during Omicron was nearly 4 times greater than that observed during the 
Delta variant wave ( Delahoy  et al 2021 ; Marks  et al 2022a ; Marks  et al 2022b ). 
Taken together, a vaccine that prevents COVID -19 and  its sequelae as well as SARS -CoV -2 
transmission in adolescents would be a crucial public health tool to help curb the pandemic.  
At the time the present study was initiated, no vaccine had been authori zed or licensed to prevent 
SARS -CoV -2, and there was an urgent public health need to develop one, there being no proven 
therapy. The Sponsor  initiated an accelerated development program for mRNA -1273 vaccine 
against SARS -CoV -2 infection ( Section  1.2), and started a Phase 3 clinical study in the US A 
involving administration of mRNA -1273 vaccine 100  µg as both an initial dose and a second 
dose 2 8 days later ( Section  1.2.2 ). Success criteria for early efficacy were met at first IA based 
on 95 adjudicated cases with a VE of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5% , 97.8%; one -sided p -value 
< 0.0001), and EUA was granted for mRNA -1273 in the adult population.  
Data from the ongoing pivotal study mRNA -1273 -P301 (Study P301) showed that mRNA -1273 
continued to induce durable protection: clinical efficacy against COVID -19 was maintained at 
93% through a median of approximately 5 months after the second dose.  
The primary objective for the Blinded Phase 2/3 study, mRNA -1273 -P203 (Study P203), is to 
evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose level (100  g) of mR NA-1273 vaccine 
administered in 2 doses 28  days apart ( Section  3.1) to an adolescent population. Specifically, the 
primary immunogenicity objective o f the study is to infer effectiveness of mRNA -1273 (100  µg, 
2 doses 28 days apart) 28 days after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 (Day 57) by comparison of immune 
responses in adolescents (aged ≥  12 through <  18 years) to the young adult (≥18 to ≤25  year of 
age) cohort  in Study P301, where efficacy was demonstrated.  
Interim data from the current Study P203 (based on a data snapshot of 08 May 2021) met the 
primary immunogenicity objective by demonstrating noninferiority of both the (i) GM value of 
serum nAb and (ii) the seroconversion rate from adolescent participants compared with those 
from young adults (aged  18 to  25 years) enrolled in the ongoing Phase 3 efficacy study 
(Study  P301). These interim results supported administration of mRNA -1273 as two 100 µg 
doses 28 days apart in adolescents between ≥ 12 and 17 years of age. On 17 Jun 2022, the FDA 
granted EUA of the mRNA -1273 vaccine for adolescents 12 through 17 years of age. Global 
filings/authorizations down to 12 years of age have also occurred.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 56 An additional obje ctive of the current Study P203 is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a 
50 µg of mRNA -1273 given as a 2 dose primary series as well as when given as a homologous 
and heterologous booster vaccine. The rationale for these objectives is as follows: In P art A of 
Study mRNA -1273 -P201  (Study  P201) , the time course and magnitude of antibody (both bAb 
and nAb) responses to mRNA -1273 was similar between 100 µg and 50 µg dose levels (both 
showing strong immunogenicity) at each postbaseline timepoint (Days 29, 4 3, 57, and 209), 
although the 100 µg dose group had numerically greater responses. In addition, recent interim 
results of the ongoing Study  P201 support administration of a BD of vaccine. Adult participants 
in Study P201 received 2 doses of either 50 μg or  100 μg of mRNA -1273 and were administered 
a 50 μg booster of mRNA -1273 6 to 8 months after the second dose. Participants in Study P201 
who received the BD demonstrated enhanced immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 compared to 
preboost levels and met the noninfe riority criteria stipulated in the FDA Guidance on EUA for 
Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19. Interim results from Study mRNA -1273 -P205 (Study P205) 
also show that a 50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 increased nAb levels against Omicron 
approximately 37 -fold compared to preboost levels. Available data also show that heterologous 
or mixed series of COVID -19 vaccine -induced high immune response in the adult population 
(Atma r et al 2021 ). Additionally, no new safety signals emerged upon admin istration of the BD 
in Study P201. Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit -risk profile of a BD of mRNA -1273 is 
favorable, particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease with the emergence of the 
Delta and Omicron variants.  
The Sponsor also aim s to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 50 µg of mRNA -1273.222 
given as a 2 dose primary series in COVID -19 vaccine -naïve participants. Evaluation of the 
immunogenicity of 2 doses of the bivalent mRNA -1273.222 vaccine given 6  months apart which 
allow s evaluation of immunogenicity post Dose 1 was prompted by following emerging data:  
a) Recent disease trends support the need for pediatric vaccination strategies that induce broader 
protection against VOCs (eg, Omicron variant) in addition to the an cestral SARS -CoV -2 strain,  
b) increasing prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 infection in the community ( Clarke  et al 2022 ), 
c) Study P205  data show that Omicron containing vaccine (ie, mRNA -1273.214) elicits strong 
immunogenicity in SAR S-CoV -2 positive individuals  (Chalkias  et al 2022 b), and d)  durability of 
immune response post  BD of a bivalent Beta containing vaccine (mRNA -1273.211) up to 6 
months with higher nAb responses in adults compared with mRNA -1273 against D614G, Beta, 
Omicron BA.1, and Delta variants ( Chalkias  et al 2022 a). Results of Part 3 IA demonstrate 
robust immunogenicity of a single 50  µg mRNA -1273.222 dose. The pre -specified co -primary 
endpoints were  also achieved, allowing inference of vaccine effectiveness of a single dose from 
the pivotal Study P301. Based on these results, Protocol Amendment 7 was initiated to remove 
Dose  2 administration of mRNA -1273.222 from Part  3. 
The Sponsor has developed mRN A-1273.222, a bivalent vaccine consisting of the mRNA that 
encodes for the prefusion stabilized spike glycoprotein of both the Wuhan -Hu-1 isolate of 
SARS -CoV -2 and the SARS -CoV -2 B.1.1.529, Omicron, variant. In November 2021, the SARS -
CoV -2 Omicron variant  was detected in South Africa and was found to contain potential 
antibody escape site mutations such as K417N, T478K, E484A, and N501Y.  
The ability of the Omicron variant to escape prior immunity led to an unprecedented rise in 
COVID -19 infections and rela ted hospitalizations, in adults as well as children, between 
December 2021 and February 2022. Real  world effectiveness studies in adults conducted during 
the Omicron wave found a lower efficacy of the prototype vaccine against this new variant 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 57 (Ferdinands  et al 2022 ; Tseng  et al 2022 ). Moderna COVID -19 investigational variant -
containing vaccine candidates are being evaluated as booster vaccines in Study P205 including 
the BA.1 Omicron  containing  vaccine, mRNA -1273.214 and the  Omicron  BA.4/BA.5 containing 
vaccine mRNA -1273.222. These studies included adult participants, who previously received a 
primary series of mRNA -1273 (100 µg) and some participants in Part  G and Part  H of Study 
P205 who also previously received a 3rd dose (50  µg) of mRNA -1273, received a 4th dose  
(second booster given at a 50 µg) of bivalent Omicron  containing mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -
1273.222. Safety and Immunogenicity results from Study mRNA -1273 -P205 are described in 
Section  1.2.2.3 . 
1.2. Background and Overview   
The Sponsor’s  scalable mRNA/LNP tech nology platform allowed for a  rapid response to the 
COVID -19 pandemic and was used to develop mRNA -1273, a novel  LNP -encapsulated 
mRNA -based vaccine against SARS -CoV -2. The Sponsor’s mRNA/LNP  platform is based on 
the principle and observations that cells i n vivo can take up mRNA,  translate it, and then express 
protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. The delivered mRNA  does not enter the cellular 
nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is  expressed transiently. Vaccine 
mRNA -1273 enc odes for the full -length spike (S) protein SARS -CoV -2(CoV S). The CoV 
S protein mediates attachment and entry of the virus into host cells, by binding to the angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 receptor followed by  membrane fusion, making it a primary target for nAb 
that prevents infection ( Johnson  et al 2016 ; Wang  et al 2015 ; Wang  et al 2018 ; Chen  et al 2017 ; 
Corti  et al 2015 ; Yu et al 2015 ; Kim et al 2019 ; Widjaja  et al 2019 ; Corbett  et al 2020a ; 
Ju et al 2020 ; Robbiani  et al 2020 ). 
Worldwide approvals or authorizations have been issued for mRNA -1273 as a 2-dose 100  µg 
primary series or as a 50 µg BD in adults and in the adolescent age group .  
With the recent surge of a more divergen t Omicron subvariant, the development of a bivalent 
mRNA -1273.222 vaccine was accelerated to address the current SARS -CoV -2 outbreak 
(Hastie  et al 2021 ). 
In November 2021,  the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529; BA.1) emerged as the m ost antigenically  
divergent variant to date that currently has more than 30 mutations in the S 2P protein  
(Hastie  et al 2021 ). In early 2022, new Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5  emerged which have 
their own unique and shared mutations with the BA.1. Leveraging the mRNA/LNP technology 
platform, the Sponsor initiated the development of modified COVID -19 vaccines against 
SARS -CoV -2 variants including the mRNA -1273.222 which contains  2 mRNAs: CX -024414 
encoding for the S -2P of Wuhan -Hu-1 and CX -034476 encoding for the S -2P of Omicron 
subvariants BA.4/BA.5. (See IB V8 Addendum  2). 
Moderna variant -containing bivalent booster vaccines (mRNA 1273.214 and mRNA -1273.222) 
have received appro vals or authorizations globally in adults and in the adolescent age group.  
On 18 Apr 2023, the FDA amended the EUAs for the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine (mRNA -
1273) and Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine, Bivalent (mRNA 1273.222) to simplify the vaccination 
schedule for  most individuals. In that prior authorization, individuals 12 years of age and older 
who have not yet received a bivalent COVID -19 vaccine could receive a single dose of Moderna 
COVID -19, Bivalent (50 µg total mRNA), including individuals who have never r eceived any

Confidential  Page 58 prior doses of COVID -19 vaccines. On 11 Sep 2023, the US A FDA approved the supplemental 
Biologics License Application for Spikevax® for ages 12 years and above, maintaining the 
recommendation for a single dose of the updated vaccine, Spikevax r egardless of prior 
vaccination history. Moderna's updated COVID -19 vaccine contains spike proteins for the 
XBB.1.5 sublineage of SARS -CoV -2. Global regulatory filings for the updated COVID -19 
vaccine have also been initiated . 
1.2.1.  Nonclinical Studies   
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that CoV S proteins are immunogenic and S 
protein -based vaccines, including those based on mRNA delivery platforms, are protective in 
animals. Prior clinical studies of vaccines targeting related CoVs and other viruses have 
demonstrated that mRNA -based vaccines are safe and immunogenic. mRNA -1273 has shown 
preliminary evidence of protection against SARS -CoV -2 in studies in young mice 
(Corbett  et al 2020a ) and NHPs ( Corbett  et al 2020b ). 
Nonclinical studies in mice, hamsters, and NHP s assessing the monovalent mRNA -1273.529, 
bivalent mRNA -1273.214 (contains the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and the Om icron variant BA.1 
spike sequences), and bivalent mRNA -1273.222 (contains the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and the 
Omicron variant BA.4/BA.5  spike sequences) vaccines are ongoing. These studies are designed 
to assess these vaccines as a primary series (2 -dose) or as a booster (3rd or 4th dose) in animals 
previously vaccinated with mRNA -1273. Overall, interim data suggest that a primary series with 
a monovalent vaccine induces robust neutralization against the matched and closely related 
variants but does not induce  significant neutralization against highly divergent SARS -CoV -2 
lineages. A bivalent vaccine, however, induces broader neutralization across divergent lineages. 
In these studies, no significant differences were measured in CD4 or CD8 cytokine production in  
mice that received mRNA -1273, mRNA -1273.529, or mRNA -1273.214.  
Mice were vaccinated with 2 doses of monovalent mRNA -1273, BA.1 -matched monovalent 
mRNA -1273.529, or bivalent mRNA -1273.214, with 2 doses administered 3 weeks apart. At 
Day 36 (2 weeks after t he second dose), robust serum nAb responses, determined via 
pseudovirus neutralization assay, were observed against Wuhan -1 D614G after a 2 -dose primary 
series of 1 μg mRNA -1273, with slightly lower nAb titers observed against B.1.351 or 
B.1.617.2. Serum n eutralizing activity, however, was significantly reduced against the BA.1 and 
BA.2 compared with Wuhan -1 D614G. Mice immunized with mRNA -1273.529 had high 
neutralization antibody titers against BA.1 and BA.2, but low levels of neutralization against 
Wuhan -1 D614G, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2. In mice vaccinated with the bivalent 
mRNA -1273.214, significant neutralization against both the prototype strain (Wuhan -1 D614G) 
and against BA.1 and BA.2 was measured, indicating that the bivalent vaccine affords broader 
neutralization across variants.  
In addition, mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273.222 were studied in mice previously vaccinated 
with primary series of mRNA -1273. Mice were boosted with original (mRNA -1273), BA.1 
Omicron bivalent Omicron mRNA -1273.214, or  Omicron  BA.4/BA.5  bivalent mRNA -1273.222 
approximately 31 weeks between primary series and booster. Data shows increased 
immunogenicity of bivalent mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273.222 vaccines (7 - and 3 -fold 
increase , respectively  in BA.1 neutralization titers) & (4.2 - and 4.5 -fold increase , respectively  in 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralization titers) after BD in mice whereas limited immunogenicity was

protection from BA.5 infection in the lungs ( Scheaffer  et al 2022 ). 
In support of the development of mRNA -1273 for prophylaxis against SARS -CoV -2 infection, 
nonclinical immunogenicity, biodistribution, and safety studies have been completed with similar 
mRNA -based vaccines formulated in LNPs containing SM -102 (heptadecane -9-yl

1.2.2.  Clinical Studies   
The clinical development of mRNA -1273 vaccines to support its use in the adult population  
consists of 5 ongoing clinical trials being conducted in the US A: 
• Two Phase 1, open -label, dose ranging studies (Study 20 -0003; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; 
Study  21-0002, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) sponsored by the NIAID . 
• Phase 2a, randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -confirmation study 
(Study  mRNA -1273 -P201; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
• Phase 3 randomized, stratified, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study 
(Study  mRNA -1273 -P301;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of the vaccine . 
• Phase 3b, open -label study (Study mRNA -1273 -P304, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of the  vaccine in adult solid organ transplant recipients 
and healthy controls.  
In addition, 2 ongoing trials are being conducted in the pediatric population:  
• Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo -controlled safety and immunogenicity study of 
mRNA -1273 in children 12 to  <18 years of age (Study mRNA -1273 -P203 [current 
study]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
• Phase 2/3, study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 in 
children 6 months to <12 years of age (mRNA -1273 -P204; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
In addition, 4 ongoing trials are being conducted to support SARS -CoV -2 variants : 
• Study mRNA -1273 -P205 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is an open -label, Phase 2/3 study with 
multiple parts to evaluate  the safety and immunogenicity of boosters for SARS -CoV -
2 variants.  
• Study mRNA -1273 -P206 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is a Phase 2 , Part 1 open -label, Part 2 
randomized placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity of the bivalent mRNA1273.214 vaccine for SARS -CoV -2 variants of 
concern in infants aged 12 weeks to <6 months.  
• Study mRNA -1273 -P305 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is a Phase 2/3, randomized, observer -
blind, active -controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety 
of Omicron variant vaccines in comparison with mRNA -1273 (prototype) booster 
vaccine.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
1.2.2.1.  Phase 1 Study DMID20 -0003  
The safety and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 were evaluated in Phase 1 (DMID 20 -0003) and 
Phase 2 (P201) studies that were important to select and to confirm the dose of the vaccine used 
in the pivotal Phase 3 study. In Study 20 -0003 (Phase 1), 2 doses of 100 μg or higher generated 
the highest titers of nAb or bAb with an acceptable safety profile, and this observation was the 
basis for selecting the 100  μg dose for use in the pivotal  Phase 3 study. Importantly, the Ab 
levels after 2 doses of mRNA -1273 exceeded those from a pool of convalescent sera. 
Neutralizing activity was observed for the 100  μg mRNA -1273 dose as of Day  36 and was 
higher than that of the convalescent sera control group, and the median titers remained in the 
same range as the median titer in the convalescent sera control group at Day 119 across the age 
strata. In this study, the majority of the solicited ARs were mild or moderate. A  higher incidence 
of severe solici ted ARs was observed with the 250  μg dose (in the 18–55-year age cohort) 
compared with the lower doses (25 μg, 50 μg, and 100 μg); thus, the mRNA -1273 250  μg dose 
was not evaluated in participants ≥56 years of age. One severe unsolicited AE related to 
mRNA -1273 and 1 severe clinically meaningful elevation in serum lipase related to mRNA -1273 
were also observed with the 250  μg dose (in the 18–55-year age cohort). Additionally, in 
Study  20-0003, Th1 -directed CD4+ T -cells were observed to be induced across age  groups, with 
limited indication of a Th2 -directed response, and similar responses were observed among all 
age groups for the 100  μg dose. The predominance of a Th1 -directed T -cell profile helps mitigate 
concern of the risk of enhanced disease associated w ith Th2 -driven pathophysiology.  
1.2.2.2.  Phase 2 Study mRNA -1273 -P201   
Study P201 is an ongoing Phase 2a, safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity study in healthy 
adults that provided c onfirmation of the immunogenicity of both the 100  μg and 50  µg doses. 
The study was designed as a randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled dose -confirmation 
study (Part A). Two mRNA -1273 dose levels, 50 μg and 100  μg, and placebo were evaluated in 
2 age cohorts: Cohort  1 enrolled participants ≥ 18 to < 55 years old (300  participants), and 
Cohort  2 enrolled participants ≥  55 years old (300  participants). A total of 600 participants 
received either mRNA -1273 or placebo according to a 1:1:1  randomization ratio,  ie, within each 
age cohort, 100  participants each received mRNA -1273 50 μg, mRNA -1273 100  μg, or placebo.  
An amendment to the Study 201 protocol adapted the study design to include open -label 
interventional phases (Part B and Part C). Part B allowed  unblinding of participants and offered 
2 injections of mRNA -1273 in an open -label manner, 28 days apart, to all participants who 
received placebo in Part A. Part B also offered a single BD of mRNA -1273 (50 μg) to 
participants who received 1 or 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (50 μg or 100 μg) in Part A. Part C was 
prompted by the need to proactively prepare for vaccination strategies that might induce broader 
protection, including against emerging variants of SARS -CoV -2 such as B.1.351. Part C enrolled 
participants f rom Study 301 who received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 100 μg at least 6 months 
prior. Part C participants received a single injection of mRNA -1273.351 (20 μg or 50 μg) or 
mRNA -1273.351 mixture (50 μg total – 25 μg of mRNA -1273 and 25 μg of mRNA -1273.351).

this study at both dose levels and both age cohorts, as observed through 6 months after the 
second injection. Vaccination with mRNA -1273 in Study 201 resulted in robust  immune 
responses to SARS -CoV -2 in participants 18 years and older at both dose levels, and persistence 
of immune response was observed up to 6 months after the second injection in Part A of the 
study. In Part A of Study 201, the time course and magnitude of antibody (both bAb and nAb) 
responses to mRNA -1273 was similar between 100 μg and 50 μg dose levels at each postbaseline 
timepoint (Days 29, 43, 57, and 209), although the 100 μg dose group had numerically greater 
responses (and was the dose selected fo r the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study). In Part B of 
Study  201, administration of a 50 μg BD of mRNA -1273 6 months or more after the primary 
series improved the immune responses to 1.7 -fold the peak achieved after the primary 
vaccination series in the curre nt mRNA -1273 -P301 study, where efficacy of mRNA -1273 
against COVID -19 was demonstrated.  Safety data based on preliminary results for 50 μg BDs of 
mRNA -1273 (selected participants in Part B) or mRNA -1273.351 (Part C Cohort 1) are 
available. Percentages of p articipants with solicited local and systemic AEs were similar in the 
group who received mRNA -1273.351 as a BD compared to those who received mRNA -1273 
vaccine as a BD. The majority of solicited local and systemic AEs were mild ( Grade 1) or 
moderate ( Grade 2). The frequency of any Grade 3 solicited local or systemic AE was 15% (3 of 
20 participants) after the BD of mRNA -1273 and 10.5% (2 of 19 participants) after the BD of 
mRNA -1273.351. There were no Grade 4 solicited local or systemic AEs. The most common  
solicited local AE was injection site pain after injection in both groups (68.4% for the 
mRNA -1273.351 vaccine and 90.0% for the mRNA -1273 vaccine). The most common solicited 
systemic AEs after the BD of the mRNA -1273.351 vaccine were fatigue (36.8%), headache 
(36.8%), myalgia (31.6%), and arthralgia (21.1%). The most common solicited systemic AEs 
after the BD of the mRNA -1273 vaccine were fatigue (70.0%), headache (55.0%), arthralgia 
(50.0%), and myalgia (45.0%). Fever was reported after the BD of mRNA -1273 in 3 of 
20 participants (15%) but not after the BD of mRNA -1273.351 (0 of 19 participants). There were 
no SAEs reported in this study.  
1.2.2.3.  Phase 2/3 Study mRNA -1273 -P205   
Part G  of Study P205 will evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of the 
mRNA -1273.214 vaccine (contains the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and the Omicron variant spike 
sequences) when administered as a single BD to adult participants who have previously received 
the mRNA -1273 primary series as well as a BD. The results of the mRNA -1273.214 vaccine will 
be compared to the immunogenicity induced after an mRNA -1273 BD, in individuals who also 
previously received the 2 -dose primary series of mRNA -1273. Interi m results are available. 
Part H of the study will evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of the 
mRNA -1273.222 vaccine (contains the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and the Omicron variant 
BA.4/BA.5 spike sequences) when administered as a single BD to adult participants who have 
previously received the mRNA -1273 primary series as well as a BD. The results of the 
mRNA -1273.222 vaccine will be compared with the immunogenicity induced after an 
mRNA -1273 BD in participants who also previously received the 2-dose primary series of 
mRNA -1273. Results from this study are pending.

mRNA -1273.214:  
The bivalent booster vaccine, 50 μg mRNA -1273.214 contains equal amounts of the mRNA  
sequence for the S protein, 25 μg of the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and 25 μg of the Omicron spike  
mRNA sequence. The immunogenicity of 50 μg mRNA -1273.214 was evaluated in Part G of the 
P205 Study when administered as a second BD in adults who previously received 2  doses of 
100 μg mRNA -1273 as a primary series and a single BD of 50 μg mRNA -1273. The IA of 
Study  P205 showed that all primary and key secondary immunogenicity objectives were met 
based on the prespecified testing sequence. The mRNA -1273.214 dose of 50 μg elic ited a 
superior nAb response against Omicron and a noninferior neutralizing response against the 
ancestral SARS -CoV -2 strain compared with the 50 μg mRNA -1273 28 days after the BD. 
Specifically, in the primary analysis set, defined as participants without evidence of prior  
SARS -CoV -2 infection, the estimated Day 29 nAb GMTs (95% CI) against the ancestral 
SARS -CoV -2 (D614G) were 6422.3 (5990.1, 6885.7) and 5286.6 (4887.1, 5718.9) 28 days after 
the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 BDs, respectively. The GMR (97.5%  CI) was 1.22 (1.08, 
1.37), meeting the prespecified criterion for noninferiority (lower bound of 97.5% CI >0.667). 
The Day 29 SRR (95% CI) against ancestral SARS -CoV-2 was 100% (98.9, 100 and 98.6, 100) 
28 days after in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 gro ups, respectively, with an SRR 
difference of 0, meeting the noninferiority criterion (lower bound of CI > -10%). In participants 
who received the mRNA -1273.214 , who were SARS -CoV -2 positive, baseline nAb GMT against 
the ancestral strain as well as 28 days p ost BD were higher than those who were SARS -CoV -2 
negative ( Chalkias  et al 2022b ). 
The estimated Day 29 nAb GMTs against Omicron were 2479.9 (2264.5, 2715.8) and 1421.2 
(1283.0, 1574.4) in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 groups, respectively. The GMR 
(97.5% CI) was 1.75 (1.49, 2.04), which met the prespecified superiority criterion (lower bound 
of CI > 1). The Day 29 Omicron SRRs (95% CI) were 100% (98.9, 100) and 99.2% (97.2, 99.9) 
in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 groups , respectively. The SRR difference (97.5% CI) 
was 1.5% ( -1.1, 4.0), meeting noninferiority criteria (lower bound of CI > -10%).  
All immunogenicity endpoints were also met based on an analysis that included participants with 
and without evidence of prebooste r SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
Additionally, in the primary analysis set (PPSI – Neg, reflecting participants without prior  
SARS -CoV -2 infection), the observed GMTs (95% CI) against Omicron BA.4 /BA5 GMTs 
(95%  CI) prebooster were 115.6 (98.5, 135.6) and increased to 727.4 (632.9, 836.1) at 28 days 
after the BD for mRNA -1273.214 with a GMFR (95% CI) of 6.3 (5.7, 6.9). The GMTs  
(95%  CIs) in the mRNA -1273.214  group were 139.7 (119.5, 163.3) prebooster and 492.1 (431.1,  
561.9) 28 days after the BD, and the GMFR (95% CI ) was 3.5 (3.2, 3.9). The GMR  (95% CI) for 
the comparison of mRNA -1273.214 50 μg BD with the mRNA -1273 50  μg BD was 1.69 (1.51, 
1.90) with the lower bound of the CI > 1 (See IB V8 Addendum  2). 
On the basis of these results, the mRNA -1273.214 (50 μg) elicited superior nAb responses 
against the Omicron subvariants BA.4, BA.5 compared with mRNA -1273 (50 μg) (nominal α of 
0.05) and the BA.4, BA.5 nAb response was consistently higher in the mRNA -1273 .214 group 
compared to the mRNA -1273 group in participants with and without prior SARS -CoV -2 
infection.

[427.4 -558.4] and 5651.4 (5055.7 -6317.3) respectively, at day 29 post -boost in participants with 
no prior SARS -CoV -2-infection. A randomly selected subgroup (N=60) of participants in the 
mRNA -1273.222 group also exhibited cross -neutralization a gainst the emerging omicron 
variants BQ.1.1 and XBB.1. No new safety concerns were identified with mRNA -1273.222. 
Vaccine effectiveness was not assessed in this study; in an exploratory analysis 1.6% (8/511) of 
mRNA -1273.222 recipients had Covid -19 post -boost (Chalkias et al 2022c ). 
Safety:  
The safety and reactogenicity of 50 μg mRNA -1273.214 was evaluated in the  Part G of Study 
P205 when administered as a second BD in adults who previously  received 2 doses of 100  μg 
mRNA -1273 as a primary series and a single BD of 50 μg  mRNA -1273. The 50  μg 
mRNA -1273.214 second BD was administered a median of 136 days after a first BD of the 
50 μg mRNA -1273 and had a median follow -up duration of 43 days (range 22 to 51 days). The 
50 μg mRNA -1273.214 was well -tolerated and had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of the 
50 μg mRNA -1273 when given as a second BD. The incidence of ARs after immunization with 
50 μg mRNA -1273.214 was also similar or lower relative to that of a first BD of 50  μg 
mRNA -1273 and relative to the second dose of the 100 μg mRNA‑1273 primary series. No new 
safety signals were identified.  
The overall occurrence of solicited local ARs within 7 days following second  BDs was 79.4% 
and 79.5% in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 groups,  respectively. The most common 
solicited local AR was injection site pain for any Grade event in both groups (77.3% and 76.6% 
in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 group, respectively). The incidences of systemic ARs 
were 70.3% in the mRNA -1273.214 and 66.1% in the mRNA - 1273 groups, and the most 
frequent ARs for any Grade event were fatigue (54.9% and 51.4%), headache (43.9% and 
41.1%), and myalgia (39.6% and 38.6%) in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 groups, 
respectively. The majority of solicited A Rs were mild  to moderate (Grades 1 -2) for both groups. 
The incidence of Grade 3 events was 8.0% in both groups, with the most common being fatigue 
(3.4% and 3.1%) and myalgia (2.3% and 3.7%), for the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 
groups, respectively. No Gra de 4 events occurred in either group  (See IB V8  Addendum  2). 
The unsolicited AEs were reported in 18.5% of participants in the mRNA -1273.214 group and 
20.7% in the mRNA -1273 group regardless of the relationship to vaccination up to 28 days after 
the second BD. In the mRNA -1273.214 group, 2 (0.5%) participants each e xperienced 2 SAEs 
(prostate cancer and traumatic fracture) and 1 (0.3%) participant in the mRNA -1273 group

fatal events or AEs leading to study discontinuation that were related to vaccination as assessed 
by investigators. As of the data cutoff date, no deaths or AEs of special interest, including cases 
of myocarditis or pericarditis, occurred, and 1 additional SAE (Grade 3, nephrolithiasis)

1.2.2.4.  Phase 3 Study mRNA -1273 -P301   
Currently, a Phase 3 pivotal, randomized, placebo -controlled, observer -blind clinical Study P301 
is being conducted in participants 18 years of age and older who are at an increased risk of 
COVID -19 disease. In addition, prespecified cohorts of participants who were either ≥65 years 
of age or 18  to <65 years of age with comorb id medical conditions were included. A total of 
30351 participants were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1 -122) for the development of 
COVID -19 disease. Success criteria for early efficacy were met at first IA based on 95 
adjudicated cases with a V E of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5%, 97.8%; one -sided p -value < 0.0001). 
Study  P301 is expected to provide immunogenicity data where an Ab threshold of protection 
against COVID -19 will be estimated.  
In Study P301, solicited ARs were reported more frequently among vac cine participants than 
placebo participants. The most frequently reported ARs after any dose in the vaccine group were 
pain at the injection site (92.0% any Grade; 6.1% Grade ≥ 3), fatigue (70% any Grade; 10.1% 
Grade ≥ 3), headache (64.7% any Grade; 5.7% Grade ≥3), myalgia (61.5% any Grade; 9.1% 
Grade ≥ 3) and chills (45.4% any Grade; 1.4% Grade ≥ 3). The majority of local and systemic 
ARs had a median duration of 1 to 3 days. Overall, there was a higher reported rate of some ARs 
in younger age groups: the incidence of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, 
arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in 
those aged 65 years and above. Grade 3 solicited local ARs were more frequently reported  after 
Dose 2 than after Dose 1. In the participants who received the vaccine, solicited systemic ARs 
were reported numerically more frequently by vaccine participants after Dose 2 than after 
Dose  1. Grade 3 systemic ARs (fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache) were reported more 
frequently after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. Unsolicited AEs and SAEs were reported at generally 
similar rates in participants who received mRNA -1273 and placebo from the first dose until the 
last observation. Unsolicited AEs tha t occurred in ≥ 1% of study participants who received 
mRNA -1273 and at a rate at least 1.5 -fold higher rate than placebo, were 
lymphadenopathy -related events (1.1% of versus 0.6%). All of the lymphadenopathy events are 
similar to the axillary swelling/tende rness in the injected arm reported as solicited ARs. 
Hypersensitivity AEs were reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo 
recipients. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included injection site rash and injection 
site urticaria, wh ich are likely related to vaccination. There have been no cases of severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions reported immediately after vaccination in the trial to 
date. There were 3  reports of Bell’s palsy in the mRNA -1273 vaccine group (one of wh ich was 
an SAE), which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after vaccination, and one in the placebo group, 
which occurred 17  days after vaccination. The currently available information on Bell’s palsy is 
insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the v accine. There were 2 SAEs of facial 
swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of 
swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination and was likely related to 
vaccination. There was 1  SAE of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with prior 
history of severe headache and nausea requiring hospitalization. This event occurred 1 day after 
vaccination and was likely related to vaccination.

The Sponsor submitted a data package to FDA on 30 Novem ber 2020 for consideration of EUA. 
FDA granted an EUA for mRNA -1273 for use in adults 18  years of age and older on 18 
December 2020.  
Efficacy and safety results based on the final analysis of Part A with a database lock of 
04 May 2021 are provided in the I B. The results are generally comparable to the IA. On 
25 Aug 2021, Moderna announced that it had completed the rolling submission process for its 
BLA to the FDA for the full licensure of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine (mRNA -1273) for 
active immunization to p revent COVID -19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. On 
31 Jan 2022, mRNA -1273 was granted full licensure by the US A FDA. mRNA -1273 has been 
showing durable efficacy of 93% through 6 months after the second dose.  
1.2.2.5.  Study mRNA -1273 -P203 - Interim Results   
Interim data from the current Part 1A of Study P203 (based on a data snapshot of 08 May 2021) 
show that the primary immunogenicity objective was met by demonstrating noninferior ity of 
both the (i) GM value of serum nAb and (ii) the seroconversion rate from adolescent participants 
compared with those from young adults (aged  18 to 25 years) enrolled in the ongoing Phase 3 
efficacy study (Study  P301). The GMR of adolescent (Study P2 03) to young adult (Study P301) 
nAb titers at Day 57 was 1.077 (95% CI: 0.939, 1.236), meeting the 1.5 -fold noninferiority 
criterion (ie, lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR is >0.667). The difference in adolescent to 
young adult nAb SRR s at Day 57 was 0.2  (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4), meeting the 10% noninferiority 
criterion (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR  difference is ≥ -10%). In addition, results of VE 
against COVID -19, defined using either the “Study  P301 case definition” or the “CDC case 
definition”, and condu cted starting 14 days after Dose 1 or Dose 2 were all similar to the 94.1% 
VE observed 14 days post  Dose 2 in the pivotal Study P301. Overall, local reactogenicity was 
higher and systemic reactogenicity was lower to mRNA -1273 in adolescents compared with that 
observed in the adult mRNA -1273 -P301 study. Both solicited local and systemic ARs were more 
comm only reported by participants in the mRNA -1273 group and systemic ARs generally 
increased after Dose 2. While the majority of these solicited ARs were Grade 1 or Grade 2, there 
was a higher frequency of Grade 3 or higher solicited ARs in the mRNA -1273 grou p than in the 
placebo group after Dose 1 and Dose 2. The majority of the solicited ARs in participants who 
received mRNA -1273 occurred within the first 1 to 2 days after any dose and generally persisted 
for a median of 1 to 3 days. The frequency of reporte d solicited ARs were generally similar and 
there were no notable differences in the reported rates of unsolicited AEs observed between 
participants aged ≥  12 to <  16 years and participants aged ≥ 16 to <18 years.  
Unsolicited treatment -emergent AE s (TEAEs ) up to 28 days after any dose were more common 
in the mRNA -1273 group than in the placebo group. Imbalances in unsolicited TEAEs up to 
28 days after any dose was primarily attributable to events related to reactogenicity . The 
incidence of MAAEs within 28  days of injection was generally similar between the mRNA -1273 
and placebo groups. The incidence of unsolicited severe TEAEs and serious TEAEs in the 
28 days after any dose was low overall and generally similar in participants who received 
mRNA -1273 and those who received placebo. Unsolicited TEAEs, including MAAEs, up to 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 66 28 days after any dose assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment were more 
frequently reported in the mRNA -1273 group than in the placebo group.  
Data from interim data cut of 31 Jan 2022 showed consistent immunogenicity and safety results 
as the first interim results (08 May 2021). The evidence from the 08 May 2021 data cutoff infers  
effectiveness, suggesting that mRNA -1273 is effective in preventing COVID -19, and the known 
and potential benefits of mRNA -1273 when used to prevent COVID‑19 outweigh the known and 
potential risks.  
The updated data collected as of 31 Jan 2022 included: (i) VE of the blinded phase updated as of 
31 May 2021; (ii) COVID -19 cases as of 31 Jan 2022; and (iii) safety data from all mRNA -1273 
recipients for the blinded and open‑label phases of the study.  
Vaccine efficacy through 31 May 2021 was 100% (95% CI: 61.2%, not estimated [NE]) using 
the P301 case definition and 89.9% (95% CI: 51.0%, 98.9%) using the CDC case definition. The 
updated analysis confirms results provided in the EUA Amendment submitted on 09 Jun 2021 
based on the 08 May 2021 data cutoff). Beyond 31 May 2021, the loss of placebo participants 
precluded meaningful analysis of VE. Long -term ass essment of monthly incidence rates among 
all participants who received mRNA -1273 as randomized and remained on study up to 
31 Jan 2022 (combined blinded and unblinded) shows low monthly incidence rates of 
COVID -19 until November 2021. Not unexpectedly, an increase in COVID -19 incidence rates 
was observed in December 2021 and January 2022, when the Omicron variant prevailed . 
Neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant was evaluated in a small subset (N=20 each 
study) of serum samples randomly selected from adults (≥ 18 years) in the pivotal P301 study, 
and from adolescents (≥ 12 to <18 years) in Study P203 following a 2 -dose regimen of 100 μg 
mRNA -1273 and from children (6 to <12 years) in Study mRNA -1273 -P204 after 2 doses of 
50 μg mRNA -1273. In adolescents, nAb measured against Omicron was present in all 
participants (100%) 4 weeks after Dose 2. The GMT against Omicron was 11.8 -fold lower than 
that measured against D614G among adolescents. Compared with adults, adolescent GMTs were 
1.5- and 3.8‑f old higher for D614G and the Omicron variant, respectively ( Girard  et al 2022 ). 
mRNA -1273 was found to be generally safe in clinical Study P203 with no new safety signals in 
either the 08 May 2021 initial EUA Amendment data cu toff or the longer -term safety cut of 
31 Jan 2022. The overall safety profile observed in the adolescent study (Study P203) was 
generally consistent with the findings to date in the Phase 3 Study P301 in adults aged ≥ 18 years. 
In the long -term safety follo w-up, SAEs were reported for 22/2577 participants (0.9%) overall. 
No SAEs were assessed by investigators as related to study vaccine and there were no fatal 
events. MAAEs were reported for 1002/2577 participants (38.9%) overall. MAAEs considered 
by the inv estigator to be related to mRNA -1273 were reported for 26 participants (1.0%). The 
incidence of MAAEs reflects the Omicron surge. Three participants in the mRNA -1273 group 
discontinued study vaccine because of a TEAE. AESIs were reported for 13 participant s. In the 
open -label, cross over phase, there was 1 probable case of myocarditis (adjudicated by cardiac 
endpoint adjudication committee) observed in the Study P203 clinical program which occurred 
1 day following second dose but did not require hospitalizat ion and completely resolved by 
8 days postvaccination with no sequelae at 5 months of follow -up (Study  mRNA -1273 -P203 data 
on file) .

demonstrate effectiveness of a mR NA-1273 BD (50  µg) in adolescents 12 to <18 years inferred 
based on comparison of adolescent nAb responses to those post -mRNA -1273 primary series in 
young adults in Study P301. Results echo the successful immunobridging of the primary series 
for this same age group. Prespecified NI immunogenicity criteria were met for adolescents 
(GMR point estimate 5.071 and lower bound of the 95% CI of 4.477; SRR difference point 
estimate of 0.7% and lower bound of the 95% CI of -0.8%) allowing effectiveness of a 50 μg BD  
of mRNA -1273 in adolescents 12 to <18 years to be inferred. There were no new safety findings 
observed in the mRNA -1273 Booster Phase of Study P203 and in general, the BD showed less 
reactogenicity than the primary series. Most solicited ARs were reported  within 2 days, were 
Grade 1 or 2 and lasted a median of 2 to 3 days. Pain was the most frequently reported solicited 
local AR and headache and fatigue were the most frequently reported solicited systemic AR. 
There were no SAEs or AESIs reported in the 28 days after BD. There were no reported deaths 
or cases of MIS -C, and even with the enhanced surveillance implemented in this study, no TEAE 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis was identified. Up to the time of data cutoff 
(15 Aug 2022), the unsolicited AE profile, including SAEs and AESIs, demonstrated events 
typically observed in an adolescent population during the COVID -19 pandemic (CSR 
Addendum  1). 
Results from Part 2 data snapshot as of 01 May 2023, show robust nAb responses 28 days after  
1 dose of 50  µg mRNA -1273 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive participants.  After 28 days post  
dose 1 of 50  µg mRNA -1273, the GMC levels in the adolescent baseline -positive participants 
increased to 18 -fold higher than the baseline GMC levels (GMC=6053.2 [95% CI: 4495.8, 
8150.1]). Despite the higher baseline nAb responses observed in adolescent baseline -positive 
participants, the GMC post  dose 1 of 50 -µg mRNA -1273 was observed to be higher than those 
observed post  primary series in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young adults in Study P301 
(GMC=1400 .4 [95% CI: 1272.7, 1541.0) with a GMR of 4.322 (95% CI: 3.274, 5.707). The 
seroresponse rates were comparable between the Study P203 adolescents (97.5%, n=39/40) and 
Study P301 young adults (99.3%, n=292/294), with SRR difference of -1.8% (95% CI: -12.2%, 
0.8%). Administration of the second dose did not increase the neutralizing antibody response to 
the degree which was observed in baseline SARS -CoV2 negative participants (mRNA -1273 
Part 2 Data Memo) . 
Results from Part 3  IA (data cutoff of 05 Jun 2023 ) demonstrate that after 28 days post Dose 1 of 
50 µg mRNA -1273.222, the GMC levels against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in the adolescent 
baseline -positive participants increased to 18 -fold higher than the baseline GMC levels 
(GMC=2771.0 [95% CI: 2500.8, 3070.3]). The GMC post Dose 1 of 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 
was o bserved to be higher than those observed post -primary series in baseline SARS -CoV -2 
negative young adults in Study P301 (GMC=56.6 [95% CI: 54.5, 58.8). The rate of seroresponse 
against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 was high (94.7%) in study  P203 Part 3 adolescents  whereas 
none of the P301 young adults seroconverted against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5, 28 days after 
Dose 2 of the 100 µg mRNA -1273 primary series; the difference in SRR was 94.7% (95%  CI: 
91.1%, 96.9%). In addition, the GMC levels against the ancestral strai n in the adolescent 
baseline -positive participants increased to 13.6 -fold 28 days post Dose 1 compared to baseline 
GMC levels (Day 29 GMC=7187.1 [95% CI: 6495.3, 7952.7]). The GMC post Dose  1 of 50  µg 
mRNA -1273.222 in adolescent baseline -positive participa nts was observed to be higher than 
those observed post -primary series in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young adults in

Confidential  Page 68 Study  P301 (GMC=1692.3 [95% CI: 1537.4, 1862.7). The rates of seroresponse against the 
ancestral strain were comparable between the study P203 Part 3 adolescents (94.6%) and study 
P301 young adults (99.3%); the difference in SRR was -4.7% (95% CI: -8.4%, -2.1%). The 
GMR of Study P203 Part 3 Day 29 GMC against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 compared with young 
adults in Study P301, Day 57 GMC was 48.953 ( 95% CI: 44.209, 54.206), meeting the 
superiority criterion (ie, lower bound of the 95% CI >1.0). The GMR of Study P203 Part 3 
Day 29 GMC against ancestral strain compared with young adults in Study P301, Day 57 GMC 
was 4.247 (95%  CI: 3.693, 4.884), meeting  the noninferiority criterion (ie, lower bound of the 
95% CI >0.667). The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective 
were met, thus enabling the inference of vaccine effectiveness of the single 50  µg 
mRNA -1273.222 in Study 203 P art 3 from that observed in Study  P301 . 
Based on  Part 3 IA  results and the approval of the updated monovalent COVID -19 vaccine  
containing the spike proteins for the XBB.1.5 sublineage of SARS -CoV -2, the second dose in 
Part 3 was removed . 
In the post-EUA period, anaphylaxis has been reported following mRNA -1273 administration. 
There have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination 
with COVID -19 mRNA vaccines.  A detailed review of the clinical experience with LNPs 
containing SM -102 (mRNA vaccines and placebo) is provided in the IB.  
1.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment   
1.3.1.  Potential Benefits from Participation   
The following benefits may accrue to participants:  
• The mRNA -1273 and mRNA -1273.222 vaccines may be effective against COVID -19 
including disease caused by variants of concern.  
• Participants will have a baseline (Day  1) evaluation for SARS -CoV -2 infection and 
ongoing surveillance for COVID -19 throughout the study.  
• The study will contribute to the development of a vaccine against COVID -19 for 
adolescents.  
1.3.2.  Risks to Study Participants and Risk Mitigation   
Immediate systemic allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) can occur following any vaccination. 
These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per  450,000 vaccinations for 
vaccines that do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). As a 
precaution, all participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes 
after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by 
the pain or anxiety caused by the injection and is not related to the substance injected. Therefore, 
it is important that standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoi d injury from 
fainting.  
IM injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by the Sponsor containing the SM -102 
lipid formulation commonly results in a transient and self -limiting local inflammatory reaction. 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 69 This typically includes pain, erythema (redness ), or swelling (hardness) at the injection site, 
which are mostly mild to moderate in severity and usually occur within 24 hours of injection.  
The majority of local and systemic solicited ARs observed after injection with mRNA -1273 at 
the 100  µg dose level  have been mild to moderate in severity ( Section  1.2.2 ). The most 
commonly reported systemic ARs were headache, myalgia, fatigue, chills, and fever. In the 
majority of cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously within several days.  
There is a theoretical risk that active vaccination to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection may cause a 
paradoxical increase in the risk of COVID -19. This possibility is based on t he rare phenomenon 
of vaccine -associated disease enhancement, which was first seen in the 1960s with 2 vaccines 
made in the same way (formalin -inactivated whole virus) and designed to protect children 
against infection with respiratory syncytial virus ( Chin  et al 1969 ) or measles virus 
(Fulginiti  et al 1967 ). Disease enhancement has also been proposed as a possible explanation for 
cases of more serious disease associated with dengue vaccination ( Thomas  and Yoon  2019 ; 
WHO  2019 ). 
In order to address this theoretical risk, animal studies were performed in young and aged 
wild-type mice and rhesus macaques (NHPs). These studies were designed to capture 
immunogenicity endpoints that would be predictive of ERD and also to evaluate if, at protective 
or subprotective dose levels of mRNA -1273, evidence of disease enhancement would be 
observed after challenge of the animals with SARS -CoV -2. These noncl inical studies 
demonstrated that mRNA -1273 is safe and well -tolerated in different animal species, is 
immunogenic; drives a robust SARS -CoV -2-specific Ab, neutralization, and Th1 -directed CD4 
T-cell response; fully protects animals from challenge at dose l evels as low as 1  μg/dose in mice 
and 30  μg/dose in NHPs; and does not lead to ERD at protective or subprotective dose levels 
(Corbett  et al 2020a ; Corbett  et al 2020b ). Clinical immunogenicit y data from the DMID Phase  1 
study of mRNA -1273 demonstrated high levels of nAbs and Th1 -polarized CD4+ T -cell 
responses ( Jackson  et al 2020 ), consistent with the immunogenicity observed in these nonclinical 
studies. These da ta suggest that a paradoxical increase in the risk of disease, while not 
eliminated, is likely to be low.  
In individuals 18 years of age and older, there have been very rare reports of myocarditis and 
pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Moderna C OVID -19 vaccine. The majority of the 
cases have been reported in young males shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are 
typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard 
treatment and rest ( Gargano  et al 2021 ). One probable case of myocarditis was reported in this 
study with features consistent with this typical mild, short -lived pattern 
(Study  mRNA -1273 -P203 data on file ). Recent data from an observational study ( Wong  2022 ) 
conducted in 4 large US administrative health plan claims databases covering more than 
100 million persons, (OptumServe, HealthCore, Blue Health Intelligence, and CVS Health) 
observed no statistical difference in risk rates of myocarditis/pericarditis following any dose of 
2 mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. Moreover, recently published data from a health care 
organization in Israel estimated the incidence of myocarditis due to COVID‐19 infection as 
11.0 cases per 100 ,000 persons (95% CI: 5.6 –15.8), compared to the nearly five -fold lower 
incidence of myocarditis observed following the 2nd dose of mRNA -1273 (highest incidence 
rate) at 2.17  per 100,000 person -days (95% CI: 1.55 -3.04) ( Wong  2022 ). Other studies also show 
that myocarditis cases related to COVID‐19 infection revealed a higher mortality rate and rate of 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 70 severe complications compared to myocarditis cases following vaccination with a COVID -19 
mRNA vaccine ( Patel  et al 2022 ). Moreover, infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 has more adverse 
events beyond myocarditis, including many carrying significant risk for death.  
In adults, the AEs after receiving a third dose of mRNA -1273 are described in Section 1.2.2 . In 
general, solicited local and systemic ARs after the BD (Study P201) were comparable to what 
had been observed with the primary series (Study P301). Preliminary report from a heterologous 
booster study in adults show r eactogenicity and adverse events were similar across booster 
groups  (Atmar  et al 2021 ). 
1.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion   
All participants in Part 1 will receive a single dosage of 100 g mRNA -1273 vaccine or placebo 
administered in 2  doses 28 days apart ( Section  3.1). Participants in Part 1A who received 
mRNA -1273 will be offered an option to receive a third BD of 50 µg of mRNA -1273 at least 
5 months from second dose in Part 1C -1. Participants  in Part 1A who received placebo will be 
offered to receive a single dose of 100 µg mRNA -1273 vaccine administered in 2  doses 28  days 
apart in Part 1B and a third BD of 50 µg of mRNA -1273 at least 5 months from second dose in 
Part 1C -1. All participants in  Part 1C -2 will receive a single BD of 50 µg of mRNA -1273. 
Participants in Part 2 will receive a single dosage of 50 µg mRNA -1273 vaccine administered in 
2 doses 28 days apart  with or without a booster dose . Participants in Part 3 will receive 1 or 
2 doses  of 50 µg bivalent mRNA -1273.222 vaccine.  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study ( Section  7.6). 
Considering the limited number of approved vac cines for COVID -19, the participants’ risk of 
COVID -19 outside the study during a pandemic, and the nonclinical and clinical data to date, the 
Sponsor considers the potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.

3.1.1.  Part 1 Study Design   
This is a three -part, Phase 2/3 study: Part 1A, Part 1B, and Part 1C. P articipants in Part 1A, the 
Blinded Phase, are blinded to their treatment assignment.  
Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase of this study, is designed to offer participants who 
received placebo in Part 1A of this study and who meet the EUA eligibilit y criteria an option to 
receive mRNA -1273 in an open -label fashion ( Figure  3). Participants who received mRNA -1273 
(100 µg) in Part 1A of this study will proceed to Part 1B after they are unblinded and will 
continue to follow the Part 1A SoA ( Table  10). Part 1C -1, the Homologous Booster Dose Phase,  
is designed to offer participants in Part 1A and Part 1B, and who are at least 5 months from the 
last dose, the option to request a BD of 50 µg mRNA -1273. Part 1C -2, the Heterologous Booster 
Phase, is designed to provide participants who completed non-Mod erna primary COVID -19 
vaccination series under EUA (ie, Pfizer) a 50 µg BD of mRNA -1273 at least 3 months from the 
last dose.

12 months for dosing (on Day 1, Day 29, and Day 209 for BD), and 12 months for follow -up. 
Participants who received placebo in Part 1A will be in the study for approximately 25  months 
total if a BD  is received in Part 1C -1, which includes approximately 9 months in Part 1A and 
approximately 4 months of follow -up following their second dose of mRNA -1273 in Part 1B 
before entering Part 1C -1 or before BD is received; or approximately 12 months of follow -up. 
Participants that decline unblinding or decline to receive a BD will be in the study approximately 
14 months total, which includes 1 month for Screening (Day -28 to Day 1), 1 month for dosing 
(on Day 1 and Day 29), and 12 months for follow -up. 
Participants in Part 1C -2 will be in the study for approximately 12 months total, which includes 
7 days for Screening  (Day -7 to Day 1), 1 day of dosing (BD -Day 1), and 12 months of 
follow -up. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, G CP, and all applicable regulatory 
requirements . 
3.1.1.1.  Part 1A, the Blinded Phase   
The blinded phase of this study is a randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study 
intended to i nfer the effectiveness of mRNA -1273 in an adolescent population aged 12 to 
< 18 years. The study includes 2  arms: (i) 100  µg of mRNA -1273, and (ii) placebo. 
Approximately, 3000  participants between 12  to < 18 years of age will be randomly assigned in a 
2:1 ratio to receive mRNA -1273 (n=2000) or placebo (n=1000).  
The schematic of study arms and major study events for Part 1A is illustrated in Figure  2 and the 
SoA for Part 1A is located in Table  10. 
The goal of the study is to seek an ind ication for use of mRNA -1273 (100  µg IM, given as 
2 injections, 28 days apart) in the 12  to < 18 years age group. The basis for demonstrating 
vaccine effectiveness is proposed to be met by serum Ab response measured in this adolescent 
age group. The approa ch to inferring vaccine effectiveness will depend on whether an accepted 
serum Ab threshold conferring protection against COVID -19 has been established. If an Ab 
threshold of protection has been established, effectiveness will be inferred based on the 
proportion of adolescent study participants with serum Ab levels (on Day 57) that meet or 
exceed the Ab threshold. If an Ab threshold of protection has not been established, effectiveness 
will be inferred by demonstrating noninferiority of both (i) the GM valu e of serum nAb and (ii) 
the SRR  from adolescent participants compared with those from young adults ( 18 to 25  years of 
age) enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study  P301). The statistical 
parameters to infer effectiveness are describe d in Section  2. 
This study in adolescents will monitor all participants for a total of 12 months following the 
second dose of vaccine or placebo. Saf ety assessments will include solicited ARs (7  days after 
each injection), unsolicited AEs (28 days after each injection), MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs 
(including MIS -C) throughout the study period.  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants at baselin e (Day 1), Day  57 (28  days after 
Dose  2), Day  209 (6 months after Dose  2), and Day  394 for measurement of 
ModernaTX, Inc.

Confidential  Page 82 SARS -CoV -2-specific bAb and nAb responses. Blood samples will also be tested for the 
development of Ab directed against nonvaccine antigen (eg, Ab against the nucleocapsid 
protein), which will signify infection with SARS -CoV -2. The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 
infection among vaccine recipients and placebo recipients will be compared to assess the 
potential for mRNA -1273 to reduce the rate of infection in  vaccine recipients.

The study duration will be approximately 14 months, which includes 1 month for Screening  
(Day  ˗28 to Day 1), 1 month for dosing (on Day 1 and Day 29), and, for participants who 
received mRNA -1273 in Part 1A, 12 months of follow -up after the second dose to monitor for 
safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Participants who received placebo in Part 1A will still be

following their second dose of mRNA -1273 in Part 1B before receiving a BD.  
Note: Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day ( Table  10). 
After providing informed consent/assent, participants will undergo Screening  assessments to 
determine study eligibility. Screening assessments ( Table  10) must be completed after signing 
the ICF/assent form. The investigator will review study entry criteria to determine the participant 
eligibility during the Screening Period.  
Eligible participants will enter the Treatment Period.

Confidential  Page 83 On Day  1, after the compl etion of the scheduled assessments ( Table  10), participants will be 
administered a single IM dose of mRNA -1273 (100  µg) or placebo (procedures will be detailed 
in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual). Participants will be closely monitored for safety 
and will remain at the study site for observation for at least 30 minutes after dosing. On Day  29, 
the second dose of IP will be administered. Participants w ill be monitored for 12 months after the 
second dose of IP for safety and immunogenicity assessments.  
To test for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR, NP or nasal swab samples will be 
collected on each day of injection prior to dosing and on  Day 57 (28 da ys post  Dose 2) , 
according to the SoA ( Table  10). 
During the course of the study, participants who meet prespecified disease criteria that suggest 
possi ble SARS -CoV -2 infection will be asked to contact the study site to arrange for a prompt, 
thorough, and careful assessment, including an NP or nasal swab sample to be tested for the 
presence of SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR. Confirmed, symptomatic cases of SARS -CoV -2 infection 
will be captured as MAAEs and reported in an expedited time frame to the Sponsor 
(Section  7.4.3 ). 
All participants will be monitored for safety and reactogenicity and provide predose and 
postdose blood specimens for immunogenicity through 12 months after the second dose of 
mRNA -1273.  
Participants will be instructed on the day of the first dose (Day 1) and reminded on the day of the 
second dose (Day  29) how to document and report solicited local or systemic ARs in a provided 
eDiary. Solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to wit hdrawal, AESIs, and SAEs 
will be assessed as described in Section  7.1, according to the timepoints in the SoA ( Table  10). 
Blood sampling for immunogenicity testing is scheduled throughout the study: on the day of 
injection before the first dose and 1, 6, and 12  months after the second dose.  
Participan ts may experience AEs that necessitate an unscheduled visit, including situations when 
the investigator asks a participant to return to the study clinic for an unscheduled visit following 
the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be conducted at the se visits as necessary to 
ensure the safety and well -being of participants during the study. eCRF  should be completed for 
each unscheduled visit.  
3.1.1.2.  Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase   
Part 1B, the Open -label Observational  Phase of the study, will be prompted by the authorization 
of a COVID -19 vaccine under an EUA for any persons under the age of 18 years. Par ticipants 
will be transitioned to Part 1B of the study as their age group becomes EUA -eligible. This 
transition permits all ongoing study participants to eventually be informed of the availability and 
eligibility criteria of any COVID -19 vaccine made avail able under an EUA and the option to 
offer all ongoing study participants an opportunity to schedule a Participant Decision Visit to 
know their original treatment assignment (placebo vs. mRNA -1273 100 µg vaccine).  
Part 1B provides the opportunity for study participants to be informed regarding the EUA, to be 
unblinded to their original assignment (mRNA -1273 or placebo), and, for those who previously 
received placebo, to actively request to receive 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (100 µg) vaccine.

At the Participant Decision Clinic Visit ( Table  11), EUA -eligible participants will:  
• Be given the option to be unblinded as to their original group assignment (placebo vs. 
mRNA -1273 vaccine [100 µg]),  
• Be counseled about the importance of continuing other public health measur es to 
limit the spread of disease including social distancing, wearing a mask, and 
hand -washing,  
• Sign a revised ICF and assent if not signed at a previous clinic visit, and  
• Provide an NP or nasal swab for RT -PCR for SARS -CoV -2 and a blood sample for 
serology and immunogenicity.  
Participants that decline unblinding will remain in Part 1A and follow the Part 1A SoA in  
Table  10. 
After the Participan t Decision Clinic Visit, participants that consent to unblinding will follow the 
Part 1A SoA ( Table  10) or Part 1B SoA ( Table  12) as follows:  
• Participants received placebo in Part 1A and consent to receiving 2  doses of 
mRNA -1273 in Part 1B : These participants will proceed to Part 1B and follow the 
Part 1B SoA in Table  12 until BD is offered.  
• Participants received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 in Part 1A:  Due to statistical 
considerations, these participants will be considered in the Open -label Observational 
Phase but w ill continue to follow the Part 1A SoA in Table  10 until BD is offered.

Part 1C -1 Homologous Booster Phase is designed to offer participants in Part 1A and Part 1B, 
who are at least 5 months from the last dose, the option to request a BD (50 µg) of mRNA -1273.  
If eligible, each study participa nt will receive a notification letter and will be asked to schedule a 
BD-1 Visit at their study site. Principal investigators should consider current local public health 
guidance for administration of COVID -19 vaccines under EUA and marketing authorization  (if 
any) when determining the scheduling priority of participants.

At the BD -1 Visit, each participant will:  
• Be encouraged to remain in the ongoing study,  
• Sign a revised ICF that includes both updated safety information relevant to the 
ongoing study and a BD, and the option to receive a BD,  
• Be given the option to receive  a BD consisting of a 50 μg dose of mRNA -1273,

The investigator is responsible for conducting all assessments as spec ified in the Part 1C -1 
Supplemental SoA, according to the schedule. As this Supplemental SoA is intended to occur in 
addition to the original SoAs being followed by all participants in Part 1A or Part 1B, there is a 
possibility for study visits to overlap (ie, Part 1C -1 BD -Day 1 and study visit in Part 1A or 
Part 1B that coincides with Part 1C -1 BD -Day 1). If visits overlap according to respective visit 
windows, a single visit may be done with the combined study procedures completed once. Any 
participant wh o consented to receive a BD will follow Part 1C -1 SoA. In case a study visit in 
Part 1A or Part 1B coincides with Part 1C -1 BD -Day1, participants  should follow Part 1C  SoA.  
Note: Participants enrolled in Part 1C -1 who have received the third (booster) dose  in this study 
and would like to receive the bivalent COVID -19 vaccine, can receive it outside of Study P203. 
Participants who receive the updated bivalent COVID -19 vaccine may remain in the P203 study 
after receipt of the nonstudy vaccine. However, sites must report this as concomitant medication.  
3.1.1.4.  Part 1C -2, Heterologous Booster Phase   
Part 1C -2 – Heterologous Booster Phase is designed to provide a BD (50 µg) of mRNA -1273 to 
eligible participants who completed primary COVID -19 vaccination series with a non-Moderna  
vaccine under EUA (ie, Pfizer, Table  4) and are at least 3 months from the last dose.

Note: Due to emergence of a more diver gent variant of concern (ie , Omicron), Study Part 3 was 
initiated  to replace the investigative product mRNA -1273 with a bivalent vaccine mRNA -
1273.222. As a result of this amendment, Part 1C -2 enrollment was discontinued  effective 
16 August 2022. Booster d osing in the study was also discontinued and was reflected in Protocol 
Amendment  5. Participants  enrolled in Part 1C -2 who have received the third (booster) dose in 
this study and  would like to receive  the bivalent COVID -19 vaccine , can receive it outside of 
Study P203. Participants who receive the updated bivalent COVID -19 vaccine may remain in the 
P203 study after receipt of the nonstudy  vaccine. However, sites must report this as concomitant 
medication.  
3.1.2.  Part 2 Study Design   
Part 2 is an open -label design. The study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and 
effectiveness of a 50 μg primary series of mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine in healthy 
adolescents 12  to < 18 years of age.  
The study schema and major study events for Part 2 participants who receive the booster dose is 
illustrated in Figure  5 and the SoA is located in Table  15. The study schema for Part  2 
participants who d o not receive the booster dose is illustrated in Figure  6 and the SoA is located 
in Table  16. 
This study in adolescents will monitor all participan ts for a total of 12 months following Dose  2 
or booster dose (third dose) of vaccine. Safety assessments will include solicited ARs (7  days 
after each injection), unsolicited AEs (28  days after each injection), MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs 
(including MIS -C) thro ughout the study period and AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing 
and/or withdrawal from study.  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants at baseline (Day  1) and at specified visits 
presented in Part 2 SoA ( Table  15 for participants who receive the booster dose  and Table  16 for 
participants who d o not receive the booster dose ) for measurement of SARS -CoV -2 specific 
binding and nAb responses. Blood samples will also be tested for the development of Ab 
directed aga inst nonvaccine antigen (eg, Ab against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify 
infection with SARS -CoV -2. Blood sample will be collected 3 days after Dose 2 or booster dose 
for future biomarker analysis  (ie, inflammatory and/or cardiac biomarkers) . 
The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection after mRNA -1273 vaccination will be evaluated.

booster dose of mRNA -1273 in Part 2 will be in the study approximately 17 months, which 
includes 1 week for screening (Day ˗7 to Day 1), 4 months for dosing (on Day 1, Day 29 , and 
Day 149), and 12 months of follow -up after the booster dose.  Participants who do not receive  the 
booster dose of  mRNA -1273 in Part 2 will be in the study approximately 12 months, which 
includes 1 week for Screening  (Day ˗7 to Day 1), 1 month for dosing (on Day  1 and Day 29), and 
12 months of follow -up after Dose  2. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
Note: Due to emergence of a more divergent  variant of concern (ie , Omicron), Study Part  3 was 
initiated  to replace the investigative product mRNA -1273 with a bivalent vaccine mRNA -
1273.222. This amendment aim ed to assess primary series of 50 µg bivalent mRNA -1273.222 in 
Part 3 of the study. As a result of this amendment, Part 2 enrollment was discontinued  effective 
16 August  2022. The booster administration (Protocol Amendment  4) was also removed and was 
reflected in the Protocol Amendment 5 SoA. Participants  enrolled in Part  2 who have receive the 
primary series or third (booster) dose in this study and  would like to receive  the bivalent 
COVID -19 vaccine , can receive it outside of Study P203. Participants who receive the updated 
bivalent COVID -19 vaccine may remain in the P203  study after receipt of the nonstudy  vaccine. 
However, sites must report this as concomitant medication.  
Part 2 participants enrolled under Protocol Amendment 4 who have already received the booster 
dose will continue the study with the Protocol Amendment 4 Part 2 SoA ( Table  15). 
3.1.3.  Part 3 Study Design   
Part 3 was initially designed as an open -label study to evaluate safety, reactogenicity, and 
effectiveness of a 2 -dose 50 µg primary series of mRNA -1273.222 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 
administered 6 months apart. An interim analysis was conducted which demonstrated robust 
immunogenici ty of a single 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 dose. The pre -specified co -primary 
endpoints were also achieved allowing inference of vaccine effectiveness of a single dose of 
mRNA -1273.222 from the pivotal P301 study. Based on these results, the study design was 
amend ed to primarily  evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of a single dose 50 μg 
primary series of mRNA -1273.222 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine  in at least 300  healthy adolescents 
12 to <18 years of age.  
The study schema and major study events for Part 3 participants who receive Dose  2 is illustrated 
in Figure  7 and the SoA is described in Table  17. The study schema for participants who receive  
a single dose is illustrated in Figure  8 and the SoA  is described in Table  18. 
Safety follow -up in Part 3 participants who receiv e 1 dose of vaccine will be 6 months after 
dosing and participants who receive 2 doses will be followed  for 1 month following Dose  2. 
Safety assessments will include solicited ARs (7 days after each injection), unsolicited AEs 
(28 days after each injection), MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs (including MIS -C) throughout the 
study period and AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or withdrawal from study.

1 month after Dose 2 or 6 mont hs after Dose  1 for participants who receive  a single dose . Blood 
samples will also be tested for the development of Ab directed against nonvaccine antigen (eg, 
Ab against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify infection with SARS -CoV -2. Blood 
sampl es will be collected 3 days after Dose 1 and 3 days after Dose  2 (Day 184), for future 
biomarker analysis  (ie, inflammatory and/or cardiac biomarkers) . 
The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection after mRNA -1273 .222 vaccination will be evaluated.  
Participants who receive  2 doses  of mRNA -1273.222 in Part 3 will be in the study for 
approximately  7 months including 1 week for Screening  (Day -7 to Day -1), 6 months for dosing 
(Day  1 to Day  181), and 1 month of follow -up after Dose 2.  Participants who receive  a sing le 
dose of mRNA -1273.222 in Part 3 will be in the study for approximately 6 months including 
1 week for Screening (Day -7 to Day -1), dosing (Day 1), and 6 months of follow -up after 
dosing.  
Note: Participants who receive the updated COVID -19 vaccine may remain in the P203 study 
after receipt of the nonstudy vaccine. However, sites must report this as concomitant medication .

3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design   
The single age cohort in this Phase 2/3 study, 12 to <  18 years of age, was established to 
understand the tolerability and immunogenicity of 100 µg (Part 1A) and 50 µg (Part 1C -1, 
Part 1C-2, and Part  2) mRNA -1273, as well as 50 µg (Part 3) mRNA -1273.22 2 in an adolescent 
population. The lower age boundary used in this study is consistent with the definition of 
adolescence provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( Hardin  et al 2017 ). 
With SARS -CoV -2 expected to be circu lating in the general population during the study, all 
participants will provide preinjection blood samples and postinjection blood samples for Ab 
analysis through 12 months after the last dose of IP during Part 1A, Part 2, and through 6  months 
(for partic ipants who receive Dose 2 ) or 1 to 6 months after the last dose of IP in Part 3 of the 
study. In addition, participants will have NP or nasal swab samples collected  before the injection 
on Day  1 (Part 1A, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3 ), Day  29 (Part 1A , Part  2, and Part 3 ), Day 149 
(Part  2 participants who receive  the booster dose) , and Day 181  (Part 3  participants  who receive 
Dose  2); additional  timepoints  are in the SoA (Table  10 and Table  12 through Table  18). 
Furthermore, with any signs or symptoms or MAAE suggesting  SARS -CoV -2 infection in a 
participant, an additional nasal or NP swab sample and a blood sample will be taken to confirm 
the diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 via serology and RT -PCR. Additionally, clinical information will 
be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 92 As it is possible that participants are naturally exposed to SARS -CoV -2 through community 
exposure, the NP or nasal sw ab samples collected before study injection and the serologic assays 
for Ab responses to nonvaccine antigen(s) may help discriminate between natural infection and 
vaccine -induced Ab responses, should such discrimination be needed.  
Part 1B, is the Open -label Observational Phase. During Part 1B of the study, all ongoing study 
participants were permitted (a) to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any 
COVID -19 vaccine made available under an EUA and (b) to schedule a study visit to know their 
original group assignment (placebo vs. mRNA -1273 vaccine). Part 1B also provided the 
opportunity for eligible study participants who previously received placebo to receive 2  doses of 
mRNA -1273 vaccine under open -label conditions.  
Part 1C, the Booster  Phase and Part 2, were prompted by the recent interim results of an ongoing 
Moderna Phase 2 study (mRNA -1273 -P201).  In Part  A of Study mRNA -1273 -P201, the time 
course and magnitude of antibody (both bAb and nAb) responses to mRNA -1273 was similar 
between 100 µg and 50 µg dose levels (both showing strong immunogenicity) at each 
postbaseline timepoint (Days 29, 43, 57, and 209), although the 100 µg dose group had 
numerically greater responses. In Part B  of Study mRNA -1273 -P201 in which participants who 
had r eceived 2 doses of 50 µg or 100 µg of mRNA -1273 6 -8 months prior were administered a 
50 µg booster of mRNA -1273, participants demonstrated enhanced immune responses compared 
to preboost levels and met the noninferiority criteria stipulated in the FDA Guida nce on EUA for 
Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19. In addition, interim results from Study mRNA -1273 -P205 show 
that a 50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 increased nAb levels against Omicron approximately 
37-fold compared to preboost levels. No new safety signals emerged  upon administration of the 
BD in Study mRNA -1273 -P201. Available data (DMID 21‐0012) also show that heterologous or 
mixed series of COVID -19 vaccine -induced strong immune response in the adult population with 
persons who received an mRNA‐based booster vac cination achieving a four‐fold increase in their 
neutralization response more frequently than those who were boosted with Ad26.COV.S. 
(Atmar  et al 2021 ). 
Part 3 was prompted by preclinical data on bivalent vaccine (mRNA -1273.2 14 given as 2  dose 
primary series) showing broader neutralization across divergent lineages. Preclinical mice 
studies also show increased immunogenicity after BD of the BA.1 & BA.4/BA.5 Omicron 
Bivalent Vaccines (mRNA -1273.214 & mRNA -1273.222). Further, mRNA -1273.214 when 
given as 50 µg BD in Study P205 participants elicited superior nAb responses against the 
Omicron subvariants BA.4, BA.5 compared with mRNA -1273 50 μg (nominal α of 0.05) and the 
BA.4, BA.5. nAb response was consistently higher in the mRNA -1273.214 group compared to 
the mRNA -1273 group in participants with and without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection  (although 
higher GMT titers post  BD were observed in t hose who were SARS -CoV -2 positive at pre -BD). 
Data also demonstrate antibody responses 180 days after the 50  μg mRNA -1273.211 BD were 
higher than those after a 50  μg mRNA -1273 BD ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; Chalkias  et al 2022a ) against 
the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and Beta, as well as Omicron BA.1 and Delta variants. In additio n, 
the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 -containing vaccine mRNA -1273.222 elicited superior 
neutralizing antibody responses against BA.4/BA.5 compared to mRNA -1273, with no safety 
concerns identified ( Chalkias  et al 2022c). Given the increasing prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 
infection in the community ( Clarke  et al 2022 ), effectiveness of 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 post 
dose 1 will be evaluated as a primary objective under Part 3 . Recent IA results from Study P203 
Part 2 also support evaluation of immunogenicity of a single  50 µg -dose. Study P203 Part 2 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 93 interim results  show  higher immunogenicity post dose 1 of 50 µg mRNA -1273 in Study  P203 
unvaccinated baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive adolescent participants when compared to 
immunogenicity post  primary series in unvaccinated baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young 
adults in Study P301  (GMR of 4.322 [95% CI : 3.274, 5.707 ]). An IA conducted for Part  3 
demonstrate robust immunogenicity of a single 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 dose. The pre -specified 
co-primary endpoints were also met allowing inference of vaccine effectiveness of a single dose 
from the pivotal Study P301. The study vaccine was also well -tolerated after a median of 
~1 month after Dose 1. Based on these results, the second dose of mRNA -1273.222 in Part  3 was 
removed . 
Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit -risk profile of monovalent mRNA -1273 and biva lent 
mRNA -1273.22 2 vaccine is favorable, particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease 
with the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants.  
3.3. Justification for Dose, Control Product, and Choice of Study 
Population   
The 100 g dose level is currently being investigated in a large Phase 3 efficacy study in adults 
18 years of age and older; therefore, based on this and the results of the studies described in 
Section  1.2.2 , the Sponsor intended to study a single dose level of 100 g in Part 1A of this 
Phase  2/3 study in the adolescents age group of 12 to < 18 years of age . 
At the time of study initiation, there were no licensed SARS -CoV -2 vaccines available, and so 
0.9% sodium chloride was used as a placebo control for the safety and immunogenicity 
assessments. The mRNA -1273 vaccine and placebo injections look different, so  administration 
was blinded  in Part 1A of this study ( Section  8.1). 
Interim data from the current Part 1A Study P203 (based on a data snapshot of 08 M ay 2021) 
show that the primary immunogenicity objective was met by demonstrating noninferiority of 
both the (i) GM value of serum nAb and (ii) the seroconversion rate from adolescent participants 
compared with those from young adults (aged 18 to 25 years) enrolled in the ongoing Phase  3 
efficacy study (Study  P301).  
Following potential EUA of a COVID -19 vaccine for persons under 18 years of age, a study 
amendment was designed to give EUA -eligible participants the opportunity to transition to 
Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase ( Figure  3). Transitioning the study to Part 1B, 
open-label Observational Phase, permits (a) all ongoing study participants to be informed of the 
availability and eligibility criteria of any COVID -19 vac cine made available under an EUA and 
(b) the option to offer all ongoing study participants who request unblinding an opportunity to 
schedule a study visit to know their original group assignment (placebo vs. mRNA -1273 [100  µg 
vaccine]). Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase, also provides the opportunity for study 
participants who previously received placebo to request to receive 2 doses of mRNA -1273 
(100 µg) vaccine.  
For Part 1C (provision for the option of a single 50 µg BD for eligible participant s during the 
Open -Label Observational Phase ) and for Part 2 (evaluation of 2 doses of 50 µg given 28 days 
apart), the selected 50 µg dose was based primarily on data from Study  mRNA -1273 -P201. For 
Part 1C -2, participants will be boosted at least 3 months p ost Dose 2. For Part 1C -1, participants 
are well beyond 3 months post  Dose 2 and thus will not be changed to a BD at least 3 months 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 94 post Dose 2. In Part  A of Study mRNA -1273 -P201, the time course and magnitude of antibody 
(both bAb and nAb) responses to mR NA-1273 was similar between 100 µg and 50 µg dose 
levels (both showing strong immunogenicity) at each postbaseline timepoint (Days 29, 43, 57, 
and 209), although the 100-µg dose group had numerically greater responses. In Part B of 
Study  mRNA -1273 -P201, ad ministration of a 50 µg BD of mRNA -1273 6 months or more after 
the primary series, improved the immune responses to 1.7 -fold the peak achieved after the 
primary vaccination series in the current mRNA -1273 -P301 study, where efficacy of 
mRNA -1273 against COV ID-19 was demonstrated. In addition, interim results from 
Study  mRNA -1273 -P205 show that 50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 increased nAb levels against 
Omicron approximately 37 -fold compared to preboost levels.  
Available data also show that heterologous or mixed series of COVID -19 vaccine -induced strong 
immune response in the adult population ( Atmar  et al 2021 ). In a recent DMID study 
(DMID  21-0012), interim data show Day 15 post‐boost neutralization titers ranged from 
676.1 -901.8 IU50/ml for participants boosted with 100 µg mRNA‐1273 compared to 
31.2-382.2  IU50/ml for those boosted with Ad26.COV2.S, and 341.3‐677.9 IU50/mL for those 
boosted with BNT162b2. In general, Day 15 titers post‐boost were highest in 
mRNA -1273 -primed partici pants, followed by BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S, irrespective of the 
booster vaccine administered ( Atmar  et al 2021 ). 
For Part 3, the rationale for assessment of 50 µg primary series of the bivalent Omicron 
containing vaccine mRNA -1273.222 is based on the preclinical data on bivalent vaccines given 
as primary series (mRNA -1273.214) and as BD (mRNA -1273.222) that show robust 
immunogenicity and broader neutralization across divergent lineages. Clinical data from 
mRNA -1273.214 bivalen t vaccine (given as a 50 µg BD) also show consistent robust 
immunogenicity , regardless of SARS -CoV -2 infection status  in participants (although higher 
GMT titers post  BD were observed in those who were SARS -CoV -2 positive at pre -BD), with 
acceptable safety  profile.  Data also demonstrates antibody responses 180 days after the 50  μg 
mRNA -1273.211 BD were higher than those after a 50  μg mRNA -1273 BD ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; 
Chalkias  et al 2022a ) against the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and Beta, as well as Omicron BA.1 and 
Delta variants. In addition, the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 -containing vaccine 
mRNA -1273.222 elicited superior neutralizing antibody responses against BA.4/BA.5 compared 
to mRNA -1273,  with no safety concerns identified ( Chalkias  et al 2022 c).  
These data together with increasing prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 infection in the community 
(Clarke  et al 2022 ) as well as recent interi m results from Study P203 Part  2 showing  robust 
immunogenicity after dose 1 of mRNA -1273 in unvaccinated baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive 
adolescent participants , prompted the evaluation of the immunogenicity of 2 doses of the 
bivalent mRNA -1273.222 vaccine given 6 months apart. The 6 -month interval will allow 
evaluation of the immunogenicity of Dose 1.  An IA conducted for Part 3  demonstrate robust 
immunogenicity of a single 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 dose. The pre -specified co -primary 
endpoints were also met allowi ng inference of vaccine effectiveness of a single dose from the 
pivotal Study P301. The study vaccine was also well -tolerated after a median of ~1 month after 
Dose  1. Based on these results, the second dose of mRNA -1273.222 in Part 3 was removed . 
Taken tog ether, these data strongly suggest that a monovalent 50 µg  mRNA‐1273 given as a 
2 dose primary series, as a homologous and heterologous booster vaccine is anticipated to 
provide strong immunogenicity in the adolescent population. Similarly, these data also  suggest 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 95 that a bivalent 50 µg mRNA‐1273.222 , given  as 1 dose or  2 doses , may provide strong 
immunogenicity in the adolescent population.

5.1. Investigational Product Administered   
The term IP refers to mRNA -1273 (100 g for Part 1A and Part 1B, and 50 µg for Part 1C, and 
Part 2), and 50 µg mRNA -1273 .222 (Part 3) vaccine or placebo (0.9%  sodium chloride) in this 
study.  
The mRNA -1273 is an LNP dispersion of an mRNA encoding the prefusion stabilized S  protein 
of SARS -CoV -2 formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipids (1 proprietary and 3 commercially 
available): the proprietary ionizable lipid SM -102; cholesterol; 1,2 -distearoyl -sn-glycero -
3-phosphocholine (DSPC); and 1 -monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol -2,3-dimyristylglycerol with 
polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 2000 (1 -monomethoxypolyethyl eneglycol -2,3-
dimyristylglycerol polyethylene glycol 2000 [PEG2000 -DMG]).  
mRNA -1273 injection is provided as a sterile liquid for injection, white to off -white dispersion 
in appearance, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 87 mg/ mL 
sucrose and 10.7  mM sodium acetate at pH 7.5.  
The Sponsor initiated the development of modified COVID -19 vaccine leveraging the 
mRNA/LNP technology platform against SARS -CoV -2 variant, which incorporates key 
mutations present in Omicron subvariants BA.4 /BA.5. The vaccine IP, mRNA -1273.222, 
contains 2 mRNAs: CX -024414 encoding for the S -2P of Wuhan -Hu-1 and CX -034476 
encoding for the S -2P of Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5.  
mRNA -1273.222 will be provided as a sterile solution for injection at a concentratio n of 
0.1 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer with sucrose, at pH 7.5. The solution will be kept in 2R USP 
Type  I borosilicate glass vials with PLASCAP vial seal containing a 13 mm FluroTec -coated 
plug stopper with a 0.8 mL nominal fill volume. For Part 3, each inje ction preparation will have 
a volume of 0.5 mL and contain 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 . 
5.2. Randomization (Part 1A Only)   
Random assignment of participants will use a centralized interactive response technology, in 
accordance with pregenerated randomization schedules.  
5.3. Dosing and Management of mRNA -1273 Vaccine   
5.3.1.  Preparation of Study Vaccine for Injection   
Each dose of IP will be prepared for each participant based on the assigned treatment, as detailed 
in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. For Part 1A and Part 1B, the volume of IP injected 
will be 0.5 mL consisting of either 100  µg dose of mRNA -1273 or placebo (normal saline), as

In the Blinded Phase, Part 1A of the study, each participant will receive 2  doses of IP by IM 
injection, 28 days apart (ie, Day 1 and Day  29) into the deltoid muscle, according to their 
assigned regimen and according to the procedures specified in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy 
Manual. Preferably, both doses should be administered into the nondominant arm.  
In the open -label Part 1B of the study, mRNA -1273 vaccine will be administere d as an IM 
injection into the deltoid muscle following the injection schedule for each group based on the 
product received in Part 1A. Participants who received placebo in Part 1A will receive 2 doses of 
mRNA -1273 (100 µg) on OL – Day 1 and OL -Day 29 of Pa rt 1B ( Table  12). Preferably, both 
doses should be administered into the nondominant arm.  
For Part 1C, mRNA -1273 vaccine will be administered as an IM i njection into the deltoid 
muscle. Preferably, the dose should be administered into the nondominant arm. Each injection 
will have a volume of 0.25  mL and contain mRNA -1273 50  µg. 
For Part 2, each participant will receive 2  doses of 50 µg mRNA -1273 by IM inj ection, 28  days 
apart (ie, Day 1, Day  29) into the deltoid muscle, according to the procedures specified in the 
mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. Preferably, all doses should be administered into the 
nondominant arm.  
For Part 3  Protocol Amendment 5, each participant will receive 2  doses of 50 µg mRNA -
1273.222 by IM injection, 6 months  apart (ie, Day 1, Day  181). Protocol Amendment 7 was 
implemented to remove the second dose administration ; thus, some participants will only receive 
1 dose of mRNA -1273.222. The mRNA -1273.222 will be administered into the deltoid muscle, 
according to the procedures specified in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. Preferably, 
all doses should be administered into the nondominant arm.  
At each visit when IP is administered , participants will be monitored for a minimum of 
30 minutes after administration. Assessments will include vital sign measurements and 
monitoring for local or systemic reactions ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, Table  15, 
Table  16, Table  17, and Table  18). 
Eligibility for a subsequent dose of IP will be determined by followi ng the criteria outlined in  
Section  6. 
The study sites will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either on -site resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
appropr iate protocols for the rapid transport of participant to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.

and Part 1C), a 10R glass vial with an 8.0 mL fill volume (Part 1C and Part 2 only), or a 10R 
glass vial with a 6.3 mL fill volume (Part 1C and Part 2 only) . The IP will have all required 
labeling per regulations and will be supplied to the pharmacy in an unblinded manner. For Part  3, 
the IP will be packaged in a 2R glass vial . 
The IP will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating proc edures of the 
Sponsor or of its designee, CFR Title 21, ICH GCP guidelines, guidelines for Quality System 
Regulations, and applicable regulations.  
5.3.5.  Study Vaccine Storage   
The IP mu st be stored as per the temperature conditions printed on the IP label in a secure area 
with limited access and protected from moisture and light until it is prepared for administration 
(Section  5.3.1 ). The refrigerator and/or freezer utilized for IP storage should have automated 
temperature recording and a 24 -hour alert system in place that allows for rapid response in case 
of refrigerator  malfunction. There must be an available backup refrigerator and freezer. The 
refrigerators and freezers must be connected to a backup generator(s). In addition, IP 
accountability study staff are required to keep a temperature log to establish a record of 
compliance with these storage conditions. The study site is responsible for reporting any IP that 
was not temperature controlled during shipment or during storage. Such IP will be retained for 
inspection by the monitor and disposed of according to approved  methods.  
5.3.6.  Study Vaccine Accountability   
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the IP accountability study staff maintain accurate 
records in an IP accountability log of rec eipt of all IP, study site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP 
injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used and unused IP vials.  
A study site monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during study site visits and 
at the completion of the study. Additional details are found in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy 
Manual.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 105 5.3.7.  Study Vaccine Handling and Disposal   
A study site monitor will reconcile the IP inventory during the conduct and at the end of the 
study for compliance. Once fully reconciled at the study site at the end of the study, the IP can be 
destroyed at the investigational site or at a Sponsor -selected third party, as appropriate.  
Vaccine may be destroyed at the study site only if permitted by local regulations and authorized 
by the Sponsor. A certificate of destruction must be completed and sent to the Sponsor or 
designee.  
5.4. Study Treatment Compliance   
All doses of IP will be administered at the study site under direct observation of medically 
qualified study staff and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Qualified study site 
staff will confirm that the participant has received the entire dose of IP. If a participant does not 
receive IP or does not receive all of the planned dose, the reason for the missed dose will be 
recorded. Data will be reconciled with study site accountability records to assess comp liance.  
Participants who miss the second  or third dose due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and 
not due to a safety pause will still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule as 
described in the protocol and their regimen schedu le. Unless consent is withdrawn, a participant 
who withdraws or is withheld from receiving the second  dose will remain in the study and 
complete all safety and immunogenicity assessments required through the participant’s last 
scheduled study visit . 
The st udy site staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
participant and complete a visit within the defined visit window (Part 1A , Table  10; Part  1B, 
Table  12; Part 1C , Table  13 and Table  14; Part 2 , Table  15 for participants who receive the 
booster dose and Table  16 for participants who d o not receive the booster dos e; and Part  3, 
Table  17 for participants who receive Dose 2 and Table  18 for participants who receive  a single  
dose. If a participant does not complete a visit within the time window, that visit will be 
classified as a missed visit and the participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study 
visits. All safety requirements of the missed visit will be captured  and included in the subsequent 
visit.  
5.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications   
5.5.1.  Prior Medications and Therapies   
Information about prior medications (including any prescription or over -the-counter medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by the participant within the 28  days before providing 
informed consent/assent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclu sion requirements) will be 
recorded in the participant’s eCRF.  
5.5.2.  Concomitant Medications and Therapies   
At each study visit, study site staff must question the participant and/or th e participants’ 
parent(s)/LAR(s) regarding any medications taken and vaccinations received by the participant 
and record the following information in the eCRF:  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 106 • All nonstudy  vaccinations administered within the period starting 28 days before the 
first dose of IP.  
• All concomitant medications and nonstudy  vaccinations taken through 28 days after 
each dose of IP  (Part 1A ) or throughout the study (Part 1B, Part 1C -1, Part 1C -2, Part 
2, and Part  3). Antipyretics and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in  the 
absence of any symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as 
such.  
• Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or a MAAE.  
• Participants will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic o r analgesic 
to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7 days after each dose of IP, including the day 
of injection. Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should be recorded in the 
source document by the study site staff during the postinjection stud y visits or via 
other participant interactions (eg, telephone calls).  
5.5.3.  Recording of Concomitant Medications and Concomitant Vaccinations  
Study site staff must question the participant regarding any medications taken and vaccinations 
received by the participant and record the following information in the eCRF:  
• All nonstudy  vaccinations administered within the period starting 28 days before the 
first dose of IP.  
• Seasonal influ enza vaccine administered for the current influenza season (typically 
October through April in the Northern Hemisphere).  
• All concomitant medications and nonstudy  vaccinations taken through 28 days after 
each dose of IP  (Part 1A) or throughout the study (Part 1B, Part 1C -1, Part 1C -2, Part 
2, and Part  3). Antipyretics and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the 
absence of any symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as 
such.  
• Any con comitant medications used to prevent or treat COVID -19 or its symptoms . 
• Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or a MAAE.  
• Participants will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or analgesic 
to treat or  prevent fever or pain within 7 days after each IP dose, including on the day 
of dosing. Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should be recorded in the 
source document by the study site staff during the postinjection study visits or via 
other partic ipant interactions (eg, phone calls).  
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Dictionary. If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator and the CRO’s 
medical monitor will make a joint decision about continuing or withholding further injection of 
the participant based on the time the medication was administered, the drug’s pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication will compromise the participant’s safety or 
interpretati on of the data. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that details regarding the 
concomitant medications are adequately recorded in the eCRF.

Confidential  Page 107 5.5.4.  Conco mitant Medications and Vaccines that May Lead to the  Elimination of a 
Participant from Per-Protocol Analyses  
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study (with the exception of planned or actua l receipt of a nonstudy 
COVID -19 vaccine either under EUA or licensed for Part 1A and 1B only) but may determine a 
participant’s eligibility to receive a second dose or evaluability in the PP analysis (analysis sets 
are described in Section  8.4: 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the IP used 
during the study period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs administered chronically (ie, 
more than 14  days in total) during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean 
that prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day or the equivalent is not permitted. Inhaled, nasal, and 
topical steroids are allowed.  
• Long -acting immune -modifying drugs administered at any time during the study 
period (eg, infliximab).  
• Immunoglobulins  and/or any blood products administered during the study period.  
5.6. Intervention After the End of the Study   
Any SAE occurring after the end of the study and considered to be caused by the IP must be 
reported to the Sponsor.

PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY   
6.1. Criteria for Delay of Vaccine Administration   
6.1.1.  Individual Participant Criteria for Del ay of Study Vaccination   
Body temperature (oral) must be measured on dosing visits before vaccine administration. The 
following events constitute criteria for delay of injection, and if either of these events occur at 
the time scheduled for dosing, the participant may receive the study injection at a later date 
within the time window specified in the relevant SoA ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, 
Table  15, Table  16, Table  17, and  Table  18), or the participant may be discontinued  from dosing 
at the discretion of the investigator ( Section  6.2): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing  
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C/≥100.4°F at the time of dosing  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by the investigator, can be 
vaccinated. Pa rticipants with a fever of ≥38.0°C/ ≥100.4°F will be contacted within the time 
window acceptable for participation and re -evaluated for eligibility. If the investigator 
determines that the participant’s health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes inje ction, the 
visit should be rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit if possible or at a time the 
participant is clinically stable according to the judg ment  of the investigator.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, an injection co uld be delayed within the visit 
window based on the joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
6.2. Discontinuing St udy Vaccination   
Participants can discontinue study injection (ie, refuse the second dose) for any reason, without 
prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to recei ve. 
The investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold a participant 
from further injection if the participant experiences any of the following:  
• Becomes pregnant  
• Withdrawal of consent (not related to COVID -19) 
• Develops, during the course of the study, symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria ( Section  4.1.2 ) 
• Experiences an AE (other than reactogenicity)  after injection that is considered by the 
investigator to be related to IP ( Section  7.5.9 ) and is of Grade  3 (severe) or greater 
severity  
• Experience s an AE or SAE that, in the judgment of the investigator, requires IP 
withdrawal due to its nature, severity, or required treatment, regardless of the causal 
relationship to vaccine  
• Experiences an AESI  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 109 • Experiences a clinically significant change in vital s ign measurements, or general 
condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, requires vaccine withdrawal  
• Experiences anaphylaxis clearly related to IP  
• Experiences generalized urticaria related to IP  
The reason(s) for withdrawal from further injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator could withhold the second  or 
third dose based on a joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
Every reasonable attempt will be made to follow -up with participants for safety throughout the 
entire scheduled study period according to their regimen, even if the participant does not receive 
the second  dose or misses one or more visits. Unless participants withdraw consent, they are 
expected to remai n in the study and complete all scheduled visits and assessments.  
6.3. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study   
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. A “withdrawal” 
from the study refers to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the final visit 
planned in the protocol. The statistical management of participant withdrawals is discussed in 
Section  8. 
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
If participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will try to 
obtain agreement to follow -up with the particip ant until the event is considered resolved or stable 
and will then complete the EOS eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision to withdraw a participant from the study was  made by the 
participant or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminate d by Sponsor  
• Withdrawal of consent by participant (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 110 Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs) must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators wil l follow -
up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE or AE until resolution 
of the event.  
A participant who withdraws from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the investigator must docume nt this in the study site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  10.2.10 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research data that have already been collected for 
the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of  these samples. All 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by local regulations).  
6.4. Study Pause Rules   
During Part 1A of the study, the investigators, study medical monitor, and Sponsor will monitor 
for events that could trigger a study pause. Study pause rule criteria, events, and thresholds are 
described in Table  5. Although these pause rules are not applicable during Part 1B or Part 1C, 
Part 2, or Part 3, participants will continue to be monitored for the events in Table  5, and the 
Sponsor will be notified if any of these events occur.  
Table  5: Pause Rule Criteria, Events, and Thresholds   
Pause Rule 
Criterion  Event  Participant Threshold for 
Triggering Study Pause  
1 Any death due to SARS -CoV -2 infection  ≥ 1 
2 Any related SAE or related Grade  4 AE  ≥ 1 
3 Hospitalization due to SARS -CoV -2 infection  ≥ 1 
4a Any Grade 3 or higher solicited local AR lasting 
≥ 24 hours and occurring  within 7 -days of injection 
(Days  1-8) ≥30 participants out of the first 
300 participants enrolled

≥ 24 hours and occurring within 7 -days of injection 
(Days  1-8) ≥30 participants out of the first 
300 participants enrolled  
6a Any ≥ Grade 3 or higher unsolicited AR that cannot 
be reasonably attributed to a cause other than 
vaccination  ≥30 participants out of the first

SARS -CoV -2 = Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus  2. 
a. Pause Rules 4, 5, and 6 apply only to the first 300 participants enrolled.  
If any of the thresholds for a study pause is met during Part 1A, the Sponsor will immediately 
suspend further enrol lment , pause study dosing, and notify all investigators. Such a suspens ion 
will remain in force until the threshold event(s) is (are) reviewed by the DSMB and a 
recommendation to continue is provided to the Sponsor.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 111 The investigator or designee is responsible for reporting to the Sponsor, via the EDC system 
within 24 hours of  observation, each event that potentially meets any pause rule criterion. The 
Sponsor will inform the DSMB of any event that potentially meets any pause rule criterion. The 
DSMB will review all available study data to adjudicate such events in accordance w ith the 
DSMB charter.  
The Sponsor will notify the CBER within 48  hours in the event of a study pause. In the event of 
a study pause, all safety and immunogenicity assessments will continue PP. The window 
allowance for injection visits may be extended by an  additional 7 days (ie, +14 days) for affected 
participants at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
During Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3 of the study, the Sponsor will continue to inform the 
DSMB of the occurrence of any of the events in Table  5. The DSMB will review all available 
relevant study data to adjudicate such events in accordance with the DSMB charter.  
6.5. Lost to Follow -up  
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The study site staff must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed 
visit as soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whet her the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certi fied letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and 
registered letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• A participant who continues to be unreachable or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.

Confidential  Page 112 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES   
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants and/or participants’  
parent/LAR will sign an ICF (as detailed in Section  10.2.6 ). Participants will undergo study 
procedures at the timepoints specified in the Part 1A SoA ( Table  10), Part 1B SoA ( Table  12), 
Part 1C ( Table  13 and Table  14), Part 2 ( Table  15 and Table  16), or Part 3 ( Table  17 and 
Table  18). 
After the participant proceeds to the Participant Decision Clinic Visit (Part 1A) of the study, 
participants who received mRNA -1273 in Part 1A will continue to follow the open -label Part  1A 
SoA ( Table  10). Participants who received placebo in Part 1A will transition to the open -label 
Part 1B of the study ( Figure  10) and will follow the Part 1B SoA ( Table  12). Participants in 
Part 1A or Part 1B who transitioned to Part 1C -1, at least 5 months from the last dose, will 
follow open -label Part 1C -1 SoA ( Table  13) until study completion.  Participants who remained 
blinded will follow Part 1A SoA. Participants who do not receive a BD will continue with their 
SoA (Part 1A or Part 1B). Eligible participants enrolled in Part 1C -2 will follow Part 1C -2 SoA 
(Table  14). Eligible participants enrolled in Part 2 will follow Part 2 SoA ( Table  15 for 
participants who receive the booster dose and Table  16 for participants who d o not receive the 
booster dose ). Eligible participants enrolled in Part 3 will follow Part 3 SoA ( Table  17 for 
participants who receive Dose 2 and Table  18 for participants who receive  a single dose ). 
A participant can also be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time during the study. An 
unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19, 
or new or ongoing AEs. The study site also has the discretion to make reminder telep hone calls 
or send text messages to inform the participant about visits, review eDiary requirements, or 
follow -up on ongoing or outstanding issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS  2020 ), investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor. Such action should be 
taken to protect the safety and well -being of study partici pants and study site staff or to comply 
with state or municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be follo wed as presented in  Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, 
Table  15, Table  16, Table  17, and  Table  18. Adherence to the study design 
requirements is essential and required f or study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue study 
treatment or participation in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be compl eted and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as app licable.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 113 • Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, 
blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or 
baseline assessments provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteri a and 
were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA.  
7.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures   
In Part 1A (blinded), Part 1B (open -label), Part 1C (open -label), Part 2 (open -label), and Part  3 
(open -label) safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each 
participant, according to the SoA ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, Table  15, Table  16, 
Table  17, and  Table  18): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section  7.5.3 ) that occur during the 7 days 
following each  injection (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days) in Part 1A, 
Part 1C, Part  2, and Part 3. Solicited ARs will be recorded daily using eDiaries 
(Section  7.1.1 ). 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28  days following each injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 27 subsequent days) in Part 1A, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part  3. 
Unsolicited AEs are defined in Section  7.5.1 . 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing (except  for participants who receive  a 
single dose in Part 3) and/or withdrawal from study participation from Day  1 through 
the last day of study participation in Part 1A, Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3  (see 
Section  10.1, Appendix  1 for the SoAs) . 
• MAAEs from first dose on Day  1 through the entire study period in Part 1A, Part 1B, 
Part 1C, Part  2, and Part 3  (see Section  10.1, Appendix 1  for the SoAs) . 
• SAEs from first dose on Day  1 through the entire study period in Part 1A, Part 1B, 
Part 1C, Part  2, and Part 3  (see Section  10.1, Appendix 1  for the SoAs) . 
• AESIs through the entire study period in Part 1A, Part 1B , Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3  
(see Section  10.1, Appendix 1  for the SoAs) . 
• Vital sign measurements ( Section  7.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings ( Section  7.1.5 ). 
• Assessments for SARS -CoV -2 infection  from Day  1 through study completion 
(Section  7.1.6 ). 
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study tre atment and until the end of their participation in the study ( Section  7.5.6 ). 
7.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries   
At the time of consent/assent, participants or their caregivers must confirm they will be willing to 
complete an eDiary using either an application downloaded to their smartphon e or using a device 
that is provided at the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day  1, participants or their 
caregivers will be instructed to download the eDiary application or will be provided an eDiary 
device to record solicited ARs ( Section  7.5.3 ) on Day  1. Participants who were originally 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 114 randomized to placebo and who opt to receive mRNA -1273 will enter the Open -label 
Observational Phase. They  will receive Dose 1 at Day 209 (OL -Day 1), return for their second 
dose at OL -Day 29, and return again at OL -Day 57. Participants who entered the open -label 
phase, may opt to receive a BD in Part 1C -1, and will follow Part 1C -1 SoA until study 
completion.  During the open -label period Part 1B, the eDiary will not be used. During the 
open -label Part 1C -1, Part 1C -2, Part 2, and Part 3, the eDiary will be used to record solicited 
ARs. 
In Part 1A, the Blinded Phase, Part 2, and Part 3 at each injection visit, participants or their 
caregivers will be instructed (Day  1) or reminded (Day  29 for Part 1A and Part 2, and Day 181 
for Part 3) on thermometer usage to measure body temperature, ruler usage to measure injection 
site erythema and swelling/induration (hardne ss), and self -assessment for localized axillary 
swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection arm.  
In Part 1A,  the Blinded Phase, Part 2, and Part 3 at each injection visit, participants or their 
caregivers will record data into the eDiary starting approximately 30 minutes after injection 
under supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry of assessments. The study site 
staff will perform any retraining as necessary. Participants or their caregivers will continue to 
record d ata in the eDiary after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening and at the same 
time each day, on the day of injection and for 6 days following injection.  
Participants or their caregivers will record the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as defined in Section  7.5.3 , that 
occur on the day of each vaccine administration and during the 7 d ays after vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). If a solicited local or 
systemic AR continues beyond Day  7 after vaccination, the participant will be 
prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in th e eDiary until it 
is resolves or the next IP injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture of details of 
ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28  days after each vaccination. A Rs recorded in 
the eDiary beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by the study site st aff either during the 
next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site visit.  
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by the study site. If body 
temperature i s taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.  
• Measurement, as applicable, for solicited local ARs (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration); the size measurements will be performed using the ruler 
provided by the study site.  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on a day of injection or for the 
next 6  days.  
The eDiary will be the only source documents allowed for solicited systemic or local ARs 
(including body temperature measuremen ts). Participants or their caregivers will be instructed to 
complete eDiary entries daily. The participant or their caregiver will have a limited window on 
the following day to complete assessments for the previous day; quantitative temperature

Confidential  Page 115 recordings and measurement of any injection site erythema or swelling/induration reported on 
the following day may be excluded from the analyses of solicited ARs.  
Any new safety information reported during safety telephone calls or at study site visits 
(including a s olicited reaction) that is not already captured in the eDiary will be described in the 
source documents as a verbally reported event. An event reported in this manner must be 
described as a solicited event and entered on the solicited AR eCRF.  
Study site s taff will review eDiary data with participants at visit (s) 7 days after each injection.  
The eDiary will also be used every 4  weeks, starting at Day  71 through Day  183 and again 
starting at Day  223 through Day  363 for participants in Part 1A ( Table  10), on Day 191 through 
Day 303 and again on Day 343 through Day 455 in Part 2 for participants who receive the 
booster dose ( Table  15), and on Day  99 through Day 183 and again on Day 223 through Day  307 
in Part 2 for participants who do not receive the booster dose ( Table  16) to capture the 
occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AESI, or AEs leading to withdrawal. As specified in the 
applicable SoA (Table  10, Table  15, and Table  16), the eDiary will prompt the participant to 
complete an eDiary questionnai re that collects the following data:  
• Changes in health since last completing the questionnaire or since in contact with the 
study site . 
• Known exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
• Any experience of symptoms of COVID -19. 
• Any MAAEs  or SAEs . 
If an eDiary record results in identification of relevant safety events according to the study 
period, or of symptoms of COVID -19, a follow -up safety telephone call will be triggered.  
Completion of eDiary questionnaires will alternate with safety  telephone calls ( Section  7.1.2) as 
the procedure for safety follow -up approximately every 4 weeks starting at Day 85 through 
Day 197 and again starting at Day  237 through Day  377 (Part 1A SoA, Table  10), every 4  weeks 
starting at Day 205 through Day 317 and starting again at Day 357 through Day 469 (Part  2, 
Table  15 for participants who receive the booster dose), every 4 weeks starting at Day  113 
through Day  197 and again starting at Day  237 through Day  321 (Part  2, Table  16 for 
participants who do not receive the booster dose), every 6 weeks starting at Day 99 through 
Day 141 (Part 3, Table  17 for participants who receive Dose  2), and every 6 weeks starting at 
Day 99 through Day 141 (Part 3, Table  18 for participants who receiv e a single dose).  
In Part 1C -1 and Part 1C -2, diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 
30 minutes after BD injection while at the study site with instruction provided by study staf f. 
Study participants will continue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the 
study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of injection and for 6 days following injection. If 
a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be 
prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR 
resolves; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after vaccination. 
ARs recorded in eDiaries beyond Day 7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the 
following study visit. Review of eDiary will occur on BD -Day 8.

Confidential  Page 116 7.1.1.1.  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use   
Study sites will distribute Sponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by participants 
in assessing body temperature and injection site reactions for recording solicited ARs in eDiaries. 
Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to tho se participants who do not 
have their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
7.1.2.  Safety Telephone Calls   
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by train ed study site personnel. 
This call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information.  
Safety telephone calls follow a schedule for each participant as indicated in the Part 1A SoA 
(Table  10), Part 1B ( Table  12), Part 1C ( Table  13 and Table  14), Part 2 ( Table  15 and Table  16), 
and Part 3 ( Table  17 and Table  18). 
The participant will be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, 
SAEs, AESI, AEs leading to study withdrawal, concomitant medications associated with those 
events , and any nonstudy  vaccinations ( Section  7.5.7 ). In addition, study personnel will collect 
information on known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 
infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms. All safety information 
collected from the telephone contact must be documented in source documents as described by 
the participant and not documented on the script u sed for the safety telephone contact. As noted 
in Section  7.1.1 , an unscheduled follow -up safety telephone call may be triggered if an eDiary 
record r esults in identification of a relevant safety event.  
7.1.3.  Safety Laboratory Assessments   
No scheduled laboratory assessments for safety are planned. This is based on the absence of 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of 
mRNA -1273 in adults.  
A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit (Day  0) and before 
each vaccine dose. At any time, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine can be 
performed, at the discretion of the investigator.  
7.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements   
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastol ic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory 
rate, and body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the timepoints 
indicated in the SoAs ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, Table  15, Table  16, Table  17, and  
Table  18). At dosing visits, vital sign measurements will be collected once before injection and 
at least 30  minutes post injection (before participants are discharged from the study site).  
Febrile participants at dosing visits (fever is defined as a body temperature ≥38.0°C/≥100.4°F) 
may have visits rescheduled within the relevant study visit windows. Afebrile participants with 
minor illnesses may be injected at the discretion of the investigator.  
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur at the same timepoint, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then the blood collection.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 117 7.1.5.  Physical Examinations   
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at scheduled 
timepoints as indicated in the Part 1A ( Table  10), Part 1B ( Table  12), and Part 1C ( Table  13 and 
Table  14), Part 2 ( Table  15 and Table  16), and Part 3 ( Table  17 and Table  18) SoAs. The full 
examination will include assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, 
heart, cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities. 
Any clinically significant finding identified du ring a study visit should be reported as a MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other timepoints at the discretion 
of the investigator. On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection, the 
arm receiving t he injection should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be 
evaluated. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as 
a MAAE.  
Body mass index will be calculated at the Screening Visit (Day  0) only.  
7.1.6.  Assessment for SARS -CoV -2 Infection   
Study participants will have NP or nasal swab samples collected for SARS -CoV -2 testing at 
timepoints specified in the SoA (Part 1A, Table  10; Part 1B, Table  12; Part 1C,  Table  13 and 
Table  14; Part 2, Table  15 and Table  16; and Part 3, Table  17 and Table  18). 
For Part 1A, Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3, a study illness visi t or a consultation will be 
arranged within 72  hours or as soon as possible to collect an NP or nasal swab sample to 
ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR if a participant experiences any of the 
following:  
• Signs or symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infectio n as defined by the CDC ( CDC  2020b ). 
• Exposure to an individual confirmed to be infected with SARS -CoV -2. 
• MAAE suggesting a SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
If the participant had known exposure to COVID -19 (eg, exposure to someone with con firmed 
COVID -19), it will be captured in the COVID -19 exposure form.  
If scheduled, the study illness visit may collect additional clinical information, including 
assessments such as medical history, physical examination, blood sampling for clinical 
laborat ory testing,  and nasal, saliva, and/or NP  swab sampling for viral PCR (including 
multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses including SARS -CoV -2) to evaluate the severity of the 
clinical case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. All findings will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
If participants are confirmed to have SARS -CoV -2 infection, the investigator will notify the 
participant, and the participant’s primary care physician, of the diagnosis. If the study participant 
does not have a primary care physician,  the investigator will assist them to obtain one. The 
participant will also be instructed on infection prevention measures consistent with local public 
health guidance.  
Any confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection occurring in participants will be captur ed as 
a MAAE along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, 
and outcome.  Additionally, a convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28  days 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 118 (+7 days) after diagnosis ( Section  7.4.3 ). At this visit, an NP or nasal swab sampling for viral 
PCR and a blood sample will be collected for potential immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
During the ongoing Omicron -related surge in SARS -CoV -2 infections or if any variant of 
concern -related surge may occur the following alternative process may be used for 
assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection:  
If an illness visit is not possible due to COVID -19 related restrictio ns at site or in the wider 
community, a telehealth visit combined with a local diagnostic test, to be recorded under an 
unscheduled visit eCRF page, can substitute for a clinic visit.  
If due to COVID -19 related restrictions in the community, the participan t’s LAR performed a 
home test rather than obtaining a test performed by a health care professional, the following 
process should apply:  
• If the participant reports symptoms but home test was negative, the investigator may 
report symptoms as ‘ upper respirato ry infection ’ or other appropriate AE and report 
the negative home test on the local d iagnostic lab page for an unscheduled visit, and 
forego the illness visit.  
• If the participant reports symptoms and the home test was positive, the investigator 
should encourage the family to seek confirmatory PCR -based testing at a local testing 
center o r return to site for an illness visit.  
• If a local confirmatory PCR -based test is obtained, the investigator may report the 
result under an unscheduled visit and forego t he illness visit. A convalescent visit 
should be scheduled if feasible.  
• If due to COVID -19 related restrictions at the site or in the  community, neither a local 
test nor an illness  visit is feasible, the investigator may report the result of the home 
test under the local diagnostic lab page as an unscheduled visit and forego the illness 
visit. A convalescent visit should be scheduled if feasible.  
7.2. Immunogenicity Assessments   
Blood s amples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the timepoints indicated in 
the SoA (Part 1A, Table  10; Part 1B, Table  12; Part 1C, Table  13 and Table  14; Part 2, Table  15 
and Table  16; and Part 3,  Table  17 and Table  18): The following analytes will be measured:  
• Serum nAb level against SARS -CoV-2 as measured by pseudovirus and/or live virus 
neutralization assays  
− Serum bAb levels against SARS -CoV -2 as measured by a multiplex serology 
assay specific to the SARS -CoV -2 S, N, RBD  protein.  
Serum collected from all participants will be tested for bAb  against SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid 
protein at specified timepoints. In addition, serum samples from a selected subset of study 
participants who received mRNA -1273  or mRNA -1273.222  will be selected for testing of nAb 
and bAb against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein. Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that 
backup samples are available and that vial volumes are likely to be adequate for future testing 
needs. The actual time and date of each sample collected  will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 119 unique sample identif ication will be utilized to maintain the blind at the laboratory at all times 
and to allow for automated sample tracking and housing. Handling and preparation of the 
samples for analysis, as well as shipping and storage requirements, will be provided in a separate 
study manual.  
Measurement of bAb and nAb levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by the 
Sponsor.  
According to the ICF ( Section  10.2.6 ), serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for 
future research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize 
the immune response to SARS -CoV -2, addition al assay development, and the immune response 
across CoVs.  
The maximum planned volume of blood sampled per participant for immunogenicity 
assessments in 1 day is 21  mL. 
7.3. Exploratory Assessments and Biomarkers   
Exploratory assessments may include assessment of biomarkers for safety, reactogenicity, 
inflammatory and cardiac function. Serologic markers of disease severity, immune response to 
SARS -CoV -2, RT -PCR of NP or nasal swab or sa liva samples, and genetic sequences of 
SARS -CoV -2 strains isolated from participants’ samples may also be measured.  
7.4. Efficacy Assessments   
7.4.1.  Vaccine Effectiveness Assessments   
Vaccine effectiveness for adolescents of ages of 12 to <  18 years will be inferred based on serum 
Ab responses obtained on Day 57 (28 days after the second injection of mRNA -1273)  and 
Day 209 (28 days after the second injection of mRNA1273.222) . Inference will be based on 
assessing the adolescent Ab responses against the following:  
1. If available at the time of analysis , adolescent Ab responses will be assessed against an 
accepted se rum nAb threshold conferring protection against COVID -19. 
2. If an accepted threshold of protection is not available , adolescent Ab responses will be 
assessed by establishing noninferiority of the GM value and SRR  of serum nAb from 
adolescent participants com pared with those from young adults enrolled in the ongoing 
clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study P301). The statistical parameters to infer 
effectiveness are described in Section  2. 
COVID -19: 
To be considered as a case of COVID -19 for the evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint, the 
following case definition must be met:  
• The participant must have experienced at least TWO of the following systemic  
symptoms: Fever (≥ 38ºC/≥100.4ºF), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new 
olfactory and taste disorder(s), OR  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 120 • The participant must have experienced at least ONE of the following respiratory 
signs/symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty brea thing, OR clinical or 
radiographical evidence of pneumonia; AND  
• The participant must have at least 1  NP or nasal swab or saliva sample (or 
respiratory sample, if hospitalized) positive for SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR.  
Severe COVID -19: 
To be considered severe  COVID -19, the following criteria must be met:  
• Confirmed COVID -19 as per the primary efficacy endpoint case definition, plus any 
of the following:  
− Clinical signs indicative of severe systemic illness, respiratory rates ≥ 30 per 
minute, heart rate ≥ 125 beats  per minute, SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air at sea level or 
PaO2/FIO2 <  300 mm Hg, OR  
− Respiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, (defined as needing 
high-flow oxygen, noninvasive or mechanical ventilation, or ECMO), evidence of 
shock (systolic BP <  90 mmHg, diastolic BP  < 60 mmHg or requiring 
vasopressors), OR  
− Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction, OR  
− Admission to an ICU or death.  
The secondary case definition of COVID -19 is defined as the following systemic symptoms: 
fever (te mperature >38ºC/ ≥100.4ºF), or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle aches, or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, 
congestion or runny nose, nausea, or vomiting or diarrhea AND a positive NP o r nasal swab or 
saliva sample for SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR.  
Death attributed to COVID -19 is defined as any participant who dies during the study with a 
cause directly attributed to a complication of COVID -19. 
SARS -CoV -2 Infection:  
• SARS -CoV -2 infection is defined in participants with SARS -CoV -2 negative at 
baseline:  
− bAb level against SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid protein negative at Day  1, which 
becomes positive post baseline, OR  
− Post baseline -Positive RT -PCR . 
7.4.2.  Surveillance for COVID -19 Symptoms   
Surveillance for COVID -19 symptoms will be conducted via biweekly telephone calls or eDiary 
prompts as specified in Section  7.1.1  and Figure  9; starting after participant enrollment and 
throughout the study.  
If there is  no response to an eDiary prompt for 3 days, the study site staff will contact the study 
participant by phone.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 121 According to the CDC as of 10 Jun 2020 ( CDC  2020c ), patients with COVID -19 have reported a 
wide range of symptoms ran ging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Throughout the study, to 
survey for COVID -19, the following prespecified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion 
of COVID -19 will be elicited weekly from the participant and the presence of any one of these 
symptoms lasting at least 48  hours (except for fever and/or respiratory symptoms) will result in 
the study site staff arranging an illness visit to collect an NP or nasal swab within 72  hours:  
• Fever (temperature ≥ 38ºC/≥100.4ºF) or chills (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours) . 
• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours) . 
• Cough (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours) . 
• Fatigue . 
• Muscle or body aches . 
• Headache . 
• New loss of taste or smell . 
• Sore throat . 
• Congestion or runny nose. 
• Nausea or vomiting . 
• Diarrhea .

coronavirus 2.  
It is important to note that some of the symptoms of COVID -19 overlap with solicited systemic 
ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA -1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and 
chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, 
investigators sho uld use their clinical judgment to decide if an NP or nasal swab should be 
collected. The collection of an NP or nasal swab prior to each vaccination can help ensure that 
cases of COVID -19 are not overlooked. Any study participant who reports respiratory s ymptoms 
during the 7 -day period after vaccination should be evaluated for COVID -19. 
During the course of the study, participants with symptoms of COVID -19 will be asked to return 
within 72  hours or as soon as possible to the study site or medically qualified staff from the study 
site will conduct a home visit as soon as possible to collect an NP or nasal swab sample (for 

ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 123 RT-PCR) for evaluation of COVID -19. Both study site visits and home visits are referred to as 
illness visits ( Section  7.1.6 ). The NP or nasal swab sample will also be tested for the presence of 
other respiratory infections. Additionally, a convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 
28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis ( for Part 1A and 1B only) ( Section  7.4.3 ). At this visit, an NP 
or nasal swab sampling for viral PCR and a blood sample will be collected for potential 
immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection. In addition, the study site may collect an 
additional respiratory sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical 
care for the study p articipant as determined by local standards of care.  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for 
COVID -19 and on RT -PCR detection of SARS -CoV -2 from samples collected within 72 hours 
of the study participant repor ting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID -19. Participants 
who are hospitalized for COVID -19 without the opportunity for a clinic or home visit will also 
be considered cases, assuming that the symptomology criteria for COVID -19 are met and a 
respirator y sample is positive for SARS -CoV -2 by PCR at a clinical laboratory improvement 
amendments -certified laboratory. Investigators are encouraged to try to obtain a respiratory 
sample during the course of hospitalization for submission to the study central lab oratory, if 
feasible. The investigator should determine if the criteria for severe COVID -19 has been met.  
Severe COVID -19 is defined in Section  7.4.1 . 
All clinical findings will be recorded in the eCRF. All confirmed cases of COVID -19 will be 
captured as MAAEs, along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, 
seriousness, and outcome, and will be reported immediately to the Sponso r or designee 
(Section  7.5.4 ). 
7.4.3.  Follow -up/Convalescent Period After Diagnosis with COVID -19  
Any confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 occurring in a participant will be captured as a MAAE 
along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, and  
outcome. A convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28  days (+7 days) after diagnosis 
(for Part 1A and Part 1B only). At this visit, an NP or nasal swab sampling for viral PCR and a 
blood sample will be collected for potential immunologic assess ment of SARS -CoV -2 infection. 
The investigator should determine if the criteria for severe COVID -19 has been met. If the 
participant is hospitalized, medically qualified study site personnel will try to obtain medical 
records and SARS -CoV -2 diagnostic resu lts. If the participant is later discharged from the 
hospital during the 28 -day period following diagnosis of COVID -19, the study site personnel 
will arrange for a resumption of the protocol schedule.  
Convalescent visits are not applicable to Part 1C -1, Pa rt 1C -2, Part 2, and Part  3. 
7.5. Safety Definitions and Related Procedures   
7.5.1.  Adverse Event   
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 124 Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an  
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the first dose of IP even though they may 
have been present before the start of the study  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Medical or surgica l procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  7.5.9 ). For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the vaccine and 
the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, for the 7  days after each dose of vaccine).  
7.5.2.  Serious Adverse Events   
An AE (including an AR) is consider ed an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the investigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be  reported to the Sponsor, 
whether or not it is considered related to the IP.  
• Is life -threatening   
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of dea th. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the 
hospital or emergency ward for at least one overnight stay for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient 
setting. The hospital or emergency ward admission should be considered an SAE 
regardless of whether opinions differ as to the necessity of the admission. 
Complications that occur during inpatient hospitalization will be recorded as an AE; 
however, if a complication/AE prolongs hospitalization or otherwise fulfills SAE 
criteria, the complicatio n/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 125 • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Medica lly important event   
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeop ardize 
the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiri ng 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
7.5.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions   
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after IP injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant rep orting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  7.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an 
eDiary on the day of each dose injection a nd for the 6  days after the day of dosing (Part  1A, 
Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3 only).  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in Table  6 modified from the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical 
Trials ( DHHS  2007 ). 
If a solicited lo cal or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will 
be prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until it resolves 
or the next IP injection  occurs  whichever occurs first; capture of detail s of ARs in the eDiary 
should not exceed 28 days after each vaccination . ARs recorded in the eDiary beyond Day  7 
should be reviewed by the study site staff either during the next scheduled telephone call or at 
the next study site visit. All solicited ARs ( local and systemic) will be considered causally

Source: Guidance for industry – Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in 
Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ). 
Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the participant’s 
source document and must also be recorded by th e study site staff on the solicited AR page of the 
participant’s eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to an HCP; otherwise meets the 
definition of a MAAE  
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the  study 
or the participant being withdrawn from the study by the investigator (AE leading to 
withdrawal)  
• Solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days after injection  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that leads to participant withdrawal from IP  
• Solicit ed local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE  
7.5.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events   
A MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to an HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for unscheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory test results follow -up, 
COVID -19 [Section  7.4.1 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary 
care physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAE. 
Unsolicited AEs will be captured on t he AE page of the eCRF.  
All confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 cases ( Section  7.4.1 ) will be recorded as MAAEs and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee imm ediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours, using 
the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section  7.5.11 ). The investigator will 
submit any updated COVID -19 case data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
7.5.4.1.  Anaphylaxis   
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as SAEs 
(Section  7.5.2 ) based on criteria for a medically important event unless  the event meets other 
serious criteria. As an SAE, the event  should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately 
and in all circumstances within 24 hours as per Section  7.5.10  (Reporting SAEs). The 
invest igator will submit any updated anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it 
being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent 
with anaphylaxis as shown below should be reported as a potential case o f anaphylaxis. This is 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 128 provided as general guidance for investigators and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case 
definition ( Rüggeberg  et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ -system involvement that can 
present as or rapidly progress to a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources. Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized 
by: 
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapi d progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involving  2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal : urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes  
− Cardiovascular : measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated 
shock, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, evidence of 
reduced peripheral circulation  
− Respiratory : bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, upper 
airwa y swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respiratory distress, 
persistent dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, 
rhinorrhea  
− Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting  
7.5.5.  Adverse Events of Special Interest   
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification b y the 
investigator to the Sponsor is required and documentation is in the form of a case narrative. Such 
events may require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Refer to 
Section  10.4, Appendix 4 for a list of AESIs pertinent to this study. All AESIs will be collected 
throughout the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately 
and in all circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC system. If 
a site receives a report of a new AESI from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site ca n report this 
information on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax 
line ( Section  7.5.11 ). 
7.5.5.1.  Acute Myocarditis and/or  Pericarditis   
These definitions are intended to serve as a guide to help in the reporting of suspected cases of 
myocarditis and/or pericarditis; however, the diagnosis of suspect ed cases is left to the 
investigator’s clinical judg ment . 
The investigator’s medical judgment must be applied when parent(s)/LAR(s) report that a  
participant has symptoms concerning for myocarditis and/or pericarditis per the  CDC case 
definition. Diagnosti c evaluation (eg, EKG, echocardiogram) and laboratory  testing (eg, 
troponin) per the CDC definition of myocarditis and/or pericarditis must be promptly obtained 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 129 for any participant with concerning signs/symptoms. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist should  
be obtained in those with positive test results or clinically significant symptoms without other 
identifiable causes. Additional testing and evaluation may be indicated. Once available, updated 
myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis case data will be submitted by the investigator to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours.  
All suspected cases of probable and confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis 
should be recorded as an AESI,  and reported as an SAE, if the event meets seriousness criteria. 
As an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours as per Section  7.5.12 . The investigator will submit any updated 
myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available. For reporting purposes, a participant wh o displays signs/symptoms consistent with the 
CDC case definitions as described below ( Gargano  et al 2021 ), should be reported as a potential 
case of confirmed or probable myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.  
7.5.5.2.  Acute Myocarditis Case Definition   
Presence of ≥ 1 new or worsening of the following clinical symptoms (persons who lack the 
listed symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified  as subclinical myocarditis 
[probable or confirmed]):  
• Chest pain/pressure/discomfort  
• Dyspnea/shortness of breath/pain with breathing  
• Palpitations  
• Syncope  
OR 
Infants and children aged < 12 years might instead have ≥ 2 of the following symptoms:  
• Irritability  
• Vomiting  
• Poor feeding  
• Tachypnea  
• Lethargy  
AND  
For PROBABLE CASE:  
Presence of ≥ 1 new finding of the following:  
• Troponin level above upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
• Abnormal ECG or EKG or rhythm monitoring findings consistent with myocarditis  
− To meet the ECG or rhythm monitoring criterion, a probable case must include at 
least one of the following:  
o ST segment or T -wave abnormalities

mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 130 o Paroxysmal or sustained atrial, supraventricular, or ventricular arrhythmias  
o AV nodal conduction delays or intravent ricular conduction defects  
• Abnormal cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram  
• Cardiac MRI  finding consistent with myocarditis ( Ferreira  et al 2018 ) 
AND  
• No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and fi ndings  
For CONFIRMED CASE:  
• Histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis (using Dallas criteria [ Aretz  et al 1987 ]) 
OR 
• Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with myocarditis in the 
presence of troponin level abov e upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
AND  
• No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
7.5.5.3.  Acute Pericarditis Case Definition   
Presence of ≥ 2 new or worsening of the following clinical features (Adler  et al 2015 ): 
• Acute chest pain (Typically described as pain made worse by lying down, deep 
inspiration, or cough; and relieved by sitting up or leaning forward, althoug h other 
types of chest pain may occur)  
• Pericardial rub on examination  
• New ST -elevation or PR -depression on EKG  
• New or worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiogram or magnetic resonance imaging  
7.5.5.4.  Myopericarditis Case Definition   
Participants who meet criteria for both myocarditis and pericarditis may be described under 
myopericarditis.  
7.5.5.5.  Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Case Definition   
Investigators will also be asked to report, as AESI, clinical signs/symptoms consistent with the 
CDC case definition of MIS -C (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/han00432.asp ): 
• An individual aged <  21 years prese nting with fever, laboratory evidence of 
inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with 
multisystem (>2) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, 
gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological);  
AND  
• No alternative plausible diagnoses;

Confidential  Page 131 AND  
• Positive for current or recent SARS -CoV -2 infection by RT -PCR, serology, or 
antigen test; or COVID -19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of 
symptoms:  
o Fever ≥  38.0°C/≥  100.4ºF for ≥  24 hours, or report  of subjective fever lasting 
≥24 hours  
o Including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: an elevated CRP, 
ESR, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d -dimer, ferritin, LDH, or IL -6, elevated 
neutrophils, reduced lymphocytes, and low albumin  
Some individual s may fulfill full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease but should be reported if 
they meet the case definition for MIS -C. Consider MIS -C in any pediatric death with evidence of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
All cases of MIS -C will be reported to the Sponsor o r designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours, using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line 
(Section  7.5.11 ). 
7.5.6.  Record ing and Follow -up of Pregnancy   
Female individuals who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test any time  during the study should receive no 
further dosing with IP but should be asked to remain in the study and be monitored for safety.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of t heir participation in the study.  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in this section.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abo rtion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital  anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of the study site learning of its occurrence, using  the SAE Mailbox, the SAE 
Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section  7.5.11 ). If the participant agrees to submit this information, 
the pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if 
intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be 
distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. The investigator must immediately 
(within 24  hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregn ancy resulting in an abnormal 
outcome according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
7.5.7.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 132 Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after each dose in Part 1A, Part 1C, 
Part 2, and Part 3. Other (unsolicited) AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after 
each dose in Part 1A, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part  3. 
Both MAAEs and SAEs will be collected from participants as specified in the SoA until the end 
of their participation in  Part 1A, Part 1B, Part C, Part 2, and Part  3. Any AEs that occur before 
adminis tration of IP will be analyzed separately from AEs.  
At every study site visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including COVID -19 symptoms) 
according to the sc ripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been hospitalized, 
had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any nonstudy  vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings, or data relevant to 
participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively foll ow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is 
LTFU (as defined in Section  6.4). 
7.5.8.  Assessment of Intensity   
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least on e of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section  7.5.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS  2007 ) will be used to categorize local 
and systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs ), and vital sign measurements observed during 
this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity events are presented in 
Section  7.5.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the investigator based 
upon medical judgment and the definition  of severity as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These eve nts cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from  the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s 
source do cumentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of 
intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset 
and duration of each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the cours e of the event is 
reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 133 7.5.9.  Assessment of Causality   
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to IP is part of the d ocumentation process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will  be characterized using the 
following classification:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Participant did not 
receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the IP is not 
reason able OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the IP.  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of 
exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of t he IP 
is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the IP than by another cause.  
7.5.10.  Reporting Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are obse rved or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to IP or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as 
to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the  study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Information to be collected includes the type of event, time of onset, 
investigator -specified assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and 
relationship to IP, time of resolution of th e event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment 
or evaluations, and outcome. The unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions 
to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must 
also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by the 
investigator to be not clinically significant. The MedDRA will be used to code all unsolicited 
AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the partici pant is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
7.5.11.  Reporting SAEs   
Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward  the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE considered serious by the investigator or that meets SAE criteria ( Section  7.5.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the 
EDC system. The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the SAE. T he Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in the 21 US CFR Part 312 and  Part 320. The investigator is responsible 
for notifying the IRB directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SA E, the following contact information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 134 • SAE Mailbox:  
• SAE Fax line:  
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAE are described in Section  7.5.15 . 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to IP or study procedures, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the  study.  
7.5.12.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information   
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP dosing but after obtaining informed consent 
will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions Section of the eCRF and not 
in the AE Section; however, if the conditi on worsens at any time during the study, it will be 
recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and  nonleading manner  
Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after each dose. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day of injection through 28  days after each dose.  
Serious AEs will be collected from the start o f IP dosing until the last day of study participation.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24  hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the 
Sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by the investigator to be clinically significant (eg, leads to dose modification or 
study drug discontinuation, or meets  any serious criteria). If this is the case, it must be recorded 
in the source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation that 
produced the value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is 
stabi lized and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EOS participation. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant has 
withdrawn from or completed the study, and the investigator conside rs the event to be reasonably 
related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
7.5.13.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs   
Electronic diaries hav e specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomitant 
medi cations/vaccinations.

Confidential  Page 135 The investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of treatment group or 
suspected causal relationship to IP. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of t he AE and to assess whether the AE meets 
the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about the 
occurrence of AE.  
7.5.14.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/SAE report, the invest igator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTF U, as defined in 
Section  6.4. 
7.5.15.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward  the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponso r has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating t o safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigators.  
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded 
to investiga tors as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific  safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB, i f appropriate 
according to local requirements.  
7.6. Safety Monitoring   
The CRO’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the individual study site 
investigators will monito r safety throughout the study . 
7.6.1.  Data Safety Monitoring Board   
Safety oversight will be under the direction of a DSMB composed of external independent 
consultants with relevant expertise. Members of the DSMB will be independent from the study 
conduct and free of conflict of interest.  
For the blinded phase of Part 1 of the study, the DSMB will have separate meetings by 
teleconference to review unblinded safety data when half of th e study population 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 136 (1500  randomized participants) have reached Day 8 (1 week after Dose 1) and again 
approximately when 25% (750), 50% (1500), and 75% (2250) of enrolled participants have 
reached Day  36 (1 week after Dose 2).  Recruitment will continue, as applicable, during the 
DSMB review period. The DSMB will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be 
written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. Details regarding the DSMB 
composition, responsibilities, procedures, and f requency of data review will be defined in its 
charter.  
For Part 2 and Part 3 of the study, the DSMB will convene on an ad hoc basis if any of the pause 
rules, described in Section  6.4, are met. The DSMB will review all available unblinded study 
data to adjudicate any potential study pauses and make recommendations on further study 
conduct, including requesting additional information, recommending stop ping the study, 
recommending changes to study conduct and/or the protocol, or recommending additional 
operational considerations due to safety issues that arise during the study.  
7.6.2.  Independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee   
An independent CEAC of medically qualified personnel, including cardiologists, will review all 
suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if they meet CDC criteria of 
“probable” or “confir med” events which are reported in ongoing interventional clinical trials per 
the CEAC charter ( Gargano  et al 2021 ). Any case that the CEAC assesses as representing 
probable or confirmed cases of myocarditis or pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, who 
will then determine if additional action is needed.  
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed 
at the organizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC co mposition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study.  
The details of statistical analysis will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before the 
clinical database lock for the study. If changes are made to primary and/or key secondary 
objectives and hypotheses or the statistical methods related to t hose hypotheses after the study 
has begun but prior to any data unblinding, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with 
ICH Guideline E9). Changes to other secondary or exploratory analyses made after the protocol 
has been finalized, along with an e xplanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in 
the SAP or CSR for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, will be clearly identified in 
the CSR.  
8.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses   
See Section  3.1.1.1  regarding the addition of a Participant Decision Visit as part of this protocol 
amendment.  
Part 1A of this study is observer -blind. The investigator, study staff, study participants, study sit e 
monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the IP administered until 
study end or initiation of Part 1B or Part 1C or Part 2, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded pharmacy personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to v accine 
accountability procedures and will prepare and administer mRNA -1273 (or placebo) 
to all participants. These pharmacy personnel will have no study functions other than 
study vaccine management, documentation, accountability, preparation, and 
administ ration. They will not be involved in participant evaluations and will not 
reveal the identity of IP to either the participant or the blinded study site personnel 
involved in the conduct of the study unless this information is necessary in the case of 
an em ergency.  
• Unblinded study site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be 
assigned as the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure 
that study sites are following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and  
administration procedures.  
• An unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the preplanned IA 
(Section  8.7.1 ). Sponsor team members will be  prespecified to be unblinded to the IA 
results and will not communicate the results of IA to the blinded investigators, study 
site staff, clinical monitors, or participants. This is detailed in the study Data Blinding 
Plan.  
In Part 1A, the dosing assignme nt will be concealed by having the unblinded pharmacy 
personnel prepare the IP in a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. 
An opaque sleeve over the syringe used for injection will maintain the blind at the time of 
injectio n, as the doses containing mRNA -1273 will look different to that of placebo. Only 
delegated unblinded study site staff will conduct the injection procedure. Once the injection is 
completed, only the blinded study staff will perform further assessments and interact with the 
participants. Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 138 As documented in the study Data Blinding Plan, the prespecified Sponsor and CRO personnel 
will be unblinded for the IA of immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy.  
The purpose of the unblinding is to enable the group to develop regulatory submission 
documents and to address questions from regulatory agencies during the regulatory review of the 
submission. After unblinding, this unblinded team will not participate in the conduct or 
execution of the subsequent course of the study. The study Data Blinding Plan provides details of 
the blinding/unblinding process and personnel. The study site staff, investigators, study monitors, 
and participants will remain  blinded until the initiation of Part 1B or Part 1C or Part 2.  
8.1.1.  Breaking the Blind   
A participant or participants may be unblinded in the event of an SAE or other severe event, or if 
there is a medical emergency requiring the identity of the product to be known to properly treat a 
participant. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant during the study, the blind will be 
broken if knowledge of the administered vaccine will a ffect that participant’s dosing options. In 
the event of a medical emergency requiring identification of the vaccine administered to an 
individual participant, the investigator will make every attempt to contact the Sponsor medical 
lead to explain the need  for opening the code within 24  hours of opening the code. The 
investigator will be responsible for documenting the time, date, reason for the code break, and 
the names of the personnel involved.  
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data will also be 
unblinded to a statistical team at specified timepoints for IA as outlined in Section  8.7.1 . 
8.2. Statistical Hypothesis   
8.2.1.  Part  1  
8.2.1.1.  Part  1A  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is established for the primary 
immunogenicity objective, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of participants on 
mRNA -1273 with serum Ab equal to or above the established threshold at Day  57 is ≤  70% (ie, 
H0: percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 ≤  70% with serum Ab at Day  57 equal to or 
above the established threshold).  
The study would be considered as meeting the immunogenicity  objective if the 95% CI of 
percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 rules out 70% (lower bound of the 95%  CI > 70%).  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available for the 
primary immunogenicity objective, the immunogenic ity analysis of primary vaccine response 
will be performed using the noninferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on the 2 
coprimary endpoints, respectively.  
Coprimary endpoint 1: Ab GM value  at Day  57 
The null hypothesis  H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by Ab GM 
value  at Day 57 is inferior in adolescents (12 to <  18 years of age) compared with that in young 
adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) using mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 139 The noninferiority in Ab GM in adol escents compared with that in young adults ( 18 to 25  years 
of age) is demonstrated by that the lower bound of the 95%  CI of the GMR rules out 0.6 67 
(lower bound >0.667) using a noninferiority margin of 1.5. The GMR is the ratio of the GM 
value of adolescen ts on mRNA -1273 in this study, Study P203, at Day 57 compared with the 
GM value of young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) on mRNA -1273 in Study  P301 . 
Coprimary endpoint 2: Ab SRR  at Day  57 
A definition of seroresponse will be provided in the SAP based on for thcoming information 
about assay performance.  
The null hypothesis  H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by SRR  at 
Day 57 is inferior in adolescents (12 to <  18 years of age) compared with that in young adults 
(18 to 25  years of age) using mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.  
The noninferiority in SRR  in adolescents compared with that in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of 
age) is demonstrated by that the lower bound of the 95%  CI of the SRR  difference rules 
out -10% (ie, lower bound >-10%) using the noninferiority margin of 10%. The SRR  difference 
is defined as the rate in adolescents receiving mRNA -1273 minus the rate in young adults (18  to 
25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 from Study  P301.  
The study would be considered as meeting  the primary immunogenicity objective if 
noninferiority is demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Details regarding the assay to be used to assess noninferiority will be provided in the SAP.  
8.2.1.2.  Part 1C –1 – Homologous Booster Phase   
The immunogenicity analysis of BD vaccine response against the ancestral strain will be 
performed using the noninferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on the 2 coprimary 
endpoints, respect ively.  
Coprimary Endpoint 1: Ab GM value  at BD -Day 29 
Null hypothesis  H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 BD as measured by Ab GM 
value  at BD -Day 29 in adolescents (12 -<18 years of age) in Study  P203 Part 1C -1 is inferior 
compared with Ab GM value  at Day 57 (28 days after Dose 2) in the primary series of 
mRNA -1273 in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) in Study  P301 . 
The noninferiority in Ab GM value  at BD -Day 29 in Study  P203 Part 1C -1 compared with Ab 
GM value  at Day  57 in the primary series in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) in Study  P301 
will be demonstrated by the GMR 95% CI lower bound >0.667 using a noninferiority margin of 
1.5. The GMR is defined as the GM value  of Ab at BD -D29 in Study  P203 Part 1C -1 compared 
with Ab GM value  at Day 5 7 (28 days after Dose 2) following the primary series of mRNA -1273 
in Study  P301.  
Coprimary Endpoint 2: Ab Seroresponse Rate (SRR) at BD -Day 29 
Null hypothesis  H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 BD as measured by SRR at 
BD-Day 29 in adolescents (12 -<18 years of age) in Study  P203 Part 1C -1 is inferior compared 
with SRR at Day 57 (28  days after Dose 2) following the primary series of mRNA -1273 in 
young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) in Study  P301.

following the primary series of mRNA -1273 will be demonstrated by the SRR difference 95% CI 
lower bound >-10% using the noninferiority margin of 10%. The SRR difference is defined as 
the SRR at BD -Day 29 Study  P203 Part 1C -1 minus the rate at Day 57 (28 days after Dose 2) 
following the primary series of mRNA -1273 in young adults in Study  P301. Seroresponse is 
defined as Ab value  change from baseline ( preDose  1) below the LLOQ to ≥ 4 × LLOQ, or at 
least a 4 -fold rise if baseline is ≥ LLOQ.  
The primary immunogenicity objective in Part 1C -1 is met if the noninferiority is demonstrated 
based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Key Secondary Endpoint 1: GM value  of Ab Against Circulating Strain at BD -Day 29 
Null hypothesis  H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 BD as measured by GM value  of 
Ab against circulating strain at BD -Day 29 in adolescents (12 -<18 years of age) in Study  P203 
Part 1C -1 is inferior compared with GM value  of Ab against circulating strain at Day 57 (28 days

GM value  at Day  57 in the primary series in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) in Study  P301 
will be demonstrated by the GMR 95% CI lower bound >0.667 using a noninferiority margin of 
1.5. The  GMR is defined as the ratio of GM value  of Ab at BD -Day 29 in Study  P203 Part 1C -1 
compared with Ab GM value  at Day 57 (28 days after Dose  2) following the primary series of 
mRNA -1273 in Study  P301.  
Key Secondary Endpoint 2: Seroresponse Rate (SRR) of Ab Against Circulating Strain at 
BD-Day 29 
Null hypothesis  H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 BD as measured by SRR of Ab 
against circulating strain at BD -Day 29 in adolescents (12 -<18 years of age) in Study  P203 
Part 1C-1 is inferior compared with SRR  of Ab against circulating strain at Day 57 (28 days after 
Dose 2) following the primary series of mRNA -1273 in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) in 
Study  P301.  
The noninferiority in SRR at BD -D29 compared with SRR at Day 57 (28 days after Dose 2) 
following the primary series of mRNA -1273 will be demonstrated by the SRR  difference  95% CI 
lower bound >-10% using the noninferiority margin of 10%. The SRR difference is defined as 
the SRR at BD -Day 29 Study  P203 Part 1C -1 minus the rate at Day 57 (28 da ys after Dose 2) 
following the primary series of mRNA -1273 in young adults in Study  P301. Serores ponse  is 
defined as Ab value  change from baseline (pre  Dose 1) below the LLOQ to ≥ 4 × LLOQ, or at 
least a 4 -fold rise if baseline is ≥ LLOQ.  
The key secondary immunogenicity objective in Part 1C -1 is met if the noninferiority is 
demonstrated based on both key secondary endpoints.  
8.2.2.  Part  2

Hypothesis testing for the  endpoints that infer effectiveness of the 50-µg mRNA -1273.222 in 
adolescents will be performed on the null hypotheses for the 2 coprimary endpoints  as follows:  
Coprimary Endpoint 1: Post Dose 1 Ab GM value  against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at Day 29 
(superiority testing ) 
The null hypothesis H0: GM value of Ab against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at Day 29 post Dose 1 of 
50 μg mRNA -1273.222 in adolescents who are baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive is not superior to 
GM value at Day 57 post Dose 2 of 100 μg mRNA -1273 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study  P301.  
The superiority in Ab GM value against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in adolescents who are baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 positive compared with that in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young adults (18 to 
25 years of age ) is demonstrated by meeting the following success criterion : 
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR  >1. 
The GMR is the ratio of the GM value against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at Day 29 post Dose 1 of 
50 μg mRNA -1273.222 in adolescents who are baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive in Study P203 
Part 3 over the GM value against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at Day 57 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 
negative young adults (18 to 25 years of age) post Dose 2 of 100 μg mRNA -1273 in Study  P301 . 
Coprimary Endpoint 2: Post Dose 1 Ab  GM value against the ancestral strain  at Day 29 
(noninferiority testing)  
The null hypothesis H 0: GM value of Ab against ancestral strain at Day 29 post Dose 1 of 50 μg 
mRNA -1273.222 in adolescents who are baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive is inferior to GM value 
at Day 57 post Dose 2 of 100 μg mRNA -1273 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young adults 
(18 to 25 years of age) in Study  P301 .  
The noninfer iority in Ab GM value against ancestral strain adolescents  who are  baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 positive compared with that in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) is demonstrated by meeting the following success criterion : 
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR >0.667.  
The GMR is the ratio of the GM value against ancestral strain at Day 29 post Dose 1 of 50 μg 
mRNA -1273.222 in adolescents who are baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive in Study P203 Part 3 
over the GM value against ancestral strain at Day 57 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young

8.3.1.1.  Part  1A  
The sample size of this study is driven by safety. Approximately 3000 participants will be 
randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive mRNA -1273 and placebo  (Section  5.2). With 
2000  participants exposed to mRNA‑1273, the study has at least 90% probability to observe at 
least 1 participant with an AE at a true 0.25% AE rate .

Subset).  
Approximately 362 participants who receive mRNA -1273 wi ll be selected for the 
Immunogenicity Subset, with a target of 289  participants receiving mRNA -1273 in the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset (adjusting for approximately 20% of participants who may be excluded 
from the PP Immunogenicity Subset, as they may not have  immunogenicity results due to any 
reason). The sample size of the Immunogenicity Subset may be updated with data from other 
mRNA -1273 studies or external data especially regarding a threshold of protection. In such a 
situation, the final sample size of th e Immunogenicity Subset will be documented in the SAP.  
For the primary immunogenicity objective, with approximately 289  participants in the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset, the study will have >  90% power to rule out 70% with a 2 -sided 95% CI 
for the percentage o f mRNA -1273 participants exceeding the acceptable threshold if the true rate 
of participants exceeding the acceptable threshold is 80%.  
If an acceptable Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available at the time of 
analysis, for the primary i mmunogenicity objective, noninferiority tests of 2 null hypotheses 
based on 2 coprimary endpoints, respectively, will be performed. The sample size calculation for 
each of the 2 noninferiority tests was performed, and the larger sample size was chosen for the 
study.

8.5.3.  Immunogenicity Analyses  in Part 1   
The SAP will describe the complete set of immunogenicity analyses, including the approach to 
sample participants into an Immunogenicity Subset for analysis of immunogenicity. The PP 
Immunogenicity Subset is the primary analysis set for immunogenicity unless otherwise 
specified. The primary immunogenicity objective of this study is to use the immunogenicity 
response to infer efficacy in adolescents (12  to <18  years in this study). The primary 
immunogenicity analysis is performed in Part 1A.  
If an accepted serum Ab thresh old of protection against COVID -19 is available based on data 
from other mRNA -1273 studies or external data, the number and percentage of participants with 
Ab greater than or equal to the threshold at Day  57 will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using 
the Clopper -Pearson method. If the lower bound of the 95% CI on the mRNA -1273 group is 
>70%, the primary immunogenicity objective of this study will be considered to be met.  
The percentage of participants with serum Ab greater than or equal to the threshold w ith 95% CI 
will be provided at each postbaseline timepoint. The CI will be calculated using the 
Clopper -Pearson method.  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not established, the 
noninferiority of primary vaccine response as m easured by Ab GM value  and SRR  in adolescents 
compared with those in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 will be 
assessed. The study is considered as meeting the primary immunogenicity objective if the 
noninferiority of the immune resp onse to mRNA -1273 as measured by both GM value  and SRR  
at Day 57 is demonstrated in adolescents in this study at a 2 -sided α of 0.05, compared with that 
in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) in Study  P301 receiving mRNA -1273.  
An ANCOVA model will be carr ied out with Ab value at Day 57 as a dependent variable and a 
group variable (adolescents in Study P203 and young adults in Study  P301) as the fixed variable. 
The GM values of the adolescents at Day 57 will be estimated by the GLSM from the model. 
The GMR (ratio of GM values) will be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model. A 
corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided to assess the difference in immune response for 
the adolescents in Study P203 compared to the young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) i n Study 
P301 at Day  57. The noninferiority of immune response to mRNA -1273 as measured by GM 
value  will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95%  CI of the GMR is >0.667 
based on the noninferiority margin of 1.5.

mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 148 The number and percentage (rate) of participants achieving Ab seroresponse at Day 57 will be 
summarized. The difference of SRR s between adolescents receiving mRNA -1273 in Study P203 
and young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 in Study P301  will be calculated 
with 95% CI. The noninferiority in SRR  of adolescents in Study P203 compared to young adults 
(18 to 25  years of age) in Study P301 will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 
95% CI of the SRR  difference is >-10%, based on  the noninferiority margin of 10%.  
In addition, the GM level of specific nAb and bAb with corresponding 95% CI will be provided 
at each timepoint. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log 
transformed values then back transforme d to the original scale. The GMFR of nAb and bAb with 
corresponding 95% CI will be provided at each timepoint with Day  57 as the primary timepoint 
of interest. Descriptive summary statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will also 
be provided.

Long -term analysis will be performed including data collected in the Open -label Observationa l 
Phase (Part 1B), and prior to BD if a BD is received. The analysis will include participants who 
are randomized to mRNA -1273 in Part 1A and remained in the study with or without unblinding, 
and participants who are originally randomized to placebo and la ter crossed over to receive 
mRNA -1273 in Part 1B after unblinding. Long -term analysis of applicable safety, efficacy, and 
immunogenicity endpoints will be summarized descriptively by treatment cohort as defined in 
Table  9 without treatment group comparison.

Exploratory analyses will be described in the SAP before database lock.  
8.5.10.  Subgroup Analyses   
Subgroup analyses will be performed as described in the SAP.  
8.6. Multiplicity Adjustment   
A hierarchical sequential hypothesis testing (fixed -sequence) method will be used to adjust 
multiplicity to preserve the family -wise type I error rate ( α = 0.05). The hypothesis testing for the 
2 coprimary endpoints (GMT and SRR) for the primary series of mRNA -1273 in Part 1A was 
completed and statistically significant based on data snapshot dated 08 May 2021, and thus the α 
level of 0.05 can be passed to P art 1C -1 hypothesis testing. In Part 1C -1 Homologous Booster 
Phase, the hypothesis testing for the 2 coprimary endpoints (GMT and SRR against the ancestral  
strain) after BD of mRNA -1273 will be tested at α level of 0.05. The testing in Part 1A and 1C -1 
will continue through the sequence only until an endpoint is not statistically significant (did not 
meet specified noninferiority success criteria), in which case the testing will stop. If the 
hypothesis testing for the 2  coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1-Homo logous Booster Phase is 
statistically significant (meeting the noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary endpoints), 
the α level of 0.05 will be passed to the hypothesis testing in Part  3. 
For the key secondary objective in Part 1C -1 Homologous Boos ter Phase to evaluate immune 
response elicited by the 50 µg prototype booster of mRNA -1273 against variant(s) of interest, the 
key secondary endpoints will be analyzed independently, given that prototype vaccine 
mRNA -1273 does not contain variant specific sequences.

Confidential  Page 153 Part  3 
Since the hypothesis testing for the coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1 was statistically significant 
based on an IA with a data cutoff dated 16 May 2022, the α level of 0.05 (two -sided) was passed 
to Part 3 hypothesis testing.  
8.7. Study Analyses

If a participant cannot attend a study site visit (scheduled or unscheduled) with the exception of 
Screening or Day  1, a home visit is accep table if performed by appropriately delegated study site 
staff or a home healthcare service provided by the Sponsor ( Section  7). If neither a participant 
visit to the study site nor a home visit to the participant is possible (with the aforementioned 
exceptions), a safety telephone call should be performed that includ es the assessments scheduled 
for the safety telephone calls.  
After the Participant Decision Clinic Visit, participants will continue to follow the Part 1A SoA 
(Table  10) or Part 1B SoA ( Table  12), as described in Section  3.1.1.2  and as shown in Figure  10. 
All eligible participants will be offered a BD and those who choose to receive BD will follow 
Part 1C-1 SoA ( Table  13). Eligible participants that completed their primary COVID -19 
vaccination series under EUA and choose to receive a BD will follow Part 1C -2 SoA  (Table  14). 
Eligible participants enrolled in Part 2 will follow Part 2 SoA ( Table  15 and Table  16). Eligible 
participants enrolled in Part 3 will follow Part 3 SoA ( Table  17 and Table  18).

Note : In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Pub lic Health Emergency (DHHS  2020 ), investigators may convert 
study site visits to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
Note: If during the Participant Decision Visit (Table  11) the participant is unblinded and determined to have received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 in Part 1A, due to statistical 
considerations, they will be c onsidered in the Open -label Observational Phase but will continue to follow the Part 1A SoA. 
1. Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Day 0 Visit may be performed over multiple visits if preformed within the 28 -day Screening windo w. 
2. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the participant is not able to attend a study site visit due to the  COVID -19 pandemic 
(self-quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “s tay at home” or “shelter in place”), a safety 
telephone call to the participant should be made in place of the st udy site visit. The safety telephone call should encompass all scheduled visit assessments that can be 
completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medications (eg, as defined in scheduled safety telephone call s). Home visits will be perm itted for all

Confidential  Page 165 nondosing  visits, except for  Screening, if a participant cannot visit the study site due to the  COVID -19 pandemic. Home visits must be permitted by the study site IRB and the 
participant via informed consent/assent and have prior approval from the Sponsor (or its designee).  
3. If the visit for the second dose (Day  29) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 29 +7 days due to the  COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site 
activities following business continuity plans an d/or local government mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in place”), the visit window may be extended to 
Day 29 + 21 days. When the extended visit window is used, the remaining study visits should be rescheduled to follow the inter -visit interval from  the actual date of the 
second dose.  
4. Safety follow -up via an eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day  71 to Day  183 and again from Day  223 to Day  363. 
5. Safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be performed every 4 weeks from Da y 85 to Day  197 and again from Day  237 to Day  377. 
6. The Participant Decision Visit may be performed over multiple visits. Once the Participant Decision Visit has been initiated, all assessments must be c ompleted within a 7 -
day period.  
7. Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at Day  1, Day  29, Day  57, Day  209, and Day  394. BMI will be calculated 
only at Screening Visit (Day  0). Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other timepoints at the discretion of the investigator. On each injection day 
before injection and again 7 days after injection, the arm receiving the injection should be examined and the associated lymp h nodes should be evaluated. Any clinically 
significant finding identi fied during a study visit should be reported as a MAAE. Vital signs are to be measured predose and postdose on days of injection (Day  1 and 
Day 29). When applicable, vital signs should be measured before blood collection. Participants who are febrile (body  temperature ≥  38.0°C/100.4°F) before injection on 
Day 1 or Day  29 must have the visit rescheduled within the relevant visit window to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with mino r illnesses can be enrolled at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
8. Pregnancy test at Screening and Day  1 and before the second study injection will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via 
blood or point -of-care urine test can be performed at any time.  
9. Sample must b e collected prior to dosing of injection on Day  1. 
10. The nasopharyngeal or nasal swab sample will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.  
11. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for C OVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the prespecified criteria of 
suspicion for COVID -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an unscheduled illne ss visit, to 
include an NP or nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing)  and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a home visit may be arranged to collect the NP or 
nasal sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will be asked to submit a sal iva sampl e to the study site by a Sponsor -approved 
method. At this illness visit, the NP or nasal swab samples will be collected to evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. NP or nasal swab samples will also be 
tested for the presence of other respiratory  pathogens. If due to COVID -19 related restrictions in the community, the participant’s LAR performed a home test rather than 
obtaining a test performed by a health care professional, see Section  7.1.6 . In addition, the study site may collect an additional NP or nasal sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to 
be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined by local standards of  care. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
12. A convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis. At this visit, an NP or nasal swab sa mpling for vir al PCR and a blood sample will be 
collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
13. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the study site with in struction provided by stu dy staff. Study participants 
will continue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day  of injection and for 6 days following injection. If a 
solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond  Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDi ary 
until the AR is resolves or the next IP injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary sho uld not exceed 28  days after each vaccination. A Rs 
recorded in eDiaries beyond Day  7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the following study visit.  
14. Trained study site personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any  AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to study withdrawal, information on concomitant 
medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy  vaccinations. In addition, study personnel will collect information on known participant exposure to someone 
with know n COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms.  
15. All concomitant medications and nonstudy  vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days after each injection; all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatm ent of 
an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day  1 through the final visit (Day  394).

1. The Participant Decision Visit may be performed over multiple visits. Once the Participant Decision Visit has been initiated, 
all assessments must be completed within a 7 -day period.  
2. After the OL -D57 visit, Part 1B participants who choose to receive BD will have one additional safety call at OL -D113 prior 
to entering Part 1C -1. 
3. The NP or nasal swab sample, collected prior to vaccination on days of injec tion, will be used to ascertain the presence of 
SARS -CoV -2 via PCR.  
4. Physical examination: A symptom -directed physical examination will be performed at OL -D1, OL -D29, OL -D57, and 
OL-D178. Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the discretion of the 
investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as a MAAE. Vital signs are 
to be collected predosing and postdosing on days of injection (OL -D1 and OL -D29). When applicable , vital sign 
measurements should be performed before blood collection. Participants who are febrile (body temperature 
≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) before injection on OL -D1 or OL -D29 must be rescheduled within the relevant window period to receive 
the injection. Afeb rile participants with minor illnesses can be administered investigational product at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
5. All concomitant medications and nonstudy  vaccinations will be recorded through out the study ; all concomitant medications 
relevant to o r for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day  1 through OL -D113 before entering Part 1C -
1. If a participant declines a BD, all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be 
recorded from Day 1 through OL-D178.  
6. If a participant meets the prespecified criteria of suspicion for COVID -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to 
return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an unscheduled illness visit, to include an NP or nasal s wab 
sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not p ossible, a home visit may be arranged 
to collect the NP or nasal sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will be 
asked to submit a saliva sample to the study site by a Sponsor -approved method. At this illne ss visit, the NP or nasal swab 
samples will be collected to evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. NP or nasal swab samples will also be 
tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. If due to COVID -19 related restrictions in the comm unity, the 
participant’s LAR performed a home test rather than obtaining a test performed by a health care professional, see 
Section  7.1.6 . In additi on, the study site may collect an additional NP or nasal sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to 
render appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical 
information will be carefully co llected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
7. During OL -D57, all participants will be given the option to receive a BD. Participants will choose whether to receive the BD 
or not and sign the consent form. Those who decline BD will continue with Pa rt 1B. Those who choose to receive a BD will 
have one safety call prior to entering Part 1C -1. 
8. All participants in Part 1B who choose to receive BD will have one additional safety call at OL -D113 prior to entering Part 
1C-1. 
9. OL-D178 is only for those who decline BD. Participants who choose to receive a BD will follow Part 1C -1 SoA after the 
OL-D113 safety call. The BD -D1 has a window  of -1 month, thus, can be scheduled at least 5 months after the second dose, 
and participants will need to complete the OL -D113 safety call.

investigators may convert study site visits to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
1. A BD may be administered to all participants who are currently enrolled in Part 1A or Part 1B provided there are no current c ontraindications for further 
dosing ( Section  6). A participant who is currently in the Convalescent Period may come in for a BD -1 visit and receive a BD as long they are no longer 
symptomatic, an d this includes the possibility for a Convalescent Visit Day 28 to overlap and be combined with a BD -1 visit.  
2. Symptom -directed physical examination will be performed at the BD -Day 1. On dosing day before injection, the arm receiving the injection should be  
examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated. At visits BD -2 (BD -D29), BD -3 (BD -D181) and BD -4 (BD -D361), a symptom -directed 
physical examination may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Any clinically significant finding ide ntified during a study visit should be 
reported as a MAAE. Vital signs are to be collected predosing  and postdosing (participant will be seated for at least 5 minutes before all measurements are 
taken per Section  7.1.4 ) on the day of injection (BD -D1). Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥  38.0°C/100.4°F) before dosing (BD -D1) must be 
rescheduled to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.  
3. The pregnancy test at the BD -1 visit will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care 
urine test can be performed.  
4. Sample should be collected prior to dosing on BD -D1. 
5. All participants who chose to receive a BD. Serum sample from two ~4 mL blood draws. Biomarker plasma and biomarker serum sam ples will be stored for 
potential future biomarker assessment.  
6. Postdosing, participants will have a 30 -minute observation period.  
7. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the 
prespecified criteria of su spicion for COVID -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study 
site for an unsched uled illness visit, to include an NP or nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not

Note: In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Heal th Emergency ( DHHS 2020 ), 
investigators may convert study site visits to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
1. BD-Day 0 and BD -Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the BD -Day 0 Visit may be performed over multiple visits if preformed within 
the 7 -day Screening window. A BD will be administered to all eligible participants who are at least 3 months from completion of primary series under EUA 
(outside of the study).  
2. A full physical exa mination including height, weight, and vital signs will be performed at the BD -Day 1. On dosing day before injection, the arm receiving 
the injection should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated. At visits BD -2 (BD -D29), BD -3 (BD -D181) and BD -4 (BD -D361), a 
symptom -directed physical examination may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Any clinically significant finding iden tified during a study 
visit should be reported as a MAAE. Vital signs are to be collected predosing and postdosing (participant will be seated for at least 5 minutes before all 
measurements are taken per Section  7.1.4  on the day of injection (BD -D1). Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) before dosing 
(BD-D1) must be rescheduled to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be vaccinated at the discret ion of the inve stigator.  
3. The pregnancy test at the BD -1 Visit will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care 
urine test can be performed.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 175 4. Sample should be collected prior to dosing on BD -D1. 
5. Serum sample from two ~4 mL blood draws. Biomarker plasma and biomarker serum samples will be stored for potential future bio marker assessment.  
6. Postdosing, participants will have a 30 -minute observation period.  
7. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by react ogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the 
prespecified criteria of suspicion for COVID -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study 
site for an unscheduled illness visit, to include an NP or nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not 
possible, a home visit may be arranged to collect the nasal swab sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will 
be asked to submit a saliva sample to the study site by a Sponsor -approved met hod. At this illness visit, the NP or nasal swab samples will be collected to 
evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. Nasal swab samples will also be tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. If due to 
COVID -19 related restrictions  in the community, the participant’s LAR performed a home test rather than obtaining a test performed by a health care 
professional, see Section  7.1.6 . In addition, the study site may collect an additional nasal swab sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render 
appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical informati on will be c arefully collected to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
8. The nasal swab sample must be collected prior to injection at the BD -1 Visit. 
9. Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any unsolicited AEs, MAAEs  (including any signs and symptoms of 
COVID -19), AESIs, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy  
vaccinations.  
10. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the study site with instruction provided by study staff. 
Study participants will continue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of injection and 
for 6 days following injection. If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be prompted to capture 
details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR resolves; capture of details o f ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after 
vaccination. A Rs recorded in eDiaries beyond Day 7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the following study visit. Review of eDi ary will occur 
on BD -D8. 
11. Only for participants who chose to re ceive a BD.  
12. All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Screening through the fi nal visit.

Confidential  Page 181 encompass all scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medi cations (eg, as defined in 
scheduled safety telephone calls). Home visits will be permitted for all nondosing visits, with the exception of Screening, i f a participant cannot visit the 
study site as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Home visits must be pe rmitted by the study site IRB and the participant via informed consent/assent and 
have prior approval from the Sponsor (or its designee).  
1. Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Day 0 visit may be performed over multiple visit s if preformed within the 7-day 
screening window.  If eligible, participants will receive 50 µg mRNA -1273 28 days apart and will receive a  BD at least 3 months from second dose.  
2. If the visit fo r the second dose (Day 29) or BD (Day 149) is disrupted and c annot be completed at Day 29 +7 or at Day 149 -28 days as a result of the 
COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “stay at 
home ” or “shelter in place ”), the visit window may be extended to Day 29 + 21 days  or Day 149 +21 days . When the extended visit window is used, the 
remaining study visits should be rescheduled to follow the inter -visit interval from the actual date of the second dose.  
3. Safety follow -up via an eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 191 to Day 303 and again from Day 343 to Day 455. 
4. Safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 205 to Day 317 and again from Day 357 to Day 469.  
5. Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height , weight, and vital signs  will be performed at Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, Day 149, Day 329, 
and Day  514. BMI will be calculated only at Screening Visit (Day 0). Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the 
discretion of the investigator. On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection, the arm receiving th e injection should be examined and 
the associated lymph nodes should be e valuated. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE. Vital signs 
are to be measured pre and post -dose on days of injection (Day 1 , Day 29 , and Day 149 ). When applicable, vital signs should be measured before blood 
collec tion. Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) before injection on Day 1 , Day 29 , or Day 149  must have the visit rescheduled 
within the relevant visit window to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with mi nor illnesses can be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.  
6. Pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 and before the second and third/booster study injection will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the 
investigator, a pregnancy test e ither via blood or point -of-care urine test can be  performed at any time.  
7. Serum sample from two ~4 mL blood draws. Biomarker plasma and biomarker serum samples will be stored for potential future bio marker assessment.  
8. Sample must be collected prior to dosi ng of injection on Day 1 , Day 29, and Day  149. 
9. The nasal swab sample will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV-2 via RT -PCR.  
10. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for C OVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs.  If a participant meets the 
prespecified criteria of suspicion for COVID -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as p ossible to the study 
site for an unscheduled illness visit, to include a nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a 
home visit may be arranged to collect the NP or nasal sample and conduc t clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will be asked to 
submit a saliva sample to the study site by a Sponsor -approved method. At this illness visit, the NP or nasal swab samples will be collected to evaluate for 
the prese nce of SARS -CoV-2 infection. NP or nasal swab samples will also be tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. In addition, the s tudy 
site may collect an additional NP or nasal sample for SARS -CoV-2 testing to be able to render appropriate medi cal care for the study participant as 
determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severit y of the clinical case.  
11. A convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days ) after diagnosis. At this visit, a nasal swab sampling for viral PCR and a blood 
sample will be collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV-2 infection.  
12. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the study site with instruction provided by study staff. 
Study participants will continue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of injection and 
for 6 days followi ng injection. If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be prompted to capture 
details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR resolves or the next IP injection occurs, which ever occurs first; capture of details of

telephone call or at the following study visit.  
13. Trained study sit e personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to study withdraw al, 
information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations. In addition, study person nel will collect information 
on known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV-2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms.  
14. All concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccinations will be recorded through out the study ; all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment 
of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day 1 through the final visit (Day  514).

Note : In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health Emergency ( DHHS  2020 ), 
investigators may conv ert study site visits to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
Note: All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the participant is not able to attend a study site visit due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “s tay at 
home” or “shelter in place”), a safety telephone call to the participant should be made in place of the study site visit. The safety telephone call should

Confidential  Page 186 encompass all scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medicati ons (eg, as defined in 
scheduled safety telephone calls). Home visits will b e permitted for all nondosing visits, except for Screening, if a participant cannot visit the study due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Home visits must be permitted by the study site IRB and the participant via informed consent/assent and have pri or approval fr om the 
Sponsor (or its designee).  
1. Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Day 0 Visit may be performed over multiple visits if they occur  within the 7 -day 
Screening window. If eligible, participants will receive 50 µg mRNA -1273 28 days apart.  
2. If the visit for the second dose (Day 29) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 29 +7 due to  the COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of 
study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government  mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in place”), the visit window may be 
extended to Day 29 + 21 days. When the extended visit window is used, the remaining study visits should be rescheduled to fol low the inter -visit interval 
from the actual date of t he second dose.  
3. Safety follow -up via an eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 99 to Day 183 and again from Day 223 to Day 307.  
4. Safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 113 to Day 197 and again from Day 237 to Day 321.  
5. Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be conducted during Screening. However,  this review may be conducted on Day 1 if Screening and Baseline 
procedures are conducted on the same day.  
6. Physical examinat ion: A full physical examination, including height, weight, and vital signs will be performed at Screening, Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, Day 
209, and Day  394. BMI will be calculated only at Screening Visit (Day 0). Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other timepoints at 
the discretion of the investigator. On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection, the arm re ceiving the injection should be examined 
and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should  be reported as a MAAE. Vital 
signs are to be measured pre dose and postdose on days of inj ection (Day 1  and Day 29). When applicable, vital signs should be measured before blood 
collection. Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) before injection on Day 1  and Day 29 must have the visit rescheduled within the 
relevant vis it window to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be enrolled at the discretion of the inves tigator.  
7. Pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 and before the second study injection will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a 
pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine test can be performed at any time.  
8. Serum sample from two ~4 mL blood draws. Biomarker plasma and biomarker serum samples will be stored for potential future bio mark er assessment.  
9. Sample must be collected prior to dosing of injection on Day 1  and Day 29.  
10. The nasal swab sample will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.  
11. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illne ss visit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the 
prespecified criteria of suspicion for COVID -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study 
site for an unscheduled illness visit, to include a nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a  
home visit may be arranged to collect the NP or nasal sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possibl e, the participant will be asked to 
submit a saliva sample to the study site by a Sponsor -approved method. At this illness visit, the NP or nasal swab samples will be collected to evaluate for 
the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. NP or nasal swab samples will also be tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. In addition, the s tudy 
site may collect an additional NP or n asal sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as 
determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severit y of the clinical cas e. 
12. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the study site with in struction provided by study staff. 
Study participants will continue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leav e the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of injection and 
for 6 days following injection. If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant  will be prompted to capture 
details of the solicited loca l or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR resolves or the next IP injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture of deta ils of 
ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after each vaccination.  
13. ARs recorded in eDiaries beyond Day 7  after vaccinat ion should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the following study visit.

information on concomita nt medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy  vaccinations. In addition, study personnel will collect information 
on known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms.  
15. All concomitant medications and nonstudy  vaccinations will be recorded through out the study ; all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment 
of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day 1 through the final visit (Day  394).

7. Sample must be collected prior to dosing of injection on Day  1. 
8. The nasal swab sample will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV-2 via RT -PCR.  
9. An unschedule d visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the 
prespecified criteria of suspicion for COVID -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study 
site for an unscheduled illness visit, to include a nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical  evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a 
home visit may be arranged to collect the NP or nasal sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possibl e, the participant will be asked to 
submit a saliva sample to the study site  by a Sponsor -approved method. At this illness visit, the NP or nasal swab samples will be collected to evaluate for 
the presence of SARS -CoV-2 infection. NP or nasal swab samples will also be tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. In addi tion, the study 
site may collect an additional NP or nasal sample for SARS -CoV-2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as 
determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
10. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the study site with in struction provided by study staff. 
Study participants will continue to  record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of injection and  
for 6 days following injection. If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant  will be prompted to capture 
details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR resolves or the next IP injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture of details of 
ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after vaccination.  
11. ARs recorded in eDiaries beyond Day 7 after vaccination should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the following study vi sit. 
12. Trained study site personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AEs lead ing to study withdrawal, 
information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations. In addition, study person nel will collect information 
on known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV-2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms.  
13. All concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccinations  will be recorded through out the study ; and all concomitant medications relevant to or for the 
treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be record ed from Day 1 through the final visit (Day  181).

• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration  of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines.  
• Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines.  
• Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, IB, and other relevant documents (eg, 
advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB by the investigator and reviewed and 
approved by the IRB before the study is initiated.  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study d esign, except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by the IRB  
− Notifying the IRB of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by IRB 
procedures  
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of  21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB, European regulation 536/2014 
for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations.  
10.2.2.  Study Monitoring   
Before an invest igational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of the 
Sponsor or its representatives will visit the investigational study site to do the following:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other  personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a clinical study agreement between the Sponsor, the 
designated CRO, and the investigator.  
Accord ing to ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the 
proper conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on 
the eCRFs. The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and the Spo nsor in the 
maintenance of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The 
study monitor will advise the investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB  review, and inspection by providing di rect access to the source 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 195 data/documents. In addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the investigator 
all regulations applicable to the clinical evaluation of an IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibi lity to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation 
throughout the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; 
to verify completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study 
conduct  to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. During 
the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and suppo rt to the investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed.  
• Perfor m source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the SAE Hotline, and  those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
10.2.3.  Audits and Inspections   
The Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct 
study site visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any 
aspect of the study. The inve stigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or 
regulatory authorities to inspect the IP storage area, IP stocks, IP records, participant charts and 
study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and any IRB may visit the 
study site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a 
Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine a ll study -related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH E6(R2) GCP, and any 
applicable regulatory requirements. The investigato r should contact the Sponsor immediately if 
contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection.  
The principal investigator must obtain IRB approval for the investigation. Initial IRB approval, 
and all materials approved by the IRB for this study includin g the participant consent/assent form 
and recruitment materials, must be maintained by the investigator and made available for 
inspection.

submit the complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements required under 21 CFR 54. 
In addition, the investigator  must provide the Spon sor with a commitment to promptly upda te 
this information if any  relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for 
1 year following the co mpletion of the study. 
The Sponsor, the CRO,  and the study site are not financially responsible for further testing or 
treatment of  any medical condition that may be detected during the screening process. In addition, 
in the absence of specific arrangements, the Sponsor, the CRO , and the study site are not 
financially responsible for fu rther treatment of the disease u nder study. 
10.2.5.  Recruitment Procedures   
Advertisements to be used for the recruitment of study participant s, and any other written 
information regarding this study to be provided to the participant  should be submitted to the 
Sponsor for approval. All documents must be approved by the IRB. 
10.2.6.  Informed Consent/Assent Process   
The informed consent/assent document(s) must meet the requirements of 21  CFR  50, local 
regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, where 
applicable, and the IRB or study site. All consent documents will be approved by the appropriate 
IRB. The actual ICF used  at each study site may differ, depending on local regulations and IRB 
requirements. However, all versions of the ICF must contain the standard information found in 
the sample ICF provided by the Sponsor. Any change to the content of the ICF must be approv ed 
by the Sponsor and the IRB prior to the ICF being used.  
If new information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant’s willingness to 
continue participation in the study, this will be communicated to them in a timely manner. Such 
informa tion will be provided via a revised ICF or an addendum to the original ICF.  
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant  
and answer all questions regarding the study.  
The investigator is responsible for  ensuring that the participant  fully understands the nature and 
purpose of the study. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever 
possible.  
No participant should be obliged to participate in the study. The participant  must be informed 
that participation is voluntary. Participants, their relatives, guardians, or (if applicable) LARs 
must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study. The information must 
make clear that refusal to participate in the study or w ithdrawal from the study at any stage is 
without any prejudice to the participant’s subsequent care.  
The participant must be allowed sufficient time to decide whether they wish to participate in the 
study.  
The participant must be made aware of, and give co nsent to, direct access to his/her source 
medical records by study monitors, auditors, the IRB, and regulatory authorities. The participant 
should be informed that such access will not violate participant confidentiality or any applicable

Confidential  Page 197 regulations. The participant and/or participants’  parent(s)/LAR(s)  should also be informed that 
he/she is authorizing such access by signing the ICF.  
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant and/or participants’  parent(s)/LAR(s) . 
A participant who is rescre ened is not required to sign another ICF if the rescreening occurs 
within 28  days from the previous ICF signature date (within the initial Screening Period).  
The ICF will also explain that excess serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize the 
immune response to SARS -CoV -2, additional assay development, and the immune response 
across CoVs.  
10.2.7.  Protocol Amendments   
No change or amendment to this protocol may be made by the investigator or the Sponsor after 
the protocol has been agreed to and signed by all parties unless such change(s) or amendment(s) 
has (have) been agreed upon by the i nvestigator or the Sponsor. Any change agreed upon will be 
recorded in writing, and the written amendment will be signed by the investigator and the 
Sponsor. IRB approval is required prior to the implementation of an amendment, unless 
overriding safety rea sons warrant immediate action, in which case the IRB(s) will be promptly 
notified.  
Any modifications to the protocol or the ICF, which may impact the conduct of the study, 
potential benefit of the study, or may affect participant safety, including changes of study 
objectives, study design, participant population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant 
administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such an amendment will 
be released by the Sponsor, agreed by the investigator( s), and approved by the relevant IRB(s) 
prior to implementation. A signed and dated statement that the protocol, any subsequent relevant 
amended documents, and the ICF have been approved by relevant IRB(s) must  be provided to 
the Sponsor before the study i s initiated.  
Administrative changes of the protocol are minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no 
effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes will be released by 
the Sponsor, agreed by the investigators, and noti fied to the IRB(s).  
10.2.8.  Protocol Deviations   
The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site 
staff. As a result of protocol deviati ons, corrective actions are to be developed by the study site 
and implemented promptly.  
After a participant proceeds to the Participant Decision Visit (Part 1A) of the study, participants 
who received mRNA -1273 will continue to follow the open -label Part 1 A SoA ( Table  10). 
Participants who received placebo will transition to open -label Part 1B of the study and will 
follow the Part 1B SoA ( Table  12). Participants who transitioned to Part 1C -1, at least 5 months 
after last dose, will follow the Part 1C -1 SoA ( Table  13). Eligible participants that completed 
their primary COVID -19 vaccination series under EUA and choose to receive a BD will follow 
Part 1C -2 SoA ( Table  14). Participants enrolled in Part 2 will follow Part 2 SoA (Table  15 and 
Table  16). Participants enrolled in Part 3 will follow Part 3 SoA ( Table  17 and Table  18). 
ModernaTX, Inc.

report protocol deviations to the Sponsor or its designee. All protocol deviations must be 
addressed in study source documents, reported to study monitor.  Protocol deviations must be 
sent to the reviewing IRB per their policies. The study site investigator is responsible for 
knowing and adhering to the r eviewing IRB requirements.  
10.2.9.  Data Protection   
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the Spons or will contain the identifier only; participant names or 
any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.  
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accord ance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the participant.  
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by clinical QA 
auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Spo nsor, by appropriate IRB members, 
and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential, and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Information will be ac cessible to 
authorized parties or personnel only. Medical information may be given to the participant’s 
physician or to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant’s well -being. 
Each participant will be asked to complete a form allo wing the investigator to notify the 
participant’s primary health care provider of his/her participation in this study.  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner desi gned to maintain participant confidentiality. All records will be kept in a secure 
storage area with limited access. Clinical information will not be released without the written 
permission  of the participant, exce pt as necessary for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, 
its designee, relevant regulatory au thority, or the IRB. 
The investigator  and all employees and coworkers involved with this study may not disclose or 
use for any  purpose other than performance of the study, any data, record, or other unpublished,  
confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpose of the study. Prior written 
agreement from the  Spons or or its designee must be obtained for the disclosure of any 
confidential information to other parties. 
10.2.10.  Sample Retention and Future Biomedical Research   
The retention period of laboratory samples will be 20 years, or as permitted by local regulations, 
to address further scientific questions related to mRNA -1273 or antirespiratory virus immune 
response. In addition, identifiable samples can be destroyed at any time at the request of the 
participant. During the study, or during the retention period, in addition to the analysis outlined 
in the study endpoints, explorat ory analysis may be conducted using other Ab -based 
methodologies on any remaining blood or serum samples, including samples from participants 
who are screened but are not subsequently enrolled. These analyses will extend the search for 
other potentially re levant biomarkers to investigate the effect of mRNA -1273, as well as to 
determine how changes in biomarkers may relate to exposure and clinical outcomes. A decision 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 199 to perform such exploratory research may arise from new scientific findings related to the drug 
class or disease, as well as reagent and assay availability.  
10.2.11.  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data

• Records and doc uments, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this 
study must be retained by the investigator for a period of at least 2 years after the 
last marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years following the 
discontinuance of the test  article for investigation. If this requirement differs from 
any local regulations, the local regulations will take precedence unless the local 
retention policy is less than 2 years. No records may be destroyed during the 
retention period without the writt en approval of the Sponsor. No records may be 
transferred to another location or party without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Quality assurance includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure 
that the clinical study is performed and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and 
reported according to ICH GCP and local/regional regulatory standards.  
A QA representative from the Sponsor or a qualified designee , who is independent of and 
separated from routine monitorin g, may periodically arrange inspections/audits of the clinical 
study by reviewing the data obtained and procedural aspects. These inspections may include 
on-site inspections/audits and source data checks. Direct access to source documents is required 
for the purpose of these periodic inspections/audits.  
10.2.13.  Data Collection and Management   
This study will be conducted in compliance with ICH CGP guidelines. This study will also be 
conduc ted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
This study will use electronic data collection to collect data directly from the study site using 
eCRFs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each e CRF are completed 
promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against any source data.  
Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between 
the eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved i n accordance with the 
principles of GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the Clinical Monitoring 
Plan.  
Adverse events will be coded with MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using 
WHO  - Drug Dictionary.

Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
Females of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, 
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle ca nnot be confirmed before first 
dose of study treatment, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal,  surgically sterile female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented comple te hysterectomy  
• Documented surgical sterilization  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, 
(eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied in 
determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the study site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
Contraception Guidance:  
A highly  effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate 
(eg, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, 
combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomized 
partner. For participants using a hormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the 
product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed.  
Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contraceptive m ethod in accordance with the product label. For example:  
• Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction 
with spermicide  
• Intrauterine device  
• Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pill), transde rmal 
(patch), subdermal, or IM route  
• Sterilization of a female participant’s monogamous male partner prior to entry into 
the study  
Note that periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptab le methods of contraception.

Amendment 6, 22 Jun  2023  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main purpose of this amendment is to update the primary immunogenicity objective of 
Part 3, per regulatory feedback, to evaluate the effectiveness of a single 50  μg dose of 
mRNA -1273.222 in COVID -19 vaccine -naïve, baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive individuals 12 to 
17 years of age, by compar ing the immune response in these individuals at 1 -month post single 
dose (50  μg mRNA -1273.222) to the 1 -month post Dose 2 (100  μg mRNA -1273) immune 
response from baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative participants in Study P301 adults for whom 
clinical vaccine effic acy was demonstrated.

Power and Sample Size 
(Part 3)  The target number of enrolled participants 
was also revised (from N of 500 to N of at 
least 300) according to the new sample size 
and power calculation (based on new 
information): With at least 300 ad olescents 
enrolled, the study will have at least a 95% 
probability to observe at least 1 participant 
with an AE at a true AE rate of 1%. A 
sample size of approximately 168 
participants is required to sufficiently power 
the hypothesis testing of new 
coprima ry immunogenicity  endpoints, 
resulting in approximately 240 enrolled 
participants required for immunogenicity 
primary analysis after considering the 
potential 30% exclusion rate for the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset -baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 positive (PPIS -POS), as 
participants may be baseline SARS -CoV -2

mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 216 Amendment 3, 04 Nov 2021  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
To provide a 50 μg BD of mRNA -1273 to participants. This change is prompted by new interim 
data from an ongoing Moderna Phase 2 s tudy, mRNA -1273 -P201 (Study P201). Adult 
participants in Study mRNA -1273 -P201 received 2 doses of either 50 μg or 100 μg of 
mRNA -1273 and were administered a 50 μg booster of mRNA -1273 6 to 8 months after the 
second dose. Participants in mRNA -1273 -P201 who  received the BD, demonstrated enhanced 
immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 compared to preboost levels and met the noninferiority 
criteria stipulated in the US A FDA  Guidance on EUA  for Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19. 
Additionally, no new safety signals emerged u pon administration of the BD in Study P201. 
Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit -risk profile of a BD of mRNA -1273 is favorable, 
particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease with the emergence of the Delta variant. 
Providing the option for  a BD to all eligible participants currently enrolled is expected to 
generate valuable booster data in the adolescent population.

Confidential  Page 220 Amendment 1, 23 Mar 2021  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary rationales for this amendment are as follows:  
• To update the primary endpoints and null hypotheses (or success criteria) for establishing 
immunobridging and assumptions for the sample size calculations, as recommended by 
health authorities.  
•  Following the authorization of a COVID -19 vaccine under an EUA, this study 
amendment is designed to transition to Part B, the Open -Label Observational Phase. 
Transitioning the study to Part B, the Open -label Observational Phase permits all ongoing 
study part icipants (a) to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any 
COVID -19 vaccine made available under an EUA and (b) for EUA -eligible study 
participants, the opportunity to schedule a study visit to know their original group 
assignment (pla cebo versus mRNA -1273).  
• Part B, the Open -label Observational Phase also provides the opportunity for study 
participants who previously received placebo to request to receive 2 doses of the 
mRNA -1273 vaccine.  
The Summary of Changes table provided here descr ibes the major changes made in Protocol 
Amendment 1 relative to the original protocol, including the sections modified and the

Protocol Synopsis – Objectives and 
Section 2 (Objectives and 
Endpoints)  The primary endpoints were 
redefined. Secondary and 
exploratory endpoints were 
refined. An additional secondary 
objective and corresponding 
endpoint were added. A new 
exploratory objective and endpoint 
were added.  If an accepted threshold of 
protection is  not available, using 
coprimary endpoints based on nAb 
geometric mean and SRR  (added) in 
the noninferiority test was 
recommended by health authorities, 
as it is considered standard in 
immunobridging. A secondary 
objective/endpoint to evaluate 
asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 
infection was added to be separate 
from the objective/endpoint of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection in 
participants with SARS -CoV -2 
negative at baseline. An exploratory 
objective/endpoint was added to 
evaluate asymptomatic SARS -CoV -
2 infection in participant s 
seropositive at baseline.

1 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
This Post Approval S tudy is a multi- center, prospective,  open label,  single arm cohort study 
to evaluate the lon g-term safety, lon g-term effectiveness, and survival rate in subjects 
implanted with the remedē System from the remedē System Pivotal Trial. Up to 94 subj ects 
will be enrolled at up to 21 sites in the United States (US) and five ( 5) sites in the European 
Union (EU). 
Only s ubjects who were implanted and actively being followed as part of the rem edē System 
Pivotal Trial are eligible for this trial.  An individual subject ’s participation is expected to continue to five years post rem edē 
System implant. Subjects will start follow -up at the appropriate follow-up visit based on their 
initial remedē Syst em implant date. Subjects will be seen  for an in -office visit at  36, 48 , and 
60 months post implant for a remedē System assessment,  an assessment of medical stability, 
sleep study  (polygram [PG] at 36- and 48-month visits and polysomnogram [PSG] at the 60-
month visit) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) completion, and adverse event monitoring. 
Subjects will be contacted by phone at 30, 42, and 54 months post implant for survival and 
adverse event monitoring. 
Data analys es will include an evaluation of long- term safety, long -term eff ectiveness, and 
survival rate.  
2 STUDY PURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION  
This extended follow-up study is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) condition of approval of the remedē System in adult patients with moderate to severe central sleep apnea  
(CSA). The primary purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single arm cohort study is to 
evaluate the long -term safety, long -term effectiveness, and survival rate in subjects implan ted 
with the remedē System in the remedē System Pivotal Trial. 
3 STUDY MILESTONES AND  TIMELINE  
Following FDA approval of the protocol, rem edē System Pivotal Trial sites with active 
subjects will be invited  to participate in this study. Activation of sites sh ould be complete 
within six months following FDA approval of the protocol. Enrollment of subjects, defined 
as signing the informed consent, should be complete within six months following site 
activation.  
Follow-up is planned for five years from the date of implant. Since all subjects have already completed 24 months of follow-up, total study duration is estimated to be three years.

4 BACKGROUND  
4.1 Regulatory History  
The remedē System Pivotal Trial demonstrated that rem edē System therapy effectively 
treats CSA and delivers statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in 
sleep, respiratory, and patient-centered metrics. The primary effectiveness endpoint of the 
remedē System Pivotal Trial was met: a significantly higher proportion of subjects in the 
treatment group (35 of 68, 51%) had a 50% or higher reduction in Apnea-H ypopnea Index 
(AHI) from baseline to 6 months of follow-up than in the control group (8 of 73, 11%). The 
difference between groups was 41% ( p ≤.0001). This significant difference demonstrated the 
superiority of remedē System therapy compared to no therapy. In the per protocol 
population, 60% of the Treatment subjects achieved a ≥50% reduction in AHI versus 11% in the Control group. The benefits experienced by the Treatment group continued throughout 
the course of the study, demonstrating durability of effect, and were confirmed by the results of the Control group after 6 months of active therapy. In addition to the benefits conferred by 
meeting the primary effectiveness endpoint, all of the hierarchically tested secondary 
endpoints (Central Apnea Index [ CAI], AHI, O xygen Desaturation Index 4% [ODI4 ], percent  
sleep  time in Rapid Eye Movement [REM ], Patient Global Assessment [PGA ], Arousal 
Index [ArI], and ESS) were met. The therapy was well tolerated, and 91% of subjects were 
free from serious adverse events ( SAEs ) related to the implant procedure, rem edē System, or 
delivered therapy through 12 months indicating both procedural and chronic safety of the 
remedē System.  
The remedē System received CE Mark approval on August 13, 2010. 
The remedē System was approved for marketing in the US by the FDA on Octo ber 6, 2017. 
As a condition of approval, the Post Approval Study will continue to gather clinical evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness for the remedē System in adult subjects with moderate 
to severe CSA .  
5 DEVICE NAME, INTENDED USE , AND SYSTEM DE SCRIPTION  
5.1 Device Name 
The rem edē
® System  
5.2 Indications for Use  
The remedē System is an implantable phrenic nerve stimulator indicated for the treatment of 
moderate to severe CSA in adult patients.  
5.3 System Overview  
The system consists of an implantable pulse generator (IPG), one transvenous lead to stimulate the phrenic nerve, and one transvenous sensing lead to sense respiration via

transthoracic impedance. External, non -implanted devices and accessories of the remedē 
System include the remedē System programm er, external IPG, and programming wand. A 
detailed description of the rem edē System  can be found in the rem edē System Implant and 
Clinician Use Manual  found in Appendix F . 
6 STUDY DESIGN AND S COPE  
This is a multi- center, prospective, open label, single cohor t study to evaluate the long -term 
safety, long -term effectiveness, and survival rate in subjects implanted with the remedē 
System in  the rem edē System Pivotal Trial. Up to 94 subj ects will be enrolled at up to 21 US 
sites and 5 EU sites. 
Only s ubjects who were implanted and actively being followed as part of the rem edē System 
Pivotal Trial are eligible for this trial.  
An individual subject’s participation is expected to continue through five years post remedē 
System implant. Subjects will be seen for an in -office visit at  36, 48, and 60 months post 
implant for a remedē System assessment, an assessment of medical stability, sleep study 
(polygram [PG] at 36- and 48-month visits and polysomnogram [PSG] at the 60- month visit) , 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) co mpletion, and adverse event monitoring. Subjects will be 
contacted by phone at 30, 42, and 54 months post implant for survival and adverse event 
monitoring. See Table 1  Follow-up Schedule. 
7 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1. Evaluate the survival rate  
This endpoint is an assessment of survival in subjects with moderate to severe 
CSA  being treated with the remedē System . Survival will be compared to 
historical controls or newly published results at three and five years post implant . 
No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested.   
2. Evaluate long -term three and five- year device -related Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs)  
This endpoint is an assessment of long- term safety via summary of anticipated or 
unanticipated device- related SAEs . Events must meet the definition of serious as 
defined in S ection 10.8. Device- related SAEs  include device explants due to 
device- related infection and events such as : device malfunction, lead fracture, 
lead component failure, lead dislodgment, lead displacement, pocket perforation, or extra -respiratory sensation requiring lead revision. rem edē System IPG 
replacement for battery depletion will not be considered a device- related SAE  
unless it is earlier than anticipated . The number of events and subjects with an 
 
Clinical Investigational Plan – Post Approval Study   Respicardia, Inc.  Confidential  
CR1079, Rev C  Page 7 of 44  
event will be summa rized through each time point. No formal statistical 
hypothesis will be tested.  
3. Evaluate long -term three and five- year therapy -related SAEs  
This endpoint assesses the safety of the remedē System by evaluating anticipated 
or unanticipated therapy -related SAEs . Therapy -related SAEs must meet the 
definition of a SAE as defined in Section 10.8 and include events such as 
diaphragmatic stimulation discomfort, extra- respiratory stimulation , or 
concomitant device interaction. The number of events and subjects with an event will be summarized through each time point. No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested.  
4. Evaluate the AHI, CAI , and obstructive apnea index ( OAI) at three years using in -
home polygram (PG) and at five years using  in -lab polysomnogram (PSG)  
This effectiveness endpoint will be assessed by summarizing the A HI, CAI , and 
OAI at three and five years, as well as change from baseline at five years . No 
formal statistical hypothesis will be tested.  
5. Evaluate the change in quality of life from baseline to three and five years using 
the ESS  
The ESS is a validated ins trument that assesses a subject’s daytime sleepiness. 
The objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the ESS score from baseline at three and five years . No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested.

• Subject death  
10.6.1  Subject Lost to Follow Up  
In the event the ICF is signed and the subject is lo st to follow -up, the study site  must make a 
minimum of two attempts (one certified letter and one documented phone call or two 
certified letters) to contact the subject.  Each attempt to contact a lost to follow -up subject and 
the method used will be documented in the subject’s medical record. 
10.6.2  Subject -Initiated Withdrawal  
A subject may withdraw from the study at any time  by notifying their physician. If a subject 
withdraws participation in the study at any time, there will be no penalty o r loss of future 
medical care.  
10.6.3  Physician- Initiated  Withdrawal  
The PI may withdraw the subject from the study without the subject’s consent at any time if 
medically justified  or for other documented reasons .  
10.6.4  Subject Death  
Subject death s must be reported to Respicardia or desi gnee  within 24 hours of investigator 
knowledge, and the site must also complete an Adverse Event CRF. 
If a subject death occurs while the subject is in the hospital, submit a copy of the hospital 
discharge note(s) and/or progress note(s) related to the death and/or death summary to 
Respicardia, Inc. If an autopsy is performed, submit a copy of the autopsy report and once the death certificate becomes available, send a copy to the Sponsor within 10 days. If a 
subject death occurs at a site remote from the in vestigational site, it is the investigative site ’s 
responsibility to make an attempt to retrieve all pertinent information related to the subject’s death and submit the PI ’s summary of the known events surrounding the death. In all cases  
Clinical Investigational Plan – Post Approval Study  Respicardia, Inc.  Confidential  
CR1079, Rev C  Page 15  of 44  
following subject death , the investigator should request that the rem edē System be explanted 
and returned to Respicardia, Inc.  
10.7 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is defined as an instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or 
unintentionally, the requirements of the CIP, including the Investigator Agreement, IRB/ IEC, 
or local regulatory requirements. 
The PI must maintain accurate, complete and current records, including documents showing 
the dates of and reasons for each deviation from the protocol. Protocol deviations must be 
reported to Respicardia, Inc.  regardless of whether or not medically justifiable . In the event 
the deviation involved a failure to obtain a subject’s consent, or is made to protect the life or 
physical well -being of a subject in an emergency, the deviation must be reported to 
Respicardia, Inc.  and the IRB/IEC within 5 working days of the deviation occurring. All 
other deviation reporting  to IRB/ IEC must comply with local IRB/ IEC and local regulatory 
requirements.  
Respicardia, Inc.  will be respo nsible for analyzing, assessing and trending deviations to 
determine if corrective or preventive action is required. All deviations will be reported in the 
progress and f inal study reports. 
10.8 Adverse Events 
All adverse events (AE s) that occur between the subject signing the ICF and study exit will 
be documented in a timely manner and reported to the Sponsor. The investigator at the site 
should follow AEs until they ha ve resolved, the condition has stabilized, or the subject exits 
the trial and report such follow-up information to the sponsor. AEs will be recorded in detail 
on the AE  CRF . 
In addition, serious AEs , implant- related AEs, therapy -related  AEs , and  device- related AEs 
occurring after exit from the pivotal trial and prior to signing ICF in this trial will be 
collected.  
An independent Clinical Events Committee  (CEC) will adjudicate, at minimum,  all serious 
adverse events, including deaths, and therapy -, device- or implant- related adverse events.   
CEC membership will include at least  one physician  from ea ch of the following specialties: 
sleep , cardiology (preferably heart failure) , and electrophysiology ( familiar ity with device 
implant procedures).

CR1079, Rev C   Page 18  of 44  
In addition, the following will be considered an SAE for purposes of  this trial: 
• A device or therapy related AE that r equired a system modification  (excluding IPG  
replacement  for battery depletion within anticipated  timeframe or elective explant )  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) : any serious adverse effect on the health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device 
(remedē System), if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the product labeling , or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, s afety, or welfare of subjects.  
Investigators must report any suspected UADE to the sponsor as soon as possible but no later than ten (10) working days of knowledge of the event. Respicardia, or designee, will report 
results of any UADE evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRBs/I ECs and participating 
investigators within ten (10) working days after Respicardia first receives notice o f the effect.  
10.8.1  Safety Endpoint Definitions  
Serious device- related:   For the purpose of assessing the device-related safety endpoint, a 
serious device -related  adverse event is an event that meets the definition of serious and 
includes device explant due to  device- related infection and events  such as:  device 
malfunction, lead fracture, lead component failure, lead dislodgment, lead displacement, 
pocket perforation, or extra-respiratory sensation requiring lead revision.  
Serious therapy -related:   For the purpose of assessing the therapy-related safety endpoint, 
the event must meet the definition of serious and include events such as diaphragmatic 
stimulation discomfort, extra -respiratory stimulation, or concomitant device interaction.  
10.8.2  Serious Adverse Event R eporting  
Any SAE must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of investigational site knowledge. 
If the SAE requires expedited reporting to regulatory bodies (for example, a UADE resulting 
in death), the Sponsor wil l complete reporting requirements  to FDA and other applicable 
regulatory bodies, as well as all reviewing IRBs and participating investigators within 10 working days after the Sponsor first receives notice of the event . The Sponsor will submit 
additional reports as requested from the FDA concerning the reported event.   
10.9 Concomitant Cardiac Devices 
Any addition of or change to a concomitant cardiac device during this trial or occurring after 
exit from the pivotal trial and prior to signing ICF for the post approval study will be 
collected.

CR1079, Rev C   Page 19  of 44  
10.10  Technical Observations  
A technical observation is defined as a deficiency related to the identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a device after it has been released for 
distribution. 
All technical observations that occur between the subject signing the ICF and study exit will 
be documented in a timely manner and reported to the Sponsor. Technical observations will be recorded on the technical observation CRF.  
11 STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 General Statistical Considerations  
Data from this study will be combined with data from the remedē System Pivotal Trial.  All 
subjects will be pooled for analysis regardless of original randomization assignment. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data. Continuous variables will be 
summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges, minimums and 
maximums. Categorical variables will be summarized by calculating the percent of subjects 
in each category.  No imputation for missing data will be performed.  
Statistica l analyses will be performed using validated software (e.g., SAS). 
Copies of databases used to prepare clinical report summaries will be archived to enable any statistical analyses performed to be replicated.  
11.2 Analysis Population 
Intention- to-Treat (ITT):   Subjects who were previously consented  and randomized in the 
remedē System Pivotal Trial. All effectiveness and safety evaluations will be based on the 
ITT population. Effectiveness analyses will only include subjects with data at the visit of 
interest.  
11.3 Data Analyses 
All subjects  randomized in the rem edē System Pivotal Trial  will be included in the safety 
assessments, unless otherwise noted. All adverse events will be summarized by seriousness, relatedness, and temporal relationship to the procedure and wi ll be analyzed in a descriptive 
fashion. The number of events and number of subjects experienc ing events will be 
summarized.  
The survival distribution will be estimated with a Kaplan -Meier curve and the 95% 
confidence interval for the three and five year ( or other time point of interest) survival rate s 
will be calculated using the standard error determined by the Peto method.
1 The survival rate 
will be compared to historical controls and/or newly published results.  
 
Clinical Investigational Plan – Post Approval Study  Respicardia, Inc.  Confidential  
CR1079, Rev C   Page 20  of 44  
Subjects with follow -up data at the visit of interest will be included in the effectiveness 
assessments. Change from baseline analyses will include subjects with baseline and follow-
up visit data.  
Additional exploratory and/or subgroup analyses may also be performed to characterize 
study outcomes. 11.4 Sample Size Justification  
No sample size calculations were performed.  
12 DATA MANAGEMENT  
Clinical data will be captured on  CRFs  and reported to Respicardia, Inc. CRF  elements can 
be found in Appendix C. Device and sleep study  data will be collected at appl icable 
protocol-required visits in addition to source documentation collected for AE review and 
adjudication. All data should be entered into the CRFs , reviewed,  and approved by the 
Investigator in a timely manner after the study visit or adverse event occurs. 
In order to protect subject confidentiality, subjects will be identified by a subject ID number. 
The subject ID will be the same ID number that was assigned in the remedē System Pivotal 
Trial.   
All clinical data not collected via CRF  (i.e., interrogation including pre and post device 
settings parameter printouts ) should be uploaded to the Sponsor via a secure web portal. 
Sleep study data from the 36, 48, and 60 month post implant follow -up visits will be 
submitted directly to the core lab for analysis . Core Lab personnel will review the sleep 
studies per the 2007 American Academy of Sleep Association Manual (AASM) and provide 
the data to Respicardia, Inc.  A sleep study  report will be provided to the respective 
investigational site . The intent of providing the report is to document study procedure 
compliance and CRF completion; it is  not to assist in patient care . The study site should have 
the sleep study read locally if needed for timely patient care .  
All study documents must be retained by the investigational site for a period of two years 
after study conclusion and made available for monitoring or auditing by the sponsor’s 
representative or representatives of the FDA and other a pplicable regulatory agencies. The 
investigator must ensure the availability of source documents from which the information on 
the CRFs was derived.  
13 MONITORING 
Each investigational site will be monitored to ensure compliance with the signed investigator 
agreement, CIP, IRB/ IEC reporting requirements , and the applicable regulatory 
requirements . Monitoring will be conducted by the Sponsor or designee. The monitor will

to the  research records. Insurance companies may not pay for treatment that is part of 
a research study.  
 
PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND  
The purpose of this study is to assess the continued safety and effectiveness of this approved 
device.  
 
The remedē System Pivotal Trial showed that rem edē System  benefits patients with central 
sleep apnea. Based on these results, t he FDA approved the rem edē System  for sale in the 
United States (US).  As part of the approval, the FDA is requiring the sponsor to conduct this 
post-approval study.   
There are no experimental (investigational) procedures or devices involved in this study. 
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
If you agree to take part in this study, the study doctor and study staff will collect information about you. They may ask you questions, and they may review your medical records to obtain health information. 
 
Your participation in this study may last up to 36 months. Up to 94 subjects will take part in 
this study, which is being conducted at up to 26 site s worldwide. 
 You will be asked about serious health problems , problems related to the remedē System , 
and any new or changes to your cardiac device (if you have one)  that you have experienced  
since you exited the remedē System Pivotal Trial .  
 This study requires  annual  office visits at 36, 48, and 60 months  after your remedē System 
was implanted. It is possible that you have already completed some of these visits while 
enrolled in the remedē System Pivotal Trial. If you consent to be in this study, your first visit 
will be calculated based on the date of your original implant of the remedē System. For 
example, if you were implanted in January of 2014 and sign consent in January of 2018, your 
first visit would be considered your 48 month visit  or 54 month visit depending on the visits 
you completed in the remedē System Pivotal Trial. Your final visit will be at 60 months post 
remedē System implant.  
 During the 36 and 48 month office visits, you will have the following assessments : 
 
 
Clinical Investigational Plan – Post Approval Study  Respicardia, Inc.  Confidential  
CR1079, Rev C   Page 28  of 44  
• a remedē System device evaluation (a wand  is placed over the skin where the device 
is located and it reports its condition electronically)  
• an in home, overnight sleep study  
• a quality of life questionnaire asking how sleepy you are during the daytime  
• review of new or worsening health problems, hospitalizations, illness or injury, or 
outpatient procedures that you have experienced 
 
During the 60 month office visit , which is your last visit, you will have the following 
assessments:  
 
• a remedē System device evaluation (a wand is placed over the skin where the device 
is located and it reports its condition electronically)  
• an overnight sleep study done in a sleep laboratory  
• a quality of life questionnaire asking how sleepy you are during the daytime  
• review of new or worsening health problems, hospitalizations, illness or injury, or 
outpatient procedures that you have experienced 
 
At the time of these annual visits, if you were hospitalized within the two weeks prior to the 
visit, you will be asked to delay the sleep study until it has been at least two weeks since your 
hospitalization  or your doctor determines you are stable enough to perform the sleep study.  
 Telephone visits will be conducted in between the annual office visits at 30, 42, and 54 months. During these  calls, your health status will be determined by review of new or 
worsening health problems, hospitalizations, illness or injury, or outpatient procedures that 
you have experienced  since your last office visit.  
 
If you have other stimulation devices implanted  or modified during the study, contact your 
study doctor as special testing will be needed to ensure the devices are not interacting.  
 If you die when you are in the study, your emergency contact or next of kin may be contacted 
to inquire about the cause of your death. An attempt may be made to collect the remedē 
System if it is explanted.  
 
ROLE OF SPONSOR REPRESENTATIVE  
Respicardia, Inc. personnel may be present at office visits for  technical and programming 
support. 
RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
There are no research -related risks to you by allowing your study doctor to continue to 
collect information about you and the rem edē System.  
 
Clinical Investigational Plan – Post Approval Study  Respicardia, Inc.  Confidential  
CR1079, Rev C   Page 29  of 44  
 
NEW INFORMATION  
You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this 
study. You may be asked to sign a new consent form if this occurs.  
BENEFITS  
Your central sleep apnea may improve while you are in this study . The results of this study 
may help people with central sleep apnea in the future. 
 
COSTS  
Now that the FDA ha s approved the remedē System, follow- up care will be considered 
standard of care. Respicardia, Inc . (Sponsor) will no longer be paying for procedures related 
to the remedē System such as lead revisions, replacement of the battery, explant (removal) of

2 Introduction 
This manual is intended to provide clinicians with information regarding the implant and use 
of the rem edē® System. Included in this manual are descriptions of the r emedē System as 
well as instructions for handling, storing and surgical placement of the remedē System. This 
manual also includes an overview of the remedē System therapy and instruction for clinical 
use and follow-up care of patients using the remedē System Programmer. 
1.3 Indications for Use 
The rem edē® System is an implantable phrenic nerve stimulator indicated for the treatment 
of moderate to severe central sleep apnea (CSA) in adult patients. 
1.
4 System Overview 
The system consists of an implantable pulse generator (IPG), one transvenous lead to 
stimulate the phrenic nerve, and one transvenous sensing lead to sense respiration via 
transthoracic impedance. External, non-implanted devices and accessories of the remedē 
System include the remedē System Programmer, external IPG, and programming wand. 
1.5 Description of System Components 
All implanted components of the remedē System are intended for single use only. 
1.5.1 rem edē® IPG 
The rem edē IPG (Model 1001, Figure 1) is an implantable, multi-programmable stimulator 
de
signed for unilateral, transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation. The device monitors the 
pa
tient’s respiratory signals and provides electrical stimulation to the left or right phrenic 
nerve to restore patients to a normal breathing pattern during sleep. The remedē IPG contains 
electronic circuitry components and a battery, which are hermetically sealed in a titanium 
case. Therapy settings are determined by the physician and configured using an external 
programmer via telemetry. 
The rem edē IPG has four 3.2 mm connector ports (Figure 2) that are compatible with IS-1 
c
onnectors. The IS-1 lead connectors in each 3.2 mm connector port are secured by two set 
screws.

Figure 2 The remedē® IPG Connector Ports  
1.5.2 respi stim® Stimulation Leads 
Respicardia, Inc. has developed a respi stim L (left) family of leads and a respi stim R (right) 
fa
mily of leads for phrenic nerve stimulation to treat CSA. The respi stim family of 
sti
mulation leads is comprised of four unique transvenous leads designed for chronic 
stimulation and sensing when placed in a thoracic vein and connected with a compatible 
pulse generator. 
1.5.2.1 respi stim® L Stimulation Lead 
The respi stim L stimulation lead (Models 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004) is a bipolar, 
transvenous, over-the-wire lead. The proximal end of the lead contains one IS-1 terminal 
pin/connector and the distal end is comprised of two ring electrodes. The lumen of the lead is 
continuous, permitting the passage of a 0.014” guide wire for delivery into the desired target 
ve
in.  
1.5.2.2 respi stim® LQ Stimulation Lead 
The respi stim LQ stimulation lead (Models 5045, 5055, 5065, and 5085) is a quadripolar, 
transvenous, over-the-wire lead. The proximal end of the lead has two IS-1 terminal 
pins/connectors and the distal end is comprised of four ring electrodes. The lumen of the lead 
is conti
nuous, permitting the passage of a 0.014” guide wire for delivery into the desired 
target vein. 

 10 1.5.2.3 respi stim® LQS Stimulation Lead 
The respi stim LQS stimulation lead (Models 4045, 4055, 4065, and 4085) is a quadripolar, 
transvenous, over-the-wire lead. The proximal end of the lead has two IS-1 terminal 
pins/connectors and the distal end is comprised of four ring electrodes having an S-shape 
bias. The lumen of the lead is continuous, permitting the passage of a 0.014” guide wire for 
delivery into the desired target vein. 
1.5.2.4 respi stim® R Stimulation Lead 
The respi stim R stimulation lead (Models 3101, 3102, 3103, 3104, 3105, 3106 and 3201, 
3202, 3203, 3204, 3205, 3206)
 is a hexapolar, transvenous, stylet delivered lead. The 
proximal end of the lead has three IS-1 terminal pins/connectors and the distal end of the lead 
is comprised of six ring electrodes and a non-electrically active tip having a helical shape 
bias. The lead is designed for use with a stylet to remove the distal bias and permit delivery 
of the lead into the desired target vein. 
1.5.3 Respiratory Sensing Lead 
The rem edē System is designed to monitor respiration by sensing changes in transthoracic 
impedance. The system is capable of sensing respiration signals through either an implanted 
respi stim stimulation lead or through a commercially available IS-1 compatible bipolar lead. 
1
.5.4 rem edē® System Programmer 
The rem edē System Programmer (Model 1002A, Figure 3) is a touch screen tablet computer 
use
d to communicate with the remedē implantable pulse generator (IPG) via inductive 
tele
metry and allows for configuration of programmable settings, initiation of system testing 
and review of collected diagnostic data. Communication with the implanted device is 
achieved using the remedē programming software and an external programming wand 
(Model 1004A or 1004A-F) connected to the programmer via USB cable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3 The rem edē System Programmer 

 11 1.5.5 rem edē® Programming Wand 
The rem edē System programming wands (Models 1004A, Figure 4 and 1004A-F) connect to 
the S
ystem Programmer via USB and provide a magnetic inductive communication link to 
the implanted device. The Model 1004A programming wand requires placement of the wand 
directly over the implanted device for telemetry communication. The optional Model 1004A-
F provides an extended flexible antenna disc that must be placed directly over the implanted 
device and is intended to allow for real-time monitoring during a polysomnogram (PSG).

1.5.6 rem edē® External IPG 
The rem edē external IPG (Model 1006, Figure 5) is used for evaluation of stimulation lead 
placement during implant of the remedē System. The external IPG (eIPG) delivers the same 
sti
mulation pulse as the remedē IPG and provides one set of anode and cathode connection 
ports for use with a sterile cable.

1.6 Contraindications 
The rem edē System is contraindicated for the following: 
 P atients with an active infection 
 Patients known to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 

 12 1.7 Warnings and Precautions 
Carefully read all warnings, precautions, and instructions before use. Follow all operating, 
maintenance, and installation procedures as described in this manual. Failure to do so may 
result in patient harm.  
1.7.1 Warnings 
1.7.1.1 Modified Components 
The use of modified components with the remedē® System is not allowed and may result in 
da
maged components, unintended operation, or increased risks to the patient. 
1.7.1.2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI or NMRI) 
Do not use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI or NMRI) on patients who have been 
implanted with the remedē System. Energy produced by MRI equipment may result in 
permanent tissue damage or damage to the remedē System. Alternative imaging options 
should be considered. 
1.7.1.3 Diathermy 
Do not use shortwave diathermy, microwave diathermy or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy 
(collectively referred to as diathermy) on patients implanted with the remedē System. Energy 
produced by diathermy equipment may be transferred through the implanted system and can 
cause permanent tissue damage at the location of the implanted electrodes, resulting in severe 
injury or death. 
Diathermy can also damage the remedē System, resulting in loss of therapy and requiring 
a
dditional surgery for system explantation and replacement. Advise the patient to inform 
their health care professionals that diathermy exposure should be avoided. 
1.7.1.4 Electric Shock 
When operating under AC power, the rem e dē System Programmer must be connected to a 
grounded power source to avoid risk of electric shock. 
1.7.1.5 Concomitant Active Implantable Devices 
Use rem edē System with caution in patients with an active implantable device that may be 
susceptible to unintended interaction with the remedē system. Consult Respicardia to assess 
the possibility of interaction.  
1.7.1.6 Patients with Evidence of Phrenic Nerve Palsy 
Therapy with the  remedē System may be ineffective in patients who have evidence of 
phrenic ne
rve palsy. 
 13 1.7.1.7 Pediatric Use 
The safety and effectiveness of the remedē® System has not been established for pediatric 
use
. 
1.7.1.8 Electromagnetic Compatibility and Medical Procedure Precautions 
The remedē System is designed to ensure immunity from most common sources of 
electromagnetic interference (EMI). In most cases, turning off the EMI source, or moving 
away from the EMI source will return the IPG to normal operation. Extremely strong sources 
of EMI could interfere with normal IPG operation, causing the IPG to reset and requiring the 
progr
ammed settings to be reconfigured. For information on MRI and diathermy, see 
‘Warnings’ in sections 1.7.1.2 and 1.7.1.3. 
1
.7.1.8.1 Electrocautery 
Electrocautery may induce failure of the IPG and leads if direct contact is made. Alternatives 
to electrocautery should be used when available. If electrocautery is necessary, the remedē 
System should be programmed off and bipolar cautery should be used. Confirm proper 
function of the rem e dē System after any procedure where electrocautery is used. 
1.7.1.8.2 Radiofrequency or Cryoballoon Ablation 
If radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation must be used in the vicinity of the IPG or leads, the 
remedē System should be programmed off. Avoid direct contact between the radiofrequency 
ablation or cryoballoon catheter and the implanted remedē System. 
1.7.1.8.3 Therapeutic Radiation  
The IPG should not be directly irradiated by therapeutic levels of ionizing radiation (such as 
that produced by cobalt machines or linear accelerators used for treatment of certain cancers) 
because of the risk for damage to the remedē System. If such therapy is required, program 
the remedē System off, shield the device, and confirm proper function of the remedē System 
after treatmen t. 
1.7.1.8.4 Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging 
If a CT scan is required, ensure that the remedē System is off and confirm proper function of 
the remedē System after the scan is complete. 
1.7.1.8.5 Therapeutic Ultrasound 
Exposure to high ultrasonic frequencies may result in damage to the remedē System. It is not 
recommended to use high-output ultrasonic devices, such as an electrohydraulic lithotripter 
or bone growth simulator on patients implanted with the remedē System. If therapeutic 
ultrasound must be performed, program the remedē System off and keep the implanted 
 14 system a minimum of 2.5 cm (1 in) away from the ultrasonic field. Confirm proper function 
of the rem edē® System after treatment. 
1
.7.1.8.6 External Defibrillation Energy 
The use of external defibrillation may cause damage to the remedē System. The risk of 
damage may be minimized by positioning the defibrillation patches or paddles a minimum of 
15 cm (6 in) and perpendicular to the IPG. Confirm proper function of the remedē System 
after any use of external defibrillation. 
1.7.1.8.7 Patient Monitoring Equipment 
remedē System stimulation therapy may be detectable by patient monitoring equipment 
including
 automated external defibrillators. Confirm proper function of monitoring 
equipment if used while remedē stimulation therapy is active. 
1
.7.1.8.8 Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators (TENS) 
TENS therapy should be used only if the remedē System is inactive (not providing 
stimulation therapy). If TENS therapy must be used, place the TENS electrodes as far from 
the remedē System as possible. TENS electrodes should also be spaced as close together as 
possi
ble to reduce the generated electrical field. Confirm proper function of the remedē 
System after use of TENS therapy. 
1.7.1.8.9 Electrical Isolation During Implant 
Do not allow the patient to have contact with grounded equipment that might produce 
electrical current leakage during implant. Electrical current leakage may induce arrhythmias 
that could result in patient death. 
1.7.1.8.10 Lead Compatibility 
Only use IS-1 lead or lead extension terminals with the rem edē System. Use of non IS-1 
c
ompatible terminals may result in undersensing of respiratory activity, failure to deliver 
necessary therapy, or a leaking or intermittent electrical connection. 
1.7.1.8.11 Concomitant Active Implantable Cardiac Devices 
It is recommended that testing for oversensing of remedē stimulation therapy by the 
concomitant cardiac device occur at the time of implant and prior to initiating remedē 
System therapy in patients with a concomitantly implanted cardiac device (testing protocol 
described on page 36). Programming of the remedē System and/or the concomitant device, 
when necessary, can prevent oversensing of remedē stimulation therapy. 
To avoid telemetry interference, one telemetric programming system should be utilized at a 
time if the concomitantly implanted device uses magnetic inductive telemetry. 
 15  
1.7.1.9 Pacemaker Dependence 
Use rem e dē®  System therapy with caution in pacemaker dependent patients without a 
physiologic escape rhythm. Device interaction may lead to over or undersensing resulting in 
a loss of pacing. 
1.7.1.10 Pregnancy  
The safety and effectiveness of the remedē System during pregnancy has not been 
established. 
1.7.2 General Precautions 
1.7.2.1 Expiration Date 
Do not use any remedē System product after its expiration date. 
1.7.2.2 Storage Temperature Ranges 
It is recommended the remedē System be stored in a dry place according to the temperature 
ranges below: 
remedē® System  Temperatur e Ranges  
remedē IPG  0ºC (32ºF) and 50ºC (122ºF)  
respistim® R, L, LQ, LQS Leads  5ºC (41ºF) and 30ºC (86ºF)  
remedē System Programmer  -20ºC ( -4ºF) and 70ºC (158ºF)  
Programming Wand   -20ºC ( -4ºF) and 70ºC (158ºF)  
eIPG  0ºC (32ºF) and 50ºC (122ºF)  
1.7.3 Home or Work Environment Precautions 
1.7.3.1 High Powered Electric Fields 
Normal operation of the remedē System can be affected by magnetic, electrical and 
e
lectromagnetic signals with sufficient strength or with characteristics similar to respiratory 
activity. Consult with Respicardia if the patient will be in an area where contact with current 
carrying conductors is possible or near high powered electromagnetic fields caused by 
equipment such as arc welding units, induction furnaces, induction stoves, resistance 
welders, radio or microwave transmitters, and linear power amplifiers. 
1.7.3.2 Cellular Phones 
Normal operation of the remedē System  may be affected by cellular phones. Maintain a 
mi
nimum separation of 25 cm (10 in) between a cellular phone and the remedē System , even 
if the cellular phone is not on.  
 16 1.7.3.3 Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) 
Electronic article surveillance equipment such as retail theft prevention systems, as well as 
airport metal detectors, may interfere with the remedē System. Advise patients to walk 
directly through an EAS system and not remain near an EAS system longer than necessary. 
Where possible, alert security personnel of the implanted remedē System and request a 
manual search.  
1.7.3.4 Common Radiofrequency Sources (e.g. RFID) 
Normal operation of the remedē System  may be affected by common radiofrequency 
sourc
es. Patients sh ould minimize time around radiofrequency sources, such as RFID, when 
recognized they are nearby and operators of the remedē System external components should 
maintain a separation distance of 40cm from RFID systems.  
1.7.3.5 Static Magnetic Fields 
Patients should avoid equipment or situations where they would be exposed to static 
magnetic fields greater than 10 gauss or 1 mT. Static magnetic fields may suspend therapy 
until next scheduled therapy session. Sources of static magnetic fields include, but are not 
limite d to, stereo speakers, bingo wands, extractor wands, magnetic badges, or magnetic 
therapy products. 
1.7.3.6 Wi-Fi 
Do not use or enable Wi-Fi on the remedē System Programmer to protect the system from 
c
ybersecurity risks.  
1.7.4 rem edē® System Therapy Hazards 
1.7.4.1 Risk of Arrhythmia 
The stimulation lead should be placed in the right brachiocephalic vein or the left 
pericardiophrenic vein. Based on clinical study of leads placed in these locations, it is highly 
unlikely the heart would be electrically impacted by the levels of stimulation available in the 
remedē System (≤10 mA, 300 µs). Based on clinical experience and animal testing 
experience with displaced leads, it is unlikely that a displaced lead would cause significant 
arrhythmias.  
1.7.4.2 Muscle Stimulation in Unipolar Configuration 
Under certain circumstances, such as high-output unipolar stimulation, therapy induced 
muscle stimulations may occur at the pocket site of the implanted device. This condition is 
mitigated by appropriate programming of the stimulation parameters by qualified medical 
personnel in conjunction with patient feedback. 
 17 1.7.4.3 Component Failure 
As with any active implantable electronic system, the remedē® System might unexpectedly 
fa
il or stop working at any time due to random component fault, battery failure, exposure to 
extreme environmental interferences or environmental conditions. These factors may reduce 
system longevity, effectiveness and cause change in the performance characteristics.

The rem edē System was evaluated in a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial at study 
c
enters in the United States, Germany, and Poland for the indication of transvenous 
stimulation of the phrenic nerve for the treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA). 
1.9.2 Patients Studied 
The study enrolled 151 central sleep apnea patients who underwent an implant procedure. Of 
the 151 implant attempts, 147 (97%) were successful. The study endpoints were evaluated 
based on intent to treat. The patient demographics for the remedē System Pivotal Trial are

1.9.3 Study Design and Methods 
The rem edē® System Pivotal Trial was a multicenter, prospective randomized trial 
c
onducted at 31 centers:  24 United States, 6 Germany, and 1 Poland. Prior to baseline 
assessments, patients were medically stable for 30 days in addition to having guideline 
recommended therapy appropriate for their clinical condition. Potential patients were 
identifie
d by chart reviews and direct physician referrals. Pre-screening was performed via 
in-home sleep testing (polygraphy [PG]) or review of PSGs completed for clinical reasons.  
 
Following pre-screening, potentially eligible patients prospectively underwent a qualifying 
overnight, attended PSG within 40 days prior to implant. Eligibility required the following 
PSG results:  apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥20 events/hour of sleep, central apneas (CAI) 
≥50% of all apneas and at least 30 central apnea events throughout the night, and an 
obstructive apnea index (OAI) ≤20% of the total AHI. Key exclusion criteria included factors 
prohibitive of system implantation, phrenic nerve palsy, Stage D heart failure, a 
cerebrovascular event within 12 months, CSA secondary to opioids, and advanced renal 
disease. 
 
All patients undergoing an implant attempt were randomized 1:1 to phrenic nerve stimulation 
(treatment) or control. The investigational system was implanted in both the treatment and 
control groups. All patients had a 1-month study visit after implantation that determined the 
schedule for subsequent follow-up at 3 month intervals. The system was activated in the 
treatment group at the 1-month visit according to a proprietary algorithm that applied a 
 20 stimulation pattern which enabled full diaphragmatic contraction while the patient continued 
to sleep. A full night PSG was completed 6 months following the 1 month visit in all subjects 
to assess the primary effectiveness endpoint. The system remained off in the control group 
throug
h the 6-month effectiveness assessment, after which therapy was initiated and 
remained on.  
 
The primary effectiveness endpoint was a comparison of the proportions of patients in the 
treatment versus control groups achieving a reduction in AHI of ≥50% from baseline to 6 
months. The primary safety endpoint was freedom from serious adverse events associated 
with the implantation procedure, the system, or delivered therapy in the combined study 
groups through 12 months. A serious adverse event was defined as any adverse event that led 
to dea
th, led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject, resulted in a life-
threatening illness or injury, resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure  or a 
body function, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to a body 
structure or a body function , or led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality 
or birth defect.

 27 1.9.4.2 Effectiveness 
The primary effectiveness endpoint was a comparison of the proportions of patients in the 
treatment versus control groups achieving a reduction in AHI of ≥50% from baseline to 6 
months. The proportion of patients achieving ≥ 50% reduction in AHI and the 95% 
c
onfidence interval (CI) for the Treatment group was 51% (35/68) [95% CI (39%, 64%)] 
compared to 11% (8/73) [95% CI (5%, 20%)] for the Control group, resulting in a difference 
of 41% [95% CI (25%, 54%)] (Table 7 ). This result was statistically significant (p<.0001), 
demonstrating that active therapy with the remedē System is superior to Control (inactive 
therapy) in achieving a 50% reduction in AHI.

1.9.4.3 Conclusion 
The data support the reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of this device for 
treatment of moderate to severe CSA in adults. 
1.10 Storage and Handling 
Respicardia sterilizes the IPG and stimulation leads with ethylene oxide (EtO) prior to 
shipment.  
The materials used are biologically compatible, but they are nevertheless prone to attract 
foreign particles. Avoid any contamination before introduction of the IPG or leads into the 
body. 
Inspect the sterile package and contents prior to opening to ensure it is intact and contains a 
proper sterile use by date. The IPG, stimulation leads, and packaged accessories are intended 
for one (1) time use only and cannot be resterilized, do not implant product from a damaged 
or opened package. 
Store and transport the remedē® System in a dry place and within the recommended 
e
nvironmental temperature limits displayed in Table 8 below. 
  
 28 Table 8 Environmental Temperature Limits 
remedē® System  Temperature Ranges  
remedē IPG   0ºC (32ºF) and 50ºC (122ºF)  
respistim® R, L, LQ, LQS Leads  5ºC (41ºF) and 30ºC (86ºF)

Programming Wand   -20ºC ( -4ºF) and 70ºC (158ºF)  
eIPG  0ºC (32ºF) and 50ºC (122ºF)  
 
Do not implant the IPG if it has been dropped on a hard surface from a height of 30 cm (12 
in) or greater. 
Only appropriate sterile implant techniques should be used to handle the remedē System 
once removed from the sterile packaging. 
1.10.1 Stimulation Leads 
Avoid severe bending, kinking, stretching or aggressive handling with surgical instruments 
as this may cause permanent damage to the lead. Only appropriate sterile implant techniques 
shoul
d be used to handle the stimulation lead once removed from sterile packaging. 
Published literature suggests that certain upper extremity activities can cause damage to the 
leads and possible failure of the leads. Active people, particularly those who perform 
repetitive upper extremity exercise at work or play should be cautioned that they could 
subject leads to damaging stress. 
1.11 Clinician Training 
Prior to implanting the remedē System , implanting physicians will receive instruction on 
im
plant tools and techniques, anatomical considerations, and instruction on concomitant 
device testing.  Clinicians will receive training related to therapy management including the 
ini
tiation of therapy, titration, and use of the programmer.   
1.12 rem edē® System Implant 
This section describes the general implant procedure of the remedē System.  Both respi sti m 
L (left) and respi stim R (right) stimulation lead placements described in 1.11.3.2 have been 
shown to b
e equally effective and safe.  Similar to cardiac device transvenous lead implant 
procedures, the implanting physician will determine the appropriate stimulation lead 
plac
ement based on visualizing the anatomy under fluoroscopy, gaining access to the vessels, 
navigating the lead to a stable location within the desired vessel, and electrically stimulating 
the nerve.  Provided the anatomy is suitable for a respi stim L (left) lead placement, the 
physician should attempt to place this lead since the remedē IPG battery longevity is 
typically greater with this system configuration. 
 29  
1.12.1 Mitigation Strategies for Managing the Risk of Infection During 
remedē® System Implant, Replacement and Explant Procedures  
The following recommendations should be followed in order to minimize the risk of 
infection during the remedē System implant, replacement and explant procedures.  
 Use  rigorous aseptic methods including antiseptic skin preparation  
 Admini ster prophylactic and post-operative antibiotics  
 Use  antiseptic flush in the pocket  
 Use  local antimicrobial agents  
1.12.2 Implantable System 
 r em edē System IPG 
 re spi stim®  L, LQ, LQS, or R stimulation lead 
 IS- 1 compatible bipolar transvenous lead for sensing 
1.12.3 rem edē® System Implant Procedure 
The rem edē System Implant includes the following steps: 
 Locate target vessel and deploy the stimulation lead 
 Te st for phrenic nerve capture and secure the stimulation lead 
 De ploy the sensing lead 
 P erform final testing  
 C reate pocket, insert leads into the IPG and secure the IPG in the pocket 
 Concomitant testing (if applicable) 
1.12.3.1 Locate the Target Vessel 
 Gain venous access using the right axillary, cephalic or subclavian vein using 
standard techniques. 
 S elect a puncture site near the lateral border of the first rib when utilizing a 
subclavian approach and avoid penetrating the subclavius muscle   
Caution:   Do not insert the lead under the medial one-third region of the clavicle; lead 
da
mage from clavicle/first rib entrapment or chronic dislodgment of the lead is possible if 
the le
ad is implanted in this manner. It is recommended to introduce the lead into the 
subclavian vein near the lateral border of the first rib.  
 I nsert a guiding catheter and position within the left brachiocephalic vein. Refer to 
F
igure 6 below for a pictorial description of typical venous anatomy. 
 30  Obtain a venogram to visualize target vein ostium.  
Caution:   When locating the target vein ostium with the guiding catheter, do not force the 
catheter tip forward if resistance is felt. 
Caution:   Excessive amount and/or rate of contrast dye injection can cause extravasation 
of c
ontrast dye or vessel dissection. 
 C annulate the vein and visualize with selective venogram (for the left 
pericardiophrenic vein). 
 
Figure 6 Typical Left Pericardiophrenic Vein Anatomy 
 
1.12.3.2 Deploy the Left or Right Stimulation Lead 
1.12.3.2.1 Left Pericardiophrenic Stimulation L ead 
 I nsert respi stim®  L, LQ, or LQS stimulation lead over a 0.014 inch guide wire 
and advance to desired position within the left pericardiophrenic vein   
 Use  care when inserting a guide wire into the lead to avoid penetrating the lead 
wall or damaging the lead conductor coil. 
Note :  Flushing a clotted lead can compromise the integrity of the stimulation 
lea
d. If clotting is suspected, remove the lead from the body and soak in 
heparinized saline. Insert a guide wire into the proximal or distal end of the 
stimulation lead and advance to clear the lumen.  
Note:  Guide wires should be handled with care at all times. A damaged guide 
wire
 may not behave as expected and could result in damage to the lead or 
vasculature.  

 31 1.12.3.2.2 Right Brachiocephalic Stimulation L ead 
 S elect the appropriate right stimulation lead model for the diameter of the 
brachiocephalic vein (See Appendix III). A lead that is too small for the vessel 
can result in weak or ineffective diaphragmatic stimulation 
 Ensure the stylet is fully advanced within the lead to the distal end of the lumen 
before inserting the right stimulation lead   
 Use  care when inserting the stylet to avoid damaging the lead wall or conductor 
coil. It may be necessary to straighten the helical shape of the lead to fully 
advance the stylet 
 P lace the lead through an introducer sheath and advance until the distal end of the 
lead is at the level of the superior vena cava or right atrium 
 R etract the stylet gradually and apply counterclockwise rotation to the lead body 
to allow the helical shape to form 
 Appl y gentle traction and counterclockwise rotation as needed to position the 
electrodes along the lateral wall of the vessel 
 Do not a llow the proximal and distal helixes to collapse and make contact as this 
will not provide a stable lead position   
 Asse ss the stability of the lead position by requesting that the patient  breathe 
deeply or cough during fluoroscopic observation 
Note:   Motion of the lead synchronous with cardiac systole may suggest that the lead 
is near the right atrium and should be repositioned.  
1.12.3.3 Test for Phrenic Nerve Capture  
Patient stimulation testing requires communication with the patient to ensure an appropriat e 
stimulation response. Physicians should deliver procedural sedation that allows for this 
communication. See Table 9 below for recommended stimulation threshold and impedance 
va
lues. 
 Eva luate stimulation lead impedance 
 Perform stimulation threshold testing 
o Once the stimulation lead has been placed in the desired location, make sure 
the stylet or guide wire is retracted sufficiently to expose lead bias, if 
applicable, allowing the lead to engage the vessel in a natural way. 
o Select an electrode testing configuration (cathode-anode electrode pair) and 
c
onnect the stimulation lead to the remedē® eIPG 
C
aution:   Connect the sterile cable to the r emedē eIPG before connecting to the 
stimulation lead. 
 32 Caution:   Do not touch the exposed metal of the stimulation lead connector end 
or the
 exposed metal of the cable alligator clips. Do not allow the exposed metal 
of the stimulation lead connector end or the exposed metal of the cable alligator 
clips to contact electrically conductive or wet surfaces.  
Caution:  Protect any unused alligator clip(s) from contact with any conductive 
surface or current leakage source.

 If an inadequate response or no response is detected, the implanting 
physician should select a new electrode pair (for R, LQ and LQS 
leads) and repeat the stimulation threshold test before repositioning the 
stimulation lead  
 If an inadequate or no response persists, the stimulation lead should be 
repositioned and the stimulation threshold test sequence repeated until 
the desired response is achieved  
o Te st for extra respiratory sensations (ERS) at levels above the stimulation 
threshold  
  ERS or sensations during stimulation other than diaphragmatic 
c
ontraction are the result of stimulating nerves beyond the phrenic 
nerve  
 Reposition the lead if unable to avoid ERS through electrode selection 
or limitation of IPG output

1.12.3.4 Secure the Stimulation Lead 
 The  guiding catheter (respi stim®  L, LQ or LQS) or introducer sheath (respi stim®  R) 
must
 be removed prior to securing the stimulation lead. For detailed instructions on 
removing the guiding catheter refer to the manufacturer’s Instructions For Use (IFU). 
 Ensur e sufficient lead slack is provided within the venous system to allow for strain 
relief during changes in body position to reduce the risk of lead dislodgement. 
 P osition the first ligature sleeve immediately proximal to the point of venous access 
and secure the ligature sleeve to the lead using permanent, non-absorbable sutures; 
anchor the ligature sleeve to the fascia or other suitable subcutaneous tissue using 
permanent, non-absorbable sutures. 
 F or  respi stim R leads , place a second suture sleeve a minimum of 10 cm proximal to 
the first suture sleeve with a strain relief loop between the first and second sleeve for 
stability. 
 Ma intain the guide wire or stylet within the lumen of the stimulation lead while 
securing the ligature sleeve to the lead body and anchoring to tissue in order to 
prevent damage to the stimulation lead insulation and conductor coil. 
 Do not use excessive force when tying sutures on ligature sleeves. 
 Do not kink, t wist, or torque the lead while anchoring the ligature sleeve, as doing so 
could cause electrode movement. 
 Do not ti e a suture directly to the lead body. 
Note:  Inadequate strain relief between proximal and distal ligature sleeves (if multiple 
ligature sleeves are present) or between ligature sleeve and IPG pocket can increase the 
risk of chronic flex damage to the lead. 
1.12.3.5 Deploy Sensing Lead 
 De ploy the sensing lead into a branch vein off the main tributary of the azygos vein 
using standard techniques 
Note:  The respi sti m  lead or any commercially available bipolar IS-1 compatible lead can 
be
 utilized for sensing 
  
 34 
1.12.3.6 Create Pocket, Insert Leads and Secure IPG  
Note:  For optimal performance of the 3-axis position sensor, care should be taken to ensure 
the poc
ket is tight forming and aligned vertically (Figure 7). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7 Recommended IPG Pocket Location 
The rem e dē IPG has four IS-1 bipolar connector ports in the header block, three for 
connecting stimulation leads and one for a sensing lead. The three stimulation lead 
ports are labeled 1-2, 3-4  and 5-6 corresponding to the following stimulation lead 
e
lectrodes (Figure 8 ). The single IS-1 bipolar connector sensing lead port is labeled S 
a
nd allows for the insertion of a bipolar sensing lead (also Figure 8 ):

 36 Caution:  Verify that the lead connections are secure. Loose lead connections may 
re
sult in inappropriate sensing and/or failure to deliver stimulation therapy. 
Caution:  Use only the wrench supplied with the device. The wrench is designed to 
pre
vent damage to the device from over tightening a setscrew. 
Caution:  Counterclockwise rotation of a set screw may cause the set screw to 
diseng
age from the connector block. 
Caution: If a multipolar stimulation lead is not implanted, pin plugs provided with 
the device must be secured in the unused stimulation ports to avoid damage to the 
device . 
 Do not kink, t wist, or braid the lead connectors with other leads, as doing so could 
cause lead insulation abrasion or conductor damage. 
 Do not be nd the lead near the lead-header interface. Improper insertion can cause 
insulation or connector damage. 
 P rior to placing the IPG in the pocket,  wrap any excess lead length loosely behind 
the IPG by rotating as shown in Figure 12. 
 P lace the IPG and excess lead wrap in the IPG pocket with the IPG connector closest 
to the pocket incision and with the device labeling facing up toward the skin.  
 Do not c oil the leads. Coiling will twist the lead bodies and may result in lead 
dislodgment.

1.12.4 Concomitant Cardiac Device Testing (if applicable) 
Testing for concomitant cardiac device interaction at the time of remedē System implant for 
patients with a pre-existing cardiac device is recommended. Concomitant device interaction 
testing should be repeated prior to therapy initiation and anytime the reme dē System or the 
cardiac device system is modified. The following steps are required to complete concomitant 
de
vice interaction testing: 

 37 1. Disable high voltage cardiac therapies on the cardiac device if applicable 
2. P rogram cardiac device sensing to the most sensitive setting and prepare for 
monitoring electrogram (EGM) and device marker channels  
3. S et up rem e dē® System stimulation test (2 sec duration) 
a. Ac
ute/new remedē System: 
i. Left stimulation lead: pulse width 150μs, frequency 20 Hertz 
ii. Right stimulation lead:  pulse width 300μs, frequency 40 Hertz 
b. C hronic remedē System: 
i. Use programmed pulse width and frequency settings 
4. De liver 2-3 stimulation pulses at 2 times the stimulation threshold 
5. Obse rve cardiac device EGM and marker channels for evidence of detection of 
remedē System stimulation pulses 
6. Te sting should be completed with both an intrinsic (sensed) rhythm and during forced 
ventricular pacing 
1.12.5 Postoperative Care 
Follow up according to normal postoperative care procedures. A 7 to 14 day check of the 
surgical incision healing is recommended. 
To allow for stabilization and healing after the implant procedure, the remedē System 
therapy should not be enabled for approximately 1 month following implant. 
Regular patient follow-up should be scheduled to monitor the condition of the IPG battery 
and to confirm that therapy settings are appropriately programmed. 
Intermittent or continuous loss of stimulation or sensing can be caused by a displacement of 
the electrode, unsatisfactory electrode position, breakage of the conductor or its insulation, an 
increase in thresholds, or poor electrical connection to the pulse generator. 
1.12.6 Physician Instructions to Patient 
Information regarding the remedē System should be provided to patients including the 
warnings and precautions provided on page 13. Patients should also be instructed as follows: 
 I t is normal to feel some discomfort from the surgical incision and to have some pain 
at the implant site for 2 – 6 weeks. 
 I t is best to limit the mobility of the right arm (or left arm if left-sided device 
placement) and avoid lifting the arm above shoulder level for several weeks after the 
implant procedure. This time period allows the leads and IPG to affix more securely 
in place and such movements could impair the healing process. 
 38  Repetitive upper extremity activities and exercise can cause damaging stress and 
possible failure to permanent implanted leads. Active patients should be cautioned to 
avoid physical activities that could damage the implant site or the implanted system. 
 Inform general practitioners and consulting physicians that the patient has an 
implanted stimulation system 
 C arry the Device/Subject Identification Card at all times 
1.12.7 Patient Registration 
Complete a remedē®  System registration form following implant of the remedē System. 
This form serves as a permanent record of facts related to the implanted system. A copy of 
this form should be returned to Respicardia. Refer to the last page of this manual for contact 
information. 
1.12.8 Surgical Revision and Explant 
1.12.8.1 Lead Repositioning 
If the stimulation lead becomes displaced and phrenic nerve capture cannot be obtained by 
programming stimulus to other electrodes, an effort to reposition the affected lead should be 
attempted as soon as possible. Care should be taken to avoid damage to the implanted IPG, 
stimulation lead, sensing lead and surrounding tissues during the replacement procedure. If 
the displaced lead is unable to be repositioned and must be explanted, the lead should be 
returned to Respicardia for analysis and/or disposal. 
1.12.8.2 IPG Replacement 
The IPG should be replaced when IPG battery has been depleted and either the elective 
replacement indicator (ERI) or end of life (EOL) indicator is displayed on the remedē 
System Programmer. Care should be taken to avoid damage to the implanted leads during the 
replacement procedure. Confirm proper function and programming of the remedē System 
following replacement. The explanted IPG should be returned to Respicardia for analysis 
and/or disposal. 
1.12.8.3 System Explant 
The decision to remove the remedē System is the responsibility of the physician and patient 
and should be determined on a case by case basis. The risks associated with system removal 
and/or abandonment should be considered. If the IPG is removed but the leads are left in 
place, the proximal connectors of the leads should be capped to minimize tissue irritation and 
induced currents. Any explanted system components should be returned to Respicardia for 
analysis and/or disposal.

grouped using a tab format with the following headings: Summary, Therapy, Stimulus, 
Weekly Titration, Nightly Titration, Sensors, Tools, Lab Parameters, Lab Status, and LOG 
Configuration. Selecting a tab heading will allow the user to view to the corresponding 
programmable parameters and their current values. 
 

 44 Programming Window 
The Programming Window (Figure 17) allows a user to interrogate the device, directly 
e
xecute a programming command and cancel pending programming changes that have not 
been executed or undo a previous programming command. A message field is located 
beneath the programming window buttons that details parameter value conflicts, if 
applicable. 
Log Window 
The Log Window (Figure 17) contains a message field detailing history log of all interactions 
betwe
en the device and programmer during a clinical programming session. Each log entry 
will contain the following format: description, status, date and time. The date and time 
correspond to the programmer clock. If the programmer clock is different from the clock 
maintained by the implanted device, a message will appear upon initial interrogation. If 
applicable, additional log entry information may be viewed by double tapping the specific 
log entry. 
Marker Window 
The Marker Window (Figure 17) may be used to graphically view live data collected by the 
de
vice or to review previously collected waveforms and data. Two channels may be selected 
for viewing at a time.  
Status Bar 
The Status Bar (Figure 17) indicates any current communication event (for example, 
interrogation, programming and ready). The Status Bar may also be used to indicate the 
function of any buttons as the description will be displayed when the pointer is held over a 
button. 
1.13.2.4 Positioning and Using the Programming Wand 
During a clinical programming session, telemetry communication between the remedē® 
S
ystem Programmer and the remedē IPG requires the programming wand to be positioned 
ove
r the patient’s implanted device. The programming wand must be in place over the 
implanted device for the duration of the programming session. Lifting or moving the 
programming wand out of telemetry range will interrupt or end any tests or operations in 
progress. Replacing the wand may allow the user to resume progress saving wave or log data, 
while other functions may need to be restarted. 
The programming wand contains a number of LEDs to indicate proper position and function. 
A green power on LED indicates the programming wand is connected to the remedē System 
P
rogrammer display and powered. A series of red, yellow, and green LEDs indicate 
telemetry signal strength with green indicating best communication, yellow indicating 
 45 adequate communication, and red or no LED illumination indicating poor or no 
communication. The programming wand should be repositioned in the case of red or no LED 
illumination. 
Note :  Best signal strength will be found when the distance between the Programming Wand 
and implanted device is less than 2.5 cm (1 inch). 
1.13.2.4.1 Effect of Programming Wand on Concomitant Devices 
The rem edē System Programmer Wand does not contain a strong magnet. Placing the 
Programming Wand over a concomitantly implanted device is unlikely to have an effect on 
the ope
ration and programming of the concomitant device. 
1.13.2.5 Interrogating the remedē®  IPG 
Position the Programming Wand directly over the implanted device and verify sufficient 
signal strength for proper communication. Select the interrogate button from the remedē 
System Software Application (Figure 18) using the attached stylus or by selecting Interrogate 
unde
r the File pull down menu on the Menu Bar. The interrogate button will illuminate in 
blue if no active programming session is in progress. After successfully completing the 
interrogation, the Summary Tab and associated parameters will appear displaying current 
device status and programmed settings. 
 
Figure 18 Interrogate Button 
  

 46 1.13.2.5.1 Battery Status 
The measured battery voltage will be displayed with one of the following battery status 
indicator messages: 
Good  The measured battery voltage level is above the elective replacement 
indicator level.  
ERI The elective replacement indicator (ERI) is triggered after 3 consecutive 
battery measurements are less than 2.60V. The remedē IPG will 
continue to operate as programmed  but replacement should be 
scheduled as soon as possible. Approximately 3.3 weeks of normal 
operation remain once ERI is triggered.  
EOL  The end of life indicator (EOL) is triggered when 3 consecutive battery 
measurements are less than 2.50V. Stimulation t herapy is disabled when 
the battery reaches EOL and the remedē IPG should be replaced 
immediately.  
1.13.2.6 Urgent Off Command Using the Programming Wand 
The urgent off command is a safety feature that overrides all functions in effect and 
immediately disables stimulation therapy and programs the device to the off mode. The 
urgent off command may be initiated using the programming wand by selecting and holding 
the urgent off button for at least 2 seconds (Figure 19). An orange LED above the urgent off 
butt
on will illuminate and flash 5 times to indicate successful programming. If not 
successful, the programming wand will automatically make one additional attempt to 
program the urgent off command. In this case the user should ensure the programming wand 
is positioned over the device with sufficient telemetry signal strength. 
 
Figure 19 remedē®  System Programmer Wand Urgent Off Button 
Once the remedē IPG has been interrogated, the user may also initiate the urgent off 
command by selecting Urgent Off from the Tools pull down menu on the Menu Bar or by 
selecting the urgent off icon from the toolbar (Figure 17).  

 47 Note:  – The programming wand may be connected to any powered USB port to program the 
urge
nt off command and does not require the remedē System Software Application.

.13.2.7 Therapy Suspension Using a Magnet 
The rem edē® System stimulation therapy can be suspended by placing a strong magnet over 
the implanted device (within 6 cm) in the event that the programming wand is unavailable. A 
magnetic sensor in the IPG can sense the presence of a strong, external magnetic field (most 
commonly generated by using a standard pacemaker donut magnet). The minimum magnetic 
field strength required to activate the magnet sensor is 25 Gauss as measured at the surface of 
the remedē System device. The magnet must be held in place for a minimum of 10 seconds 
to allow the remedē System to detect the magnetic field and confirm its presence. Once a 
magnetic field has been detected, the remedē System automatically suspends stimulation 
therapy. Once the magnetic field has been removed, stimulation therapy will resume at the 
next Scheduled Sleep Start Time (typically the next night when stimulation therapy is 
scheduled to start).

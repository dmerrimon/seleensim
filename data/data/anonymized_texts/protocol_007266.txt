 information  will be collected using an online software called Qualtrics. However, you will have option 
to use paper and pen to answer the question s as well. If you use paper and pen, we will transfer the 
information to Qualtrics.  Before you answer these questions, our research staff will enter the STUDY 
ID for you in the Qualtrics softw are or paper/pen questionnaires. Information collected in Qualtrics do 
not contain your  personal identifying information and will be password protected. This session  will 
happen at mutually agreed upon space . We will make sure the space is secure and that no one can hear 
our conversation.  We will be there to answer any questions you may have regarding the questionnaire. 
This session should not take more than 60 minutes. Your time will be compensated with $25 for this 
session. We will then randomize each par ticipant to two groups, first group will get the meditation 
training first and after a month second group will get the same training.  
When it is time for your  meditation  training  (second session), we will show you a recorded video that 
will provide you wi th orientation and training to practice daily meditation. The meditation will be 
recorded by a certified meditation trainer. We will also provide you with a guided meditation practice 
in an mp3 player . You do not have to return the mp3 device after this re search study is over  and 
additional $10 will be provided for time compensation.  The training session will happen in a group in 
a lobby or media room. After the training is over, we will be available to answer any questions. At the 
end, we will collect som e data on your health and wellbeing  and your thoughts about the training and 
meditation practice . This session should not take more than 60 -90 minutes.    
We also ask you to practice meditation at least once a day for 20 -25 minutes using the mp3 device we 
give you. You will be taught how you can use the mp3 player. We will also call weekly to check in and 
answer any questions you may have. You will also be provided with a journal folder with some 
questions  (daily and weekly questions) , that we request you fi ll out daily  (and weekly for weekly 
questions)  after you r guided meditation practice , which should not take more than 10 minutes . This 
completed journal, which captures your general feeling and experiences regarding the meditation 
practice, will be collected at end of the month. Around end of one month of your own guided 
meditation practice, we will contact you  again for data collection. This session should not take more 
than 30 minutes. At this session, we will compensate you with $30. At this time,  we may ask for 4 -5 
volunteers to participate in a focus group meeting, which will be around 90 minutes and compensated 
with $25.  If all participants agree to meet face to face, we will meet at a mutually agreed venue to 
understand more about your experien ces and any suggestions you may have for improving the 
intervention and future such studies. This focus group meeting will be audio recorded  given that all 
participants unanimously agreed to it. Confidentiality cannot be guaranteed in this small group sett ing. 
However, the audio recording will be deleted once it is transcribed without any personal identifying 
information.   
We will ask you to continue with you daily meditation practice using the mp3 player. This time there 
will be no weekly calls and we wil l do a follow up again at a month. At month follow up, we will call 
to set up an appointment for another set of data collection. This session should not take more than 30 
minutes and will be compensated with $20.  
If you are in a second group, then we ask y ou to continue doing activities you regularly do, and we will 
call in a month to schedule a meeting for data collection (compensated with $20) and then for the 
meditation training. We will follow the same timing and compensation as we did with the first gr oup 
except there will be no focus group.

Page 3 of 4 BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATION 
There may be direct benefits to you as a participant in this study.  You will receive training in loving -
kindness meditation. Research has indicated the benefits of this practice in red ucing stress. And we 
hope to learn about your experiences during and after the meditation practice. There are different types 
of meditation practices available for free on YouTube that may be beneficial  as well .  
RISKS OF PARTICIPATION 
There are risks inv olved in all research studies. This study may include only minimal risks. Meditation 
practice may arouse thoughts and we recommend not paying attention to those thoughts and bringing 
your awareness back to the guided meditation. You may feel uncomfortable during the meditation 
practices as you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions. This is expected and guided 
practice will help you return back to meditation practice. Should doing meditation becomes 
challenging, you can stop the practice and come b ack at a later time. Sometime keeping eyes open and 
lowered may help. Please write about these experience s in your journal and give us a call to discuss 
these challenges. Some of the questions might make you feel  uncomfortable , and you have the right to 
refuse to answer those questions. There may be some inconvenience in the time required to complete  
the task. We encourage taking breaks as needed .  
COST /COMPENSATION  
There may not  be a financial cost to you to participate in this study.  The study will take minimum of 
30 minutes  of your time  for each session.  Some session might take longer and is explained above. You 
will be compensated for your time . First intervention group will receive $85 in total, and second group 
will receive $105 because of one month wait and one extra data collection. For those, who participate 
in focus group, they will receive $25 more. This money will be divided between sess ions.  We may 
need to provide your identifying information , such as name, gender, mailing address , and date of birth , 
to our research payment system for compensation purposes. This information  will not be linked to your 
study data.

Modification Summary
Briefly describe the proposed modification(s) and explain why each change is needed.
I am seeing increased interest in my study, so to be safe I would like to increase the study sample size
from 60 to 100. Given the benefit of the intervention and interest from the eligible community members, it
seems fair to increase the sample size and not exclude any interested eligible members. 
I am also increasing focus group number. We will ask for 8- 10 volunteers and divide them into two groups
of 4-5 participants. As the sample size increases, I would like to make sure that focus group is
representative of the sample as well, so I would like to increase focus group participants. 
These changes have been made in the protocol as well.

Provide the inclusion/exclusion criteria for each population.
Loneliness is a serious public health problem that affects more than 35% of older adults. Given that
the study is testing an intervention to reduce loneliness and its implications among older adults, we
will only include . We will be recruiting adults aged 50 and older living adults 50 years of age or older
in Southern Nevada.
 Inclusion criteria: adults age 50 years or older living in Southern Nevada
 Exclusion criteria: cognitive or language barriers that would be determined by whether they are able
to understand and repeat information from informed consent. If we determine they are not able to
provide informed consent, they will be excluded from the study.

What are the selection criteria for research participants?
Include sample size calculations, if applicable.
Adults age 50 years or older, who are willing to participate will be recruited unless they have a
significant cognitive or language barrier that will prevent them from successfully answering the
study questionnaires. 
We will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with waitlist control to determine the intervention's
feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy. Although the proposed study is a feasibility pilot study,
we will investigate the preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Therefore, the sample size for this
current pilot study was estimated based on four repeated measurements: (baseline, right
after intervention,  post-intervention (at one month), and follow-up (at second month). Using an
estimated effect size (Cohen's f= 0.2), an alpha of 0.05, and a power of 90%, for a repeated
measure ANOVA between-within effects, with two groups and four measurement time points, the
sample size was determined to be 46. This sample size was then increased by 33% to allow for
attrition, to give the total sample of 60. The sample size was determined using G*Power (v. 3.1.9.7).
Given the interest from the community, we are increasing our sample size to 100. We do not want
to exclude eligible community members who might benefit from participating in the study. This will
help increase the study power as well.

Recruitment
Describe how subjects will be recruited.
 will be recruiting adults aged 50 or older living We, either the PI or research assistant (CITI-trained),
in Southern Nevada. The research team will recruit 100 older adults from different senior homes or
institutions that serve older adults, such as the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) at
UNLV, with approximately equal numbers of participants  in each RCT condition. Senior (n = 50)
housing and OLLI staff will help advertise our study to their residents/members by posting flyers or
emailing the flyer (they will not be involved in recruitment, data collection, or answering questions;
they will direct the potential participants to us for any research-related questions). The research
team will also directly work with the onsite manager of the senior apartments to post our flyers,
promote our study, and recruit from the sites.  Once the research team has received approval from
the apartment manager, we will have a table in the lobby to recruit potential participants, we will
also post flyers in the lobby area so interested participants can directly call the PI. The PI will ask
the apartment complex to provide a facility authorization letter once approval to use the facility is
received.  
Recruitment will occur face-to-face at the older adult’s apartment complex (probably in the  lobby
area, where we will obtain potential participants' contact information) or via phone (if potential
participant call us with interest to participate). We will also use the OLLI site for recruitment, and
approval to use the facility will be sought. During the recruitment phase, research team is only
collecting potential participants name and contact information for screening visit.
At the end of the intervention, we will also recruit  volunteers from the study to participate in 8-10 two
 to further collect qualitative data on the feasibility of the focus groups (each with 4-5 participants)
study.  During the final data collection at the end of the fourth week research team will ask the
participants if they would like participate in a focus group interview. We will randomly choose 8-10
participants from the interested pool of the participants.

Objectives
Briefly describe your research questions and the objectives of this study in lay terms. State
what you hope to learn from the study and assess the importance of this new
knowledge. What do you aim to achieve through this research?
Note: DO NOT copy and paste directly from your grant proposal, dissertation prospectus,
clinical protocol, etc.
Objective 1: To evaluate the feasibility of implementing loving-kindness meditation (LKM) among older
adults. Research Question 1: Is LKM intervention feasible and acceptable among older adults? We hope
to find that intervention is feasible and acceptable among this population. We will also gather data on
challenges and how to improve/refine this intervention for future research through a focus group interview.
Objective 2: To examine the preliminary effectiveness of the LKM in increasing positive emotions such as
compassionate love. Research Question 2: What is the preliminary effect of the LKM on compassionate
love?Hypothesis: Older adults will show an increased compassionate love (Self-compassion scale) after
30 days of intervention.Objective 3: To examine the preliminary impact of the LKM in reducing loneliness
and improvement in cognitive function and mental health.Research Question 3: What is the preliminary
effect of the LKM on loneliness, depressive symptoms, anxiety scores, and cognitive function?
Hypothesis: Older adults will show a reduced feeling of loneliness, depressive symptoms (CESD) and
anxiety (PROMIS anxiety scale), and improved cognitive function (PROMIS cognitive function scale) after
30 days of intervention.

Research Methods
Describe ALL the study procedures that human participants will undergo for purposes of the
research. 
Keep this in mind - If you are:
Observing participants - describe the setting and what you will document
Asking participants to complete a survey - describe how the survey will be distributed 
Interviewing participants - describe how you will interview them and what the setting of
the interview will be 
Audio or video recording - describe how the audio/video tapes will be used and how
confidentiality will be maintained
Conducting secondary analysis - describe the data source and provide a list of the
variables that will be obtained and analyzed 
Include:
Time commitment for each participant including if there are multiple visits (e.g., 30
minutes per week for 3 weeks for a total time of 1.5 hours)
Explain what will happen if the participant no longer wants to participate and they are
no longer interested in being in the study. What will happen to data that has already
been collected?
Describe what will happen to the data after it is collected and analyzed. If data is
presented publicly, will it be identifiable or de-identified? 
*required
How will you conduct this study?
Clearly describe any procedures used during the conduct of the study for each
participant population. A step-by-step description is recommended.
A randomized controlled trial with a wait list control will be used in this research. The principal
investigator will be involved in every aspect of the research and will train two research assistants to
collect data and provide recorded orientation and intervention to participants. To develop orientation
and intervention videos, PI will collaborate with Dr. Donna Costa, who is certified in a variety of
mindfulness meditations. Dr. Costa will not have any interaction with the participants. She will help
the PI design the intervention and record the meditative practice. The PI will record the orientation
video in collaboration with Dr. Costa. The delivery of these recorded videos to the participants will
be done by trained research staff. Some portion of orientation will be in person as well.
First, our community collaborators such as Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) and senior
housing apartment will help with advertisement of the study via emailing their members our study
flyer. We will also set up a table at these community partners sites for prospective participants to
sign up. Once we have enough interested participants  50 years and older), we will set (100 adults,
up an appointment with them to discuss our study. At this time, our research staff will explain the
informed consent and after the potential participants fully consent to understanding the research
procedure, its risks and benefits, we will ask them to sign the informed consent, copy of which will
be given to them. Unless there is a significant language or cognitive barrier that makes it difficult for
the potential participants to answer the questionnaires, no interested older adults will be excluded.
Participants' capacity to consent would be determined by asking them if they understood the
information about the study and the benefits and risks of participating in the study. The trained
research staff will also respond to their questions about participating in the study. The potential
participants will be told that they can withdraw from the study at any time if they choose. They will
be told that the data they provide will be held confidential and they will not be individually identified
or in any way associated with specific responses they supply. This will happen face to face in the
participants' apartments in common private spaces such as a computer room or a community room
or OLLI classroom, where we can privately talk with participants. We will take approval from the
apartment manager and OLLI staff to use such a facility.
Then, participants' baseline data for screening will be collected before randomization.
Randomization will be done based on participants race, gender and socio-economic statuses
resulting with comparable demographic status in both intervention (n=50) and control group (n=50).
Baseline data includes questionnaire on demographic information and measures of loneliness,
depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-compassion, and cognitive function (see attached Study
questionnaires LKM). The baseline data collection will occur one on one in a common private space
in the apartment or OLLI classroom to protect participants privacy and for research staff safety. To
further strengthen our staff's safety, they will travel in pairs to collect data and provide intervention.
Participants will fill out the questionnaire on their own using either their own smart phone, paper and
pen (for which data will be transferred to Qualtrics), or research iPad (however, study ID section will
be entered by the research staff and participants are asked to fill out rest of the questionnaire). Our
research staff will be there to answer any questions participants may have. We will offer rest/break
periods as needed during the data collection sessions. Data will be collected using Qualtrics
software, which will be password protected, which will ensure the protection of the participants'
data. We may use paper pencil for data collection when needed and transfer the data to Qualtrics.
We will destroy the paper data once the data has been cleaned and ready for analysis. The paper
questionnaire will have Study ID section same as Qualtrics and personal data will not be collected
during baseline or other data collection session. The only time personal information is collected
during participants sign up, and this information will be safely locked in PI’s office cabinet and will
only be used to contact participants for future data collection sessions.
Except for demographic information, other data and some intervention evaluation questions will also
be collected at the end of the intervention, at 4 week and 8 week. There will be one extra data
collection for control group before they get their intervention at 4 week. If for any reason participants
refuse to participate during any part of the study, we will collect the reasons for their premature
dropping out of the study. Some of the questions that will be asked to those who drop out of the
study prematurely are in “Guide for Quantitative Data Collection” attachment.
The intervention primarily involves orientation and mindfulness practices such as proper posture,
breathing techniques. We will also teach them the importance of the intervention and daily
practices, how to deal with thoughts that may arise during the meditation practice, and encourage
them to write about their daily meditation experiences in the diary provided to them. We will also
teach them loving-kindness meditation and provide them with guided meditation on an MP3 device,
which they do not have return upon completion of the study. The orientation and intervention will
happen in the lobby area, common space, or OLLI classroom in a group setting. The LKM recording
will consist of mindfulness practice where they are guided to focus on compassion and kindness for
themselves and others. Recording for both brief orientation and LKM are attached. After
intervention session is over, participants are encouraged to practice guided meditation daily using
the mp3 device for 20-25 minutes on their own at time appropriate for them. They will be
encouraged to write their experience in the diary after the practice, which can take from 5 to 10
minutes daily. The diary will be a small folder with some questions to guide their entries daily.
Please see dairy or journal requirement attachment for more information. The diary will be given to
the participants after the intervention training. There will be weekly reminders via phone call to
practice meditation daily and write their experiences in the diary. Weekly call will be around 5-10
minutes weekly for four weeks. 
The orientation is about 10-20 minutes (with both in person and recording) and recorded LKM
training is about 30-35 minutes (video links provided under interview section as attachments). We
will also have a Questions and Answers session, which could take up 10-20 minutes. Participants
will be then given the link to fill out the post intervention questionnaires on their own and if they
request paper and pen version, those would be available as well.
After 3 weeks of intervention, we will call to set up an appointment to meet both intervention and
control group to collect data for 4 week data collection. At this data collection session, we will also
collect 30-day journal folders. At this time, we will also ask for  volunteers for focus group study8-10
(we will have two group of 4-5 participants) and once we have their permission, we will set up
another appointment for focus group interview, which may take up to 90 minutes at either OLLI
campus or apartment’s media room. We will also set up an appointment for control group for their
LKM training after collecting time 2 data from them. We will do a month follow-up again at 8 week
for intervention group and 4week post-intervention data collection for control group.
There are three areas of outcome measures we are aiming to determine: feasibility, acceptability,
and initial efficacy:
(1) feasibility of collecting measures of self-compassion, loneliness, depressive symptoms, anxiety,
and cognitive function; (2) acceptability of the intervention (i.e., satisfaction, adherence, recruitment,
and retention rates); and (3) initial efficacy (i.e., changes in loneliness along with self-compassion,
depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognitive function at immediately post-intervention, at 30 and 60
day follow-up). We will evaluate feasibility through participants' satisfaction, their continued use of
intervention after the study completion, how appropriate the intervention was for them, their positive
or negative effects associated with the intervention. We will also assess their active and continual
participation, retention rates, participation rate, and missing data on collected measures. We will
also conduct two focus group with  at the end of the study to 4-5 participants in each group
determine the feasibility of the study and how we can further improve the intervention for future
research. PI will transcribe the qualitative interviews.

Most studies require partial compensation be given for partial participation. Please
address this in your answer. 
The description how much compensation is provided above. We will provide them with described
amount at each face to face meeting by adding designated amount in their Forte prepaid card. For
partial participation, partial compensation will be provided. For example, they will receive $ 25 for
baseline data collection and will not receive further compensation if they did not participate after the
baseline data collection. If they took the training on intervention but chose to decline at time 2 data
collection, they will be allowed to keep mp3 player and sd card but will not receive $10 as no data
will be collected. If participants did not complete the journal at all but provided data for time 3 data
collection, they will receive $20 for data collection but not whole $30.

Participant Protection
*required
Do you consider this research study to be:
✔Minimal Risk (something that a normal person would expect to encounter in their daily life).
More than Minimal Risk (this level of risk could place participants at risk of civil or criminal liability;
damage their financial standing, employability or reputation; or place them at risk of emotional or
physical damage).
*required
Potential Risks
Examples of risk include physical risks, psychological risks (such as stress, discomfort, or
invasion of privacy) and social risks (such as jeopardy to insurability or employability).
Describe immediate risks, long-term risks, rationale for the necessity of such risks,
alternatives that were or will be considered, and why alternatives may not be feasible.
xpected risks to the subject are minimal due to the relaxed nature of the intervention. They mayE
have difficulty practicing meditation at the beginning and some thoughts may arise, but with time, it
usually gets better. 
They may have discomfort when answering some questions. However, participants can take as
many breaks during answering questions as they wish, and they can skip the questions that make
them uncomfortable or stop participating in the study. 
Describe any potential legal, financial, social, or personal affects on subjects of
accidental data disclosure.
As we are not collecting any protected health or financial information from the participants, we do
not anticipate any personal, financial, social, or legal effects on the subjects. Without having both
identifiable documents and study data, there is very minimal chance of data disclosure. Moreover,
we are collecting data in Qualtrics, which is always password protected.
What procedure(s) will be utilized to prevent/minimize any potential risks?
Given the potential risk information we have, we will make sure to teach our participants about
potential risks and how to handle them should they arise. We will ask the participants to write down
these experiences in their daily diaries, and if it starts to bother their daily activities, we will ask them
to stop the practice.
Participants may feel uncomfortable during their meditation practices as they become more aware
of their thoughts and emotions as they become more mindful of their surroundings and body
responses. During the orientation session, participants will be instructed on how to deal with these
thoughts safely.  Participants will be encouraged to keep their eyes open if closing them feels
uncomfortable. They will also be told that thoughts are normal, but guided meditation will help them
focus back on the meditation. If they cannot focus back on the meditation, then that is normal as
well. We will let them know that their comfort is important and should they feel any discomfort, they
can stop the meditative practice and come back at a later time. They also have the option to stop
the intervention at anytime and withdraw from the study. 
Should they have any discomfort with answering the questions, they can skip the questions. They
also have the option to stop the study at anytime. 
They will be encouraged to approach the PI to discuss any concerns. The PI's mobile telephone
number and email will be provided to the participants during the orientation to contact the PI.

Privacy and Confidentiality
How will you protect the subjects privacy during research activities?
Privacy refers to the environment in which data are collected from participants and the
individual's interest in controlling the access of others to themselves (e.g., interviewing
participants individually in a place where personal responses will not be seen or
overheard, collecting only the minimum necessary PII to carry out the research, etc.).
We will be collecting data and implementing the intervention either at the participant's home or a
mutually agreed upon venue. We will make sure the mutually agreed upon venue is private and
secure so that the risk of being overhead is zero.  After the data collection, the indefinable data will
be locked in a briefcase before transferring the paper records to the UNLV secure file
cabinet.  Since the main study's de-identified data are collected in Qualtrics, the data will be
password protected. 
We will conduct focus group interviews via phone conference call or in person. After the recording is
started, we will ask participants to only use their first names. We will let the participants know that
once the recording is transcribed, the audio recording will be destroyed and the transcription will not
have any identifiable information. Moreover, pseudo names will be used instead of their real
names. 
What precautions will be taken to safeguard  data? identifiable
If identifiable data will be linked to the participant, describe how this will be presented in
any written or oral materials related to the study. 
If you plan to code the data, describe the method in which it will be coded and indicate
who will have access to the key to the code. 
If you plan to de-identify the data, describe who will be responsible for the
de-identification and how data will be de-identified so identifiers are not linked to the
participant data. 
Note: Data is considered to be anonymous when identifiable data is not collected at all.
If identifiers are obtained, but are replaced with pseudonyms or participant ID numbers
which can then be linked back to identifiers, then data is considered to be coded, not
anonymous. If the data cannot be linked back to identifiers, then data is considered to
be de-identified.
The only identifiable data that we are collecting are the participants' names and contact information
in written form. We will assign a study ID to each participant and use that ID to collect data at
different time points. The numerical ID is written at the top of the identifiable form.  It is important to
have this ID to link longitudinal data points. Only the PI and the research assistant collecting the
data will have access to this information. The list with participants' personal information will be

destroyed in three years, and we will not be able to link the information back to the participants with
the de-identified data. As no identifying information is collected in Qualtrics, destroying the
identifiable information sheet will be sufficient to prevent being able to link the data to the
participants.

Specify how all forms of data (e.g. paper hardcopy, electronic, audio/video files/recordings,
etc.) will be destroyed and/or kept at the conclusion of the study. 
We will not destroy de-identified data. But identifiable data such as patient names and contact information
will be destroyed after three years of data collection. Identifiable data are only used to contact participants
to make appointments and link the different time points' data. Since this information will be in paper
format, it will be locked on a secure UNLV site in a locked file cabinet and will be shredded at the end of
the third year.
*required
Where will  and data be stored?  identifiable de-identified 
For review/audit purposes, a copy of all records must be kept in a location accessible to the
. PI on UNLV property
A USB Drive cannot be used for storage of the data. A HIPAA compliant storage solution
must be utilized, accessible to both the student and PI. No PHI should be stored on a USB
drive. 
Indefinable paper records will be kept at secure storage location at UNLV school of nursing research office
file cabinet. De-identified data are collected in online Qualtrics software. We will collect identifying
information in paper separately, so it will be linked to Qualtrics data by subject code number. This code
number is used to combine different time points data. When this data is downloaded in SPSS software, it
will be stored in UNLV PI computer which is password protected. This will be accessible only to the PI and
UNLV research data sharing policy will be followed when sharing the de-identified data to a statistician,
mainly for analysis purposes.

How long will  and data be kept? identifiable de-identified 
Identifiable data will be destroyed after 3 years. De-identifies data may be kept forever for findings
dissemination.

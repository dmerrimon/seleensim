PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  2. INTRODUCTION 
Seasonal influenza occurs annually, and in the United States it causes an estimated 100 to 600 thousand 
hospitalization s annually and up to 50,000 deaths a year [ 1,2,3]. The continued emergence of novel influenza 
A vir uses in humans—including subtypes H5N1, H3N2v, H7N7, H9N2, 2009 H1N1, and most recently 
H7N9, underscores the need for focused efforts to prepare for the next influenza pandemic [ 4-9]. Current 
licensed inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are good  for preventing influenza but are less effective than 
desired . One approach to improve the effectiveness of IIVs is to prime the immune system with epitope- based 
vaccines. The M -001 vaccine from BiondVax consists of  
that are  The 
epitopes in the vaccine are common to a large majority of influenza virus strains, and the epitopes are recognized by both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system [10]. 
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess in healthy adults the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two doses of multimeric -001 (M-001) vaccine followed by the 2018-2019 seasonal quadrivalent IIV (IIV4). 
2.1. Purpose of the A nalyses 
These analyses will assess the safety, reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity of two doses of M-001, 
manufactured by BiondVax, or saline placebo, followed by a single dose of seasonal IIV4  for up to 200 days 
after the first study vaccination . They will be presented  in the CSR, with a subset for compilation in a 
“topline” report  for expedited delivery (exhibits indicated by asterisks in the appendices).

achieving seroconversion (defined as a minimum four-fold rise in post-vaccination ELISA ant ibody titer) at 
each time point, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
For individual subjects, fold rise will be calculated as the ratio of: 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝−𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝑝𝑝𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑣𝑣 𝑝𝑝𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡
𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡−𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑣𝑣 𝑝𝑝𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡, where pre-vaccination 
value is always the result obtained at Day 1, prior to the first M -001 dose. 
Seroconversion for HAI and Neut assays  is defined as either a pre- vacci nation titer <  1:10 and a post-
vaccination titer ≥ 1:40, or a pre -vaccination titer ≥  1:10 and a minimum four-fold rise in post-vaccination

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
DMID 14 -0112 is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial in a sample of 120 males and 
non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria.  
This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two  priming doses of 
M-001 followed by administration of IIV4.   
Subjects are assigned randomly to 1 of 2 study arm s (60 subjects per study arm ) to receive two doses of the 
M-001 vaccine or placebo followed by a single dose of IIV4 (see Table 1).  
• Group A re ceives two 1 mg doses of M-001, on Days 1 and 22 followed by a single dose of IIV4 
on approximately Day 172 (± 30).   
• Group B receives saline placebo on both Days 1 and 22, followed by a single dose of IIV4 
approximately on Day 172 (±30). 
4.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
This study uses a placebo  concurrent control design. Saline was chosen to act as an inactive placebo control as 
a comparator for  the safety, reactogenicity , and immunogenicity of two doses of M-001 vaccine a s well as for 
the downstream immunogenic effects post-seasonal IIV4 vaccination. 
4.3. Selection of Study Population  
The study population for this clinical trial is 120 males and non- pregnant females, 18-49 years of age, 
inclusive, who meet all eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria ensure that subject s are in good health  at the time 
of vaccination and have not recei ved (and do not plan to receive) therapies  that would interfere with immune 
response to the study products, such as non-study vaccines or immunos uppressive therapies. Exact eligibility 
criteria can be found in the protocol sections 5.1 and 5.2. S ubjects ar e recruited from the general population at 
the participating Vaccine Trial and Evaluation Unit (VTEU) sites that have substantial experience cond ucting 
large influenza vaccine studies.  
4.4. Treatments 
4.4.1. Treatments Administered  
Two doses of either multimeric M -001 vaccine or saline placebo are administered per subject’s randomized 
assignment , followed by administration of seasonal IIV4 vaccine to all subj ects. 
4.4.2. Identity of Investigational Product(s) 
Seasonal Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV4)  
IIV4 f or intramuscular injection is indicated for active immunization against influenza disease caused by 
influenza virus subtypes A and type B present in the vaccine.  The 2018-2019 Fluzone Quadrivalent IIV4  used 
in the study was formulated  by Sanofi  to contain HA of each of the following four influenza strains  
recommended for the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza season: A/Michigan/45/2015 X-275 
(H1N1 ), A/Singapore/INFIMH-16- 0019/2016 IVR -186 ( H3N2 ), B/Maryland/15/2016 BX-69A (a 
B/Colorado/06/2017- like vir us, B Victoria lineage), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage).

Multimeric -001 (M-001) vaccine developed by BiondVax is
 
 
Placebo  
Sterile normal saline will be used as the placebo .  
4.4.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Study Arm s (Randomization)  
Enrollment/randomization is  done through the enrollment module in the electronic data capture system, 
maintained by the SDCC.  
Eligible subjects are randomized and assigned in a [1:1 ] ratio to re ceive two priming doses 21 days apart of 
either M -001 (Group A) or saline placebo (Group B), followed by seasonal IIV4 vaccination (all groups). 
Randomization is stratified  by prior receipt of the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine and by site. The 
randomization is based on a variable blocked scheme to provide an approximately balanced allocation to the 
study arm s during the study. 
4.4.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
Multiple  studies of M -001 have assessed the safety and immunogenicity profile in healthy adults, and t heir 
results suggested that immune responses were improved with increasing  doses up to 1 mg, with no saf ety 
concerns identified.  The 1 mg dosage was selected for this trial based on the elevated HAI antibody responses 
in that study group in the placebo -controlled BVX -006 trial [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]], where no SAEs or safety 
concerns were observed.  
4.4.5. Selection and Timin g of Dose for Each Subject  
All subjects receive the assigned vaccination at Day 1 and Day 22 (+2 days), followed by a single dose of IIV4 on approximate ly Day 172 ( ±30 days). 
4.4.6. Blinding  
This trial is double -blinded; subjects, investigators, study personnel performing any study- related assessments 
following study vaccine administration, and laboratory personnel performing antibody assays are blinded to the treatment assignment.  
The randomization scheme was generated by the SDCC and provided to unblinded study personnel (i.e., pharmacists performing study vaccination preparations and unblinded study vaccine administrators) at the participating VTEU sites who are not involved in study- related assessments or have subject contact for data 
collection following study vaccine administration. 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) receives data in aggregate and presented by group and may 
request treatment assignment be unblinded for an individual subject if required for safety assessment. The DSMB review s grouped and unblinded data in the closed session only. 
4.4.7. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications include any  medications, therapies, or vaccinations  taken in the 60 days prior to 
Day 1 through approximately 21 days after the last M -001/placebo dose received. Medications reported in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF) are limited to those taken within 30 days prior to the first study 

Statistical Analysis Plan - DMID Protocol: 14-0112 Version 1.0 
09September2019 
- 8 - 
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  vaccination through approximately 21 days after the second M-001/placebo dose. In addition, receipt of any 
non-study vaccines is solicited at each clinic visit or phone call  and reported in the eCRF for the entire 
duration of the study.  
Use of new medication should prompt evaluation for the presence of a new diagnosis of chronic medical 
disease or condition. Medications that might interfere with the evaluation of the investigational product were 
not to be used unless absolutely necessary. Medications in this category include the prohibited medications 
per the Subject Exclusion Criteri a. In addition, the site PI or appropriate staff  may identify other mediations 
that should not be used due to a risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity. 
4.4.8. Trea tment Compliance  
All subjects receive two doses of either M- 001 or saline placebo followed by seasonal IIV4 administered in 
the clinic.   
4.5. Immunogenicity and Safety Variables  
See Table 2 for the schedule of study procedures in DMID protocol 14-0112. 
4.5.1. Safety V ariables  
Safety will be assessed by the frequency and severity of:

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  Individual HAI and Neut antibody results will be reported for the IIV4 vaccine strain by the central 
immunology laboratory at St Louis University. Assay results are reported as a reciprocal titer with values of 
10*2k, where k=0, 1, 2, etc. The lower limit of detection for both the HAI and Neut assays is 1:10; values 
below the limit of detection are reported as ‘<10’, and for analysis are imputed as one- half the limit of 
detection (10/2 = 5). For analysis, the geometric mean of repeated results for each sample will be computed 
and used as the response for all subsequent calculations. The variation arising from multiple measurements for 
an individual at a single time point will not be used in subsequent calculations. See Section  3.3 for definitions 
of derived variables for the analysis of HAI and Neut data.  
Assays to determine serum levels of antibodies to M -001 will be performed by BiondVax.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  5. SAMPLE SIZE CONS IDERATIONS  
The study population for this clinical trial was planned to include 120 males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 
49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. The subjects were recruited 
from the general populat ion at the participating VTEU sites that have substantial experience conducting large 
influenza vaccine studies.  
Based on the accrual rate for similar studies, it was expected  that the participating VTEUs would be able to 
enroll this trial in a timely fas hion. Prior experience suggests up to 5% of subjects could be excluded from the 
per protocol analysis for the primary immunogenicity outcome either because they are lost- to-follow-up or 
otherwise do not have data available following the second study vaccination or because they had a protocol 
deviation requiring their exclusion from the per protocol analysis. 
Table 3 indicates the probability of observing one or more safety events, such as solicited injection site or 
systemic reactogenicity events or an unso licited non -serious AE of a particular type, for a single study arm  
(N=60) and all enrolled subjects (N=120).  
Binomial confidence intervals (CI) are widest (have the least precision) when the response rate is 50%. 
Table 4 is presented to indicate the worst-case scenario for precision of observed exact (Clopper- Pearson) 
binomial confide nce intervals.  
With N= 60 subjects per arm and assuming the standard deviation of log GMP is 0.75, the study will have 
80% power to detect a 2.5-fold increase in the GMP of T cell subsets expressing IFN -γ. Table 5 illustrates a 
power analysis considering a range of standard deviations for log GMP and a range of GMP fold- change with 
N=60 subjects per arm, and further includes the power under the conservative assumption of 10% drop out in each study arm . Power is calculated for a two -sided t- test with signific ance level (alpha) 0.05 using PROC 
POWER in SAS 9.4. Utilizing  different  tests instead  of those based on Normal approximations could increase 
the power from what is shown. 
While there will be multiple comparisons performed for this primary immunogenicity objective (for each of 
five parameters alone measured in CD4 and CD8 T cells plus any combinations measured), it is assumed that 
these analyses are not intended to be confirmatory and thus no adjustment for multiple comparisons is considered . Instead, p-value thresholds of p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05 will be considered as strong, 
moderate, and weak evidence of differences between study arms.  These will be indicated in relevant tables 
with ***, **, and *, respectively.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  6. GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1. General Principles  
All continuous variables, unless otherwise specified, will be summarized  using the following descriptive 
statistics: n (non -missing sample size), mean, standard  deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Titers will 
be summarized  with geometric means, first across replicates to compute one value for each individual sample 
and then across subjects within a study group. Percentages of cell types will also be summarize d by geometric 
means within each study group. The frequency and percentages (based on the non- missing sample size) of 
observed levels will be reported for all categorical measures. In general, all data will be listed, sorted by 
treatment and subject, and when appropriate by visit number within subject. All summary tables will be 
structured with a column for each vaccination group in the order presented in Table 1 and will be annotated with the total population size relevant to that table/treatment, includin g any missing observations. 
If a substantial number of subjects me et eligibility criteria , but had intercurrent infections that might affect the 
immunoassay results for the vaccine strains, sensitivity analyses will be performed excluding those and qualita tive comparisons will be made with the mITT and PP analyses. 
6.2. Timin g of Analyses 
No interim analysis is planned. 
The final analysis will be performed after the last subject completes the final visit, and the database is cleaned, 
monitored, and locked. A topline report will be generated upon receipt and processing of immunogenicity 
data (T cell responses after stimulation with M -001 peptides and with other Influenza A antigens, and M-001 
ELISA responses) through Day 200. Tables and figures to be included have an asterisk f ollowing the title.  
The CSR will be completed when all primary and secondary endpoint data are available.  All available 
exploratory endpoint data will be included in the CSR, and additional data not available at the time of CSR 
generation wil l be included in one or more addendums, depending on the timing of each set of exploratory 
assays. 
6.3. Analysis Populations  
A tabular listing of all subjects, visits, and observations excluded from the analysis populations will be 
provided in Listing  5. In the  case of mis -randomization, subjects will be analyzed according to the study 
product actually received for all analysis populations.  
6.3.1. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population 
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population includes all subjects who receive d at least on e dose of study 
vaccine and contributed at least one post-study vaccination venous blood sample for immunogenicity testing 
for which valid results were reported.  
6.3.2. Per Protocol Population  
The per protocol (PP) population includes all subjects i n the mITT su bset with the following exclusions: 
• Data from all available visits for subjects found to be ineligible at baseline  
• Data from all visits subsequent to major protocol deviations, such as: 
o Second or third study vaccination not received

o Receipt of non-study licensed live vaccine within 30 days before or 21 days after each study 
vaccination  
o Receipt of non-study licensed inactivated vaccine within 14 days before or 21 days after each study vacc inatio n 
o Receipt of non-study seasonal influenza vaccine (live or inactivated) within 30 days before or for the duration of the study 
o Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids) within 30 days before or after each of the first two study vac cinati ons (Dose 1 and Dose 2) 
• Data from any visit that occurs out of window 
o Visit 03: Day 14 + 2 days post vaccination 1 
o Visit 04: Day 22 + 2 days post vaccination 1 
o Visit 06: Day 14 + 2 days post vaccination 2 
o Visit 07: Day 21 + 7 days post vaccination 2 
o Visit 08: Day 56 + 7 days post vaccination 2 
o Visit 09: Day 150 ± 30 days post vaccination 2 
o Visit 10: Day 14 + 3 days post vaccination 3 
o Visit 11: Day 28 + 7 days post vaccination 3 
6.3.3. Safety Analysis Population 
The Safety Analysis p opulation includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccine. 
6.4. Covariates and Subgroups  
The protocol does not define any formal subgroup analyses, and the study is not adequately powered to 
perform subgroup analyses. 
6.5. Missing Data  
All attempts will be made to colle ct all  data per protocol. As missing data are expected to be minimal, no 
imputation will be performed for missing values. Any data point that appears to be erroneous or inexplicable based on clinical judgement will be investigated as a possible outlier. If  data points are identified as outliers, 
sensitivity analyses will be performed to examine the impact of including or excluding the outliers. Any substantive differences in these analyses will be reported.  
6.6. Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
Interim safet y data is reviewed by the DSMB as described in Protocol Section 9.6.2. Interim summary reports 
for the DSMB safety review include enrollment and demographic information, medical history, concomitant medications, physical assessments, clinical laborato ry va lues, solicited reactogenicity events and unsolicited 
AE/SAEs. There were no formal interim analyses planned.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  6.7. Multicenter Studies  
Data will be pooled across all three clinical sites.  Center effects are not anticipated because the sites are using 
standardiz ed procedures for vaccination and assessment of solicited and unsolicited adverse events, and the 
study relies on central laboratories for the assessment of immunogenicity endpoints. 
6.8. Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
While there will be multiple compa rison s performed for the primary immunogenicity objective (for each of 
five parameters alone measured in CD4 and CD8 T cells plus any combinations measures), it is assumed that 
these analyses are not intended to be confirmatory and thus no adjustment for m ultiple comparisons is 
considered.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  8. IMMUNOGENICITY EVALUATION 
Analysis of all immune responses will be conducted using the PP population. In addition, for the primary 
endpoint, analysis conducted with the mITT population will be used as a sensitivity analysis. Percentages of 
cell subset responses will be measured by flow cytometry  as described in Section  4.5.2. 
Data listings of HAI and Neut assay results as reported by the central immunogenicity laboratory will be provided in Listing  8, Listing  9, Listing  10, Listing  11, Listing  12, Listing  13, Listing  14, and Listing  15. 
ELISA assay results will be provided in Listing  16, and f low cytometry results will be provided in Listing  17 
and Listing  18. 
8.1. Primary Immunogenicity Analysis 
The primary immunogenicity objective is to determine whether priming with M -001 improves T cell 
responses. The cells are sorted  via flow cytometry, and t he percentages of CD4 + and CD8+ T cells expressing 
perforin, CD107a, IFNγ, TNF -α, IL-2, or any combination of these are calculated as the number of cells 
positive for these proteins divided by the total number of T cells counted in each sample. To compare the T 
cell responses between groups, the following Poisson regression model will be fit for each combination of proteins of interest: 
log(E(Y|X)/Z)=β
0+ β 1*X,  
where Y is the number of cells expressing a given combination of proteins, X is an indic ator variable for 
Group A, and Z (the offset) is the total n umber of T cells in each sample.  Wald tests will be performed to 
evaluate whether there are differences in the expression of T cell subsets between the two study arms.  As 
described in Section  6.8, adjustments for multiple comparisons are not planned. 
GMPs  of CD4 + and CD8+ T cells expressing each combination of proteins and the corresponding 95% 
bootstrap confidence intervals will also be presented  for each study arm Table 22Table 23Table 24Table  25. 
These will be  presented in Table 22 , Table 23, Table 24, and Table 25 and summarized visually in boxplots 
over time in in Figure  2, Figure  3, Figure  4, and Figure  5. 
8.2. Secondary Immunogenicity Analy ses 
Humoral immune responses in terms of strain -specific IIV4 HAI and Neut antibody titers will be summarized 
by study arm at each ti me point. Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for all assays and time points 
including number of subjects with non-missing results, number and percentage of subjects with titers ≥1:40, number and proportion of subjects achieving seroconversion, and GMTs along with corresponding 95% CIs. Clopper- Pearson exact confidence intervals will be presented for proportion endpoints. Summaries of humoral 
immunogenicity endpoints are presented in Table 30, Table 31, Table 32, Table 33, Table 34, Table 35, Table 36, and  Table 37. 
HAI and Neut seroconversion by Day 172 or Day 200, the percentage of subjects with titer ≥40, and GMT ’s 
against the 2018-2019 IIV4 vaccine strain on Days 1, 43, 182, and 200 will be summarized as described above. 
The reverse cumulative distributions of HAI and Neut assays against each strain will be displayed in 
Figure  10, Figure  11, Figure 12, Figure  13, Figure  14, Figure  15, Figure  16, and Figure  17. The Spearman

Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n (non -missing sample 
size), mean, standard deviation, median, maximum, and minimum. All categorical measures will be 
summarized by the frequency and percentages of observed levels. The denominator for the percentages may 
be based on the number of non- missing observation s for an assessment or based on the number of subjects in 
a population. This will be described for each table. 
9.1. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Summaries of age, sex, ethnicity, race, BMI, and prior receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine will be presented 
by site ( Table 17 and Table 18) and by vaccination group ( Table 19 and Table  20). Age will be summarized 
as a continuous as well as categorical variable. Ethnicity is categorized as Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic, and not Latino, Not Reported, or Unknown. In accordance with NIH reporting policy, subjects may self -
designate as belonging to more than one race or may refuse to identify a race, the latter reflected in the eCRF 
as “No” to each racial option. BMI will be summarized as a continuous and a categorical variable, categorized 
as (<30, ≥30). S elf-reported history of prior receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine will be categorized by 
influenza season  (2016- 17 only, 2017-18 only, both 2016-17 & 2017-18, neither, or unknown). 
Individual subject listings will be presented for all demographics ( Listing  6).

All subjects were to receive three study vaccinations administered in the c linic. The number of study 
vaccinations administered to subjects will be presented by vaccine group as part of the subject disposition table ( Table 13 ).  
9.3. Adverse Events  
An overall summary of all adverse events will be presented in Table 45. A summary of adverse events occurring in 5% or more of subjects in any study arm  will be presented in Table 46. 
9.3.1. Solicited Events and Symptoms  
Solicited injection site and systemic reactogenicity events will be documented from the time of each study 
vaccination (Day 1 (Visit 01) and approximately Day 22 (Visit 04)) through 7 days after each study 
vaccination. They were graded on a scale of 0 (non e), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). Systemic events 
include fever, feverishness, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and nausea, and the grading scale 
for these can be found in Table 7. The grading scale for fever is included in Table 8. Injection site  events

respectively . 
When calculating the incidence of solicited events, each subject  will be counted once at the highest severity 
following the applic able dose, and any repetitions will be ignored. For summaries presented separately for 
each vaccination, the denominator for pe rcentages will be the number of subjects who received the respective 
vaccination with non- missing data for the event summarized. For summaries over all vaccinations the 
denominator will be the number of subjects who received at least one vaccination with non- missing data for 
the event summarized.  
Additionally, solicited AEs will be analyzed by dichotomizing the response into a binar y variable (none vs 
mild, moderate, or severe) and using 95% CIs calculated using Clopper-Pearson methodology from a 
binomial distribution (SAS Proc Freq with a binomial option) to summarize the proportion of subjects 
reporting each symptom, any injection site symptom, and any systemic symptom ( Table 47). Summaries of 
solicited AEs will be presented separately for each s tudy vaccination as well as overall study vaccinations by 
study arm  (Table 49, Table 50, Table 51, Table 52 , and Table 53). A comparison of the proportion of subjects 
reporting solicited symptoms by study arm will be shown in Table 48, and the proportion of subjects reporting 
solicited symptoms between the first and second study vaccinations will be compared using McNemar’s test 
in Table 54.

vaccination. Concomitant medications (vaccines only) will be recorded on the appropriate data collection form after Visit 7 through the end of the study. Assessment of eligibility will also include a review of 
prohibited medica tions (per the exclusion criteria).  
A by -subject listing of the concomitant medication use will be presented  (Listing  26). The use of concomitant 
medications during the study will be summarized by ATC1, ATC2 code and study arm  for the Safety 
population ( Table 80).

P-values ≥0.001 and ≤0.999 will be reported to 3 decimal places; p-values less than 0.001 will be reported as 
“<0.001” The mean, standard deviation, and other statistics will be reported to 1 decimal place greater than 
the original data. The minimum and maximum will use the same number of decimal places as the original 
data. Proportions will be presented as 2 decimal places; values  greater than zero but <0.01 will be presented as 
“<0.01”. Percentages will be reported to the nearest whole number; values greater than zero but < 1% will be 
presented as “<1”; values greater than 99% but less than 100% will be reported as >99% . Estimated 
parameters, not on the same scale as raw observations (e.g. regression coefficients) will be rep orted to 3 
significant figures.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  12. SUMMARY OF CHANGES I N THE CONDUCT OF THE STUDY OR 
PLANNED ANALYSES  
After the data format for the primary analysis was confirm ed, the planned analysis was changed from what is 
described in the protocol. Instead of utilizing a normal approximation, a Poisson regression model will be fit 
to test for differences between study arms, as described in Section  8.1. 
Additionally, the modi fied Intent -to-Treat population will only be used as a sensitivit y analysis for the 
primary objective. Originally it was also planned for secondary and exploratory objectives involving antibody responses, but these will not be done in the interest of conci seness.

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1. Synopsis
Title: Accuracyand precision of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 
reprocessed pulse oximetry sensors compared to oxygen saturation 
in arterial blood samples assessed by CO-oximetry in neonates.
Study Description: Pulse oximetry helps in measuring peripheral capillary oxygen
saturation (SpO 2) continuously and non- invasively, and provides an 
indirect measurement of arterial oxygenation (SaO 2) based on the 
red and infrared light- absorption characteristics of oxygenated and 
deoxygenated hemoglobin. Uses of pulse oximetry include
detection of hypoxia, avoidance of hyperoxia, titration of fractional 
inspired oxygen, and enabling weaning from mechanical 
ventilation. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, such as by the use 
of CO-oximeter, provides a direct measurement of SaO 2. However, 
ABG analysis requires time, expense, and arterial access. 
Therefore, this study aims to validate the SpO 2accuracy of pulse 
oximetry sensors (manufactured by Nellcor and Masimo, and 
reprocessed by Medline Industries, LP) in neonates as compared to
ABGmeasurements as part of their clinical standard of care(SOC),
as assessed by CO-oximetry. 
Objective: To validate the SpO 2accuracy, bias, and precisionreprocessed pulse oximetry sensors as compared to SaO 2in arterial 
blood samples as assessed by CO-oximetry in neonates.
Endpoint: Pulse oximeter and co-oximeter reading pair used to determine the 
accuracy of each pulse oximeter by evaluating accuracy root mean 
square (A RMS), bias, and precision .

2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. Background & Rationale
Pulse oximetry helps in measuring SpO 2continuously and non-invasively, and also 
provides an indirect measurement of SaO 2based on the red and infrared light-absorption 
characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The ABG analysis, such as 
by the use of CO-oximeter, provides a direct measurement of SaO 2.1,2However, ABG 
analysis requires time, expense, and arterial puncture; therefore non-invasive techniques
that give similar results are being investigated.
This study aims to validate the SpO 2accuracy and precision of pulse oximetry sensors 
(manufactured by Nellcor and Masimo, and reprocessed by Medline Industries, LP) in 
neonates as compared to ABGmeasurements as part oftheir clinical SOC,as assessed by 
CO-oximetry. 
2.2. StudyProducts
2.2.1.MedlineSensors, Neo (2329)
The Masimo sensors are indicated for monitoring SpO 2and pulse rate for use with 
neonatal patients in hospitals, hospital-type facilities, mobile, and home environments. 
Further information on these sensors can be found in Appendix 11.1.1.
2.2.2. MedlineN
The Nellcor sensors are used for monitoring SpO 2and pulse rate on neonates. Further 
information on the products can be found in Appendix 11.1.2.
2.3. Risk/Benefit Profile
2.3.1. Potential Study Risks
Masimo and Nellcor sensors are contraindicated for use on patients who exhibit allergic 
reactions to foam rubber products and/or adhesive tape. While we are screening to not 
include subjectswithdermatological issues, some subjects with unidentified issues may be 
enrolled. Subjects will be under the care of a physician who will be able to appropriately 
address any potential reaction from these products. Although protective measures are taken 
by the sponsor and site, there is a risk of potential disclosure of Protected Health 
Information (PHI)by being enrolled in this study.

2.3.2. Potential Study Benefits
There are no direct benefits to the neonates enrolled in this study or to their families. The 
societal benefit is knowing if the reprocessed sensors are accurate and precise.
2.3.3. Assessment of Potential Risk/Benefit Profile
The use of these products presents minimal risk for subjects enrolled in this study, while 
offering the potential for societal benefit. Therefore, the risk-benefit profile for the study 
is favorable.

6. STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS
6.1 Day 0 Screening Visit and Informed Consent
6.1.1 Informed Consent
Prior to conducting study activities, written consent will be obtained from the parent(s) or 
legal guardian(s)of all participating subjects and documented on an informed consent form 
(ICF) that has been approved by an IRB/Ethics Committee. The ICF must be written in 
adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and comply with all elements required by FDA 
CFR 50.25 and ICH 4.8, state and local regulations, and additional elements relevant to 
specific study situations, (including a statement that Medline Industries, LPand authorities 
have access to subject records). A copy of the ICF will be given to the parent(s) or legal 
guardian(s) of the subject.
6.1.2 Eligibility Screening
Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility by the site PI, via a combination of the 
screening form provided by Medline Industries, LP, and by a review of the potential 
subject6.2. Day 1 Study visit
6.2.1. Collection of arterial blood sample and measurement by CO-oximeter
The arterial blood sample will be collected in the normal course of care and will be 
measured in the reference CO-oximeter for SaO 2. The time of the arterial blood sample 
will be recorded on the CRF by the PI or designee using a calibrated
clock as the reference time. No more than three blood draws, resulting in three data pairs 
per sensor in a subject, will be used for this study. Data pairs may be concurrently 
collected for each of the two sensors type ifsensorscan beplacedon separate extremities. 
6.2.2. Data collection using pulse oximeter
At or near the time the first blood sample is collected, the PI or designeewill place one or 
both sensors (Masimo and/or Nellcor sensors) on the subject. If the subject is currently 
receiving biliruben light therapy, then the biliruben light must be turned off when the pulse 
oximeter sensor reading is taken. The PI or designee will record the SpO 2measurement, heart rate, and the time and location of the measurement on the CRF using a 
calibrated clock as the reference time. 
6.2.3 Timing of Data Collection
The ideal time to collect SpO 2values is <1 minute of the arterial blood sample collection. 
However, the PI or designee may collect the SpO 2values up-to 10 minutes before or 10
Medline Industries, LP
Accuracy of SpO 2 of reprocessed pulse oximetry sensors compared to SaO 2 assessed by CO-oximetry in 
neonates

V 3.0  Page 15 
minutes after the arterial blood sample is collected. It is also ideal to collect both SpO 2
values at the same time. If this is not possible, it is acceptable to collect the SpO 2values 
at different times, but still within the ±10-minute timeframe of when the arterial blood 
sample was collected.
6.2.4 Placement of Study Pulse Oximeters
The ideal placement of the sensors is to be on the same location (e.g., same foot, hand, 
finger, ortoe). If this placement is not possible, it is permissible to place the sensors onto
different locations.
6.2.5 Conflicting Choice of Same Location versus Same Time
If the preference of measurements at the same time and at the same location cannot both 
be accommodated, the PI or designeewill be advised to use personal judgement and 
preferentially pick the solution that will give the most similar measurement (that is
selecting the same location (if the patient has a stable SpO 2over time), or selecting the 
same time (if the patient has markedly different SpO 2or perfusion suspected between 
measurement locations)).
6.2.6 Moving and Removing Sensors
The sensors may remain on the subject up-to the same duration as would be used for a 
SOCpulse oximeter. Thus, the duration the sensorsremains on the subject is variable but
limited by the SOC for each subject.
Subject specific sensors that are removed in between samplings will be secured by the 
study team until the next time point use.  Sensors may be reused on the same subject but 
will not be used on another subject. Once a subject has completed participation, their 
sensor will be collected and returned to Medline Industries, LP.
The study or clinical team may move a sensor from location to location on the subject's 
body to facilitate careand measurement quality.
If the subject has multiple arterial blood samples collected, 6.2.1-6.2.6 can be repeated up 
to three times using the same sensor. If a new sensor is used, it shall be noted in the CRF. 
6.2.7 Additional Data Collectedlife, weight, length, reason for admission, and skin tone. The skin tone will be evaluated

7 ADVERSE DEVICE EVENTS 
7.1 Definition of Adverse Device Event(ADE)
The ADE is the adverse event (AE) related to the use of an investigational medical device 
resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the IFU, the deployment, installation, the 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device or from error use.
7.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Device Event (SADE)
The SADE is the adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event (SAE).
The FDA definition of SAEwill be used in this study: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered seriousif, in theview of either the PIor sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
Death
A life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions or,
A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. All SADEs will be reported 
to Medline, regardless of potential relationship to the investigational device. SADEs will be 
reported to the reviewing IRB as necessary according to their rules. 
7.3 Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect(UADE)
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including 
a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
7.4 Severity of Adverse Device Event
Mild (1 = Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of 
minor irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms would 
not require medication or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.

neonates 
MED-2020-DIV65-001 
May 9, 2022 
V 3.0  Page 17 
Moderate (2 = Grade 2): Discomfort severe enough to cause interference with usual 
activities; requiring treatment but not extended hospitalization or intensive care for 
the subject.
Severe (3 = Grade 3): Incapacitating with inability to do work or usual activities; 
signs and symptoms may be systemic in nature or require medical evaluation and/or 
treatment; requiring additional hospitalization or intensive care (prolonged 
hospitalization).Life-threatening (4 = Grade 4 ): At immediate risk of death in view of the 
investigator, or it is suspected that the use or continued use of the product would 
result in subject
Death (5 = Grade 5): Death related to adverse event.
7.5 Relatedness of ADEand SADE
Unrelated: This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.)
Possible: This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the Investigational 
Product administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.
Probable: This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to 
be related to the Investigational Product.
Definite: This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to the Investigational Product.
7.6Expectedness
The site PI will be responsible for determining whether an ADE or SADE is expected or 
unexpected. An ADE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the medical device. 
Expected ADEs include a reaction or irritation at the study site following application of the 
sensors or the site from where blood is drawn.
7.7Adverse Device Event Reporting
The ADEs will be recorded on the Adverse Event form, provided by Medline Industries, LP,
by the site PI. Changes in the severity of an ADE will be documented to allow an assessment 
of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Changes in severity will necessitate a new 
CRF to document the new level of severity. ADEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each episode.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination 
Data from a study assessing the accuracy of both pulse oximeters on an adult population (Study 
ID # 2018-268) were used as parameters for sample size estimation for this protocol. Sample 
size estimation was conducted separately for each product using both the Confidence Intervals 
for One Standard Deviation Using Standard Deviation (as an estimate for the accuracy root 
mean squarestatistic in equation 1.1 below) and Bland-Altman procedures in PASS 
2020 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2020). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA, 
ncss.com/software/pass. The most conservative estimate between the two products for the 
sample size (18) and the Bland-Altman statistic (40) was used as the minimum number 
of data pairs, n.A data pair will consist of a pulse oximeter sensor reading paired with an ABG 
reading collected by a CO-oximeter. We selected a sample size of at least 80 total data pairs
for each of the two product sensors, consisting of at least 40 data pairs per site per product 
sensor. We doubled this estimate and selected a sample size of at least 80 total data pairs per 
product sensor,such that no subject contributes more than three data pairs for each of the two 
product sensors, for a minimum of 27 subjects. The same blood gas value can be used for 
multiple sensors applied simultaneously.
8.2 Randomization 
Randomization will not be completed as the data are collected from a convenience sample of 
subjects.
8.3. Populations for Analysis
All data pairs will be included for analysis, unless at the time of data acquisition any one or 
more of the following is trueOR (3) the heart rate measurement derived from the pulse oximeter is 0 beats per minute; OR 
(4) the research personnel collecting the data notes an anomaly in the measurement on the CRF 
at the time of data collection before data analysis begins. Any such designated outliers and/or 
anomalous data will be explained and any data that is excluded from the analysis will be 
justified in the final report. 
8.4Data Analysis
Accuracy of each pulse oximeter will be assessed per ISO 80601-2-61:2017, the FDAOximeters - Premarket Notification Submissions [510(k)s] Guidance for Industry and Food 
paper by Blandet al.,

For each pulse oximeter, a Bland-Altman plot (mean vs. difference of SaO 2and SpO 2) and an error 
plot (SaO 2vs. difference of SaO 2and SpO 2) will be generated. Between and within subject 
variance and upper and lower 95% limits of agreement will be presented. Subject demographic 
datawill be presented with summary statisticsand site-level effects will be assessed as appropriate.
Outliers will be explained and any data that is excluded from the data analysis or any deviations 
from this statistical analysis plan will be justified in the final report.
9 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Clinical Monitoring
The Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will confirm that the rights and well-being of 
subjects are protected, and that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable 
from source documents. Moreover, the CRA will confirm the conduct of the trial by the PI, 
PI or designee, and sites are in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and regulatory 
requirements as well as any applicable institution or IRB and federal or local processes. 
Monitoring will occur every two months, depending on the enrollment during the study 
duration. It will occur more frequently if: The volume or quantity of data is large or there is a backlog of review due to 
unexpected issues
This would also include any large volume of CRFs to be reviewed 
The site compliance with the protocol or compliance with expected ICH/GCP 
and regulatory requirements is lacking or there are continuing unresolved 
compliance issuesThere are unexpected AE/SAE or subject safety concerns noted 
There are any unexpected inconsistencies with study product management
There is a request for more frequent monitoring by the site
Any mutually agreeable situation as determined by the sites and Medline 
The frequency of routine monitoring may be increased to a longer interval based off of 
enrollment. CRA will discuss this with Medline Director or Clinical Manager and will 
inform the PI prior to implementation. 
Monitoring activities will include subject eligibility, source data review, CRF completion 
verification, product accountability, site continued suitability, PI study oversight, 
compliance, and all general monitoring activities as outlined in FDAs Code of Federal 
Regulations and ICH/GCP guidelines that guide that activity.  
Medline Industries LP may, on occasion, contract with external Clinical Research 
Organizations to provide CRA services and those CRAs are authorized to act on behalf of 
Medline Industries, LP.

V 3.0  Page 22 
It is expected that the site will be compliant with any institutional Standard Operating 
Procedures during the execution of the protocol and evidence of that compliance should be 
readily documented and verifiable by the CRA. 
The CRA will generate an internal Medline Industries, LPvisit report that will be filed with 
the Medline Industries, LPtrial master file and will provide the PI a detailed follow-up letter 
after each monitoring visit that will outline the completed monitoring activities as well as 
any identified areas of concern and the expected/applicable corrections needed. Medline 
Industries, LP reserves the right to perform audit of the study activities either routine or 
for-cause as needed, and may also perform clinical monitoring audit as well.
9.2 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
9.2.1 Confidentiality and Privacy
Subject confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the investigators, their staff,
and the Sponsor. Therefore, documentation, data, and all other information generated will 
be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be 
released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor. All 
HIPAA compliant policies on data storage and security. All electronic transmission of data 
will adhere to HIPAA Security Rules.
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, representatives of the 
IRB and regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and records required to be 
maintained by the investigators, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, 
or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. The clinical study sites 
will permit access to such records.
A master list linking subject numbers to subject name and medical record number will be 
maintained in a secure database (paper or electronic) by the site PI. The study subjectcontact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use during the 
study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for 
at least a period of two years, or longer if dictated by the reviewing IRB, Institutional 
policies, Sponsor requirements, or ICH/GCP and FDA requirements.  The PI will agree to 
notify Sponsor of any intent to move or destroy these documents. research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 
reporting, will be maintained at the research sites on the CRFs. Copies of the CRFs, which 
will not contain any identifiable information, will be provided to the Sponsor for the 
purposes of data analysis.  The study data entry and study management systems used by 
clinical sites and by Medline Industries, LP research staff will be secured and stored in an 
access controlled locked area (any paper forms) and password protected (electronic

records). At the end of the study, all study databases that are not already de-identified will 
be de-identified and archived at Medline Industries, LP.
9.2.2 Safety Oversight
The design of this study is such that the ethical issues/special protections, related to 
children (neonates) as study subjects, have been considered.6In addition, given that this is
a post-market study on the sensorsusedin accordancewith their IFUand the ISO standard,
there is minimal safety risk to participating subjects.3The subjects are in care of the site PI 
who are qualified to provide adequate safety oversight for the study. In the event there any
AEs or SAEs, the site PI will review them and make any necessary safety determinations 
as needed. 
9.2.3 Data Handling and Record Keeping
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision
of the PI. The PI is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported.
All source documents of any kind (electronic, paper, etc.) should be completed in 
accordance with Good Documentation Practices (GDP) to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data.  CRFs will be created for each subject. The CRA will verify the data entered into the 
CRF with the site source regardless of the type of source. The site will be responsible for 
developing a written process that ensures the CRA is able view the source data.   
Data from the CRFs will be entered by Medline into an electronic spreadsheet via dual-
entry to assure no errors. Data will be transferred to and analyzed with Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS), SAS®9.4, for statistical analysis. SAS®allows for internal quality checks, 
such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. Medline Industries, Inc. will be responsible for performing final data analysis 
and confirmation of results. 
9.2.4 Study Records Retention
Study documents should be retained until at least two years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of the study intervention or as required by any applicable FDA guidelines 
or for a longer period if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without 
the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to 
inform the PI when these documents no longer need to be retained. The PI is required to 
notify Medline if the location of the stored documents is changed after it is defined at the 
time of the Close Out Visit at study end.

If using pulse oximetry during full body irradiation, keep the sensor out of the 
radiation field. If sensor is exposed to the radiation, the reading might be inaccurate 
or the unit might read zero for the duration of the active radiation period. 
Do not use the sensor during MRI scanning or in a MRI environment. 
High ambient light sources such as surgical lights (especially those with a xenon light 
source), bilirubin lamps, fluorescent lights, infrared heating lamps, and direct sunlight 
can interfere with the performance of the sensor.To prevent interference from ambient light, ensure that the sensor is properly applied, 
and cover the sensor site with opaque material, if required. Failure to take this 
precaution in high ambient light conditions may result in inaccurate measurements. High levels of COHb or MetHb may occur with a seemingly normal SpO 2. When 
elevated levels of COHb or MetHb are suspected, laboratory analysis (CO-Oximetry) 
of a blood sample should be performed. 
Elevated levels of Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) may lead to inaccurate SpO 2
measurements.
Elevated levels of Methemoglobin (MetHb) will lead to inaccurate SpO 2
measurements. 
Elevated Total Bilirubin levels may lead to inaccurate SpO2 measurements.
Intravascular dyes such as indocyanine green or methylene blue or externally applied 
coloring and texture such as nail polish, acrylic nails, glitter, etc. may lead to 
inaccurate SpO 2measurements.Inaccurate SpO 2readings may be caused by severe anemia, low arterial perfusion or 
motion artifact.
To prevent damage, do not soak or immerse the sensor in any liquid solution. 
Do not modify or alter the sensor in any way. Alteration or modification may affect 
performance and/or accuracy.
Do not attempt to reuse on multiple patients, reprocess, recondition or recycle sensors 
or Masimo patient cables as these processes may damage the electrical components, 
potentially leading to patient harm. 
High oxygen concentrations may predispose a premature infant to retinopathy. 
Therefore, the upper alarm limit for the oxygen saturation must be carefully selected 
in accordance with accepted clinical standards.Caution: Replace the sensor when a replace sensor message is displayed, or when a 
low SIQ message is consistently displayed after completing the low SIQ 
troubleshooting steps identified in the monitoring device operator’s manual. 
Note: The sensor is provided with X-Cal™ technology to minimize the risk of 
inaccurate readings and unanticipated loss of patient monitoring. The sensor will 
provide up to 168 hours of patient monitoring time. After single-patient use, discard 
sensor.

INDICATIONS 
Medline ReNewal Reprocessed Nellcor OxiMax SpO2  Sensors are indicated for single 
patient use when continuous noninvasive arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate 
monitoring are required for patients in the sizes indicated in the respective sensor 
directions for use.

Note: When selecting a sensor site, priority should be given to an extremity free of an 
arterial catheter, blood pressure cuff, or intravascular infusion line.
2. Orient the MAXA(L) or MAXP so the dashed line in the middle of the sensor is 
centered on the tip of the digit.Wrap adhesive flaps on non-cable end around the digit.
Note that the cablemust be positioned on the top of the hand. (2)
3. Fold cable end over top of digit so that windows are directly opposite each other. 
Wrap adhesive securely around sides of digit.  (3)
4. Plug the MAXA(L) or MAXPinto the oximeter and verify proper operationas 
describedin the oximeter operator’s manual.
Note:If the sensor does not track the pulse reliably, it may be incorrectly positioned-or 
the sensor site may be too thick, thin, or deeply pigmented, or otherwise deeply colored 
(for example, as a result of externally applied coloring such as nail polish, dye, or 
pigmented cream) to permit appropriate light transmission. If any of these situations 
occurs, reposition the sensor or choose an alternate Nellcor sensor for use on a different 
site.
Model MAXI
1. Remove plastic backing from the MAXI and locate transparent windows (b) on 
the adhesive side. Windows cover optical components. Note corresponding 
alignment marks (a) on the non-adhesive side and dashedline (c)midwaybetween
the marks. (1) 
A great toe is the preferred MAXI location. Alternatively, apply the sensor to 
another digit of similar size, for example a thumb. 
Note:When selecting a sensor site, priority should be given to an extremity free of an 
arterial catheter, blood pressure cuff, or intravascular infusion line.
2. Orient the MAXI so the window next to the cable is aligned on the bottom of the 
great toe as shown. The cable should extend towards the heel. (2)
3. Wrap the MAXI firmly, but not too tightly around the toe. Windows must oppose 
each other. (3)
4. Wrap any excess tape loosely around toe.Use additional tape provided to secure 
cable across bottom of foot, loosely enough to maintain good circulation. (4)

5. Plug the MAXIintotheoximeter and verify proper operation as describedin the 
oximeter operator’smanual.
Note:If the sensor does not track the pulse reliably, it may be incorrectly positioned—or 
the sensor site may be too thick, thin, or deeply pigmented, or otherwise deeply colored 
(for example, as a result of externally applied coloring such as nail polish, dye, or 
pigmented cream) to permit appropriate light transmission. If any of these situations 
occurs, reposition the sensor or choose an alternate sensor for use on a different site.
Model MAXN
1. Remove plastic backing from the MAX-N and locate transparent windows (a) on 
the adhesive side. Windows cover optical components. Note corresponding 
alignment marks (a) on the non-adhesive side and dashedline (b) midwaybetween
the marks. (1) 
2. Orient the MAXN so the dashed line is on the lateral edge of the site.
Neonates : The preferred site is a foot. Alternatively, use a hand. The window next 
to the cable goes on the sole of the foot as shown. (2) 
Adults: The preferred site is an index finger. Alternatively, other fingers may be 
used. The window next to the cable goes on the nail side, distal to the first joint. 
Do not place on a joint. Note that the cable must be positioned on the top of the 
hand. (3) 
Note:When selecting a sensor site, priority should be given to an extremity free 
of an arterial catheter, blood pressure cuff, or intravascular infusion line. 
3. Wrap the MAXN firmly, but not too tightly around the foot or finger. Windows 
must oppose each other.
4. Plug the MAXN into the oximeter and verify proper operation as describedin the 
oximeter operator’smanual.

WARNINGS 
 Do not use the any oximetry sensors during MRI scanning. Conducted current 
may cause burns. Also, the sensors may affect the MRI image, and the MRI unit 
may affect the accuracy of oximetry measurements. 
CAUTIONS 
1. Do not use if package is damaged. 
2. Failure to apply the sensorproperly may cause incorrect measurements.
3. While the sensor is designed to reduce the effects of ambient light, excessive light 
may cause inaccurate measurements. In such cases, cover the sensor with opaque 
material. 
4. Circulation distal to the sensor site should be checked routinely. The site must be 
inspected every 8 hours to ensure adhesion, skin integrity, and correct optical 
alignment. If skin integrity changes, move the sensor to another site.
5. Intravascular dyes or externally applied coloring such as nail polish, dye, or 
pigmented cream may lead to inaccurate measurements. 
6. Motion may compromise performance. In such cases, try to keep the patient still, 
or change the sensor site to one with less motion. 
7. Do not immerse in water or cleaning solutions. Do not sterilize. Immersion or 
sterilization could damage the sensor. 
8. If the sensor is wrapped too tightly or supplemental tape is applied, venous 
pulsations may lead to inaccurate saturation measurements. 
9. Do not alter or modify the sensor. Alterations or modifications may affect 
performance or accuracy. 
10. The operator must verify the compatibility of the monitor, sensor, and cable 
before use, otherwise patient injury can result. 
11. Misapplication of a pulse oximeter sensor with excessive pressure for prolonged 
periods can induce pressure injury. 
12. For additional warnings, cautions or contraindications with Nellcor pulse 
oximeters, refer to the instrument operator’s manual or contact the manufacturer 
of the instrument.

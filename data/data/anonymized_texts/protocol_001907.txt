and Safety Study of KX2-391 Ointment 1% in Adult Subjects with Actinic Keratosis on the Face or 
Scalp  
Sites 
Approximately 25 to 40 sites in the United States  
Study Period and Phase of Development 
First subject in to last subject out, approximately 20 months 
Phase 3  
Study Hypothesis 
Treatment with KX2-391 Ointment 1% topical once daily for 5 consecutive days will demonstrate a 
greater complete clearance (defined as 100% clearance of clinically typical and visible actinic 
keratosis [AK] lesions at Day 57) than vehicle ointment once daily for 5 consecutive days in adults with AK on the face or scalp. 
Objectives  
Primary Objective 
x To evaluate the efficacy of topical KX2-391 Ointment 1% once daily for 5 consecutive days 
compared to vehicle control in terms of 100% clearance at Day 57 in the treatment of adults 
with AK, when applied to a contiguous area of 25 cm2 on the face or scalp 
Secondary Objectives 
x To evaluate the safety of topical KX2-391 Ointment 1% once daily for 5 consecutive days in 
terms of local skin reactions (LSRs) and other safety evaluations such as adverse events 
(AEs) and laboratory assessments 
x To compare the rates of p DUWLDOUHVSRQGHUVGHILQHGDV 75% clearance of AK lesions in the 
treatment area on the face or scalp at Day 57 between the KX2-391 Ointment 1%-treated 
group and vehicle-treated group  
x To determine the recurrence of AK in the treatment area up to 12 months post-Day 57 in 
subjects who had complete clearance at Day 57 after 5 consecutive days of treatment with 
KX2-391 Ointment 1%  
x To evaluate the safety of topical KX2-391 Ointment 1% within the treatment area during the 
Recurrence Follow-up Period  
Study Design 
This is a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically on the face or scalp of adult 
subjects with AK. 
Enrollment will be controlled so that approximately two thirds of subjects enrolled will be treated on 
the face and approximately one third of subjects enrolled will be treated on the scalp.

FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 5 of 71 
 The study consists of Screening, Treatment, Response Assessment Period, and a Recurrence Follow-
up Period.  After a Screening Period of up to 28 days, subjects will return to the site for confirmation 
of eligibility.  Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 to treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 
Ointment 1% or vehicle) ratio in each treatment area subgroup. 
The treatment area will be marked with indelible marker at Baseline (Day 1 predose) at the 
investigational site.  Subjects will be given verbal and written instructions on self-administration of 
study drug/vehicle and a study kit containing 5 daily single-dose packets, 1 for each day of treatment .  
The first dose will be applied by the subject under the supervision of study site personnel.  Subjects will then take home the study kit containing the remaining single-dose packets of study drug for daily 
self-administration on the next 4 consecutive days. 
Subjects will return to the clinical sites for assessments at the Response Assessment Visits on Days 5, 
8, 15, 29, and 57.   
All subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper- pigmentation, scarring in the treatment area, 
or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 will return for additional follow-up, which includes standardized 
photography of the treatment area, every 7 to 28 days until resolution, returned to baseline, or deemed stabilized by the Investigators. 
Subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 will continue in 
the Recurrence Follow-up Period to determine recurrence rate and safety for up to 12 months 
following the Day 57 Visit.  Visits during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will occur every 
3 months.  Subjects who develop AK lesions in the treatment area during the Recurrence Follow-up 
Period will be discontinued at the time of recurrence.  
Number of Subjects 
A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 300 subjects.  At each 
site, a minimum of 10 subjects and a maximum of 20 subjects are projected to be enrolled.

until Day 57.  The Recurrence Follow-up Period will be for up to 12 months post-Day 57.  Thus, the 
maximum overall duration of participation for each subject is approximately 15 months.  
Concomitant Drug/Therapy 
Use of any treatment for AK lesions other than study drug on the treatment area is prohibited during 
the study.  
Assessments during the Treatment and Response Assessment Periods (Day 1 through Day 57) 
Efficacy Assessments  
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK lesions 
(lesion count) for all subjects at Screening, Baseline (Day 1 predose), and at the Response Assessment Visits on Days 8, 15, 29, and 57. 
Safety Assessments 
Safety will be assessed periodically through Day 57 by recording AEs, serious adverse events 
(SAEs), LSRs, and events of special interest. 
Safety assessments will also include vital signs, the performance of PEs, ECGs, laboratory evaluation 
of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalyses, and evaluation of pigmentation and scarring in the 
treatment area at prespecified timepoints ( Table 1 , Schedule of Procedures and Assessments). 
At each study visit, subjects will be asked a general question “How have you been since the last 
visit?”.  Adverse events will be recorded at each study visit, before assessment of LSRs, 
pigmentation, and scarring in the treatment area.  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs. 
LSR Assessments The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or Subinvestigator’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, ves iculation/pustulation, and 
erosion/ulceration.  These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0=absent, 1=mild 
(slightly, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense).  In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pigmentation and scarring on the treatment area will be 
assessed as being present or absent.  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, itching, 
burning, stinging, tenderness, pain) will be reported as AEs.  Standardized photography will be 
performed on Day 1 prior to dosing, and on Days 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57, and at additional follow-up 
visits for subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper- pigmentation, or scarring in the 
treatment area.

 Events of Special Interest 
x Overdose of study medication 
x Pregnancy  
x Ocular exposures to study medication 
x Skin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma); the location and treatment will be 
reported. 
Assessments during the Recurrence Follow-up Period (up to 12 months post-Day 57) 
Efficacy Assessments  
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK 
lesions (lesion count) for subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at 
Day 57 during the Recurrence Follow-up Period at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits .  
Safety Assessments 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, safety assessments will include the monitoring and 
recording of AEs and SAEs within the treatment area at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits.   
Events of Special Interest 
x Skin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) within the treatment area 
x Pregnancy 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy: 
Primary Endpoint 
x Complete (100%) clearance rate of AK lesions, defined as the proportion of subjects at 
Day 57 with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area  
Secondary Endpoints Key Secondary Endpoint: 
x Partial clearance rate of AK lesions, defined as the proportion of subjects at Day 57 with a 
75% reduction in the number of AK lesions identified at Baseline (Day 1 predose) in the 
treatment area  
Additional Endpoint: 
x Recurrence rate of AK lesions in subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57 
Safety: 
x Evaluation of LSRs, pigmentation and scarring in the treatment area, AEs, SAEs, events of 
special interest, clinical laboratory data, and other safety assessments (vital signs, PEs, 
ECGs) 
x AEs within the treatment area after Day 57 and up to 12 months post-Day 57  
Analysis Populations 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population:  all randomized subjects. This is the primary efficacy population.  
Per-Protocol (PP)/Evaluable Population:   all randomized subjects who have received at least 4 of 
the 5 doses, conformed to the protocol as to entry criteria, did not receive concomitant medications that can affect efficacy, and returned for the final visit on Day 57.  
Safety Population :  all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment. 
 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
 
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 9 of 71 
 Recurrence Follow-up Population:   all subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57, 
regardless of which treatment they received. 
Efficacy Analyses 
To achieve statistical significance in the study, the Day 57 complete clearance rate will be analyzed 
using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) model controlling for treatment location and treatment 
group.  Before applying the CMH method, a Breslow-Day test with a significance level of 10% will 
be used to explore heterogeneity of the odds ratios across treatment location subgroups. 
Further, the Pearson Chi Square (used to power the study) will be applied to demonstrate basic 
agreement with the CMH. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed with the ITT population, and will be repeated with 
the PP/Evaluable population to support the primary efficacy analysis results. 
Low enrollment sites will be pooled to analysis sites with approximately 20 subjects in each pool. For 
example, the number of subjects enrolled will be graphically displayed by study site and treatment 
location (face or scalp) from the smallest number to the largest, with bars depicting treatment 
response. Then, analysis sites will be defined for approximately every 20 subjects pooled from the 
study sites with the lowest enrollment. 
Another CMH test adjusting for treatment group and analysis site will be performed to ensure 
concordance with the primary efficacy endpoint analyses described above. 
To explore heterogeneity of the odds ratios across analysis sites, the Breslow-Day test at a 
significance level of 10% will be applied. A finding of statistical significance in this test will be 
followed by exploratory analyses to identify outlier study sites. The outlier sites will be discussed and 
an exploratory analysis excluding the outlier sites may be carried out to estimate the impact of site-
by-treatment interactions. This process will be documented as an appendix to the final version of the 
SAP, prior to the first database lock. 
Partial clearance rate will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy endpoint (complete 
clearance rate).  However, to control for multiplicity, partial clearance rate as the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint will be examined using a step-down gatekeeping testing strategy for the overall type I error rate. In other words, the primary endpoint will serve as a gatekeeper for the key 
secondary endpoint. The complete clearance rate will be tested initially; if, and only if it is 
statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level, then the partial clearance rate will be statistically 
tested at the same significance level. 
Recurrence rates will be estimated based on a Kaplan-Meier method at each nominal post-Day 57 
visit.  Subjects with missing AK assessments in the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered 
as censored.  
Safety Analyses 
For AEs, verbatim terms on the electronic case report form (eCRF) will be mapped to preferred terms 
(PTs) and system organ classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA; v 16.0 or higher).   
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after the 
first dose or those pre-existing AEs that worsen after the first dose.  The incidence of TEAEs will be 
summarized by treatment group.  TEAEs will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study treatment.  By-subject listings of all SAEs and events of special interest will be provided.  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each 
subsequent timepoint by treatment group.  Changes from baseline will also be summarized by treatment group.  In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal-high at baseline versus low-normal-high at 
follow-up in a 3-by-3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory values from 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
 
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 10 of 71 
 baseline to Day 8 and baseline to Day 15 in each treatment group. 
LSR, hyper- or hypo-pigmentation and scarring assessment results obtained through Day 57 will be 
displayed and summarized by visit and treatment group.   
Safety data collected through Day 57 and during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be analyzed 
separately.  
Interim Analyses 
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
Sample Size Rationale 
The sample size was estimated based on the prim ary efficacy endpoint for the comparison of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% and vehicle control.  By using a Pearson Chi-square method, a sample size of 
100 scalp-treated subjects and 200 face- treated subjects, both of which are with a 1:1 treatment 
allocation ratio, will give a greater than 90% power to detect a 20% difference (30% for active 
treatment and 10% for vehicle control) with a two-tailed significant level 0.05.

follow-up, which includes standardized photography of the treatment area, every 7 to 28 days until resolution, returned to base line, or deemed stabilized by the Investigators. 
c. For subjects who have complete response at Day 57 and no recurrence, 12 months post-Day 57 is the Final Visit.  Those subjects who have AK recurrence in the treatment 
area will have their final assessments at the visit when the AK recurrence is identified.  
d. These are baseline procedures/assessments and will be performed before randomization. 
e. An expanded dermatological examination to cover the sun-exposed areas where photo-damage is likely will be conducted at Screeni ng only. 
f. The location and shape of the treatment area will be marked on an  acetate transparency sheet for recording purposes and on the subject’s skin for identification of the 
treatment area for daily self-administration of study ointment. 
g. A complete PE will include weight and an assessment of HEENT, integumentary (Day 57 only), gast rointestinal, ca rdiovascular, re spiratory, musculoskeletal, and 
neurological systems.  Height will be measured at Screen ing only.  This will be considered the baseline assessment. 
h. Vital signs measurements will be taken after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes. 
i. Subjects must be in the recumbent position for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG.  Baseline ECG is performed predose.  
j. This will be considered the baseline assessment. 
k. For females of childbearing potential: urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before randomization. 
l. At each study visit, subjects will be aske d a general question “How have you been since the last visit?”.  AEs will be recorded  before assessment of LSRs, pigmentation, and 
scarring in the treatment area.  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs.   
m. Only AEs in the treatment area will be collected. 
n. On Day 5 (Visit 3), subjects are to come into the clinic after study treatment is self-administered.  Subjects are to bring all  5 study drug packets (used and unused) in the study 
kit and the dosing log back to the site.

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background 
2.1.1 Indication 
In this study, the efficacy and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be evaluated in adult 
subjects with a diagnosis of clinically typical actinic keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp. 
2.1.2 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (referred to as KX01 in study protocol numbers) is a synthetic and highly selective 
inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase signaling and tubulin polymerization.  KX2-391 Ointment is being developed as a topical treatment for AK.  KX2-391 is also being developed as an oral agent for oncology indications. 
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arrest of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the stimulation of Ca spase-3 and PARP cleavage.  Potent inhibition 
of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% 
growth inhibition [GI
50 YDOXHV@Q0VXJJHVWVWKDW.; -391 has the potential to inhibit 
the proliferative expansion and promote apoptosis of abnormally proliferating cells in the epidermal and dermal layers upon topical application.  KX2-391 has also been observed to 
inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation in vitro, suggesting additional 
potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by lymphocyte infiltration, inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
2.1.3 Nonclinical Studies 
Details regarding KX2-391 nonclinical studies are provided in the KX2-391 Ointment 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
The bioavailability of KX2-391 after dermal administration to rats (1.59%) and rabbits 
(2.49% to 6.47%, depending on concentration) wa s low.  Plasma concentrations of KX2-391 
increased with repeat dermal administration, and in rats the plasma levels after 6 days dermal dosing reached or exceeded levels produced by oral administration of KX2-391 at the no 
observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) dose (1.25 mg/kg/dose) in a 28-day twice-daily oral 
toxicity study. Following 28 days of KX2-391 topical administration at increasing doses 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 20 of 71 
 
 (0.1%, 1%, and 2%) in rats and minipigs, an increase in KX2-391 plasma exposure was 
observed from Day 1 to Day 28, suggesting slight drug accumulation. 
In 28-day repeat-dose toxicology studies, KX2-391 ointment was administered to rats and 
minipigs at dose strengths 0.1%, 1%, and 2%. Ointment volumes of 2 mL/kg body weight 
were applied to approximately 10% of the body surface area of the skin. The administration 
sites were occluded with gauze and the applications left for 8 h/day in rats. The application site was semi-occluded for 20-22 hours in minipigs. These doses contained 2, 20, or 
40 mg/kg KX2-391, respectively, equivalent to 12, 120, or 240 mg/m
2 in rats and 70, 700, or 
1400 mg/m2 in minipigs. Systemic exposures on Day 28 to KX2-391 following daily 
application of 0.1% ointment were C max 22.9 ng/mL (male)/33.7 ng/mL (female) and 
AUC 0-24h 205 h*ng/mL (male)/216 h*ng/mL (female) in rats, and C max 2.03 ng/mL 
(male)/7.25 ng/mL (female), AUC 0-24h 37.4 h*ng/mL (male)/65.5 h*ng/mL (female) in 
minipigs. Exposure (AUC) in humans was not calculated due to the lack of quantifiable 
plasma concentrations following topical KX2-391 administration. However, the maximum 
Cmax value at the NOAEL in rats and minipigs is approximately 24 and 5 times greater than 
the maximum plasma KX2-391 concentration of 1.42 ng/mL achieved in the clinic (Study KX01-AK-002). 
Other dermal toxicity studies with KX2-391 showed that KX2-391 ointment may be 
sensitizing to the skin (Buehler assay and murine local lymph node assay), that KX2-391 
ointment was negative for phototoxicity, and that KX2-391 ointment was an irritant to the 
eyes of rabbits after single application (effects cleared within 3 days post dose). 
KX2-391 was negative in a bacterial mutagenicity study (Ames test). KX2-391 caused 
chromosomal aberrations in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells at very high doses that are 
not likely to be clinically relevant. 
Studies of the effects of KX2-391 oral on reproduction and fetal development have been 
performed. In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, KX2-391 was 
administered orally in order to increase systemic exposure.  Embryo and fetal toxicity, LQFOXGLQJLPSODQWDWLRQORVVDQGIHWDOPDOIRUPDWLRQVRFFXUUHGD WRUDOGRVHVRIPJNJ
(rats) and 3 mg/kg (rabbits). The no-effect doses for fetal and reproductive effects were 
0.5 mg/kg (rats) and 1 mg/kg (rabbits). At these doses, maternal C
max and AUC 0-8 h systemic 
exposures to KX2-391 were 25.4 ng/mL and 82.4 h*ng/mL (rats, Day 17) and 144 ng/mL 
and 251 h*ng/mL (rabbits, Day 18), respectively. Systemic plasma exposure (AUC) in 
humans could not be determined due to the lack of quantifiable plasma concentrations across multiple timepoints. However, maternal C
max values at the NOAEL in rats and rabbits are 
approximately 18 and 100 times greater than the highest KX2-391 plasma concentration 
achieved clinically of 1.42 ng/mL (Study KX01-AK-002).

 2.1.4 Clinical Experience with KX2-391 
2.1.4.1 KX2-391 in Cancer (Oral) 
KX2-391 has been administered orally as a treatment for cancer to approximately 
120 patients with various types of malignancies in 4 clinical studies sponsored by Athenex, 
Inc.  A summary of the safety information from these patients is provided in an appendix of 
the KX2-391 Ointment Investigator’s Brochure. 
Due to the differences in route of administration and short duration of treatment (5 days), 
topical KX2-391 has minimal systemic exposure and is not likely to have the same toxicity profile as oral KX2-391. 
2.1.4.2 KX2-391 as a Topical Treatment for Actinic Keratosis 
To date, 2 clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the activity and safety of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK. 
Study KX01-AK-01-US, a Phase 1, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study, 
demonstrated that KX2-391 Ointment 1% was well-tolerated and showed clinical activity in 30 adults with AK on dorsal forearm when given at 50 or 200 mg daily over 3 or 5 consecutive days in an area of 25 or 100 cm
2.  Most subjects experienced mild to moderate 
and transient local skin reactions (LSRs).  The majority of the LSRs observed were erythema and flaking/scaling that peaked around Day 5-10, before returning to or close to baseline.  Symptoms of pruritus, stinging, and burning at the treatment area were generally mild and transient.  There were  no serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths, and no subjects 
discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). 
Study KX01-AK-002 , an ongoing Phase 2a, open-label, sequential group study, evaluated 
the activity and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% when applied daily in a treatment area of 25 cm
2 for 3 consecutive days (n=84 subjects) or 5 consecutive days (n=84 subjects) in adults 
with AK on face or scalp.  Preliminary data s howed that most of the 168 subjects treated had 
mild to moderate LSRs (primarily erythema and flaking/scaling.  Eleven (6.5%) subjects had 16 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) considered treatment-related by the Investigator.  Eight of these subjects had mild application site reactions including pruritus, tenderness, or stinging.  The remaining AEs considered by the Investigator to be treatment-related were mild headache, mild to moderate dizziness, mild arthralgia, or mild darkening of hair color near the treatment area.  All treatment-related TEAEs resolved prior to or stabilized by Day 57.  Four subjects reported 5 treatment-emergent SAEs.  All SAEs were considered unrelated to study drug.  No subject discontinued treatment due to AEs. 
Thirty-six of 84 subjects (43%) in the 5-day regimen and 27 of 84 subjects (32%) in the 
3-day regimen had 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area on Day 57. 
Plasma concentrations of KX2-391 were measured in Study KX01-AK-002 using a validated 
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay with a lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) of 0.1 ng/mL.  Pharmacokinetic results showed that following 3 or 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 22 of 71 
 
 5 consecutive days of treatment with KX2-391 Ointment 1%, low systemic exposure 
(< 2 ng/mL) and limited drug accumulation were observed. 
Details of both studies are available in the KX2-391 Ointment Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratosis represents the initial intra-epidermal manifestation of abnormal 
keratinocyte proliferation having the potential to progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  
Squamous cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of skin cancer deaths in the US, with 
up to 65% of SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses.1,2  The risk of progression has 
been determined to be between 0.025% and 16% per year,1,3 and the calculated lifetime risk 
of malignant transformation for a patient with AK lesions followed up for 10 years is 
between 6.1% and 10.2%.4  The rationale behind treating every AK lesion is based on the 
difficulty in predicting which single AK lesion will progress to SCC.5,6  The goal of 
treatment is to completely eliminate AK lesions, thereby minimizing their risk of progression 
to invasive SCC, and reducing the potential to  metastasize and cause death, while obtaining 
the best cosmetic outcomes. 
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits 
Preliminary results of studies KX01-AK-01-US and KX01-AK-002 indicate that KX2-391 
Ointment 1% administered once daily for up to 5 days demonstrates clinically relevant activity in the treatment of AK lesions on both the face and scalp, as well as on the dorsal forearm.  Data from KX01-AK-002 suggest that the 5-day regimen of KX2-391 Ointment 1% has greater activity (43%) than the 3-day regimen (32%). 
Preliminary safety results from both studies showed that KX2-391 Ointment 1% is safe and 
well tolerated.  Even though LSRs (primarily erythema and/or flaking/scaling) were reported by the majority of treated subjects, they were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly transient.  The treatment-related TEAEs that subjects experienced mainly consisted of mild application site reactions such as itching, burning, stinging, tenderness, and pain.  No subjects discontinued treatment due to AEs and no treatment-related SAEs were reported.  Based on these findings, the clinical benefit of treating actinic keratosis, a precancerous 
condition, with a short course of topical KX2-391 outweighs the risk of transient LSRs observed. 
At systemic KX2-391 concentrations that were significantly higher than those observed 
following topical administration in humans, KX2-391 was associated with testicular toxicity in multiple-dose nonclinical toxicity studies in animals.  As a precaution, male subjects must agree to practice medically acceptable contraception during study participation and for at least 90 days after stopping treatment.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized, parallel group, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically on the face or scalp of adult subjects with AK. 
Enrollment will be controlled so that approxima tely two thirds of subjects enrolled will be 
treated on the face and approximately one third of subjects enrolled will be treated on the scalp.  A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 300 subjects.  At each site, a minimum of 10 subjects and a maximum of 20 subjects are projected to be enrolled. 
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, a Response Assessment Period, and a 
Recurrence Follow-up Period.  After a Screening Period of up to 28 days, subjects will return to the site for confirmation of eligibility.  Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 to 
treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 Ointment 1% or vehicle) ratio in each treatment area subgroup. 
The treatment area will be marked with indelible marker at Baseline (Day 1 predose) at the 
investigational site.  Subjects will be give n verbal and written instructions on self-
administration of study drug/vehicle and a study kit containing 5 daily single-dose packets, one for each day of treatment.  The first dose will be applied by the subject under the supervision of study site personnel.  Subjects will then take home the study kit containing the remaining single-dose packets of study drug for daily self-administration on the next 4 consecutive days. 
Subjects will return to the clinical sites for assessments at the Response Assessment Visits at 
Days 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57. 
All subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper- pigmentation, scarring in the 
treatment area, or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 will return for additional follow-up, which includes standardized photography of the treatme nt area, every 7 to 28 days until resolution, 
returned to baseline, or deemed stabilized by the Investigators. 
Subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 will 
continue in the Recurrence Follow-up Period to determine recurrence rate and safety for up to 12 months following the Day 57 Visit.  Visits during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will occur every 3 months.  Subjects who develop AK lesions in the treatment area during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be discontinued at the time of recurrence.

4.2 Screening Period 
Screening (Visit 1) will occur between Day –28 and Day –1.  Subject eligibility will be 
established during the Screening Period.   
Details of screening procedures/assessments are provided in Section 7.1 . 
4.3 Treatment Period 
The Treatment Period will be Days 1 to 5.  Protocol eligibility will be confirmed at Baseline 
(Day 1 predose). 
All screening and baseline assessments should be evaluated for acceptability prior to 
randomization of the subject.  Eligible subjects will be randomized separately for face and scalp to treatment in a 1:1 ratio of KX2-391 Ointment 1% or vehicle (see Section 6.3 ). 
Baseline and Treatment Period procedures and a ssessments, and timing thereof, are shown in 
Table 1 ; details are provided in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 , respectively.

FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 26 of 71 
 
 4.4 Response Assessment Period 
Subjects will return to the clinical sites for Response Assessment Visits postdose on Day 5 
(Visit 3) and on Days 8, 15, 29, and 57 (Visits 4 through 7).  Procedures and assessments and timing thereof during the Response Assessment Period are shown in  Table 1 and the details 
are provided in Section 7.3 . 
All subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper-pigmentation, scarring in the 
treatment area, or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 will return for additional follow-up, which includes standardized photography of the treatme nt area, every 7 to 28 days until resolution, 
returned to baseline, or deemed stabilized by the Investigators. 
4.5 Recurrence Follow-up Period 
Subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 will be eligible to continue in the Recurrence Follow- up Period to determine AK recurrence rates 
and evaluate concomitant medications and AEs in the treatment area for up to 12 months post-Day 57. 
Procedures and assessments and timing thereof during the Recurrence Follow-up Period are 
shown in Table 1 and the details are provided in Section 7.5 .  Subjects who develop AK 
lesions in the treatment area during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be discontinued at the time of recurrence.
 
4.6 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Dosing and 
Control Groups 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group, efficacy 
and safety study of KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically on the face or scalp of adult subjects with AK for 5 consecutive days.   
The dosing regimen for this study is based on the Phase 2a study (KX01-AK-002).  
KX01-AK-002 is an open-label, sequential group, non-randomized, multi-center study that evaluated the dosing regimen of daily dosing for either 3 or 5 consecutive days of KX2-391 Ointment 1% on a treatment area of 25 cm
2 on the face or scalp that contained 4 to 8 AK 
lesions in 168 adults (84 subjects per cohort).  Preliminary analyses showed that a higher percentage of subjects achieved complete clearance of AK on Day 57 for the 5-day treatment group (43%) than the 3-day treatment group (32%).  For both the 5-day and 3-day treatment groups, KX2-391 Ointment 1% was found to be safe, well tolerated and minimally absorbed throughout treatment and follow up for both cohorts.  Thus, these data support the evaluation of KX2-391 Ointment 1% once daily topical application for a 5-consecutive day dosing regimen for the treatment of adults with AK on the face or scalp in this Phase 3 double-blind, vehicle-controlled study.  The 12-month Recurrence Follow-up Period allows for long-term evaluation of AK recurrence rates and safety.

6.1.2 Storage Conditions 
Study drug will be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. 
6.2 Dosage and Administration of Study Drugs 
6.2.1 Administration of Study Drugs 
At Baseline (Day 1 predose), subjects will receive verbal and written instructions on how to 
apply the topical medication and how to care for the treatment area ( Appendix 1 ). 
The study medication is for external topical use on the treatment area.  The treatment area 
will be marked with indelible marker at Baseline (Day 1 predose) at the investigational site (see Section 7.2.3 ).  Subjects will be provided with a study kit comprised of individual plastic 
bags with 5 single-dose packets containing either KX2-391 Ointment 1% or vehicle ointment and a dosing log. 
The first dose will be administered by the subject under the supervision of study personnel on 
Day 1 at the site.  Subjects will self-administer the remaining single-dose packets once daily at home for the next 4 consecutive days.  Study medication should be applied each day at approximately the same time.  It is preferable that study drug application is done early in the day.  The treatment area should not be touched or wet for approximately 12 hours after application. 
See Appendix 1 for subject instructions for study drug application.  It is imperative that 
subjects wash hands immediately  with water and soap after applying the ointment.  The 
subject instructions also contain additional details including precautions associated with ointment application during the 5 days of treatment and throughout the study.   
6.2.1.1 Instructions in the Event of Ocular Exposure 
Subjects will be instructed to avoid getting ointment in their eyes.  If ointment does get in the eyes, the subject is to flush their eyes with water immediately and extensively.  The subject must immediately contact the Investigator who will provide further instructions and will refer

 the subject to an ophthalmologist.  The ophthalmologist’s assessment will be included in the 
report of ocular exposure as an event of special interest (see Section 8.2.3 ). 
6.2.2 Criteria for Interruption of Treatment/Dose Adjustments 
Not applicable; dose adjustment is not allowed. 
6.3 Randomization/Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
Groups 
Enrollment will be controlled so that approxima tely two thirds of subjects enrolled will be 
treated on the face and approximately one third of subjects enrolled will be treated on the scalp.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 Ointment 1% or vehicle) ratio in each treatment area subgroup. 
Subjects will be assigned to treatments in a double-blinded manner based on a computer-
generated randomization scheme.  Based on the randomization scheme, 2 lists of enrollment numbers will be issued to each site; one list will be for subjects with the treatment area on the face and the other list will be for subjects with the treatment area on the scalp.  Study kits bearing corresponding enrollment numbers will be provided to the site.  One set of kits will be provided for subjects with the treatment area on the face and the second set of kits will be provided for subjects with the treatment area on the scalp. 
Enrollment numbers and study kits are distributed sequentially.  The first eligible subject 
with AK lesion on the face will be assigned th e first enrollment number for treatment of the 
face and given a study kit bearing the same enrollment number on Day 1 of treatment.  The next eligible subject with AK lesions on the face will receive the next enrollment number and corresponding study kit in a sequential order. 
The same procedure will occur for subjects with the treatment area on the scalp.  On Day 1, 
the first eligible subject with AK lesions on the scalp will be assigned the first enrollment 
number for treatment on the scalp and given a study kit bearing the same enrollment number.  The next eligible subject with AK lesions on the scalp will receive the next enrollment number and corresponding study kit in a sequential order. 
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details of procedures of study kit dispensing and 
documentation. 
6.3.1 Blinding  
The Sponsor, contract research organizations (CROs) involved in the clinical conduct of the 
study, the Investigators, study site personne l and study subjects will be blinded to the 
treatment that is assigned to each subject.  The integrity of this clinical study must be maintained by observing the treatment blind.  See Section 8.2.5 for breaking the blind.

 6.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications / Therapy 
6.4.1 Prior Medications / Therapy 
All medications (prescription and nonprescription including vitamins and dietary 
supplements), treatments, and procedures taken 28 days before Day 1 are considered prior therapy and will be recorded in the eCRF.  An AK treatment history of the face or scalp will be recorded on the AK Treatment History eCRF (see Section 7.1.4 ). 
6.4.2 Concomitant Medications/Therapy 
Concomitant medication/therapies are any new or  existing therapy received by the subject 
after signing the ICF through the final subject contact in the study.  Concomitant 
medication/therapies will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Use of sunblock from Day 15 onward or any topical products for treatment of LSRs in the 
treatment area allowed by the Investigator will be recorded in the Concomitant Medication eCRF up to Day 57. 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, sunblock and non-medicated topical products can 
be used in the treatment area.  During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, only concomitant medications/therapies for the treatment of AEs in the treatment area and those that may affect the assessment of AK lesion recurrence in the treatment area will be entered in the eCRF. 
6.4.3 Prohibited Medication/Therapy  
Use of any treatment for AK lesions other than study drug on the treatment area is prohibited 
during the study.  Subjects will be reminded that AK lesions located outside the treatment area may be treated by lesion-directed treatment only, eg, cryotherapy or biopsy. 
Prohibited medications are as follows: Prohibited drug products and treatments that might influence or mask the effects of treatment 
until Day 57 include:  immunomodulators or immunosuppressive therapies, cytotoxic drugs, interferon/interferon inducers, topical or systemic steroids, 5-FU, ingenol mebutate, imiquimod, diclofenac, topical or systemic retinoids, topical salicylic acid, bichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, acid-containing therapeutic products, benzoyl peroxide, chemodestruction, medicated/therapeutic topical salves, photodynamic therapy, psoralen plus UVA or UVB therapy, artificial tanner, excessive or prolonged exposure to UV light source.
9 
Subjects are prohibited from applying any topical products, including but not limited to, 
lotions, creams, and ointments, moisturizers, sunscreen, artificial tanners, or make-up to the treatment area up until the end of Day 57 (Visit 7), except when those medications are prescribed by the Investigator for the management of LSRs.  Subjects should avoid direct sun or UV exposure to the treatment area throughout the study.  However, from Day 15 onward, if a subject is unable to avoid direct sun or UV exposure to the treatment area, the Investigator may allow the use of sunblock only. 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 34 of 71 
 
 Subjects have unrestricted use of nonmedicated topical products on areas outside of the 
treatment area during the study. 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, use of treatments that may interfere with the 
assessment of AK recurrence in the treatment area are prohibited. This includes use of AK treatment and medicated topical products in the treatment area and use of systemic therapies (eg, immunosuppressive agents and systemic AK treatment) that may interfere with the assessment of AK recurrence. 
Any subjects who start systemic or topical therapies for the treatment of AK will be 
withdrawn from the study. 
The decision to administer a prohibited medication/treatment is done with the safety of the 
study subject as the primary consideration. 
6.4.4 Other Prohibitions and Restrictions during Study 
There are no restrictions during the study on smoking/tobacco use, diet, alcohol/caffeine, 
water or other beverages, or physical activity. 
After self-application, subjects will avoid touching or wetting the treatment area for 
approximately 12 hours.  When washing the treatment area, wash it gently with a mild, non-abrasive, non-medicated soap or shampoo.  
The treatment area should not be occluded with bandages, band aids, tight-fitting scarfs or 
caps.  The treatment area should not be exposed to excessive sunlight or UV light.  See Appendix 1 for all prohibited activity. 
6.5 Drug Accountability and Treatment Compliance 
6.5.1 Drug Supplies and Accountability 
Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) and stored 
according to the conditions specified on the drug labels. 
The Investigator and study staff will be responsible for the accountability of all clinical 
supplies (eg, shipment, dispensing, inventory, and record keeping) following the Sponsor’s instructions.  In this matter, the Investigator and study staff must adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, as well as local or regional requirements. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator allow the study drugs to be used other than as 
directed by this protocol.  Clinical supplie s will be dispensed only by an appropriately

to the clinical site on Day 5 (Visit 3) postdose, to check compliance. 
The dosing logs for each subject will be kept during the study.  The CRAs will review 
treatment compliance during monitoring site visits. 
7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS 
7.1 Screening Assessments 
All screening assessments will be performed after the subject provides informed consent (Table 1 ).  Screening (Visit 1) will occur between Day -28 and Day -1. 
Subject screening numbers w ill be assigned at Visit 1. 
The eCRF must be completed to indicate whether the subject is eligible to participate in the 
study and to provide reasons for screen failure, if applicable. 
7.1.1 Informed Consent 
Informed consent will be obtained after the st udy has been fully explained to each subject 
and before the conduct of any screening procedures or assessments.  Documentation will be 
required (documented in the clinic notation) to confirm that the Investigator ensured that the 
informed consent process was done correctly, the subject understood what to expect, and agreed to participate. 
Procedures to be followed when obtaining informed consent are detailed in Section 10.3.2 .

supplements), treatments, and therapies taken 28 days before Day 1 will be recorded at Screening. 
7.1.6 Fitzpatrick Skin-Type Classification 
The Fitzpatrick Skin-Type is a skin classification system
8 which measures 2 components 
(genetic disposition and reaction to sun exposure).  Skin-types range from very fair (Type I) to very dark (Type VI).  Subjects’ skin will be typed using this classification system at Screening. 
7.1.7 Expanded Dermatological Examination 
An expanded dermatological examination to cover sun-exposed areas where photo-damage is 
likely will be conducted at Screening only. 
7.1.8 Treatment Area Identification and AK Lesion Count Examination 
At the Screening visit, a dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will identify a 
contiguous treatment area affected with AK on the face or scalp for each subject that measures 25 cm
2 and contains 4 to 8 AK lesions that are clinically typical, visible, and 
discrete.  A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of AK lesions (lesion count) for all subjects.

 7.1.9 Physical Examinations  
A complete PE will be performed at Screening and will include weight and an assessment of 
the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.  Height will be measured at Screening only.  An expanded dermatological examination will be conducted at Screening only ( Section 7.1.7 ).  
The complete PE will be part of the baseline assessments. 
7.1.10 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be recorded at Screening.  Vital sign (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature) measurements will be taken after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes.  Serial vital signs may be obtained to confirm accurate readings. 
7.1.11 Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiogram training, equipment, and a procedural manual will be provided to the site 
by the central ECG vendor.  The ECG vendor and the Sponsor will ensure that the study site ECG operator is properly trained prior to start of study. 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be obtained at Screening.  Subjects must be in the recumbent 
position for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG.  Screening ECGs must be reviewed prior to the subject being randomized. 
ECGs will be transferred electronically to the central ECG vendor. 
7.1.12 Laboratory Measurements 
Samples for clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis) will be collected 
at Screening.  Clinical laboratory testing will be part of the baseline assessments.  See Section 7.3.4.9  for further details about laboratory tests. 
7.1.13 Pregnancy Testing 
In females of childbearing potential, a serum pr egnancy test will be obtained at Screening.  
Test results must be reviewed before randomization of subjects. 
7.2 Baseline Assessments 
All baseline assessments should be completed by Day 1 (Visit 2) prior to randomization, according to the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
7.2.1 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 38 of 71 
 
 7.2.2 Prior Medications 
All prior medications (prescription and nonprescription including vitamins and dietary 
supplements), treatments, and therapies will be confirmed at Baseline. 
7.2.3 Treatment Area Identification 
At Baseline (Day 1 predose), the Investigator will confirm the 25 cm2 treatment area affected 
with 4 to 8 AK lesions on the face or scalp that was identified at Screening. 
At Baseline (Day 1 predose), the location and shape of the treatment area and the specific 
AK lesions will be recorded on an acetate transparency sheet gridded with 1 cm2 squares.  
The Investigator or Subinvestigator will identify the treatment area by:  
1. Placing the transparency sheet over the treatment area 
2. With a fine-tip indelible marker: 
x Mark at least 3 anatomical landmarks in the vicinity of the treatment area on the 
transparency sheet.  Examples of landmarks could be bony prominences, scars, moles, seborrheic keratosis, and veins. 
x Mark the outline of the treatment area on the transparency sheet. 
x Mark the location of each of the AK lesions inside the treatment area on the 
transparency sheet. 
3. On the subject’s skin, outline the treatment area with dots and dashes with the 
indelible marker. 
The transparency sheet will be kept at the site and will be used to locate the treatment area 
and AK lesions during the follow-up visits. 
7.2.4 Actinic Keratosis Lesion Count 
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK 
lesions (lesion count) for all subjects at Baseline (Day 1 predose).  The same Investigator or Subinvestigator will conduct the lesion count at all visits for an individual subject. 
For this assessment, an AK lesion should be counted only if it is completely inside the 
treatment area. 
7.2.5 Focused Dermatological Exam of Treatment Area 
At Baseline (Day 1 predose), the focused dermatological exam of treatment area will include 
evaluation for LSRs, hypo- or hyper-pigmentation, and scarring (see below).  These assessments will be used as baseline assessments. 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 39 of 71 
 
 7.2.5.1 Local Skin Reactions 
At Baseline (Day 1 predose), after the assessment of AEs, the Investigator or Subinvestigator 
will assess for LSRs on the treatment area.  The same Investigator or Subinvestigator will 
conduct the LSR assessment at all visits for an individual subject. 
LSR signs on the treatment area include the following:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, 
swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.  These signs will be assessed using a 4-point grading scale; 0=absent, 1=mild (slightly, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense).  
Application site reactions not classified as  LSRs (eg, itching, burning, stinging, tenderness, 
pain) will be reported as AEs. 
LSRs will be reported separately from AEs. 
7.2.5.2 Pigmentation and Scarring 
At the time of LSR assessment, hypo- and hyper-pigmentation and scarring on the treatment 
area will be assessed by the Investigator or Subinvestigator as being present or absent. 
Pigmentation and scarring will be assessed at Ba seline (Day 1 predose), after the assessment 
of adverse events.  The same Investigator or Subinvestigator will assess pigmentation and 
scarring at all visits for an individual subject. 
7.2.6 Standardized Photography 
At Baseline (Day 1 predose), the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain 
standardized photography of each subject’s treatment area before application of study medication. 
Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning relative to 
the camera and camera settings are used for each photograph.  Equipment, supplies and detailed instructions for obta ining and managing the photogr aphs will be provided to the 
investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment. 
The photographs are to document the appearance of the subjects’ treatment area and to assist 
with the identification and confirmation of the location of the treatment area throughout the 
study. 
7.2.7 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be measured at Baseline (Day 1 predose).  See Section 7.1.10 for details. 
7.2.8 Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead ECG will be obtained at Baseline (Day 1 predose).  See Section 7.1.11 for details.

 7.2.9 Pregnancy Testing 
In females of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at the site at 
Baseline (Day 1 predose).  Test results must be reviewed before randomization on Day 1. 
7.2.10 Randomization 
After screening and baseline assessments confirm a subject’s eligibility to participate in the 
study, he/she will be assigned the next enrollment number appropriate for the area being treated (see Section 6.3 ). 
7.2.11 Instructions for Self-administration of Study Treatment, Dispensing, and 
Return of Study Treatment 
At Baseline (Day 1 predose), subjects will receive both verbal and written instructions 
(Appendix 1 ) for daily self-administration of stud y treatment.  Any questions will be 
answered by the clinic staff. 
Randomized subjects will be assigned an enrollment number and a study kit with the same 
enrollment number.  The study kit will have 5 single-dose packets (1 for each day of treatment) containing either KX2-391 Ointment 1% or vehicle ointment (see Section 6.1.1 ).  
The study kit will include a dosing log where the subjects will record the date and time of study drug self-administration. 
Subjects will be instructed to place the used p ackets (including torn pieces) into the plastic 
bags in which they came, seal the plastic bags, put them back into the study kit, and return 
the study kit containing used and unused packets and the dosing log to the clinical site after self-administration on Day 5 to check compliance ( Section 6.5.2 ). 
7.3 Treatment Period and Response Assessment Period 
7.3.1 Treatment Administration – Days 1-5 
After baseline assessments are completed on Day 1, the first dose of study treatment will be 
applied by the subject under the supervision of st udy site personnel.  Subjects will then take 
home the study kit containing the remaining single-dose packets of study drug for daily self-administration on the next 4 consecutive days. 
7.3.2 Efficacy Assessments 
7.3.2.1 Actinic Keratosis Lesion Count 
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK 
lesions (lesion count) for all subjects at the Response Assessment Visits on Days 8, 15, 29, and 57 (Table 1 ).  The same Investigator or Subinvestigator will conduct the lesion count at all 
visits for an individual subject. 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 41 of 71 
 
 The Investigator or Subinvestigator may use the transparency and/or photograph from Baseline 
to locate the treatment area.  AK lesion counts from previous visits should not be used to assist in the assessment of AK lesion count at the current visit.  Only AK lesions completely within the treatment area will be counted. 
7.3.3 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other 
Biomarker Assessments 
Not applicable 
7.3.4 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will include the monitoring and recording all AEs, SAEs, LSRs, and 
events of special interest. 
At each study visit, subjects will be asked a general question “How have you been since the 
last visit?”.  Adverse events will be recorded at each study visit, before assessment of LSRs, 
pigmentation, and scarring in the treatment area.  Adverse events will be reported separately from LSRs. 
Safety assessments will also include vital signs, the performance of PEs, ECGs, laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalyses, as detailed in the sections below. 
7.3.4.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed periodically through Day 57 ( Table 1 ). 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drugs are KX2-391 Ointment 1% and vehicle ointment. 
The criteria for identifying AEs in this study are: 
x Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product  
x Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease 
x Any deterioration in non-protocol-required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation of study drug 
x Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline) 
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the final subject contact in the study.  Subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper-pigmentation, scarring in the treatment 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 42 of 71 
 
 area, or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 will return for additional follow-up every 
7 to 28 days until resolution, returned to baseline, or deemed stabilized by the Investigators. 
Subjects who fail screening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) recorded in the AE 
eCRF and screen failure reported on the eCRF. 
Subjects with onset of a study treatment-related AEs will be followed until resolution, under 
medical care, or deemed stabilized by the Investigator.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory test result should be considered as a TEAE if the 
identified laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention whether prescribed in the 
protocol or not. 
An abnormal laboratory result should be considered by the Investigator to be an AE if it: 
x Results in the withdrawal of study drug 
x Results in an intervention, based on medical evaluation (eg, potassium supplement for 
hypokalemia) 
x Results in any out-of-range laboratory value that in the Investigator’s judgment fulfills 
the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject’s medical profile 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all laboratory findings in  all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Electrocardiogram Changes 
Any changes from the baseline ECG will be evaluated for clinical significance.  ECG 
changes that are determined to be clinically significant, regardless of relationship, will be 
reported as an AE. 
For symptomatic ECG abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the study site must submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor or designee, using the SAE reporting procedures ( Section 8.1 ). 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 43 of 71 
 
 7.3.4.1.1 A SSESSING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Every effort must be made by the Investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity. 
Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in 
detail indicated on the eCRF.  The definitions are as follows: 
Mild Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity Moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity Severe  Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity The criteria for assessing severity are different than those used for seriousness (see 
Section 7.3.4.2 for the definition of an SAE). 
7.3.4.1.2 A SSESSING RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY TREATMENT  
Every effort must be made by the Investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
relationship to the study treatment. 
Items to be considered when assessing the rela tionship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
x Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment  
x The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
x Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments  
x The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event  
x The presence of non-treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event.  
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administration, and which cannot be explained by concurrent or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions 
Probably Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions  
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 44 of 71 
 
 Possibly Related:   A clinical event, including laborator y test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by concurrent or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions 
Not Related:   The AE is clearly not related to inves tigational product and is clearly related to 
underlying disease, environmental or toxic factor(s), or other drug therapy. 
7.3.4.2 Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be assessed during the Treatment and Response Assessment Periods, on Days 1, 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57 ( Table 1 ). 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization. 
7.3.4.3 Events of Special Interest 
All events of special interest will be assessed during the Treatment and Response Assessment 
Periods, on Days 1, 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57 ( Table 1 ). 
In addition to the AEs and SAEs described above, events of special interest are to be 
captured and reported in the appropriate eCRF and Events of Special Interest Forms (see Section 8.2 ).  Events of special interest will be considered as SAEs if they meet the criteria 
for an SAE ( Section 7.3.4.2) . 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 45 of 71 
 
 Events of special interest during the Treatment and Response Assessment Periods (Days 1 to 
57) are as follows: 
x Overdose of study medication  
x Pregnancy  
x Ocular exposures to study medication 
x Skin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and me lanoma); location and treatment will be 
reported.  
7.3.4.4 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be  assessed during the Treatment and Response Assessment 
Periods, on Days 1, 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57 ( Table 1 ).  Any medication (including 
nonprescription medications) or therapy administ ered to the subject during the course of the 
study (starting at the date of informed consent) will be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF up to Day 57.  The Investigator will record any AE on the Adverse Event eCRF for which the concomitant medication/therapy was administered. 
Use of sunblock from Day 15 onward or any topical products for the treatment of LSRs in 
the treatment area allowed by the Investigator will be recorded in the Concomitant Medication eCRF up to Day 57. 
7.3.4.5 Focused Dermatological Exam of Treatment Area and Standard Photography 
The focused dermatological exam of the treatment area includes evaluation of LSRs, pigmentation, and scarring (see Section 7.3.4.5.1 and Section 7.3.4.5.2 , respectively). 
Standardized photography will be performed at the Response Assessment Visits (Days 5, 8, 
15, 29, and 57) and at additional follow-up visits after Day 57 for subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper- pigmentation, or scarring in the treatment area ( Table 1 ).  
See Section 7.2.6 for details. 
7.3.4.5.1 L OCAL SKIN REACTIONS  
After the assessment of AEs at the Response Assessment Visits (Days 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57) 
(Table 1 ), the Investigator or Subinvestigator will assess for LSRs in the treatment area.  See 
Section 7.2.5.1 for details.  The same Investigator or Subinvestigator will conduct the LSR 
assessment at all visits for an individual subject. 
All application site reactions and LSRs will be  followed to resolution, or if resolution is 
unlikely, to stabilization. 
Treatment for any LSR will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
Interruption/discontinuation of study treatment for an LSR will be recorded on the eCRF.

 7.3.4.5.2 P IGMENTATION AND SCARRING  
Hypo- and hyper-pigmentation a nd scarring in the treatment area will be assessed at the 
Response Assessment Visits (Days 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57) ( Table 1 ).  See Section 7.2.5.2 for 
details.  The same Investigator or Subinvesti gator will assess pigmenta tion and scarring at all 
visits for an individual subject. 
7.3.4.6 Physical Examinations  
A complete PE will be performed on Day 57 ( Table 1 ) and will include weight and an 
assessment of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), integumentary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.  Height will be measured at Screening only. 
Documentation of the PE will be included in the source documentation at the site(s).  
Changes from screening PE to findings at the last visit that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
7.3.4.7 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will also be recorded at the Response Assessment Visits on Days 5 and 57 (Table 1 ).  Vital sign (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and 
body temperature) measurements will be taken after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes.  Serial vital signs may be obtained to confirm accurate readings. 
Clinically significant abnormal vital signs, as assessed by the Investigator, will be reported as 
adverse events. 
7.3.4.8 Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiograms will be obtained at the Response Assessment Visits on Days 5 and 15 (Table 1 ).  See Section 7.1.11 for details. 
Any ECG abnormality that the Investigator considers as an AE should be recorded as such on 
the Adverse Event eCRF. 
7.3.4.9 Laboratory Measurements 
Blood will be collected for clinical laboratory tests at Response Assessment Visits on Days 8 and 15 ( Table 1 ).  Collection of blood and urine (including samples for pregnancy 
testing, where applicable) will be conducted at the clinic site.  Approximately 8 mL of blood will be collected for clinical laboratory testing, including pregnancy testing, when required, for a total of 24 mL of blood per subject durin g the study.  All samples will be sent to a 
central laboratory for testing.

Pregnancy Testing serum pregnancy test or urine pregnancy test (see  Table 1 ) 
 
A laboratory abnormality may meet the criteria to qualify as an AE as described in this 
protocol (see Section 7.3.4. 1).  In these instances, the AE corresponding to the laboratory 
abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
For laboratory abnormalities meeting the criteria of SAEs (see Section 7.3.4.2 ), the site must 
report the SAE, including the laboratory report (as regionally required), to the Sponsor using the SAE form (see Section 8.1 ). 
7.3.5 Pregnancy Testing 
For women of childbearing potential, a serum pre gnancy test will be obtained at the Response 
Assessment Visit on Day 8 and a urine pregna ncy test will be performed on Day 57/early 
termination at the clinical site ( Table 1 ).  Serum samples will be sent to a central laboratory 
for testing. 
7.4 Additional Follow-up Assessments 
All subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper-pigmentation, scarring in the treatment area, or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 will return for additional follow-up, which includes standardized photography of the treatment area, every 7 to 28 days until resolution, returned to baseline, or deemed stabilized by the Investigators.

 7.5 Recurrence Follow-up Period Assessments 
7.5.1 Recurrence Assessments 
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK 
lesions (lesion count) for subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 during the Recurrence Follow-up Period at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits (Table 1 ).  The Investigator or Subinvestigator performing the lesion count should be the 
same Investigator or Subinvestigator who evaluated the subject previously during the study. 
An AK lesion should be counted if it is within  the treatment area.  All AK lesions within the 
treatment area must be counted and recorded in the eCRF as an AK recurrence. 
When AK lesions are identified in the treatment area, the transparency which was used to 
map the AK lesions at Baseline should be used to determine if the lesion(s) is new (ie, one 
which was not identified in the target treatm ent area at Baseline and emergent during the 
Recurrence Follow-up Period) or recurred (ie, one which is at the same AK lesion location identified at Baseline and resolved at Day 57). 
For subjects who have complete response at Day 57 and no recurrence, 12 months 
post-Day 57 is the Final Visit.  Subjects who have AK recurrence in the treatment area will have their Final Visit at the visit when the AK recurrence is identified.  Subjects who develop AK lesions in the treatment area during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be discontinued at the time of recurrence. 
7.5.2 Safety Assessments 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, safety assessments will include the monitoring and 
recording of AEs and SAEs within the treatment area at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits (Table 1 ).  See Section 7.3.4.1 for further information on the assessments of AEs.   
Concomitant medications/therapies given for AEs within the treatment area and any 
concomitant medications/therapies given that may affect assessment of AK lesions recurrence in the treatment area will be assessed during the Recurrence Follow-up Period at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded on the Concomitant 
Medication eCRF.  The Investigator will record any AE within the treatment area on the Adverse Event eCRF for which the concomitant medication/therapy was administered. 
Events of special interest during the Recurrence Follow-up Period include skin cancers 
(including BCC, SCC, melanoma) within the treat ment area and pregnancy.  Information on 
skin cancers will be collected during the Recurrence Follow-up Period at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits and reported as an event of special interest and as an AE in the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 8.2.4 ).

 7.6 Appropriateness of Measurements 
All clinical assessments are standard measurements commonly used in studies of adults with 
AK. 
The safety assessments to be performed in this study, including hematology analyses, blood 
chemistry tests, urinalysis, vital signs, PEs, ECGs, and assessment of AEs, are standard evaluations to ensure subject safety.  The tests used to evaluate AK lesions including AK lesion counting, LSR grading, application site AEs, and evaluation of pigmentation and scarring in the treatment area are standard. 
8 EXPEDITED REPORTING 
Serious adverse events and events of special interest (overdose of study medication, pregnancy, ocular exposure to study medica tion, and skin cancers [including BCC, SCC, and 
melanoma]) are to be reported to the Sponsor within 1 business day of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  Specific forms for reporting each type of event will be 
provided to the sites. 
The Sponsor (or its designee) must inform Investigators and regulatory authorities of 
reportable events, in compliance with applicab le regulatory requirements, on an expedited 
basis (ie, within specific timeframes).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE and events of special interest information in the manner described below. 
In determining what SAEs meet criteria for expedited reporting, the current version of the 
KX2-391 Ointment Investigator’s Brochure will be used as the reference safety information for KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
8.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, must be reported on a completed SAE form by electronic transmission as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the Invest igator becomes aware of the event. 
Detailed contact information and SAE reporting requirements will be provided in the 
Investigator File . 
During Screening, Treatment and Response Assessment Periods, all SAEs must be reported 
beginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF, up to 30 days following the last contact or Day 57, whichever is shorter.  All SAEs will be reported regardless of causality. 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, only SAEs within the treatment area will be 
reported.  SAEs within the treatment area will be reported regardless of causality.  Once recurrence of AK lesions occurs in the treatment area, and the subject is discontinued from the Recurrence Follow-up Period, SAEs will no longer be collected.  
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 50 of 71 
 
 Any SAE event judged by the Investigator to be related (definitely, probably, or possibly 
related) to study treatment should be reported to the Sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed since study completion.  
Deaths and life-threatening events should be reported immediately by telephone.  The 
initial report must be submitted within 1 business day by electronically transmitting the completed SAE form.  
It is very important that the SAE Report Form be filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report.  This includes the Investigator’s assessment of causality.  All supporting documents should be sent de-identified and should contain the subject’s assigned enrollment number.  Only supporting documents directly related to the event should be sent. 
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded as soon as possible.  If the 
follow-up information changes the Investigator’s assessment of causality, this should also be noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including redacted copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents requested by the Sponsor. 
8.2 Reporting of Events of Special Interest 
8.2.1 Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy, whether occurring in a subject or in the female partner of a male subject, 
must be reported.  Pregnancies in female subjects for which the estimated date of conception 
was prior to Day 57 must be reported; pregnancies in female partners of male subjects for 
which the estimated date of conception was within 90 days of the last study treatment must 
be reported. 
The Pregnancy Report Form must be used for reporting.  Pregnancies must be reported by 
electronic transmission as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the 
Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy.  The contact information for the reporting of 
pregnancies is provided in the Investigator File. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment. 
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be SAEs and should be reported in the same timeframe and in the 
same format as all other SAEs (see  Section 8.1 ). 
All pregnancies must be followed to outcome.  The outcome of the pregnancy must be 
reported as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the Investigator 
becomes aware of the outcome. 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 51 of 71 
 
 A female subject who becomes pregnant during the Treatment Period must be withdrawn 
from study treatment, but may continue all study assessments and be followed for study outcome.  Male subjects whose female partners become pregnant during the Treatment Period may continue with study treatment and all assessments. 
A pregnant female subject should be requested to provide outcome information on any 
pregnancy occurring during the Treatment Period or the Recurrence Follow-up Period whether or not the subject elects to continue with study assessments.  Male subjects whose female partners become pregnant within 90 days of the last study treatment should be requested to provide outcome information on the pregnancy. 
8.2.2 Study Drug Overdose 
Study drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount 
higher than the dose being studied or for a duration longer than specified in the protocol. 
The Overdose Report Form must be used for reporting.  The overdose must be reported by 
electronic transmission as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the event.  The contact information for the reporting of 
overdose is provided in the Investigator File.   
Any study drug overdose during the study must be noted on the eCRF. All AEs associated with overdose should be captured on the Overdose Report Form and the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  If the overdose is associated with an SAE, an SAE Report Form 
should be completed and sent along with the Overdose Form. 
8.2.3 Ocular Exposure 
Ocular exposure to study medication will be reported as an event of special interest. 
The Ocular Exposure Report Form must be used for reporting.  The ocular exposure must be 
reported by electronic transmission as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the event.  The results of an ophthalmologist’s assessment must be provided as a follow-up on the Ocular Exposure Report Form.  The contact information for the reporting of ocular exposure  is provided in the Investigator File.   
Ocular exposure to study medication must be captured on the appropriate eCRF.  If the 
ocular exposure is associated with an AE, the AE must be captured on the Ocular Exposure Report Form and the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the ocular exposure  is associated with an SAE, 
an SAE Report Form should be completed and sent along with Ocular Exposure Report 
Form. 
8.2.4 Skin Cancer 
During the Treatment and Response Assessment Periods (Days 1 to 57), all skin cancers 
(including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) will be reported as events of special interest.  The 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 52 of 71 
 
 location and treatment will be reported.  Du ring the Recurrence Follow-up Period, skin 
cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) with in the treatment area will be reported as 
events of special interest.  The treatment of the skin cancer will be reported. 
The Skin Cancer Report Form must be used for reporting.  The skin cancer must be reported 
by electronic transmission as soon as possible but no later than 1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the event.  The contact information for the reporting of 
skin cancers  is provided in the Investigator File.  
The skin cancer must be captured on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Any other AEs associated 
with the skin cancer must be captured on the Skin Cancer Report Form and the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the skin cancer  is associated with an SAE, an SAE Report Form should be 
completed and sent along with Skin Cancer Report F orm. 
8.2.5 Breaking the Blind 
The Pharmacovigilance department will mainta in a secure copy of the set of sealed 
envelopes, each containing the subject’s treatment allocation for this study.  The Investigator may request to unblind the treatment assignment of any subject when this is needed for proper medical management of a medical emergency or SAE.  Agreement of the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee should be sought prior to unblinding.  Instructions for requesting unblinding of a subject will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
The Pharmacovigilance department may unblind individual cases when required for safety 
reporting.  The treatment assignment will be included on the MedWatch or CIOMS form for suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) reports provided to health authorities.
 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
All statistical analyses will be performed by the Sponsor or designee after the database is 
locked and released for unblinding.  Database lock, randomization code release, and 
subsequent data analyses will be performed in 2 steps. 
For the first step, after all dosed subjects have completed the Day 57 Visit or discontinued by 
the Day 57 Visit, and after all LSRs, hypo- or hyper- pigmentation, scarring, or treatment-related AEs which occur before or on the Day 57 Visit have resolved, returned to baseline, or 
been deemed stabilized by the Investigators, the data collected before the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be locked and the randomization code will be released to the Sponsor only.  The endpoint analyses, except for the recurrence rate and AEs in the treatment area after Day 57, will be performed. 
For the second step, after the entire study has been completed, the data collected during the 
Recurrence Follow-up Period will be locked and the randomization code will be released to 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 53 of 71 
 
 the study sites as well.  Then, the recurrence rate and AEs in the treatment area after Day 57 
will be analyzed. 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software or other validated statistical 
software as required.  The statistical analyses of the study data are described in this section.  Further details of the statistical analyses will be included in a separate statistical analysis plan 
(SAP), which will be written and signed off prior to unblinding of Day 57 data. 
If not specified, the baseline value of each assessment will be defined as the latest non-
missing value assessed before the first dose of study treatment.

 Safety Population :  all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
Recurrence Follow-up Population: all subjects who achieved complete clearance at 
Day 57, regardless of which treatment they received. 
9.1.3 Subject Disposition 
All subjects will be tabulated as to study di scontinuation and the reasons for discontinuation 
as described in Section 5.3 . 
Discontinuations through Day 57 and during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be 
analyzed separately. 
9.1.4 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized.  For continuous demographic 
variables, results will be presented as n, mean, standard devia tion (SD), median, and 
minimum and maximum values.  For categorical (nominal or ordinal) variables, the number and percentage of subjects will be summarized for each category. 
9.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All investigator terms for medications recorded in the eCRF will be coded using the WHO 
Drug Dictionary. 
Prior medications will be defined as medications/therapies taken 28 days before Day 1. 
Concomitant medications/therapies will be define d as medications/therapies that (1) started 
before the first dose of study drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug or (2) started on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be fu rther coded to the appropriate Anatomical-
Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic classification.  A summary of concomitant medications by drug and drug class w ill be included in the clinical study report 
for this protocol.   
All prior and concomitant medications/therapies will be presented in subject data listings. 
9.1.6 Efficacy Analyses 
9.1.6.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
To achieve statistical significance in the study, the Day 57 complete clearance rate will be 
analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) model controlling for treatment location and treatment group.  Before applying the CMH method, a Breslow-Day test with a significance level of 10% will be used to ex plore heterogeneity of the odds ratios across 
treatment location subgroups. 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 55 of 71 
 
 Further, the Pearson Chi Square (used to power the study) will be applied to demonstrate 
basic agreement with the CMH. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be perf ormed with the ITT population, and will be 
repeated with the PP/Evaluable population to support the primary efficacy analysis results. 
Low enrollment sites will be pooled to analysis sites with approximately 20 subjects in each 
pool. For example, the number of subjects enrolled will be graphically displayed by study site and treatment location (face or scalp) from the smallest number to the largest, with bars depicting treatment response. Then, analysis sites will be defined for approximately every 
20 subjects pooled from the study sites with the lowest enrollment. 
Another CMH test adjusting for treatment group and analysis site will be performed to ensure 
concordance with the primary efficacy endpoint analyses described above. 
To explore heterogeneity of the odds ratios across analysis sites, the Breslow-Day test at a 
significance level of 10% will be applied. A finding of statistical significance in this test will be followed by exploratory analyses to identify outlier study sites. 
The outlier sites will be discussed and an expl oratory analysis excluding the outlier sites may 
be carried out to estimate the impact of site-by-treatment interactions. This process will be documented as an appendix to the final version of the SAP, prior to the first database lock. 
9.1.6.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
Partial clearance rate will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy endpoint (complete clearance rate).  However, to control for multiplicity, partial clearance rate as the key secondary efficacy endpoint will be examined using a step-down gatekeeping testing strategy for the overall type I error rate. In other words, the primary endpoint will serve as a gatekeeper for the key secondary endpoint. The complete clearance rate will be tested initially; if, and only if it is statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level, then the partial clearance rate will be statistically tested at the same significance level. 
Recurrence rates will be estimated based on a Kaplan-Meier method at each nominal post-
Day 57 visit.  Subjects with missing AK assessments in the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered as censored. 
9.1.6.3 Additional AK Lesion Count Analysis 
The number of AK lesions and the change from baseline in lesion count at each visit will be summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) by treatment location (face or scalp) and treatment group for the ITT population. 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-003 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 56 of 71 
 
 9.1.6.4 Missing Data Handling and Sensitivity Analysis 
For the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoint analyses, all missing data caused by 
subject early discontinuation will be imputed with a last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.  
In addition, the following approaches will be used as sensitivity analyses for the primary and 
key secondary efficacy endpoints: 
1. Observed Cases (OC): Those subjects with missing AK lesion counts at Day 57 visit will 
be excluded from the analysis populations (ITT and PP/Evaluable) and then the primary and key secondary endpoint analyses described above will be repeated to show concordance. 
2. Subjects without Day 57 AK lesion counts due to early termination or other reasons will 
be considered as non-responders for complete/partial clearance rate analysis  
3. Multiple Imputation (MI): A multiple imput ation method may be applied to impute 
missing values (only for the primary and key secondary efficacy variables). 
9.1.6.5 Subgroup Analysis 
To indicate concordance with the overall results, the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tabulated and displayed graphically in subgroups such as treatment location IDFHRUVFDOSJHQGHUDJHRU\HDUVEDVHOLQH$.OH VLRQFRXQWRU and 
skin type (Fitzpatrick I/II or III/IV/V/VI).  Outli ers will be clinically explained in the clinical 
study report. 
9.1.7 Safety Analyses 
All subjects in the Safety Analysis Set will be included in the safety analyses. 
Safety data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics (eg, n, mean, 
SD, median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for categorical variables).  Safety variables include evaluation of LSRs, pigmentation and scarring in the treatment area, AEs, SAEs, events of special interest, clinical laboratory data, and other safety assessments (vital signs, PEs, ECGs). 
Safety data collected through Day 57 and during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be 
analyzed separately. 
9.1.7.1 Extent of Exposure 
The actual number of doses for each subject will be summarized by treatment group.

FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 57 of 71 
 
 9.1.7.2 Adverse Events 
For AEs, verbatim terms on the eCRF will be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and system 
organ classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (version 16.0 or higher). 
All AEs, treatment-emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings.  Only 
those AEs that are treatment-emergent will be included in summary tables.   
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
x either those AEs with an onset after the first dose or  
x those pre-existing AEs that worsen after the first dose. 
TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group.  The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as 
the number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by MedDRA SOC and PT and treatment group.  A subject will be counted only once within an SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific SOC and PT.  The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by maximum severity (by highest mild, moderate or severe rating) and by relationshi p to study treatment.  Treatment-related TEAEs 
include those events considered by the Investig ator to be related (definitely, probably, or 
possibly related) to study treatment. 
By-subject listings of all SAEs and events of special interest will be provided.  If any deaths 
occur in the study, a by-subject listing of all AEs leading to death will be provided. 
A subject data listing of all AEs leading to discontinuation from the study will be provided. 
For subjects who have treatment-related AEs at Day 57, all safety endpoints observed during 
any additional follow-up assessments will be listed. 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, TEAEs in the treatment area will be summarized 
separately. 
9.1.7.3 Laboratory Values 
Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each subsequent timepoint by treatment group.  Changes from baseline will also be summarized by treatment group.   
In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal-high at baseline versus low-normal-high at follow-up 
in a 3-by-3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory values from baseline to Day 8 and baseline to Day 15 in each treatment group. 
All laboratory data will be listed by subject.

All ECG data will be listed for each subject.  A by-subject listing of clinically significant 
ECG abnormality data  will be provided. 
9.1.7.7 Physical Examinations 
Physical examination findings will be listed for each subject. 
9.1.7.8 Local Skin Reactions and Pigmentation and Scarring 
LSR, hyper- or hypo-pigmentation and scarring assessment results obtained through Day 57 
will be displayed and summarized by visit and treatment group.  In addition, a composite score, which is defined as the sum of 6 individual LSR scores from the same visit, will be analyzed in the same way. 
All LSR, hyper- or hypo-pigmentation, and sca rring assessment results during any additional 
follow-ups after Day 57 will be presented in the by-subject listings. 
9.1.8 Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary efficacy endpoint for the comparison of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% and vehicle control.  By using a Pearson Chi-square method, a sample size of 100 scalp-treated subjects and 200 face-treated subjects, both of which are with a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio, will give a greater than 90% power to detect a 20% difference (30% for active treatment and 10% for vehicle control) with a two-tailed significant level 0.05.

constituted and functioning in accordance with ICH E6 (GCP), Section 3, and any local regulations.  Any protocol amendment and/or revision to the ICF will receive appropriate approval prior to implementation.  Verification of  unconditional approval of the protocol will 
be transmitted to the Sponsor prior to the shipment of drug supplies to the investigational site.  The Investigators or the Sponsor will submit, depending on local regulations, periodic reports and inform the IRB of any reportable AEs per ICH guidelines and local IRB standards of practice. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB chairman must be sent to the Principal 
Investigator with a copy to the Sponsor before study start and the release of any study drug to the site by the Sponsor or its designee (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  If the IRB decides to suspend or terminate the study, the Investigator will immediately send the notice of study suspension or termination by the IRB to the Sponsor. 
Study progress is to be reported to IRB annually (or as required) by the Investigator or 
Sponsor, depending on local regulatory obligations.  If the Investigator is required to report to the IRB, he/she will forward a copy to the Sp onsor at the time of each periodic report.  The 
Investigator(s) or the Sponsor will submit, depending on local regulations, periodic reports and inform the IRB of any reportable AEs per ICH guidelines and local IRB standards of practice.  Upon completion of the study, the Investigator will provide the IRB with a brief 
report of the outcome of the study, if required. 
At the end of the study, the Sponsor should notify the IRB within 90 days. In the case of early termination/temporary halt of  the study, the Investigator should notify the 
IRB within 15 calendar days, and a detailed written explanation of the reasons for the termination/halt should be given. 
10.3.2 Subject Information and Informed Consent 
As part of administering the informed consent document, the Investigator (or designee) must 
explain to each subject the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved, any potential discomfort, potential alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment available to the subject, and the extent of maintaining confidentiality of the subj ect’s records.  Each subject must be informed 
that participation in the study is voluntary, that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time, and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.

 The informed consent should be given by mean s of a standard written statement, written in 
nontechnical language.  The subject should understand the statement before signing and dating it and will be given a copy of the signed document.  At the Screening Visit, after the ICF and any other written information to be provi ded is read and explained, the subject will 
be asked to sign the ICF before any study-specific procedures are performed.  No subject can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained. 
An approved ICF must be prepared in accordance with ICH E6, and all applicable 
regulations.  Each subject must sign an approved ICF before study participation.  The form must be signed and dated by the appropriate parties.  The original, signed ICF for each subject will be verified by the Sponsor and kept on file according to local procedures at the 
site. 
The subject should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study.  The communication of this information should be documented. 
10.4 Data Handling and Recordkeeping 
10.4.1 Recording of Data 
An eCRF must be completed for each subject by qualified and authorized personnel.  Any 
correction to entries made on the eCRF must have a respective audit trail where the correction is dated, the individual making the correction is identified, the reason for the change is stated, and the original data are not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the study should be collected. 
10.4.2 Identification of Source Data 
All data to be recorded on the eCRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.  
10.4.3 Retention of Records 
The circumstances of completion or termination of the study notwithstanding, the 
Investigator is responsible for retaining all study documents, including but not limited to the protocol, copies of eCRFs, the Investigator's Brochure, and regulatory agency registration documents, ICFs, and IRB correspondence.  In addition, the Sponsor will send a list of treatment codes by study subject to the Investigator after the clinical database for this study has been locked.  The sites should plan to retain study documents, as directed by the Sponsor, for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 3 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. 
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
Investigator retire or relocate, the Investigator  contact the Sponsor, allowing the Sponsor the 
option of permanently retaining the study records.

 10.5 Publication Policy 
The detailed obligations regarding the publication of any data, material results, or other 
information generated or created in relation to the study shall be set out in the agreement between each Investigator and the Sponsor or CRO, as appropriate. 
10.6 Other Administrative Policies 
10.6.1 Changes to the Protocol 
There are to be no changes to the protocol without written approval from the Sponsor.  
Protocols will be followed as written . 
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by the Sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require submission to health or regulat ory authorities as well as additional approval by 
the applicable IRBs.  These requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the Investigator, or by the Sponsor, in the interest of preserving the safety of all subjects included in the study.  If an immediate change to the protocol is felt by the Investigator to be necessary for safety reasons, the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and the IRB for the site(s) must be notified immediately.  The Sponsor must notify the health or regulatory authority as required per local regulations.  A protocol change intended to eliminate an immediate hazard may be implemented immediately, provided the health or regulatory authority and IRBs are immediately notified and appropriate documentation of the urgent protocol change are submitted per local regulations. 
Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not require 
submission to health or regulatory authority or the IRB, but the health or regulatory authority and IRB  should be kept informed of such changes as required by local regulations.   
10.6.2 Disclosure and Confidentiality 
The contents of this protocol and any amendments and results obtained during the study 
should be kept confidential by the Investigator, the Investigator’s staff, and the IRB, and will 
not be disclosed in whole or in part to others, or used for any purpose other than reviewing or performing the study, without the written consent of the Sponsor.  No data collected as part of this study will be used in any written work, including publications, without the written consent of the Sponsor.  These obligations of confidentiality and non-use shall in no way diminish such obligations as set forth in eith er the Confidentiality Agreement or Clinical 
Trial Agreement executed between the Sponsor/CRO and the institution/Investigator. 
All persons assisting in the performance of this study must be bound by the obligations of 
confidentiality and non-use set forth in either the Confidentiality Agreement or Clinical Trial 
Agreement executed between the institution/Investigator and the Sponsor/CRO.

 10.6.3 Discontinuation of Study 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for medical reasons or any other 
reason at any time.  If a study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor will promptly inform the Investigators/institutions and regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  The IRB will also be informed promptly and provided the reason(s) for the termination or suspension by the Sponsor or by the Investigator/institution, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
The Investigator reserves the right to discontinue the study should his/her judgment so 
dictate.  If the Investigator terminates or suspends a study without prior agreement of the Sponsor, the Investigator should inform the institution where applicable, and the 
Investigator/institution should promptly inform  the Sponsor and the IRB and provide them 
with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension.  Study records must be retained as noted above.

 APPENDIX 1 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBJECTS’ SELF-
ADMINISTRATION OF STUDY TREATMENT  
The study kit contains: 
x 5 packets filled with study drug, inside individual plastic bags  
x A dosing log 
Storage: 
Store the study kit at room temperature and in a secure place, out of direct sunlight, and away 
from food products, children, and pets. 
Patient Instructions: 
Application of study drug is preferably done early in the day and at approximately the same 
time every day for a total of 5 days.  The first dose will be self-administered in the clinic. 
Follow these steps to apply study drug: 
x Take the dosing log in the study kit and record the date and time of dosing. 
x Open the plastic bag and remove a single-dose packet. 
x Tear the packet open along the perforations. 
x Squeeze a small amount of ointment from the packet on your fingertip and apply it 
evenly over the entire treatment area (Note:  Each packet contains more than the

 Precautions on Treatment Days (Days 1-5): 
x Subjects who wear contact lenses should put on their contact lenses BEFORE 
applying study drug. 
x Avoid touching or wetting the treatment area for approximately 12 hours.  If you 
touch the treatment area, wash your hands immediately. 
x Avoid activities that might cause excessive sweating, so that the ointment will not get 
in your eyes. 
x If ointment does get into your eyes, flush your eyes with water immediately and 
extensively.  You must immediately contact the study doctor who will give you 
further instructions.  You will be referred to an eye doctor so your eyes can be examined. 
x If any severe local skin reaction occurs or persists, let your study doctor know 
immediately. 
x Do not apply study drug more than once each day. 
x Do not allow other people or pets to come in to contact with the treatment area.  If the 
treatment area is touched, the area of contact on the other person or pet should be washed immediately. 
x Do not cover the treatment area with bandages, band aids, tight-fitting scarfs, or caps. 
Precautions Throughout the Study: 
x When washing the treatment area, wash it gently with a mild, non-abrasive, non-
medicated soap or shampoo. 
x Do not expose the treatment area to excessive sun light or ultraviolet light, including 
tanning beds.  When outdoors, wear protective loose clothing over the treatment area.  
x Do not use moisturizers, sunscreen, artificial tanners, make-up or other over the 
counter-topical products to the study treatment area until Day 57.  If you are unsure of 
what to use, ask your study doctor.  After 15 days, if you are unable to avoid excessive sun light or ultraviolet light to the treatment area, the study doctor may allow you to use sunblock.  
x Do not use medications not approved by your study doctor. 
x After Day 57, sunblock and non-medicated topical products can be used in the

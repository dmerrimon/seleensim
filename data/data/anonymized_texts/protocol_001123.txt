1. RCT Details  
This section provides a high-level overview  of an RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely 
as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.  1.1 Title 
Tiotropium versus Salmeterol for the Prevention of Exacerbations of COPD  (POET -COPD  trial ) 
 1.2 Intended aim(s) 
 The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of tiotropium, a long -acting anticholinergic (muscarinic 
antagonist) drug (LAMA) compared to salmeterol, a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
 
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication and RCT finding 
Time to first COPD exacerbation 
 
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
With a sample size of approximately 6800 patients (3400 in each arm), the trial will have 80% power to detect a 10% 
reduction in the risk of first exacerbation with tiotropium as compared with salmeterol, with a two-sided test for the null hypothesis of a hazard ratio of 1 at a significance level of 0.05 
 
1.5 Trial estimate 
HR = 0.83 (95% CI 0.77–0.90) comparing tiotropium to salmeterol (Vogelmeier  et al., 2011, NEJM )

3 5.Cohort Identification
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user , parallel group, propensity score matched retrospective cohort study design comparing 
tiotropium to salmeterol . The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during baseline period of 180 days before 
initiation of tiotropium or salmeterol inhalers (cohort entry date ).  
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
New users (defined as no use in 180 days prior to index date) of an exposure and a comparator drug will be identified. 
5.2.1   Eligible cohort entry date 
Tiotropium inhaler was first approved by FDA for market availability on January 30, 2004, and salmete rol on September 15, 1998  
§Optum: January 30, 2004 – March 31, 2020 ( end of data availability is December 31, 2020 but excluded data
generated during COVID-19 pandemic)
§Marketscan: January 30, 2004 – December 31, 201 8 (end of data availability)
5.2.2  Specify inclusion/exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define the index date 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are 
provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

 5 6 Variables  
6.1 Exposure-related variables: 
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is initiation of tiotropium (LAMA). Initiation will be defined by no use of inhaled tiotropium 
during the prior 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period). Patients are required to be incident users with respect both exposure group s.  
 Comparator agents: 
Initiators of salmeterol inhaler defined as no use of inhaled salmeterol during the 180 days prior to index date 
 
6.2 Preliminary Covariates: 
§ Age 
§ Sex 
§ Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the default baseline covariate assessment period of 180 days 
prior to and including the index prescription date 
Covariates listed above are a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled in the design and analysis phase 
of the study. They are included in the preliminary assessment to determine the presence of adequate overlap between the two population of patients to proceed to the next phase of the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B ).  
 
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up: 
 
6.3.1  Outcome variables 
Effectiveness outcome variables of interest (definitions provided in Appendix A):  
§ Primary outcome : Time to first COPD exacerbation   
§ Secondary outcome:  
o All-cause death 
 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 6 Control outcome s of interest (control outcome s only serve to assess aspects of study validity but are not further 
interpreted):  Pneumonia 
 
6.3.2  Study follow-up 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to -treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug 
on the day of cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in 
the trial, the AT analysis is the primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.   For the AT analysis, the follow-up will start the day after the initiation of tiotropium or salmeterol and will continue 
until the earliest date of the following events: § The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, 
§ The date of end of continue registration in the database, 
§ End of the study period, 
§ Death, 
§ Nursing home admission 
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically 
provide little to no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for cohorts for the same reason. 
§ The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug (tiotropium or salmeterol) + a 60-day grace period, 
§ The date of switching from an exposure to comparator and vice versa, 
§ The date of switching  to or initiation of other LAMA (excluding tiotropium) and other LABA (excluding 
salmeterol), LAMA/LABA, LABA/ICS, and LAMA/LABA/ICS combination inhalers. 
 
For the ITT analyses, the censoring based on the switching and treatment discontinuation will be replaced with a 
maximum allowed follow-up time of 365 days.

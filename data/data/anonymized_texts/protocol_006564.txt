ABSTRACT  
 
There is an emerging paradigm in oncology that clinical efficacy can be obtained with inhibitors directed toward oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are mutated or otherwise dysregulated in certain 
tumor types.  Examples of such succes sful intervention include imatinib in GIST with mutant c -Kit, 
erlotinib in NSCLC with mutant and/or amplified EGFR, trastuzumab in breast cancers with amplified HER-2, and sunitinib targeting the VHL-dependent VEGF pathway in RCC. The c-Met RTK is frequent ly 
altered or dysregulated in advanced cancers and has been implicated in tumor progression,
1 and therefore 
represents an attractive novel therapeutic target.  It has been shown that the Met receptor has a role in PAX3-FKHR-mediated transformation in rhabdomyosarcomas, and that MET can serve as a therapeutic 
target in this disease.
2  The anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene ( ALK), which has significant homology to the 
Met oncogene, plays a role in the pathogenesis of anaplastic large- cell lympho mas (ALCL), due to a 
chromosomal translocation that results in expression of an oncogenic kinase fusion protein known as NPM -
ALK.  ALK is an orphan tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor with homology to neurotrophin receptors 
and the MET oncogene.  Expression is restricted to the developing nervous system with a postulated role in 
the regulation of neuronal differentiation.3  It has recently become clear that many human cancers activate 
ALK signaling by creating unique oncogenic fusions of the ALK gene at 2p23 with a variety of partners 
through chromosomal translocation ev ents,4 resulting in the generation of oncogenic ALK fusion genes and 
their encoded proteins.  Recently, the interest in ALK biology has increased considerably, followi ng the 
discovery of ALK  translocations in a fraction of non -small-cell lung cancers5 and in other solid tumors.4  It 
is now clear that many human cancers activate ALK signaling by creating unique oncogenic fusions of ALK 
with a variety of partners through chromosomal translocation events.  Previous work had shown that a 
substantial percentage of human -derived neuroblastoma cell lines express ALK transcripts and ALK protein, 
but no definitive role for this oncogene had been proven.  We have recently discovered that activating  
mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) oncogene are the cause 
of hereditary neuroblastoma, and that these mutations can also be somatically acquired.6 ALK was also 
recently identified as a molecular target in neuroblastoma by a screen of human cancer cell lines with 
pharmacologic antagonists of the ALK kinase domain.7 We hypothesize that ALK is a critical neuroblastoma 
oncogene and that activation of this cell surface kinase is a tractable therapeutic target.

PF-02341066 is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c -Met kinase and 
the NPM-ALK fusion protein.  In biochemical and cellular screens, PF -02341066 was shown to be selective 
for c-Met and ALK at pharmacologically relevant concentrations across a panel of >120 diverse kinases.8,9  
PF-02341066 potently inhibited cell proliferation, which was associated with G 1S-phase cell cycle arrest  
and induction of apoptosis in ALK -positive ALCL cells but not ALK -negative lymphoma cells.  In addition, 
inhibition of key NPM -ALK signaling mediators was observed at concentrations that required for inhibition 
of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and function.  More recently, the in vitro activity of PF -02341066 was 
examined in a panel of ALCL and neuroblastoma cell lines. PF -02341066 was able to inhibit proliferation 
and ALK-mediated signaling in these cell lines at clinically achievable doses, with potent suppression of 
downstream effectors seen in the neuroblastoma cells.7

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale fo r Development  
PF-02341066 is a small -molecule inhibitor of the c -Met/HGFR and ALK receptor tyrosine 
kinase.  The rationale for use of this mechanism to treat cancer is supported by an emerging 
paradigm in oncology that robust clinical efficacy can be obtained with well -tolerated 
inhibitors directed toward oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are genetically altered through activating mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification.  Recent examples include 
Gleevec
® in gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutant c -Kit or chronic myelogenous 
leukemia with BCR- Abl gene translocations, Tarceva® in non-small cell lung cancer with 
mutant EGFR, Herceptin® in breast cancers with amplified HER -2/neu, and SU11248 
targeting the VHL -dependent VEGF pathway in renal cell carcinoma. An extensive body of 
literature indicates that c -Met/HGFR is one of the most frequently mutated or otherwise 
abnormally activated RTK s in various human cancers.1 The c-Met/Hepatocyte growth factor 
receptor (HGFR) has been well characterized for its role in regulation of cell growth, migration, and invasion of both tumor cells and endothelial cells.
1  An extensive body of 
literature indicates that c- Met/HGFR is one of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) most

   07/27/17 
frequently mutated or otherwise abnormally activated in late -stage human cancer.  When 
activated, c- Met/HGFR plays a critical role in regulation of tumor oncogenic processes such 
as mitogenesis, survival, invasive growth, metastasis and tumor angiogenesis.  Activati ng 
mutations in c -Met/HGFR have been identified in multiple adult solid tumors.1 Recent data 
shows that ALK is overexpressed in glioblastoma compared to normal brain, and that 
ribozyme- mediated targeting of ALK leads to reduced tumor growth of glioblastoma 
xenografts and increased apoptosis in the tumors.10 
 ALK was first described in anaplastic large cell lymphoma,
11 where a chromosomal 
translocation leads to production of an oncogenic fusion protein with the ALK intracell ular 
region fused to the nucleophosmin (NPM) N -terminus. Similarly, ALK fusion transcripts, 
most commonly with EML4, are potent oncogenic drivers in a subset of non- small cell lung 
cancers (NSCLC),5 and additional ALK fusions drive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors 
(IMTs) and other cancers.12 Among selective kinase inhibitors tested in a panel of 602 cell 
lines derived from a variety of human cancers, it was found that a selective inhibitor of ALK potently suppressed growth of lines derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas and 
neuroblastomas.
7 Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and its mutant translocation with the 
nucleophosmin gene (NPM -ALK) results in a constitutively active A LK receptor tyrosin e 
kinase expressed in the majority (~80%) of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL).13 
PF-02341066 demonstrated potent activity against NPM -ALK, an oncogenic fusion protein 
variant of the ALK, which results from a chromosomal translocation which is implicated in 
the pathogenesis of human anaplastic large cell lymphoma.13 In addition, recent data indicates 
that mutations in ALK are responsible for the majority of heritable neuroblastoma cases, and 
also are present in a subst antial subset of high -risk neuroblastomas due to somatic 
mutation.6,14 Preclinical data in neuroblastoma confirm the oncogenic potential of mutated 
ALK, and RNA inhibition of A LK message validates the feasibility of a targeted approach 
in this tumor type .6 Consistent with its predicted mechanism of action, PF -02341066 
inhibited target -dependent tumor cell proliferation or invasion, induced tumor cell apoptosis, 
and inhibited angiogenesis in nonclinical tumor models.  Oral administration of PF -02341066 
also demonstrated efficacy, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c- Met/HGFR or NPM -ALK. The collective rationale 
for investigation of PF -02341066 in clinical studies is built on genetic alteration of its 
molecular targets, its predicted ability to target multiple processes that are common to cancer progression, and preclinical efficacy data.  
 PF-02341066 is an orally bioavailable, selective c- Met/HGFR aminopyridine tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor and a potent ATP -competitive inhibitor of recombinant, human c- Met/HGFR kinase 
activity with a mean Ki of 4 nM.  In preliminary biochemical screens, PF -02341066 inhibited 
HGF-stimulated or constitutive total tyrosine phosphorylation of w ild type c-Met/HGFR with 
a mean IC
50 value of 11 nM across a panel of human tumor cell lines.  In addition, PF -
02341066 demonstrated potent activity against NPM -ALK in a human lymphoma cell line 
(IC50 ~ 24 nM). PF-02341066 has also shown potent activity in preclinical in vivo  xenograft 
models of GTL -16 gastric carcinoma (mean 60% regression) and the NCI -H441 non- small 
cell lung carcinoma (mean 48% regression) models.  PF -02341066 also demonstrated near  
complete tumor growth inhibition in both the U87MG glioblastoma (97% growth inhibition) and PC-3 prostate carcinoma models (87% growth inhibition) at 50 mg/kg/day. In the Karpas 
299 NPM -ALK positive human ALCL lymphoma tumor model, administration of PF-
02341066 at 100 mg/kg/day resulted in complete regression of tumors of all mice in this 
dosing cohort within 15 days of the initial compound administration. After 17 days, PF -
02341066 treatment was stopped, resulting in tumor regrowth. When tumors grew to a larger 
size (>600 mm
3), PF-02341066 treatment was reinitiated for an additional 13 days and 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
complete regression of tumors was once again demonstrated. PF -02341066 exhibits 
convincing antitumor activity in several xenograft models.  Importantly, it delivers  antitumor 
efficacy in xenograft models with a large safety window, providing increased confidence that 
mechanism -based toxicity will not be limiting in the clinic.  
 These data, coupled with preclinical in vitro data in high -risk neuroblastoma, provide a 
compelling rationale for investigating PF -02341066 in pediatric solid tumors, including CNS 
tumors, neuroblastoma and ALCL.  
There is robust preclinical rationale to maximize the recommended phase 2 dose based upon 
laboratory data that mutated ALK is more d ifficult to inhibit relative to translocated ALK (as 
seen in ALCL and lung cancer), and the fact that certain mutations (F1174L) are 
hyperactivated and thus are relatively resistant to ALK inhibition (Figure 1), but this 
resistance can be overcome in a dose-dependent manner.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies  
 
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity  
Preclinical in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that PF -02341066 is a potent and 
selective inhibitor of the c -Met/HGFR and ALK receptor tyrosine kinases, as well as 
several of their oncogenic variants (ATP binding site mutations in c -Met and the 
NPM-ALK fusion protein). In a series of cell -based functional assays, PF -02341066 
potently inhibited human GTL -16 gastric carcinoma cell growth, HGF -stimulated 
human NCI -H441 lung carcinoma cell migration and invasion through a matrigel 
matrix and HGF -stimulated MDCK cell motility/scattering, with IC50 values 
ranging from 6.1 to 16 nM.  Additionally, PF -02341066 inhibited proliferation of 
Karpas 299 ALCL cells that express an NPM- ALK fusion protein due to a t(2;5) 
chromosomal translocation (IC50 = 60 nM).  Growth inhibition by PF -02341066 in 
these NPM- ALK positive lymphoma cells was associated with G0/G1 cell cycle 
arrest and induction of apoptosis. When investigated for potential antiangiogenic Figure 1.  Dose-response curves  in vitro to PF-02341066 in 4 NB cell lines

   07/27/17 
activity, PF -02341066 inhibited HGF -mediated HUVEC endothelial cell su rvival 
(IC50 = 11 nM) and matrigel invasion (IC50 = 35 nM) as well as HMVEC 
endothelial cell tubulogenesis in fibrin gels, with IC 50’s of 11 nM to approximately 
80 nM.  These studies suggest that PF -02341066 is active against tumors of diverse 
tissue types, and may also harbor anti -angiogenic effects.  
  
The antitumor activity of PF -02341066 has also been evaluated in a variety of human 
tumor xenograft models representative of cancer indications in which dysregulation of c-Met/HGFR is implicated. PF -02341066 demonstrated potent cytoreductive 
activity in both the GTL -16 gastric carcinoma (mean 60% regression) and the NCI -
H441 non- small cell lung carcinoma (mean 48% regression) models, suggesting the 
potential to monitor patient objective response as a means of  assessing clinical 
efficacy. PF -02341066 also demonstrated near complete tumor growth inhibition in 
both the U87MG glioblastoma (97% growth inhibition) and PC -3 prostate carcinoma 
models (87% growth inhibition) at 50 mg/kg/day. In models in which multiple  dose 
levels were evaluated (GTL -16, U87MG, and NCI -H441), dose -dependent inhibition 
of tumor growth correlated with inhibition of c- Met/HGFR phosphorylation. In these 
studies it was observed that complete inhibition of c -Met/HGFR was achieved for 
the full dosing interval at 50 mg/kg/day.  In the Karpas 299 NPM -ALK positive 
human ALCL lymphoma tumor model, administration of PF -02341066 at 100 
mg/kg/day resulted in complete regression of tumors of all mice in this dosing cohort 
within 15 days of the initial compound administration. After 17 days, PF -02341066 
treatment was stopped, resulting in tumor regrowth. When tumors grew to a larger 
size (>600 mm
3), PF-02341066 treatment was reinitiated for an additional 13 days 
and complete regression of tumors was once again demonstrated.  
 
2.2.2 Preliminary Activity of PF -02341066 in Neuroblastoma  
Mutations in the ALK proto-oncogene are the major cause of hereditary 
neuroblastoma (NB)6 and are somatically acquired in sporadic primary tumors.14-16 
We resequenced the ALK tyrosine kinase domain in 449 prim ary NB DNAs, and 
stained a tissue microarray (TMA) of 160 NBs with anti -ALK and anti-pALK 
antibodies. We evaluated the anti -tumor activity of PF -02341066, an orally 
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of ALK, against a panel of patient derived cell 
lines in vitro and in vivo. Mutations were discovered in at least 15% of NBs, and 
across the spectrum of NB phenotypes. R1275Q substitutions were most common 
(45%), followed by F1174L (15%), both located in key regulatory regions of the 
receptor’s tyrosine kinase domain. Evaluation of  matched constitutional DNAs 
demonstrated 10%  of mutations were occult germline mutations.  ALK was highly 
expressed in 50 % of TMA cores and p ALK in 30%.  Integration of primary tumor 
microarrays showed a correlation between ALK copy number and mRNA expression. 
PF-02341066 showed differential sensitivity dependent on ALK status in a panel of 
18 neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro. A wild type (WT) amplified line and 2 lines 
harboring the R1275Q mutation were sensitive with IC 50s in the 145 – 301 nM range, 
while four cell lines with the F1174Lwere more resistant (IC50s >950 nM).  Cell lines 
with normal copy number WT ALK were also more resistant. Inhibition of 
proliferation was correlated with abolishing phosphorylation of ALK, STAT3 and 
AKT. These in vitro observations were recapitulated in xenograft studies of PF -
02341066 sensitivity. PF-02341066 caused complete regression of R1275Q 
xenografts, but caused only minimal growth delay in F1174L and WT xenografts (N=10/arm). PF -02341066 is a potent inhibitor of the most common ALK mutation 
in neuroblastoma.

The pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of PF-02341066 was studied in mice at 
the dose that produced the optimal therapeutic effect in neuroblastoma xenografts (200 mg/kg ≈ 80 m g/m
2). A one -compartment model was fit to the plasma 
concentration -time data (sampled over 28 h) and the parameters are shown below:

Biochemical analyses linked the reduced susceptibility of F1174L -mutated ALK to 
PF-02341066 inhibition (compared with R1275Q) to increased ATP -binding 
affinity, as seen with development of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non- small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). The activating R1275Q ALK mutation increases Km for ATP, 
mirroring the common L858R EGFR mutation. By contrast, the activating F1174L ALK mutation slightly reduces K
m for ATP, so that its kinetic parameters resemble 
those of the gefitinib/erlotinib- resistant L858R/T790M EGFR mutant in NSCLC. 
Despite the resistance seen in the studies described here, our results indicate that patients harboring the F1174L mutation may benefit from treatment with ATP -
competitive ALK inhibitors in some circumstances. Our biochemical results indicate 
that the reduced sensitivity of F1174L -expressing cell lines can be explained, at least 
in part, by an increased ATP -binding affinity compared with R1275Q – as manifest 
by K
m, ATP values – which reduces the potency of ATP-competit ive inhibitors ( Table 
1). For PF-02341066 itself, an increase in dosage to overcome the relative difference 
in Km, ATP compared with R1275Q -mutated ALK may be possible ( Table 2, 
manuscript submitted).

2.2.3 Animal Toxicology  
The primary PF -02341066 toxicities in nonclinical studies were observed in the 
gastrointestinal tract (rat, dog, monkey), hematopoietic system (rat, dog, monkey), 
kidneys (rat), reproductive organs (rat), and actively growing long bones (rat). 
Emesis and diarrhea were dose- limiting toxicities observed during the single -dose 
escalation range -finding study in dogs. Microscopic evidence of minimal to mild 
renal cortical tubule vacuolation was observed following 28 days of dosing in male 
rats treated  with ≥50 mg/kg/day. Bone marrow hypocellularity was observed in 
toxicity studies in rats and monkeys treated for 28 days at doses of 150 mg/kg/day (rats, males only) and 50 mg/kg/day (monkeys). Bone marrow hypocellularity was not observed in dogs; however , a decrease in white blood cells was identified 
following 3 single doses up to 40 mg/kg and 7 days of PF -02341066 at 20 mg/kg/day. 
Repeated administration of PF -02341066 for 28 days caused minimally decreased 
bone formation at the primary spongiosa of growing long bones at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day in male rats. PF -02341066 administration was associated with decreased 
heart rate, increased LVEDP, and decreased myocardial contractility. Increases in 
sPR interval, QRS, and QT interval were believed to be secon dary to the reduction 
in heart rate. Additional effects related to PF -02341066 administration involved 
genetic toxicity findings, and other findings of uncertain risk to humans including 
decreased cellularity in lymphoid organs, elevated liver enzymes, pot ential for 
phototoxicity, and effects on the salivary glands. 
 
2.2.4 Non-clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies  
Single-dose pharmacokinetics of PF -02341066 in the male Sprague -Dawley rat, 
Beagle dog, and cynomolgus monkey following intravenous administration 
demonstrated moderate systemic plasma clearance in all preclinical species (9 to 47 
mL/min/kg). Volume of distribution at steady state ranged from 2.9 to 24 L/kg in the 
rat, 11 to 13 L/kg in the dog, and 13 L/kg in the monkey, which all greatly exceeded 
the volume of total body water and indicated extensive distribution of PF-02341066 
into body tissues. The terminal half -life ranged from 2.3 to 17 hours. Linear 
pharmacokinetics were observed in all preclinical species at doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg. 
Oral bioavailability from the solution and suspension formulations at 12.5 to 50 
mg/kg in rats ranged from 26% to 63%, and in dogs and monkeys ranged from 38% 
to 66%.  
 
In vitro studies with pooled human liver microsomes and specific CYP probe 
substrates indicated  the highest potency for crizotinib -mediated CYP inhibition was 
for CYP3A, with IC50 values of 8.2 µM and 7.3 µM for felodipine oxidase and 
testosterone 6β- hydroxylase activities, respectively. The inhibitor potency of 
crizotinib was less for CYP2B6 and CYP2C9, with IC50 values of 22 µM and 23 
µM, respectively. Low inhibitor potency  was observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 (IC50 values >30 µM). Clinical interactions with substrates 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 are unlikely. 
Crizotinib demonstrated  time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A in human liver 
microsomes with a k inact of 0.11 min -1 and K I of 3.0 µM (midazolam as the substrate). 
Crizotinib caused marked induction of CYP3A4 based on mRNA levels in human 
cryopreserved hepatocytes at concentrations up to 7 µM; however, a  corresponding 
induction of CYP3A4 enzyme activity was not observed. This finding is likely due 
to the crizotinib -mediated time -dependent inhibition of CYP3A4.  
 
The potential of crizotinib to inhibit P -gp was evaluated in an in vitro study in Caco-
2 cells. Crizotinib demonstrated a  concentration- dependent inhibitory effect on P -
gp-mediated digoxin efflux, with an IC50 value of 5.8 µM. Therefore, 
coadministration of crizotinib could potentially increase the plasma concentration of P-gp substrates such as digoxin in vivo via inhibition of intestinal P -gp-mediated 
efflux.   Pfizer has developed PF -02341066, as an oral solution, for patients who are unable 
to swallow capsules. Based on the physiochemical properties of this agent, the bioavailability of the oral suspension (PIB - powder in bottle)  should be compar able 
to the powder -in-capsule (PIC). In vitro dissolution tests showed that the dissolution 
rate was fast, dose- independent and formulation- independent when pH=1.0 (fasted 
state) or pH=4.5 (fed state). The only exception was that the 100- mg PIC had slightl y 
slower dissolution rate than 50- mg PIC and an immediate release tablet (IRT) when 
pH=4.5 (fed state) with Paddle motion. Moreover, results from a recent 
bioavailability study in normal healthy subjects demonstrated bioequivalence 
between PIC and IRT in term of AUC and Cmax, suggesting that dissolution may not be a limiting step of absorption. The oral clearance (CL/F) of PF-02341066 was 
observed to be 80- 100 L/hr administered as the PIC in adult patients (Study 
A8081001), indicating PF -02341066 is a drug with either high clearance (CL), low 
bioavailability (F), or both. The likely low bioavailability may be due to low 
permeability and/or extensive GI/hepatic metabolism rather than poor dissolution of 
the PIC formulation. Therefore, it is believed that the oral suspension (PIB) will have 
a similar bioavailability compared to the PIC, which is currently used in adult patient 
trials.   
 Pfizer has more recently developed PF -02341066 as an oral solution ( OS), which 
along with their Formulated Capsule (FC), is moving forward for commercial development. The OS is a sweetened and flavored aqueous solution, containing PF-
02341066 (25 mg/mL) and excipients. PF -02341066 is 100% dissolved in the OS. 
Results from study A8081019 demonstrated that OS of PF-02341066 was 
bioequivalent to the FC.  In vitro dissolution tests showed that the dissolution rates 
of the solid formulations were fast and similar, suggesting that dissolution may be not limiting in PF -02341066 absorption. Based on these data, the OS is considered 
to be bioequivalent to the PIC formulation currently used in this trial.

2.3 Adult Studies  
 
2.3.1 Phase 1 Studies  
 An ongoing Phase 1 trial (A8081001) evaluating PF -02341066 as an oral single 
agent is being conducted to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of PF -02341066 in adult patients with advanced cancer 
(excluding leukemias).   This trial includes a dose escalation component followed by 
a dose expansion component in a selected co hort of molecularly -defined patients 
referred to as the enriched population.  During the dose escalation phase, PF -
02341066 was administered under fasting conditions QD or BID on a continuous 
schedule.   The objectives of the dose escalation component of the trial were to 
establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs), and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF -02341066 in patients with advanced 
cancer.  Enrollment for the dose escalation part of the trial is complete and 37 
patients have b een dosed.  Three DLTs have been observed including Grade 3 ALT 
increase in 1 patient at 200 mg QD and Grade 3 fatigue in 2 patients at 300 mg 
BID.  The MTD was determined to be 250 mg BID administered in a continuous 
daily dosing regimen.  The MTD for QD administration is currently being 
determined. 
 
ALK gene rearrangement- positive patients were identified for the expansion cohort 
of the ongoing Phase 1 trial using a diagnostic test with a break apart ALK FISH 
probe.  One hundred and thirteen ALK+ NSCLC patients have entered the enriched 
population cohort as of 7 August 2010.  Clinical activity data is reported for these 
113 patients as of data cut -off date.  Over 50% of the patients had at least 3 prior 
treatments for NSCLC and 15 patients had an ECOG performance status of 2 at baseline for this study. 
 
The objective response rate (ORR) was: 56% (95%CI: 46%, 66%).  The median 
duration of response for those patients who responded was 6.0 months.  The median 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) was 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.6, 10.3 months). 
 
The most common treatment -related adverse events in the evaluable subset is 
gastrointestinal toxicity consisting of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.  These adverse 
events were primarily Grade 1 -2 in severity.   Nausea and emesis were independent 
of dose or duration of treatment and were effectively managed using I.V. or oral anti -
emetics.  Diarrhea can be effectively controlled by anti- diarrheals.   The percentage 
of patients having visual changes which consisted mainly of seein g shadows or 
streaks during changes in light has occurred in ~45% of patients.  All of these visual 
events were Grade 1 in severity.   These adverse events did not affect patient 
management as no patients temporarily stopped treatment, had their dose reduced or were permanently discontinued from treatment. Five patients have experienced 
Grade 3 (n=4) or Grade 4 (n=1) increases in ALT.  These events occurred within the 
first cycle treatment, i.e. first 28 days of treatment.    Patients were asymptomatic and 
the ALT increases were reversible upon discontinuation of study medication.  Only 
one patient discontinued treatment due to an increase in ALT levels. 
 
In a recent review of safety for PF -02341066, Pfizer has determined that there are 4 
potential cases of pn eumonitis in patients with non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , 
which may be related to PF -02341066. One additional  case was a radiation recall 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
pneumonitis. Based on the 4 cases that were not linked to radiation treatment and 
relative to all enrolled adult patients (N=2 55) who have been treated with PF -
02341066, as of September 15, 2010, the current frequency of non- radiation recall 
pneumonitis is 1.6%.   One of the 4 cases was fatal. The 3 other patients were 
permanently discontinued from the study and recovered from the event. The one 
patient who experienced radiation recall pneumonitis, was appropriately treated and 
was able to restart PF -02341066. Interpretation of the 4 non-radiation recall cases 
was complicated by the underlying non- small cell lung cancer for which the patients 
were being treated. In addition these 3 cases were complicated by the co -
administration of other drugs known to potentially cause pneumonitis and/or other 
pulmonary complications. 
 
2.3.2 Phase 2 Studies  
There have been no Phase 2 s tudies in adults.  
 
2.3.3 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available for the first 145 patients 
enrolled in the adult Phase 1 trial  17. After oral administration of PF 02341066 on an 
empty stomach, peak plasma concentrations were reached at ~ 4 hours post dose and 
followed by a multi -exponential declining pattern with an average terminal half -life 
of 43 to 51 hours.  Following multiple oral dosing for 15 days or longer, crizotinib 
AUCtau increased with median accumulation ratios  ranging from 1.7 to 3.4 after QD 
dosing and from 4.0 to 5.9 after BID dosing, respectively.  No evidence of nonlinearity in PK was observed at doses ranging from 100 mg to 200  mg QD and 
200 mg to 300 mg BID , as evidenced by generally proportional increases in mean 
AUC
tau and C max after single or multiple doses. There was moderate variability in 
AUCtau (coefficient of variation [CV], 12 –60%) and C max (CV, 21–71%) across all 
doses studied. Crizotinib concentrations reached steady state within 15 days after  
repeated administration at 250 mg BID. Median trough plasma concentration at 
steady state (274  ng/mL total or 57  nM free drug)  exceeded the target efficacious 
levels predicted for inhibition of c-MET (13 nM)  and ALK (~26 nM) based on 
preclinical mouse tumor models. Co-administration with a standard high- fat meal 
did not appear to change the geometric mean of AUC 24 and C max of crizotinib 
following single 250- mg crizotinib doses in cancer patients.  
PF-02341066 showed time -dependent inhibition of CYP3A isozymes in human liver 
microsomes.  In order to assess the effect of PF -02341066 on CYP3A activity in the 
GI tract and the liver, PK of midazolam (a CYP3A substrate probe) following a single oral 2 mg dose was evaluated before (Day -7) and after (Cycle 2 Day 1) 
repeated administration of PF-02341066 at 250 mg BID in 13 patients.
17  A 3.6-fold 
(90% CI: 2.7- 4.9) increase in the oral midazolam AUC was observed following 28 
days of PF -02341066 dosing at 250 mg BID, suggesting that PF -02341066 is a 
moderate inhibitor of CYP3A.

2.4 Pediatric Studies  
 
2.4.1 Prior Experience in Children  
There have been no previous clinical trials of PF -02341066 in children.  
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
This will be a Phase 1 dose -finding study of PF -02341066 to determine the maximum dose 
that is safe and tolerable. Children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and children with 
relapsed/refractory ALCL will be treated with PF -02341066 orally, on a continuous 
schedule.  The starting dose will be 100 mg/m2 (70% of the adult MTD of 250 mg twice daily 
or approximately 140 mg/m2) administered orally twice daily continuously. Eligibility will 
include all relapsed/refractory solid tumors and patients with AL CL for the Phase 1 portion 
of this study (Part A1).  Patients with recurrent/refractory malignancies that have confirmed 
ALK fusion proteins, ALK mutations or evidence for MET mutation or amplification , will 
be able to enroll at any time during the phase 1 portion of the protocol (Part A2) . Except for 
the initial dose level, their accrual will lag one dose level behind the phase 1 trial. Patients 
with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma not eligible for Part A1 will also be able to enroll on 
a separate strat um (Part A3) at one dose level below the dose level at which patients on Part 
A1 are actively enrolling.  Due to the prevalence of ALK translocations in systemic ALCL, 
and with promising preclinical data on the activity of PF- 02341066 in neuroblastoma, thi s 
study includes a Phase 2 expansion at the maximum tolerated dose in two separate parts of 
the study, to obtain preliminary efficacy data in patients with ALK+ relapsed/refractory 
neuroblastoma or ALCL (Part B or Part C), as well as patients with any ALK or MET 
activated tumor (Part A2).  
 
To assess biological correlates of efficacy, we will access (when available) banked tumor 
DNA as well as tissue blocks from diagnosis or relapse in participating subjects with 
neuroblastoma and ALCL, for correlative biology studies.  We will also obtain bone marrow prior to and while on treatment from patients with neuroblastoma, as well as bone marrow 
and peripheral blood from patients with ALCL. The study will include pharmacokinetic as 
well as correlative studies. A multi-strata Phase 2 study will open group -wide, and stage 1 
data from the neuroblastoma and ALCL cohorts, as well as data for subjects enrolled at the 
MTD in this study , will be utilized as part of the COG-wide Phase 2  trial. 
 
2.6 Preliminary Results of t he Current Pediatric Study (May 2011)  
A total of 39 subjects have been enrolled on the pediatric phase 1 study of PF -02341066. 
Twenty-five subjects were enrolled on Part A1, 9 subjects on Part A2, and 5 subjects on Part 
A3. On Part A1, no hematologic DLTs were observed  during the first cycle ; at dose level 4  
(215 mg/m
2/dose BID), 1 subject experienced grade 3 dizziness, probably related to study 
drug, and 1 subject experienced grade 5 intra -tumoral hemorrhage, possibly related to study 
drug. One subject at dose level 2 (130 mg/m2/dose BID) experienced a grade 4 intra-tumoral 
hemorrhage, with an attribution of unlikely related to study drug  in Cycle 2 of therapy . There 
are no laboratory data or data from the adult trial with PF -02341066 to suggest that this d rug 
leads to intra -tumoral hemorrhage. In > 300 adult patients, including patients with NSCLC 
and brain metastases, there has not been any intra -tumoral hemorrhage observed. On Part 
A2, 1 subject experienced a grade 4 hematologic DLT (grade 4 neutropenia) at dose level 3  
(165 mg/m2/dose BID) . On Part A3, no DLTs were seen. Therefore, dose level 4 will be 
expanded to enroll one additional non-CNS patient in Part A1 according to the rolling -six 
design and dose -escalation will proceed if criteria for DLT are not met. The current 
amendment will exclude potential participants with known primary and/or metastatic CNS involvement due to the occurrence of 2 CNS adverse events reported to date on this trial.

Nineteen children enrolled on the pediatric phase 1 trial had adequate pharmacokinetic 
sampling completed after the first dose of PF-02341066. The disposition of PF-02341066 in 
children was highly variable (apparent clearance [CL/F] ranged from 9 to 276 L/m2/h). The 
relationship between dose and AUC of PF-02341066 was difficult to assess because of the 
variability (the AUC 0-∞ at the 130 mg/m2 dose level ranged from 1.2 to 14 mcg•h/mL).  The 
AUC0-∞ at the 215 mg/m2 dose level was 2.6 and 7.4 mcg•h/mL in 2 pat ients.  The mean t 1/2 
was 6.7 h, but it ranged from 2.9 to 21 h.  The half -life was considerably shorter in children 
than adults, but may be underestimated because of sampling period after the first dose was 
22-24 h.  Therefore the AUC 0-∞ may also be under estimated.  Mean steady state trough 
concentrations were 112, 224, 286 and 441 at the 100, 130, 165 and 215 mg/m2 dose levels, 
respectively. As a result of this artificially short half -life, it is likely that the AUC 
extrapolated to infinity is substantially underestimated and the AUCinf of a single dose may 
not be equal to the AUC tau at steady state.  In addition, auto- induction of metabolism may 
also impact the steady -state AUC.  To address this, we will perform steady state PK, which 
can be compared to the exposures in preclinical models. Given the importance placed on the PK in children on this trial as a way to relate to the preclinical studies and the primary driver 
for deciding to dose- escalate, PKs will be required for patients on Part A, Part B or P art C.

Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this tria l 
must only be done after obtaining written informed consent.  This can be accomplished 
through one of the following mechanisms: a) the COG screening protocol, b) an IRB -
approved institutional screening protocol or c) the study- specific protocol.  Documentation 
of the informed consent for screening will be maintained in the patient’s research chart. 
Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to 
determine eligibility) may be used for baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained. 
 
3.7 Eligibility Checklist  
Before the patient can be enrolled, the responsible institutional investigator must sign and date the completed eligibility checklist.  A signed copy of the checklist will be faxed 
immediately following enrollment, using eRDES Document Imaging Program, to the 
Operations Center at (626) 447- 2204. For more information on eRDES Document Imaging, 
please refer to the eRDES Document Imaging User Guide – Institutional , which can be 
downloaded at:

aging_UserGuide_Institutional.pdf 
 
3.8 Institutional Pathology Report  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
Immediately following enrollment, the institutional pathology report for the diagnosis under 
which the patient is being enrolled must be faxed, with the corresponding shuttle sheet, to 
the Operations Center at (626) 447-2204. The fax must include the associated study number 
and COG patient registration and accession numbers. Personal identifiers, including the 
patient’s name and initials must be removed from the institutional pathology report prior to submission to COG.  
 
3.9 Study Enrollment  
Patients may be enrolled on the study once all eligibility requirements for the study have been met. Patient s who give informed consent for the protocol in order to undergo screening 
for eligibility are not considered enrolled and should not be enrolled until the screening is 
completed and they are determined to meet all eligibility criteria. Study enrollment is  
accomplished by going to the Enrollment application in the RDE system.  If you have problems with enrollment, refer to online help in the Applications area of the COG website. 
Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins.  The date protocol therapy i s projected to 
start must be no later than five (5) calendar days after the date of study enrollment. Patients 
must not receive any protocol therapy prior to enrollment.  
 
3.10 Dose Assignment  
The dose level will be assigned via RDE at the time of study enrollment. 
 
 
4.0 PATIENT ELIGIBILITY  
 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days prior to 
enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  If more than 7 calendar days elapse between the date 
eligibility studies outlined in Section 4.1.7 were obtained and the start date of treatment, then the 
following studies must be repeated prior to treatment: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine.  If any of these repeat laboratory studies are outside the parameters required 
for eligibility (labs may again be repeated within 48- 72 hours), then the patient is off protocol therapy.  
Imaging studies, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are required withi n 14 days prior to start of 
protocol therapy. If more than 14 days have elapsed between the date imaging studies to determine 
eligibility were obtained (i.e., for patients with neuroblastoma on Part A or Part B per 
Section 4.1.4.2) 
and the start date of treatment, then repeat imaging studies must be obtained prior to initiating protocol therapy.

5.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
 
5.1 Treatment Overview  
 
5.1.1 Drug Administration  
 
Treatment Schedule Table  
Days 1-28 PF-02341066 orally twice daily 
Day 28 End of Cycle  
 
For patients receiving PF -02341066 capsule  formulation, the capsules must be swallowed 
whole. For patients receiving PF -02341066 oral solution ( OS), see the guidelines for 
preparation and administration in Appendix XIV . Feeding tube administration is allowed  for 
patients receiving the OS.  If a patient vomits after a dose of PF -02341066 (capsule or OS), 
it will not be repeated. See also Section 9.1.7  regarding administration instructions.  Refer to 
the dosing nomogram in Appendix III B for the formulated capsules (FC)  and see the formula 
and calculation in Appendix IV  for the OS.  After Cycle 1, patients m ay, for convenience, 
change formulations from  FC to OS or vice versa.   
 Patients that enrolled on Parts A1, A2 & A3 prior to Amendment#6 must continue to 
receive their current formulation PIC or OS. Refer to the dosing nomogram 
Appendix 
IIIA for the PIC formulation and Appendix IV  for the formula and calculation for the 
OS. Newly enrolled patients on Parts A2, B & C should receive therapy with either the 
FC or the OS.  
 A cycle of therapy is considered to  be 28 days.  
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA determined based on height and weight 
obtained within one week prior to the beginning of each cycle.   
 
5.2 Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles  
A cycle may be repeated every 28 days if the patient has at least stable disease, an ANC ≥ 
250/mm
3 (for patients with known bone marrow involvement) or ≥ 500/mm3 (for patients 
without known bone marrow involvement), and has again met other laboratory parameters  
for hematologic, renal, and liver function as defined in the eligibility section (Sections 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
4.1.7.1, 4.1.7.2, and 4.1.7.3).  Patients with stable disease or better who are having clinical 
benefit from PF -02341066 may continue receiving protocol therapy provided that the patient 
meets the criteria for starting subsequent cycles ( Section 5.2 ) and does not meet any of the 
criteria for removal from protocol therapy or off study criteria ( Section 10.0 ). 
 
  
5.3 Dose Escalation Schema  
 
5.3.1 Inter-Patient Escalation [Phase 1 (Part A) only] - COMPLETE 
The starting dose will be 100 mg/m2/dose BID with dose levels for subsequent groups 
of patients as follows: 
Dose Level  Dose (mg/m2/dose BID)  
0 70   
1 100  
2 130

4 215  
5 280 
6 365 
 
5.3.2 Patients with recurrent/refractory malignancies that have confirmed ALK fusion 
proteins, ALK mutations or ALK amplification (defined as greater than 4 -fold 
increase in the ALK signal number as compared to reference signal number on 
chromosome 2q arm) or ev idence for MET mutation or amplification  who have 
exhausted all standard treatment options can be accrued to a separate stratum (Part 
A2) if they are not eligible for enrollment on the phase 1 dose escalation component 
of the trial (Part A1).  These patien ts will be enrolled at one dose level below that of 
patients in part A1, or at the starting dose level (dose level 1) if dose escalation has not yet occurred. For patients enrolled with a confirmed ALK or MET aberration (Part A1 or A2), intra -patient dose escalation will be permitted for up to one dose 
level in cycles of therapy subsequent to cycle 1 if the patient is tolerating the dose at which they began therapy and if the next higher dose level has been established as 
tolerable. Part A2 will remain open during the Phase 2 portion of the study. 
 
 Patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma, with or without bone marrow 
involvement, who are not eligible for Part A1 or A2 or cannot enroll on Part A1 
because of stratum suspension or lack of available slots, can be accrued to a separate 
stratum (Part A3). These patients will be enrolled at one dose level below the dose 
level at which patients on Part A1 are actively enrolling. For these patients, intra-
patient dose escalation will be permitted for up to on e dose level if the patient is 
tolerating the dose at which they began therapy and if the next higher dose level has 
been established as tolerable.  
 
5.3.3 Dosing for the Phase 2 expansion, Part A2 (patients with ALK or MET+ 
tumors), Part B (patients with A LK+ neuroblastoma) and Part C (patients with 
ALK+ ALCL):  Patients in the initial Phase 2 expansion will be treated at the 
recommended dose from the Phase 1 component of this trial , which is 280 
mg/m2/dose BID. 
 
5.3.4 Intra-Patient Escalation  
Intra-patient dose escalation is not allowed with the exception of dosing for patients 
in Part A1 (patients with ALK or MET+ tumors), A2 or Part A3 of the study, in

4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov). Any suspected  or confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should be 
reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Study Chair. 
 
5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to PF -02341066.  The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose -
escalation will be the first cycle of therapy.  
 
Dose limiting hematological and non- hematological toxicities ar e defined differently.   
 
5.5.1 Non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity:  
• Any Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity 
• Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the specific exclusion of: 
- Grade 3 nausea and vomiting of less < 3 days duration - Grade 3 ALT/AS T that return to levels that meet initial eligibility criteria 
within 7 days of study drug interruption and that do not recur upon study 
drug re-challenge. Note: For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT is 
defined as 45 U/L. 
- Grade 3 fever or infect ion < 5 days duration. 
- Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation 
• Grade 2 allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will not 
be considered a dose- limiting toxicity.  
• Any Grade 2 non- hematological toxicity that persists for ≥ 7 days and is 
considered sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by 
patients that it requires treatment interruption. 
• Any adverse event requiring interruption of study drug f or ≥ 7 days or which 
recurs upon drug challenge.  
 
5.5.2 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
For patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (See Section 4.1.7.1 ), DLT will be 
defined as:

7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
 
7.1.1 Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
immunotherapy, or biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving 
study drug with the exceptions noted below. If the se treatments are administered the 
patient will be removed from protocol therapy. 
 
7.1.2 Part C: Patients with ALCL who benefit from treatment (SD, PR or CR) with PF -
02341066 during Cycle 1 may at the treating investigator’s discretion receive intrathecal methotrexate in subsequent cycles of therapy.   
 
7.2 Investigational Agents 
No other investigati onal agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to be used as necessary (see Section 6.0
). 
 
7.4 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function can only be 
administered in accordance with Section 6.1  or for culture proven bacteremia or invasive 
fungal infection. The Study Chair should be notified before growth factors are initiated. 
 
7.5 Concomitant Medications The metabolism of PF -02341066 is predominantly mediated by the CYP3A isozymes in 
human liver microsomes and hepatocytes.  Co- administration with drugs that are CYP3A 
inhibitors and inducers may change the plasma concentrations of PF -02341066 in humans. 
The chronic concurrent use of potent CYP3A inhibitors and potent CYP3A inducers must be 
avoided from 7 days and 12 days, respectively, prior to the first dose of PF -02341066 until 
treatment discontinuation (See Sections 4.2.2.5 and 4.2.2.6
).  The list of potent CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers in Sections 4.2.2.5 and 4.2.2.6  are also not permitted while the patient 
is on study therapy. The topical use of these medications (if applicable) is allowed.  CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers NOT listed in Sections 4.2.2.5 and 4.2.2.6  should be avoided whenever 
possible, and therapeutic alternatives to these agents are recommended.  However, if no therapeutic alternatives are available, patients may continue to receive PF -02341066. Please 
see 
Appendix II  for a list of common substrates, inhibitors, and inducers of CYP3A4. 
 
PF-02341066 showed time -dependent inhibition of CYP3A isozymes in human liver 
microsomes. In the adult Phase 1 trial, the oral midazolam AUC was increased by 3.6 -fold 
(90% CI: 2.7- 4.9, n=13) after 28- day PF-02341066 administration at 250 mg BID, suggesting 
that PF-02341066 is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A. Therefore, caution must be exercised 
in subjects receiving PF -02341066 in combination with drugs  that are predominantly 
metabolized by CYP3A.  In particular, chronic coadministration of PF -02341066 with 
CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices must be avoided from the time of the 
first dose of PF -02341066 until treatment discontinuation. See  Section 4.2.2.5  for the list of 
CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. PF -02341066 has minimal potential to 
inhibit other human CYP isoforms such as CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6.  
 
Additionally, the concurrent use of non- prescription drugs (excluding vitamins) or herbal 
supplements is not recommended.

8.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL  AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED 
 
8.1 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluation 
All enrollment/eligibility studies must be per formed within 1 week prior to study enrollment 
(unless otherwise specified). If more than 7 calendar days elapse between the date eligibility studies outlined in Section 4.1.7
 were obtained and the start date of treatment, then the 
following studies must be repeated prior to treatment: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine.  If any of these repeat laboratory studies are outside the 
parameters require d for eligibility (labs may again be repeated within 48 -72 hours), then the 
patient is off protocol therapy.  Imaging studies, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are 
required within 14 days prior to start of protocol therapy (repeat the tumor imaging if 
necessary).

least every other day until recovery to Grade 3 (See also Section 6.0 ). 
2 If patients develop Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia to < 20,000/mm3 then CBCs should be checked 
twice weekly until recovery to Grade 3 (See also Section 6.0 ). 
3 Patients with ALCL must have CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis at study enrollment.  
4 Tumor Disease Evaluation should be obtained at the end of the next consecutive cycle after initial documentation 
of either a PR or CR. Study drug should not be interrupted unless required by Section 6.1  or 6.2.   
5 Patients with ALCL are required to have PET scans within 2 weeks prior to start of therapy and should also be 
followed with PET scans if positive at diagnosis.  Patients with NB are required to have PET scans within 2 weeks 
prior to the start of therapy only if their disease is MIBG non -avid and should be followed with PET scans if 
baseline scans are positive.  
6 Patients with neuroblastoma must have bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies. These do not need to be repeated if negative at study enrollment and patient is responding to therapy.  
7 Patients with ALCL must have bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies. These do not need to be repeated if 
negative at study enrollment and patient is responding to therapy. 
8 Phase 1: P art A – all ALCL patients, if clinically indicated; Part C – all ALCL patients 
9 Phase 1: P art A – Neuroblastoma patients only;  Part B – all neuroblastoma patients  
10 Patients of childbearing potential require a negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment and must use an 
acceptable method of birth control.  Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.  
11 Snellen Eye Chart should be used to evaluate visual acuity. If a decline in visual acuity occurs or other visual 
symptoms occur, the patient should be referred for an ophthalmologic exam.   
12 Review patient diary after completion of each treatment cycle and fax a copy, with the corresponding shuttle sheet, to the COG Statistics and Data Center (626) 447 -2204.  See Appendix XII  and XIII
. 
13 See Section 8.2  and Appendix V  for timing of PK studies.  
14 See Section 8.3  and Appendix VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X for the nature and timing of correlative biology studies.  
15 Patients with neuroblastoma must have both CT/MRI and MIBG scintigraphy performed prior to enrollment if 
the patient was enrolled with or has a history of MIBG avid tumor. Otherwise, the patient must have  both CT/MRI 
and bone scan prior to enrollment. For patients with neuroblastoma and measurable disease  by CT or MRI, lesions 
should be measured and followed using the same m odality (CT or MRI) in addition to MIBG or bone scan. For 
patients with neuroblastoma with evaluable disease  by MIBG scintigraphy or bone scan , use the same  modality 
(MIBG scintigraphy or bone scan) to image patients; CT/MRI are not required but may be per formed as clinically 
indicated. 
16 For patients with positive bone marrow involvement at time of study enrollment, evaluate  until negative per the 
schedule described in the table above.   
17 For patients with ALCL and positive CSF involvement at time of study enrollment, evaluate until negative per 
the schedule described in the table above.   
18 Baseline CNS imaging is required in patients with a prior history of CNS disease to ensure that the  patient does 
not currently have CNS disease. 
19  For consenting patients  who are receiving the oral solution ( OS). See Patient Taste Questionnaire on ADVL0912 
Case Report Form.  
20  Plain radiographs of at least one tibial growth plate should be obtained in all patients prior to the first dose of protocol therapy.  In patients with open growth plates, follow -up plain radiographs of the same growth plate(s) 
should be obtained according to Section 8.5.1
. 
21 Patients with ALCL currently enrolled on Part A of the study should follow the same evaluation schedule provided 
for patients on Part C ( i.e. End of Cycle 3, 7, 11, 17, 23, and then yearly thereafter).

8.5 Monitoring for Specific Toxicities   
8.5.1 Growth Plate Toxicity  
Patients will have a plain AP radiograph of a single proximal tibial growth plate obtained prior to the first dose of protocol therapy.  
a. If patients are found to have a closed tibial growth plate, no further radiographs 
will be required.  
b. If patients are found to have an open tibial growth plate, then repeat plain AP radiographs of the same tibial growth plate will be obtained at the end of Cycle 
3 and then approximately  every 6 months  thereafter (timed with the nearest 
disease evaluation) . 
• Patients with evidence of growth plate thickening or other changes should 
have a knee MRI performed to further assess the degree of physeal pathology 
and undergo more frequent x- ray follow up. MRI should be performed 
without contrast.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
• Patients with knee MRI changes should be managed in an individualized 
manner. Decisions regarding continuation of PF-02341066 should be made 
after discussion with the Study Chair or Study Vice -Chair and DVL 
Leadershi p, taking into account the presence of any symptoms referable to 
the knee as well as the patient’s response to PF-02341066. Consultation with 
an orthopedic surgeon may also be indicated. Plans for follow -up imaging 
will also be made on an individualized ba sis, taking into account the 
presence of symptoms at the knee or other joints as well as the decision to continue PF-02341066 or not.

10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL  FROM PROTOCOL THERAP Y AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA 
 
10.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Clinical (including physical examination), laboratory (e.g., serum tumor markers) or 
radiographic evidence of progressive disease (See Section 12.0 ). 
b) Adverse Events requiring removal from study (See Section 6.0 ). 
c) Refusal of further protocol therapy by patient/parent/guardian. 
d) Non-compliance that in the opinion of the investigator does not allow for ongoing 
participation. 
e) Physician determines it is not in the patient’s best interest.  
f) Repeated eligibility laboratory studies ( CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and 
serum creatinine)  are outside the parameters required for eligibility prior to the start of 
PF-02341066 (See Section 8.1 ). 
g)  Patients who develop a second malignant neoplasm.  
 Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off Study (see below).  Ongoing adverse events, or adverse events that emerge after the patient 
is removed from protocol therapy, but w ithin 30 days of the last dose of investigational agent, 
must be followed and reported via RDE and CTEP-AERS (if applicable).  Follow -up data 
will be required unless consent is withdrawn. 
 
10.2 Off Study Criteria  
 
a) Thirty days after the last dose of the investigational agent.  
b) Death 
c) Lost to follow -up 
d) Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission. 
e) Enrollment onto another COG therapeutic (anti- cancer) study.  
  
11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
Parts of the Study: 
Part A1: Patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
(ALCL) – Phase 1  COMPLETE 
Part A2: Patients with recurrent/refractory malignancies who have confirmed ALK fusion 
proteins, ALK mutations , ALK amplification or evidence for MET mutation or 
amplification.  Once Parts B and C are open to accrual, patients who are not eligible 
for either Part should enroll on Part A2, provided that they meet all other eligibility 
criteria for Part A2 (see Section 4.0 ). 
Part A3: Patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma, who are not eligible for Part A1 
or A2 or who cannot enroll on Part A1 because of stratum suspension or lack of 
available slots.  COMPLETE  
Part B:  Patients with ALK+ relapsed/refr actory neuroblastoma – Phase 2  
Part C: Patients with ALK+ relapsed/refractory ALCL – Phase 2  
  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
There will be three parts of the study during the phase 1 component.  Part A1 will be a 
standard phase 1 trial using the rolling 6 design for patients with relapsed/refractory solid 
tumors and ALCL.  Part A2 will be patients with recurrent/refractory malignancies that have 
confirmed ALK fusion proteins, ALK mutations or amplification, or evidence for MET 
mutation or amplification who have exhausted all standard treatment options. Patients with 
confirmed ALK fusion proteins, ALK mutations or amplification or  MET mutation or 
amplification will preferentially enroll in Part A1 when possible, and then Part A2 if not 
eligible for Part A1.  Part A3 will be for patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma, 
that do not have a confirmed ALK fusion protein, ALK mutation or ALK amplification, and 
are either not eligible for Part A1 or cannot enroll on Part A1 because of stratum suspension 
or lack of available slots.  Accrual to Part A3 will begin at dose level 1, once initial accrual 
of Part A1 patients to dose level 1 has proceeded to dose level 2.  
 
Patients in Parts A2 and A3 will be enrolled at one dose level below that of patients enrolled 
in Part A1.  If dose escalation has not yet occurred, patients in Part A2 will be enrolled at 
the starting dose level (dose level 1).  Intra -patient dose escalation of up to one dose level 
will be permitted in Part A1 (for patients with confirmed ALK or MET+ tumors), A2 and A3 
in cycles of therapy subsequent to cycle 1 if the patient is tolerating the dose at which they 
began therapy and if the next higher dose le vel has been established as tolerable in Part A1.   
 
Two to six evaluable patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors and ALCL (Part A1) will 
be entered at each dose level for determination of maximum tolerated dose (see Section 11.3 ).   
The minimum sample size required to identify the MTD (Part A1) is 9 patients, which assumes 
the starting dose is the MTD and 2 of 3 patients in the next higher dose level experience a 
DLT.  As of May 2011, 25 subjects have enrolled on Part A1. One additional non -CNS patient 
will be enrolled at dose level 4 for a total of 6 evaluable non- CNS patients at this dose level. 
If no DLT is experienced, we will dose -escalate to dose level 5.  Assuming we will require 
only 1 more patient in dose level  4, and that we proceed with dose escalation and require 6 
more evaluable patients in each of dose levels 5 and 6 before the MTD is reached, up to 17 
additional patients will be required to complete this part of the study, assuming an 
inevaluability rate o f 20%. In the unlikely event that all three of these dose levels will require 
expansion to 12 evaluable patients (see Section 11.2.2 ), a total of 39 additional patients will 
be required, assuming an inevaluability rate of 20%.  With an observed accrual rate of 2 -3 
patients per month, we expect this part of the study to be complete within an additional 5- 9 
months. 
 
Up to twenty patients may enroll onto Part A2 at each lagging dose level behind Part A1. In 
the case that an MTD is not achieved in Part A1, up to twenty patients may be enrolled onto 
Part A2 at the recommended phase 2 dose.  If the dose is not tolerated in Part A2 at a given 
dose level (greater than 1/3 of patients in the dose level experience DLTs), the stratum wil l 
be closed to further accrual.   
 
Once the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose has been determined in Part A1, Part A2 will 
remain open at this dose for the duration of the Phase 2 part of the study.  When  Parts B and 
C are open to accrual, patients who are not eligible for either Part should enroll on Part A2, 
provided that they meet all other eligibility criteria for Part A2 (see Section 4.0 ). A total of 
30 evaluable patients may enroll in Part A2 at the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose. If 20 
evaluable patients are accrued during this time with less than 3 observed responses, 
enrollment to this stratum will be discontinued. Additionally, if 0 responses are observed out 
of 10 evaluable patients with the same histologic tumor type treated at the recommended 
phase 2 dose, enrollment of that tumor type will be discontinued. A maximum of 45 patients

is anticipated in this stratum, given the current number of enrollments.  If greater than 1/3 of 
patients experience DLTs at this dose lev el, the stratum will be closed to further accrual.   All 
patients enrolled on Part A2 who meet the eligibility criteria for Parts B or C of the study 
who are evaluable for response as described in Section 11.2.3  of this protocol will be included 
in the evaluation rule.    
 
Up to three patients may enroll onto Part A3 at one dose level below the dose level that Part 
A1 patients are actively enrolling.  If two out of three patients in Part A3 experience a DLT 
at a given dose level, the stratum will be closed to further accrual.  A maximum of 15 patients 
is anticipated in this part.  
 Accrual to Parts B and C will only open once the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose has 
been determined for Part  A1. Review of patient accr ual onto recent Phase 2 solid tumor 
studies and ALK+ accruals to this study indicates the following entry rates for the various 
tumors under study can be achieved: 
 
Disease Group/Part   Patients/Year  
Neuroblastoma   15 
ALCL  3-5 
 
Assuming an inevaluability rate of 10%, a minimum of 11 patients and a maximum of 45 
patients are expected to enroll in Parts B and C.  We anticipate that the  duration of the  study 
(enrollment and evaluation) will require between 48 to 54 months.  
 
11.2 Definitions  
 
11.2.1 Evaluable For Adverse Effects  
Any patient who receives the study drug will be evaluable for Adverse Effects. 
However, for the consideration of dose escalation, patients must be fully evaluable 
for toxicity. Any patient who experiences DLT at any time during protocol the rapy 
is considered fully evaluable for Adverse Effects. Patients without DLT who receive at least 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines are also considered fully 
evaluable for Adverse Effects. Patients who are not fully evaluable for Adverse Effects at a given dose level will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose 
The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one- third of patients 
experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy. In the event that tw o 
DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are different classes of Adverse Effects 
(e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), expansion of the cohort to 12 patients 
will be considered if all of the following conditions are met:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does  not appear to be related to dose 
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  
 If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose -limiting 
toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.  
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
11.2.3  Evaluability for Response 
Any patient who is enrolled and receives at least one dose of PF -02341066 will be 
considered evaluable for response provided: (1) the patient demonstrates progressive 
disease or death while on protocol therapy; or (2) the patient is observed on protocol 
therapy for at least one cycle and the tumor is not removed surgically prior to the 
time complete response or partial response is confirmed, or (3) the patient 
demonstrates a complete or partial response as confirmed according to protocol 
criteria. Patients who demonstrate a complete or partial response confirmed by 
central review will be considered to have experienced a response for the application of the rule given in Section 11.4
. Two objective status determinations are requi red 
to confirm best response ( Section 12.8 ). All other patients will be considered non-
responders. All patients considered to have a response (CR or PR) must have imaging studies reviewed centrally at the COG. Centers will be notified by the COG about 
requests for scans of patients with stable disease. See 
Section 8.4  regarding shipping 
instructions. Preliminary assessment of activity using institutionally provided tumor 
measurements will be entered into CDUS quarterly. The central review by COG will 
be provided as the final reviewed assessment of response when such becomes 
available.  
 
11.3 Dose Escalation and Determination of MTD  
The rolling six phase 1 trial design will be used for the conduct of Part A1 of this study.19 
Two to six patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but  with 
tolerability data pending at the current dose level.  Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six 
has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the num ber of participants at risk for developing a DLT 
(i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity). For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is available for all three 
when the fourth pa rticipant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and the 
fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is not yet available for one 
or more of the first three participants and no DLT has been observed, or if one DLT has  been 
observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if two or more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de- escalated. This process is repeated for participants 
five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de- escalation rules have not 
been fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled onto the study.  
 
The following table provides the decision rules for enrolling a patient at (i) the current dose level (ii) at an escalated dose level, (iii) at a de- escalated dose level, or whether the study is 
suspended to accrual:

* If six patients already entered at next lower dose level, the MTD has been defined.  
**If final dose level has been reached, the recommended dose has been reached.  
 
 
If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then 
the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped.  
 
Since this agent is not expected to be associated with dose- limiting myelosuppression, at least 
2 of every cohort of 3 or 5 of every cohort of 6 patients must be evaluable for hematologic 
toxicity. If hematologic dose limiting toxicity is observed, all subsequent patients who are 
enrolled in Part A1 must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity. Patients in Part A 2 or A3 
may be enrolled irrespective of whether or not they have bone marrow involvement. 
 
In addition to determination of the MTD, a descriptive summary of all toxicities will be 
reported. 
 
Results of pharmacokinetic testing will also be reported, includi ng clearance, C max, Tmax, Css, 
and terminal half -life. Single -dose AUC, trough estimation, and estimate a t½ of 
accumulation will be obtained.  
 
While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of PF-02341066, patients will 
have disease evaluations performed as indicated in Section 8.1 .  Disease response will be 
assessed according to RECIST criteria for pa tients with solid tumors, and will be reported 
descriptively.

11.4 Phase 2 Evaluation in ALK+ Neuroblastoma (Part B) and ALK+ ALCL (Part C) 
 
11.4.1 Study Design  
 
The best response of disease to PF-02341066 will be examined separately in each of 
these two parts. In Parts B and C , the following Simon’s optimal two stage design20 
will be used.  
 
 Cumulative Number 
of Responses Decision 
Stage 1: Enter 10 patients  0 Terminate the trial: agent ineffective  
 1 or more Inconclusive result, continue 
trial(proceed to stage 2)    
Stage 2: Enter 10 additional 
patients 2 or less      Terminate the trial: agent ineffective  
 3 or more Terminate the trial: agent effective  
 
PF-02341066 will not be considered of sufficient interest for further evaluation in a 
disease category if the true response rate is 5% and of sufficient activity if the true response rate is 25%. If PF-02341066 has a true response rate of 5%, the rule 
described above will identify it of sufficient activity for further study with probability 
0.07 (type I error), and the trial will have an expected sample size of 14 with 60% 
probability of early termination.  If PF -02341066 has a true response rate of 25%, 
the rule described above will identify it of sufficient activity for further study with probability 0.88 (power against the alternative hypothesis P = 0.25). 
 Once the trial has terminated in Part B, enrollment ont o Part C will be evaluated for 
closure.   
 
Response in all patients with solid tumors will be determined according to RECIST 
as defined in the protocol as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) , or as described in Section 12.0
 for 
other categories of responses assessment,  and reported as final results.  A report on 
the efficacy assessment will be posted on the completed disease stratum as part of 
the semi-annual study committee meeting book report. 
 It is anticipated that a multi- strata Phase 2 study will open group wide upon 
completion of stage 1 enrollment in Part B.  Data collected from any patients enrolled 
at the MTD or recommended  phase 2 dose or enrolled onto  Parts B or C will be 
utilized in the Phase 2 study. 
 
11.4.2 Method of Analysis  
Response criteria are described in Section 12.0 . Response rates will be calculated as 
the percent of patients whose best response is a CR or PR and confidence intervals 
will be constructed according to the method of Chang.21 A responder is defined as a 
patient who achieves a best confirmed response (as defined in Section 12.8 ) of PR 
or CR on the study.

11.5 Inclusion of Children, Women and Minorities  
The study is open to all participants regardle ss of gender or ethnicity.  Review of accrual to 
past COG studies of new agents demonstrates the accrual of both genders and all NIH -
identified ethnicities to such studies.  Efforts will be made to extend the accrual to a 
representative population, but in a Phase I/II trial which will accrue a limited number of  
patients in the Phase I portion, a balance must be struck between patient safety considerations 
and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of 
clinical research on the other. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or 
ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be perfor med 
to investigate those differences more fully.  
 
11.6 Pharmacokinetic and Correlative Studies  
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of PF -02341066 will be 
performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic 
parameters. The PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, 
including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit).    
Due to small patient numbers, the correlative studies are expected to be descriptive and 
exploratory in nature.  The results of these studies are expected to generate hypotheses for 
testing in future studies.   
 Pharmacogenomic data, ALK status, and MRD st atus will be reported descriptively.  Where 
possible, we will attempt to preliminarily assess correlation between ALK status and 
response to PF -02341066, and MRD status and response to PF-02341066.  
  
 
 
12.0  EVALUATION CRITERIA 
 
12.1 Common Terminology Criteri a for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting beginning October 
1, 2011.  All appropriate treatment areas shoul d have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov). 
 
12.2 Response Criteria  
As outlined, patients will be assigned to one of the following categories for assessment of 
response:  a) solid tumor and measurable disease (Section 12.3 ); b) solid tumor and evaluable 
disease (Section 12.4); c) neuroblastoma with MIBG positive lesions ( Section 12.5 ); d) 
neuroblastoma with bone marrow involvement ( Section 12.6); or e) ALCL ( Section 12.7 ).  
Note:  Neuroblastoma patients who do not have MIBG positive lesions or bone  marrow 
involvement should be assessed for response as solid tumor patients with measurable or evaluable disease.   
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
12.3 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors and Measurable Disease  
This study will use a minor modification of the  (RECIST) Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors from the NCI for assessment of radiographic response. 
 
12.3.1 Measurable Disease  
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension with the longest diameter at least 10 mm. The investigator will identify 
up to 10 measurable lesions to be followed for response. Previously irradiated lesions 
that have not demonstrated clear progression post radiation do not qualify as being 
measurable or evaluable.  
 
Serial measu rements of lesions are to be done with appropriate imaging modalities.  
Bone scans or MIBG scans cannot be used to measure lesions (see Section 12.5  for 
response criteria for MIBG).  The same method of assessment is to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
 
12.3.2 Quantification of Disease Burden  
The sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the disease measurement.  
 
12.3.3 End-of-Cycle Response  
 
a) Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target and non -target lesions.  If immunocytology is 
available, no disease must be detected by that methodology.  
 
b) Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study enrollment.  
 
c) Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started.  
 
d) Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or mo re new lesions, or evidence of laboratory or clinical 
progression. 
 
12.3.4 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined fr om the sequence of the 
objective statutes described in Section 12.8 .  
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
12.4 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors and Evaluable Disease  
 
12.4.1 Evaluable Disease  
The presence of at least one lesion that cannot be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension.  Such lesions may be evaluable by nuclear medicine techniques, 
immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers or other reliable measures.  
 
12.4.2 Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all evaluable disease.  
 
12.4.3 Partial response  
Partial responses cannot be determined in patients with evaluable disease.  
 
  12.4.4 Stable Disease (SD)  
That which does not qualify as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (P R), or 
Progressive Disease.  
 
12.4.5 Progressive Disease (PD)  
The appearance of one or more new lesions or evidence of laboratory, clinical, or 
radiographic progression. 
 
12.4.6 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
objective statutes described in Section 12.8
. 
  
12.5  Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with MIBG Positive Lesions 
 
 12.5.1  MIBG Positive Lesions  
Patients who have a positive MIBG scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for MIBG response. The use of 
123I for MIBG imaging is recommended for all scans. If 
the patient has only one MIBG positive lesion and that lesion was radiated, a biopsy 
must be done at least 4 weeks after radiation was completed and must show viable 
neuroblastoma. 
 
  12.5.2  The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by the treating institution:  
 
 
 Complete response (CR)  
 Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
 
Partial Response (PR) 
Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with persistence of other MIBG positive lesions 
 
 Stable disease (SD)  
 No change in MIBG scan in number of positiv e lesions 
  
 Progressive disease (PD)  
 Development of new MIBG positive lesions 
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
12.5.3 The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy for 
study endpoint. See Section 8.4  for details on transferring images to the Imaging 
Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by the treating institution for end of course response assessments.
 
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated  for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by adding the score of all the segments. See diagram 
of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time point by 
the corresponding pre- treatment absolute score. The relative score of each patient is 
calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  If 
morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspiration is 
present at enrollment, no tumor cells can be detected by routine morphology on 
two subsequent bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least 3 weeks apart to be considered a Complete Response . 

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced). 
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
12.5.4 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
objective statutes described in Table 3  in Section 12.8 . 
 
 
12.6 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
12.6.1 Bone Marrow Involvement  
Bone marrow obtained within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment with tumor cells 
seen on routine morphology (not by NSE staining only) of bilateral aspirate or biopsy 
on at least one of the bone marrow samples.  
 
Bone Marrow responses determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone marrow 
biopsies and aspirates are defined as follows:  
 
• Complete Response (CR)  
No tumor cells detectable by routine morphology on 2 consecutive bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed at least 4 weeks (± 5 days) apart.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD)  
o In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone marrow by morphology 
have progressive disease if there is a doubling in the amount of tumor in the 
marrow AND a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by morphology. (For example, a patient entering with 5% tumor in marrow by morpholog y 
must increase to ≥ 25% tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 30% tumor must increase to > 60%). 
o In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma in bone marrow will be defined as progressive disease if tumor is detected in 2 consecutive 
bone marrow biopsies or aspirations done at least 4 weeks (± 5 days) apart. 
 
• Stable Disease  
Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet the criteria for either complete response or progressive disease.

   07/27/17 
12.7 Response Criteria for P atients with ALCL  
 
12.7.1 Complete Response  
Disappearance of all evidence of disease from all sites for at least 4 weeks. This will 
be determined by PE and imaging. Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy must be normal and 
any macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no 
longer be present. PET scans must be negative if initially positive.  
 
12.7.2  Complete Response Unconfirmed  
A residual lymph node mass > 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by >75% in sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD), or any residual lesions in organs that have decreased by >75% and with a 
negative PET scan and SUV <3. Patients with only residual positive bone lesions on 
PET scans will be considered in CRu. Patients with bone involvement may have 
positive lesions on PET scans for some time; therefore, these patients will be 
considered in CRu if the other residual lesions have disappeared, or of the residual 
lymph node mass or masses >1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter have regressed 
by >75% in sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD).   
12.7.3  Partial Response  
≥50% decrease in the SPD of the lesions. No new lesions. 
 
12.7.4  No Response (Stable Disease)  
Failure to qualify for a PR. No new lesions.  
12.7.5  Progressive disease  
≥25% increase in the size of any lesions or appearance of new lesions. 
 
 
12.8 Best Response  
Two objective status determinations of disease status, by CT or MRI, obtained on two 
consecutive determinations, separated by at least a 3 week time period, are required to 
determine the patient’s overall best response.  Two objective status determinations of CR 
before progression are required for best response of CR.  Two determinations of PR or better 
before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, are required for a best response of PR.  Two 
determinations of stable/no response or better before progression, but not qualifying as CR or PR, are required for a best response of stable/no response; if the first objective status is 
unknown, only one such determination is required.  Patients with an objective status of progression on or before the second evaluations (the first evaluation is the first radiographic 
evaluation after treatment has been administered) will have a best response of progressive 
disease.  Best response is unknown if the patient does not qualify for a best response of 
progressive disease and if all objective statuses after the first determination and before progression are unknown.

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done 
to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies 
using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a 
trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the data collection packet for this 
protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information about 
expedited reporting. 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received 
an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade 
(severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience (expectedness) 
of the adverse event; and 3) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization w as 
associated with the event.  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but 
is actually being tested for indic ations not included in the approved package label. 
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute 
commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1: Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The 
descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 4.0 will be used 
for AE reporting beginning October 1, 2011. All appropriate treatment locations 
should have access to a copy of the CTCAE  version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Step 2:  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite. Note:  This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol 
treatment.  Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment 
and is attributed (possibly, probably, o r definitely) to the agent(s) must also be 
reported according to the instructions above. 
 
Step 4:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  Expected events are those that 
have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent.  An 
adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, 
when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in bold font 
in the table of toxicities listed in the drug information section ( Section 9.1.9 ) of 
the protocol.  
 
Step 5:  Review Table A in this section to determine if: 
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or 
• there are any protocol- specific exceptions to the reporting requirements.

1 Adverse events with attribution of possible, probable, or definite that occur greater than 30 days after the 
last dose of treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND or non -CTEP IND require reporting as follows:  
CTEP -AERS 24-hour notification (via CTEP -AERS f or CTEP IND agents; via e- mail to COG AE Coordinator for 
agents in non-CTEP IND studies) followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• Grade 3 unexpected events with hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 4 unexpected events  
• Grade 5 expected events and unexpected events  
 
2 Although a CTEP -AERS 24-hour notification is not required for death clearly related to progressive disease, a full 
report is required as outlined in the table.  
 
3    Please see exceptions below under section  entitled “Additional Instructions or Exceptions.”  
March 2005  
 
Note:  All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of causality.  Attribution 
to treatment or other cause should be provided.  
• Expedited AE reporting timelines defined:  
 “24 hours; 5 calendar days” – The investigator must initially report the AE via CTEP-AERS (via 
e-mail to COG AE Coordinator for agents in non- CTEP IND studies) within 24 hours  of learning 
of the event followed by a complete CTEP-AERS report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -
hour report.  
 “5 calendar days” - A complete CTEP-AERS report on the AE must be submitted within 5 
calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.  
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates hospitalization (or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be reported regardless of attribution and designation 
as expected or unexpected with the exception of any events identified as protocol -specific expedited 
adverse event reporting exclusions. 
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via CTEP-AERS if the event occurs following treatment with an agent 
under a CTEP IND. 
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial registration 
on all reports. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP -AERS Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 1 Trials 
Utilizing an Agent under a CTEP- IND or Non -CTEP IND:  
 
• Any death that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment with an investigational agent 
which can be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not due to cancer 
recurrence/progression must be reported via CTEP-AERS for an agent under a CTEP or non- CTEP 
IND agent per the timelines outlined in the table above. 
 
• Myelosuppression, including Grade 4 lymphopenia , does not require expedited reporting  whether it 
is expected or  unexpected, unless it is associated with hospitalization . 
 As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP-AERS reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospitalization is associated w ith the recurring AE. 
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A
) to NCI via 
the web at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ CTEP-AERS.htm  
(Telephone the COG AE Coordinator at: 626-241-1545 within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event  if the CTEP-AERS 24-Hour Notification web- based application is unavailable) 
and by telephone call to the Study Chair. Once internet connectivity is restored, a 24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP-AERS by the original 
submitter at the site.  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 
calendar days  of learning of the event. 
 
 
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 
13.3.1 CTEP-AERS Reporting 
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the NCI’s Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System ( CTEP-AERS) that can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov. 
 
An CTEP-AERS report must be submitted e lectronically via the CTEP-AERS 
Web-based application located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_event
s.htm.  If prompted to enter a sponsor e- mail address, please type in: 
COGCAdEERS@childrensoncologygroup.org. 
 Fax supporting documentation to COG (fax # 626-241- 1795; attention: COG AE 
Coordinator).  ALWAYS include the ticket number on all faxed documents . 
 
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note: These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG data submission 
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS reporting.  
 
13.4.1 If an adverse event occurs more than once in a cycle of therapy only the most severe 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
grade of the even t should be reported. 
 
13.4.2 If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one cycle of therapy, 
only the most severe grade should be reported. 
 13.4.3 The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) grade of the Adverse Effects.  
 13.4.4 The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
eligibility criteria level or ≤ Grade 1 level, whichever level is greater (note that the 
resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the resolution 
date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 13.4.5 An adverse event that persists from one cycle to another should only be reported 
once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent cycle. An adverse event 
which resolves and then recurs during a different cycle, must be reported each cycle 
it recurs.  
 
13.5 Other Recipients of Adverse Event Reports  
 
13.5.1  Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP-AERS reporting ( Section 13.2
) should 
be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the data form packet (See 
Section 14.1 ). 
 13.5.2 COG will forward reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to the 
FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for industry 
sponsored trials).  
 
13.5.3 Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to the 
local policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS  
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients on NCI -sponsored trials following their chemotherapy for cancer must be 
reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm reporting requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the following 
information within two weeks of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after treatment for 
cancer on NCI- sponsored trials:  
 
• a completed CTEP -AERS report; 
• Non-treatment related cases of AML/MDS for CTCAE v4.0 should be reported 
using “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - 
Other, specify.”  
• To grade a non life -threatening event for “Myelodysplastic syndrome”, use 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other, 
specify” where the specified term is MDS.  
 
Note:  If a patient has been enrolled in  more than one NCI -sponsored study, the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE S ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL0912   
   07/27/17 
CTEP-AERS report must be submitted for the most recent trial. 
 
14.0 RECORDS, REPORTING, AND DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 
14.1 Categories of Research Records  
Research records for this study can be divided into three categories : 
 
1. Non-computerized Information:  Roadmaps, Pathology Reports, Surgical Reports  
and Patient Taste Questionnaire . These forms are faxed, with the corresponding 
shuttle sheet, to the Statistics & Data Center at (626) 447 -2204. 
 
2. Reference Labs, Biopathology Reviews, and QARC data:  These data accompany 
submissions to these centers, which for ward their data electronically to the COG 
Statistics & Data Center.  
 
3. Computerized Information Electronically Submitted:  All other data will be entered in the COG Remote Data Entry System with the aid of schedules and worksheets 
(essentially paper copies of the RDE screens) provided in the data form packet.  
 
See separate Data Form Packet, which includes submission schedule.  
 
14.2 CDUS 
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) version 3.0. 
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means.  Reports are 
due January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31.  This is not a responsibility of institutions participating in this trial.  
 
14.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
Data and safety is ensured by several int egrated components including the COG Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
14.3.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group 
policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. I n brief, the role of 
the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is to protect the interests of patients 
and the scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC consists of a 
chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one con sumer 
representative; the lead statistician of the developmental therapy scientific committee; and a member from the NCI. The DSMC meets at least every 6 months 
to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the Phase 1 and 2 
DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for working with the study statistician to 
prepare study reports for review by the DSMC. The DSMC will provide 
recommendations to the COG Developmental Therapeutics Chair and the Group 
Chair for each study reviewed to change the study or to continue the study unchanged. Data and Safety Committee reports for institutional review boards can 
be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web site.  
 
14.3.2 Monitoring by the Study Chair and Developmental Therapeutics Leadership 
The study chair will monitor the study regularly and enter evaluations of patients’ eligibility, evaluability, and dose limiting toxicities into the study database. In 
addition, study data and the study chair’s evaluations will be reviewed by the 
Developmental Therapeutics Chair, Vice Chair and Statistician on a weekly 
conference call.

APPENDIX IV: PF-02341066 PEDIATRIC ORAL SOLUTION CALCULATION  
 
 
To calculate dosing volumes for each patient based on BSA, the following formula should be used: 
 
Dosing Volume (mL) = Prescribed Dose (mg/m2) x BSA (m2) 
       25 (mg/mL)  
 Calculate d dosing volumes should be rounded up to the nearest 0.1 mL for the actual deliverable dose. 
 
Examples:  
• Patient BSA 0.75 m
2, Dose Level 1  Dosing volume = 3.0 mL BID 
         Dosing Volume (mL) = (100 mg/m2 x 0.75 m2) / (25 mg/mL) = 3 mL 
 
• Patient BSA 0.75 m2, Dose Level 3  Dosing volume = 5.0 mL BID 
               Calculated  Volume (mL) = (1 65 mg/m2 x 0.75 m2) / (25 mg/mL) = 4.95 mL 
Dosing Volume (mL) =  5 mL  (rounded up to nearest 0.1 mL) 
 
 
 
Note: For patients receiving PF -02341066 PIC refer to Appendix III A and FC refer to Appendix IIIB .

Sample Processing Procedures   
1. Label the cryovial tube with the patient’s study registration number, the study I.D. (ADVL0912), and the date and time the 
sample was drawn; please label as “plasma ”. Affix storage label to 2 mL cryovial (vertically).  
2. Draw 2 mL of blood  into a 4-mL K2EDTA (lavender top) Vacutainer tube . Once collected, samples should be processed 
immediately and kept out of direct sunlight due to the light sensitive nature of PF -02341066.  
3. Mix the blood with the anticoagula nt by gently inverting the tube 6 to 8 times.  
4. Place sample on wet ice.  
5. Centrifuge  the blood samples at approximately 1700g for 10 minutes at 4oC to harvest the plasma.    
6. Remove the plasma by transfer pipette and transfer ~1 mL of plasma into the 2 mL pre -labeled cryovial. Cap the tubes tightly.   
7. Record the date and time of collection for each sample on this form.  A copy of this form must accompany the sample(s) at 
time of shipment.  
8. Place the cryovial containing the plasma inside the cryovial storage box  provided and store the plasma at -20 to -70oC 
within 1 hour of collection until shipment.  
One copy of this Pharmacokinetic Study Form should be faxed to the study research coordinator with the corresponding shuttle 
sheet, to the Operations Center at (626)  447-2204. A second copy should be sent with the samples to Covance at the address listed 
in Appendix V -A.  See Appendix V -A for detailed guidelines for packaging and shipping PK samples to Covance.   
 
If this form will be used as a source document, the site personnel who collected the samples must sign and date this form below:

APPENDIX VII: NEUROBLASTOMA CORRELATIVE BIOLOG Y STUDIES  
 
1. COMPREHENSIVE DNA RESEQUENCING OF ALK  
Tumor tissue will be requested for all research subjects. The optimal sample will be tumor at the time 
of study enrollment, but tumor tissue from diagnosis or at any other point during therapy prior to 
treatment with PF -02341066 will be accepted. This can be archived tissue (frozen or paraffin) from 
the institution or from the Biopathology Center (BPC) for those subjects enrolled on ANBL00B1. If 
a tumor block is not available, unstained slides may be shipped instead. DNA extraction and Sanger -
based re- sequencing of the 29 coding exons of ALK and 500bp of the promoter region will be 
performed at CHOP.  
 
2. DEFINE ALK ALLELIC STATUS  
We will define whole genome DNA copy number status as well as ALK allelic using the Illumina 
HH550K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array.6,22,23 The primary goal of this assay is to 
determine if the ALK and/or MYCN loci are amplified. For samples in which allelic gain or amplification exist in the context of a mutation, we will also design allele specific quantitative PCR 
probes to determine if the mutated allele is somatically gained.  
 
3. DEFINE ALK TRANSLOCATION STATUS***  
We will perform FISH for ALK translocations using the LSI ALK Dual Color, Break Apart 
Rearrangement probe (Abbott -Vysis) either on touch preps or paraffin- embedded tumor from all 
available neuroblastoma primary tumors gather for experiments #1 and #2 above.  
***These studies will only be pursued if ongoing investigations show that ALK translocations are a 
significant mechanism for ALK activation in neuroblastoma.  
 
4. DETERMINE THE MALIGNANT TRANSFORMING PROPERTIES OF ALL ALK 
MUTATIONS IDENTIFIED 
To determine the functional consequences of various candidate ALK mutations, we will engineer 
mutant full -length ALK cDNAs using site- directed mutagenesis. We will then over -express these 
constructs in a mammalian neural -crest derived cell line and assay for malignant transformation.  We 
will use a lentiviral system for stable integration of alk constructs into retinal pigment epithelial cells 
that express telomerase (RPE1 -hTERT) and look for evidence of malignant transformation.
24 We will 
then screen for transformation in vitro  using standard assays.  
 
5. DETERMINE THE BIOCHEMICAL CONSEQUENCES OF ALK ACTIVATION BY 
SURVEYING DOWNSTREAM SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN ALK-MUTANT SAMPLES  
We will determine which of the major canonical signaling pathways are activated as a consequence 
of mutant ALK. Specifically, we will assess native and phosphorylated ALK, STAT3, AKT, ERK, and SHP2 expression on all available tumor tissue from patients enrolled on this trial. We will 
compare the signaling properties of the various mutations and look for differential signaling patterns 
that may predict increased sensitivity to growth inhibition by A LK inhibition. 
 
6. EXPLORE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE TO PF -02341066 AT TIME OF 
DISEASE PROGRESSION ON THIS STUDY  
We will collect bone marrow samples before and during treatment with PF -02341066, flow -sort for 
tumor cells, and establish cell lines in  culture. These cell line models will then be used for direct re-
sequencing of ALK as well as for in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity assays to explore mechanisms of potential acquired drug resistance.

APPENDIX XIV: ORAL SOLUTION ADMINISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS  
 
ADMINISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS  
 
1 Study Site Staff should review information contained on drug label as well as dosing and administration 
instructions with patient and/or patient caregiver to ensure proper dispensing of medication.  Particular 
attention should be focused on how to accurately draw desired dose into corre ct oral syringe(s) and how to 
read syringe graduations to avoid patient mis -dosing. 
 
Note that oral solution  will be packaged together with a press -in-bottle adaptor and re-usable dosing syringes.  
2 Each morning and evening dose should be taken at about the same time each day, approximately 12 hours 
apart.  The dose may be taken with or without food or beverage.  
 
3 Remove the bottle from the refrigerator and gather the appropriate oral syringe(s) and any other supplies as 
directed by Study Site Staff.   
Before using dosing syringes, ensure that each syringe and its components are clean and dry. The plunger 
within each syringe should be pressed all the way closed.  
 
Note once a bottle of oral solution  has been opened, it should only be used for 90 days unle ss additional in -
use stability data has been made available.  
4 When using a bottle for the first time, unscrew the bottle cap and insert the press in bottle adaptor (PIBA) 
into the bottle opening to help withdraw the medication.   Once inserted the press in bottle adaptor will not be taken out.  
 
5 Open the bottle and ensure that the bottle adaptor is securely in place.  
 
6 Select a clean, dry dosing syringe and insert the syringe tip into the bottle adaptor.  
 
7 Pick up the bottle with one hand while holding the dosing syringe firmly in place with the other hand.  It is 
recommended that the thumb of the hand holding the dosing syringe be placed against the top of the syringe 
barrel while the fingers grip the sides of the barrel.  The dosing syringe tip  should still be firmly inserted into 
the bottle adaptor.  
 
8 Turn bottle and syringe set -up upside down so bottle is on top of syringe.   
Slowly pull back on the plunger to draw a small amount of solution into the syringe (about 2 mL).  Check the 
syringe for trapped air bubbles.  If air bubble(s) are present in the syringe, return the bottle to the upright 
position and then remove the dosing syringe from the adaptor.  
 
9 Expel trapped air bubble(s) in the syringe by holding the syringe with the tip pointed  upwards and gently tap 
on the side of the syringe barrel to move air bubbles into the tip of the syringe.  Slowly depress the syringe plunger to expel the air from the syringe tip.  Ensure that no further air bubbles are present and that the solution in the syringe completely fills the tip of the syringe.  
 
Note that trapped air in the syringe will cause an inaccurate volume of medication to be delivered.  
10 Re-insert the dosing syringe tip into the bottle adaptor and invert the bottle and syringe set -up again.  
Continue to slowly pull back on the plunger and withdraw the prescribed amount of solution into the syringe.  
  
11 When the desired amount of solution is contained within the syringe, return the bottle to the upright position 
and remove the syringe. 
 
12 If additional dose syringes need to be prepared, repeat steps 6 -11. 
 
13 After preparing dosing syringe(s), medication should be delivered promptly to patient.   
   ADVL0912 
   7/27/17 
If the patient cannot be dosed immediately with medication in syringes, wrap each syringe with aluminum 
foil to protect medication from light exposure and place in refrigerator.  Oral solution  may be stored in 
supplied syringes for no more than 24 hours.  
 
If the patient has sensitivity to cold temperatures, then the oral solution may be held in syringes for up to 24 
hours at room temperature. As mentioned above, the syringes must be wrapped with aluminum foil to protect medication from light exposure.  
 
14 To deliver the dose, place the tip of the oral dosing syringe into the patient’s mouth.  With the patient’s head 
tilted slightly back, slowly push the plunger to expel the solution.   
To avoid choking, be careful not to expel the dose directly into the back  of the throat.  
 
15 Recap the bottle and return it to refrigerator.  
 
16 Complete Crizotinib Oral Solution Taste Fe edback Questionnaire ( see the ADVL0912 Case Report Forms ) 
within 10 minutes of dosing patient.  Questionnaire is to be completed on the following schedule to capture 
patients taste responses to the oral solution after dose administration.  
• First administration of oral solution  
• Once a week during first month of a dministration of oral solution  
• Every visit to treating institution after first month of administration of oral solution  
 
17 Wash hands. Clean the syringe by removing the plunger and rinsing the barrel and plunger with water.  
Allow the barrel and plunger to air dry or use a clean paper towel or clean cloth to dry.    
When dry, push the plunger back into the syringe barrel in preparation for next dose.  
 
18 As per guidance from Study Site Staff, bring any unused medication and used syringes in a sealed plastic bag 
to your next clinic appointment for appropriate disposal.  The sealable plastic bag should be labeled as 
“waste” and kept away from the reach of children or pets.  
 
 
 
NOTE:  
• If the patient vomits the dose, do not repeat the dose at that time.  Wait until the next regularly 
scheduled time to administer the dose.  
• If a dose is missed, take a dose as soon as you remember, but never more than 6 hours after 
the time it was originally due.   
• If you have any questions, contact your provider.

SAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT / PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR 
PARTICIPATION IN RES EARCH 
[FOR PART A2 (PHASE 2 COMPONENT) OF THE STUDY ONLY]   
 
 
ADVL0912 , A Phase 1/2 Study of PF -02341066, an Oral Small Molecule Inhibitor 
of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and c-MET, in Children with 
Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma 
 
When we use “you” and “I” in this consent form, we mean you or your child. 
 
This study is a clinical trial (a research study involving patients, or protocol) of an experimental new drug 
for cancer. We are asking if you want to participate in this study because there is not a standard treatment 
for your cancer  at this point. Clinical trials only include patients who choose to take part. Your participation 
in this study is entirely voluntary. Please read the consent form carefully. You will be given a copy of it to 
keep if you decide to participate in this study. You may discuss your decision with your friends and family 
if you would like.  
 
This study is being carried out by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Phase I Consortium. COG is an international research group that consists of more than 200 hospitals that treat children with cancer in the 
United States, Canada, Australia, and Switzerland, and The Phase I Consortium is the group of 21 hospitals within COG that does phase 1/2 studies like this one.  It is common medical practice to treat children with 
cancer on research studies like this one.  Participation in this study will be limited to the Consortium 
institutions and five additional hospitals within COG . 
 This is a Phase 1 /2 study of a drug called PF -02341066.  PF -02341066 is a drug that in laboratory studies 
can block or inhibit two proteins called c -met and Alk.  These proteins may be important in the growth of 
certain types of cancer cells.  PF -02341066 is considered experimental because the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) have not approved it.  
 
You are participating in the phase 2 portion of this trial.  In this part of the trial, we use the highest tolerable 
dose studied in the phase 1 portion to assess the anti -tumor effect of PF -02341066 in patients with an 
abnormality in the ALK gene that can not be cured by any known standard treatment 
 You are being asked to participate in this study because you have a recurrent or progressive tumor or 
lymphoma that cannot be cured by any known standard treatment. When a cancer comes back (recurs) or 
does not respond to therapy, your doctor may recommend other anti -cancer drugs (chemotherapy), surgery, 
or radiation therapy. For certain cancers, a combination of one or more of these approaches is considered standard treatment. However, for other cancers, for cancers that again come back, or for cancer for which 
therapy is no longer working, the best treatment is not known.

Why is this study being done?  
We are testing new experimental drugs such as PF -02341066 in the hopes of finding a drug that may be 
effective against recurrent tumors or lymphoma.  
 The goals of this study are: 
 
• To learn what kind of side effects PF -02341066 can cause; 
• To learn more about the pharmacology (how your body handles the drug) of PF-02341066; 
• To learn more about the biology of PF-02341066; 
• To determine whether PF-02341066 is a beneficial treatment for your tumor. 
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
There will be up to 45 patients participating in Part A 2 of this study.  About ___ will be treated at this 
hospital. 
 
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?   
Before you begin the study …  
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  These 
exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study.  
If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study 
doctor.   
• A medical history  
• Physical exam  
• Eye exam  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature) 
• Blood tests 
• Urine tests  
• Test of bone marrow (if you have lymphoma)  
• Pregnancy test (if you are a woman who could have children) 
• Plain X-ray of one or both of your lower legs 
• Electrocardiogram (EKG, which tests the electrical impulses of your heart)  
• We will also do whatever X -rays, CT scans, MRI or other tests are needed to check your 
tumor or to check whether tumor has spread to your brain since those patients may not 
participate in the study.  
During the study …  
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, PF-
02341066 will be given by mouth twice a day for 28 days. This entire period is called a cycle.  You may 
continue to receive PF -02341066 unless you develop serious side effects or your tumor worsens.   
 
You will also have the following tests and procedures during the study.  They are part of regular cancer 
care. They are being done more often because you are in this study. 
• Physical exam  
• Eye exam  
• Blood tests 
• Urine tests  
  ADVL0912 
  07/27/17
  
  Page 3 
• Tests to evaluate the status of your tumor based on your tumor type and location (e.g., CT 
or MRI scans, MIBG scans, PET scans, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies)  
 
These tests are all necessary to make sure that you are not having unsafe side effects and to see whether or 
not your tumor is responding to PF-02341066. 
 
Copies of the films used to check your child’s disease may be sent to central review centers as part of COG 
quality control.  Your name and other identifying information will be removed from these films prior to 
review. 
 
In addition, we will monitor one or both of your lower legs with a plain X -ray prior to starting treatment 
with PF-02341066.  If your bones have stopped growing, no further X -rays of the lower legs will be taken. 
If your bones are still growing, we will check your lower legs for changes at the end of Cycle 3, and then 
approximately every 6 months thereafter with a plain X- ray. Should we detect changes, we may perform 
an MRI to better describe the changes. These tests  are performed, because in some growing animals that 
received PF -02341066 and other related drugs, changes in the structure of the growing bones were 
observed.  
You will be given a Patient Diary at the beginning of each cycle of PF -02341066. Use the diary to record 
the date and time you take the drug, side effects you experience and other medications you are taking.  This diary should be returned to clinic, along with the medication bottle (even if it is empty) before starting another cycle. This will help us to know how much of the drug you take and how it made you feel. 
 The PF-02341066 will be given as a capsule or liquid solution by mouth. Since we do not have information 
on how well the medicine is absorbed, if you vomit the medication it should not be taken again.  
 
Questionnaire:  
If you are receiving the PF -02341066 as a liquid by mouth, we would like to ask you to fill out a short 
questionnaire at the time of the first dose, and then once per week for the first month, and then at every visit 
thereafter so we can learn more about how the drug tastes. This questionnaire will take about 20 minutes to 
fill out each time.   The study staff will collect some information from your chart about your age and what 
kind (if any) of PF- 02341066 capsules or liquid y ou may have received in the past. The questionnaire is 
optional. The information learned would not change the way you are treated, and the results will not be returned to you.  
 
______/______ Yes, I agree to take part in the questionnaire.  
______/______ No, I do not agree to take part in the questionnaire. 
 
We would also like to do some extra tests called pharmacokinetic studies and biologic studies.  These tests 
will help us learn more about PF -02341066 and may help children who receive this drug in the future. The 
information learned would not change the way you are treated, and the results of these tests will not be returned to you.  The pharmacokinetic studies are required and the biology studies are optional. You do not have to do those tests if you do not want to.  Although these tests are a very important part of how we will 
better learn to use this drug, it is your decision as to whether or not you agree to participate in these tests.  
 Pharmacokinetic Studies  
During the study blood samples will be collected to determine how much of the PF-02341066 is in your 
blood (pharmacokinetics).  These samples are about 2 mL (approximately ½ teaspoon) of blood each. A 
  ADVL0912 
  07/27/17
  
  Page 4 
single sample will be obtained before your first dose of the drug on Day 1 and additional samples will be 
obtained between day 15 and day 28 after you begin taking the drug in Cycle 1. These additional samples 
will be obtained before and at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6- 8 hours after the dose is given after 
approximately the middle of the first c ycle (between day 15 and day 28).  These additional samples may 
require that a small intravenous tube (catheter or IV) be placed if you do not have a central line.  If you have a central line then you will not require an IV for these studies. A total of 12  mL (less than 3 teaspoons) 
of blood will be drawn for these studies.  This amount of blood is safe even for small children.  These blood 
samples are required from all participants in this study.  
Biology Studies 
If you consent to the biology study, one blood sample (3 ml, which is less than one teaspoon) will be 
collected before you take the first dose of PF -02341066 on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
 ______/______ Yes, I agree to participate in the biology studies. 
 ______/______ No, I do not agree to participate in the biology studies.  
 A total of 15 mL will be drawn (approximately 3 teaspoons) for all the pharmacokinetic and biology study 
tests described above. This amount of blood is safe to draw even from small children.  
 
 
How long will I be in the study? 
Your doctor may decide to take you off study if any of the following occur:  
• The side effects of PF -02341066 are too harmful for you 
• You need a treatment that is not allowed on this study 
• Your tumor does not improve or worsens 
• You are not able to follow study-related treatment instructions  
• New information becomes available  
• The study is not in your best interest 
• The study is stopped 
 
After you are finished taking PF-02341066, the study doctor will ask you to visit the office for follow -up 
exams as they wou ld normally do for patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.  
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from  PF-02341066 
can be evaluated by your doctor.  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. 
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best 
interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched 
carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side 
  ADVL0912 
  07/27/17
  
  Page 5 
effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the PF -02341066. In some cases, side 
effects can be serious, long lasting, may never go away, or possibly result in death.  
 
You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.

If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be more likely 
to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the blood stream (sepsis).  If this 
happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics.  If your white blood cell count is very low and you get a fever, you may have to come to the hospital to get treated with antibiotics. 
 
If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy bruising 
or bleeding.  If the count is very low and there is bleeding, you might need platelet transfusions to help 
stop the bleeding. 
 
Transfusions may be accompanied by or followed by fe ver and/or reactions that can cause kidney failure, 
heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections. 
Reproductive risks:  You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because 
the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby.  Women should not breastfeed a baby while on 
this study.  It is important you understand that you need to use birth control while on this study.  
Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them.  
Some methods might not be approved for use in this study. A pregnancy test will be obtained in female 
patients before beginning treatment with PF -02341066. 
 We will tell you if we learn any new information that may a ffect your health, welfare, or decision to stay 
in this study.  
Risks of blood drawing or placing an intravenous catheter for blood drawing : 
Risks associated with drawing blood are slight, but some risks include: pain, excessive bleeding, 
fainting or feeling lightheaded, bruising, infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken), and 
multiple punctures to locate veins.  
 
Risks of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy : 
Risks associated with having a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy include: pain, bleeding, infection, or bruising.  
Risks of Imaging Scans  
The following imaging scans are part of routine care for many types of cancer and are performed to assess the size and/or location of your tumor(s). 
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. 
 
Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
The potential benefit of the treatment with PF -02341066 is that it may cause your cancer to stop growing 
or to shrink for a period of time.  It may lessen the symptoms, such as pain, that are caused by the cancer.  
Because there is not much information about the PF -02341066 effect on cancers in humans, we do not 
know if you will benefit from taking part in this study. Information learned from this study may help future 
patients with cancer.

SAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT / PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR 
PARTICIPATION IN RES EARCH 
[FOR PARTS B OR C (PHASE 2 COMPONENT) OF THE STUDY]   
 
 
ADVL0912 , A Phase 1/2 Study of PF -02341066, an Oral Small Molecule Inhibitor 
of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and c-MET, in Children with 
Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma 
 
When we use “you” and “I” in this consent form, we mean you or your child.  
This study is a clinical trial (a research study involving patients, or protocol) of an experimental new drug 
for cancer. We are asking if you want to participate in this study because there is not a standard treatment for your cancer at this point. Clinical trials only include patients who choose to take part. Your participation  
in this study is entirely voluntar y. Please read the consent form carefully. You will be given a copy of it to 
keep if you decide to participate in this study. You may discuss your decision with your friends and family 
if you would like.   
This study is being carried out by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Phase I Consortium. COG is an 
international research group that consists of more than 200 hospitals that treat children with cancer in the 
United States, Canada, Australia, and Switzerland, and The Phase I Consortium is the group of 21 hospitals 
within COG that does phase 1/2 studies like this one.  It is common medical practice to treat children with cancer on research studies like this one.  Participation in this study will be limited to the Consortium 
institutions and five additional hospitals within COG . 
 
This is a Phase 1/2 study of a drug called PF -02341066.  PF -02341066 is a drug that in laboratory studies 
can block or inhibit two proteins called c -met and ALK.  These proteins may be important in the growth of 
certain types of canc er cells.  PF -02341066 is considered experimental because the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) have not approved it.  
 
You are participating in the phase 2 portion of this trial.  In this part of the trial, we use the highest safe 
dose studied in the phase 1 portion to assess the anti -tumor effect of PF -02341066 in patients with 
neuroblastoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma.  
 
You are being asked to participate in this study because you have a recurrent or progressive neuroblastoma 
or lymphoma that shows an abnormality in the ALK gene and that cannot be cured by any known standard 
treatment. When a cancer  comes back (recurs) or does not respond to therapy, your doctor may recommend  
other anti -cancer drugs (chemotherapy), surgery, or radiation therapy. For certain cancers, a combination 
of one or more of these approaches is considered standard treatment. However, for  other cancers, for cancers 
that again come back, or for cancer for which therapy is no longer  working, the best treatment is not known.

Why is this study being done?  
We are testing new experimental drugs such as PF -02341066 in the hopes of finding a drug that may be 
effective against recurrent neuroblastoma or lymphoma.  
The goals of this study are: 
 
• To determine whether PF-02341066 is a ben eficial treatment for your tumor;  
• To learn what kind of side effects PF -02341066 can cause; 
• To learn more about the pharmacology (how your body handles the drug) of PF-02341066; 
• To learn more about the biology of PF-02341066. 
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
There will be about 11-45 patients participating in Part B and C of this study.  About ___ will be treated at 
this hospital. 
 
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?   
Before you begin the study …   
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  These 
exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study.   
If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study 
doctor.   
• A medical history  
• Physical exam  
• Eye exam  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature) 
• Blood tests 
• Urine tests  
• Test of bone marrow (lymphoma or neuroblastoma) and spinal fluid ( lymphoma)  
• Pregnancy test (if you are a woman who could have children) 
• Plain X-ray of one or both of your lower legs 
• Electrocardiogram (EKG, which tests the electrical impulses of your heart)  
• We will also do whatever X -rays, CT scans, or other tests are needed to check your tumor 
During the study …   
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, PF-
02341066 will be given by mouth twice a day for 28 days. This entire period is called a cycle.  You may 
continue to receive PF-02341066 unless you develop serious side effects or your tumor worsens.   
 
You will have the following tests and procedures during the study.  They are part of regular cancer care. 
They may be done more often because you are in this study. 
• Physical exam  
• Eye exam 
• Blood tests 
• Urine tests  
  ADVL0912 
  07/27/17
  
  Page 3 
• Tests to evaluate the status of your tumor based on your tumor type and location (e.g., CT 
or MRI scans, MIBG scans, PET scans, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies)  
 
These tests are all necessary to make sure that you are not having unsafe side effects and to see whether or not your tumor is responding to PF-02341066. 
 
Copies of the films used to check your child’s disease may be sent to central review centers as part of COG 
quality control. Your name and other identifying infor mation will be removed from these films prior to 
review. 
 In addition, we will monitor one or both of your lower legs with a plain X -ray prior to starting treatment 
with PF-02341066.  If your bones have stopped growing, no further X -rays of the lower legs will be taken. 
If your bones are still growing, we will check your lower legs for changes at the end of Cycle 3, and then 
approximately every 6 months thereafter with a plain X- ray. Should we detect changes, we may perform 
an MRI to better describe the changes. These tests are performed, because in some growing animals that received PF -02341066 and other related drugs, changes in the structure of the growing bones were 
observed. 
 
You will be given a Patient Diary at the beginning of each cycle of PF -02341066. Use the diary to record 
the date and time you take the drug, side effects you experience and other medications you are taking.  This diary should be returned to clinic, along with the medication bottle (even if it is empty) before starting another cycle. This will help us to know how much of the drug you take and how it made you feel. 
 
The PF-02341066 will be given as a capsule or liquid solution by mouth. Since we do not have information 
on how well the medicine is absorbed, if you vomit the medication it should not be taken again. Since this 
medicine can make you sleepy, you can take this medicine at bedtime. 
Questionnaire:  
If you are receiving the PF -02341066 as a liquid by mouth, we would like to ask you to fill out a short 
questionnaire at the time of the first dose, and then once per week for the first month, and then at every visit 
thereafter so we can learn more about h ow the drug tastes. This questionnaire will take about 20 minutes to 
fill out each time.   The study staff will collect some information from your chart about your age and what 
kind (if any) of PF- 02341066 capsules or liquid you may have received in the pa st. The questionnaire is 
optional. The information learned would not change the way you are treated, and the results will not be returned to you.  
 
______/______ Yes, I agree to take part in the questionnaire.  
______/______ No, I do not agree to take part in the questionnaire.  
 We would also like to do some extra tests called pharmacokinetic studies and biologic studies.  These tests 
will help us learn more about PF-02341066 and may help children who receive this drug in the future. The 
information learned  would not change the way you are treated, and the results of these tests will not be 
returned to you.  The pharmacokinetic studies are required and the biology studies are optional, except in patients with ALCL in whom some specific correlative biology tests are required. You do not have to do 
these tests if you do not want to.  Although these tests are a very important part of how we will better learn 
to use this drug, it is your decision as to whether or not you agree to participate in these tests.

Pharmacokinetic Studies  
During the study blood samples will be collected to determine how much of the PF-02341066 is in your 
blood (pharmacokinetics).  These samples are about 2 mL (approximately ½ teaspoon) of blood each. A 
single sample will be obtained before your first dose of drug on Day 1 and additional samples will be 
obtained between day 15 and day 28 after you begin taking the drug in Cycle 1. These additional samples 
will be obtained before and at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6- 8 hours after the dose is given after 
approximately the middle of the first cycle (between day 15 and day 28).  These additional samples may require that a small intravenous tube (catheter or IV) be placed if you do not have a central line.  If you have a central line then yo u will not require an IV for these studies.  A total of 12 mL (less than 3 teaspoons) 
of blood will be drawn for these studies.  This amount of blood is safe even for small children. These blood 
samples are required from all participants in this study. 
 
Biology Studies 
If you consent to the biology study, one blood sample (3 ml, which is less than one teaspoon) will be collected before you take the first dose of PF -02341066 on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
 
______/______ Yes, I agree to participate in the biology studies.  
 ______/______ No, I do not agree to participate in the biology studies. 
 A total of 15 mL will be drawn (approximately 3 teaspoons) for all the pharmacokinetic and biology study 
tests described above. This amount of blood is safe to draw even from small children.  
 
Additional Tissue Studies to Consider for Patients with Neuroblastoma Only  
As part of your regular care, your doctor may have removed some body tissue (tumor tissue or bone 
marrow) to see if you have cancer. We would like to keep some of the tissue that is left over and test how 
much a gene called ALK can be found in the tissue. If you weigh more than 10 kg, the bone marrow sample is 5 mL (about 1 teaspoon). If you weigh equal to or less than 10 kg, the bone marrow sample is 3- 5 mL 
(about 1 teaspoon or less). The ALK gene testing may help us learn more about how the drug, PF -02341066, 
works in the tissues in your body. If the results are positive, the bone marrow sample will be repeated with each disease evaluation. The tissue and/or bone marr ow will be sent directly to the lab for testing and will 
not be sold. The ALK gene testing in the tumor and bone marrow is done for research and we will not disclose these results to you. However, if you are interested in genetic screening for neuroblastoma, you 
should talk with your doctor about a new molecular diagnostic test that is available.   
 ______/______ Yes, I agree to participate in the biology tumor tissue studies. 
 
______/______ No, I do not agree to participate in the biology tumor tissue studies. 
  
______/______ Yes, I agree to participate in the biology bone marrow studies. 
 ______/______ No, I do not agree to participate in the biology bone marrow studies.
 
 
Additional Studies to Consider for Patients with Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma ( ALCL) Only  
For patients with ALCL, we would like to test your blood and bone marrow before you begin therapy for 
minimal residual disease (MRD).   MRD is the presence of very small amounts of cancer in the blood and 
bone marrow and we would see if the MRD test can help us determine early signs of whether or not your 
tumor is responding to the drug. These tests are done for research and the results will not be disclosed to 
you. The bone marrow sample (5 mL, about 1 teaspoon if you weigh more than 10 kg, or 3- 5 mL, about 1 
  ADVL0912 
  07/27/17
  
  Page 5 
teaspoon or less if you weigh equal to or less than 10 kg) will be drawn before your first dose of PF -
02341066. The blood samples (15 mL, about 3 teaspoons if you weigh more than 10 kg, or 10 mL, about 2 
teaspoons if you weigh equal to or less than 10 kg) will be drawn before your first dose of PF -02341066, 
on Day 15 of Cycle 1, at the beginning of Cycle 2, once in each additional cycle  through Cycle 11, and then 
every 3 cycles.  These samples would be drawn at the same time as routine blood tests.  These samples will 
be sent directly to the lab for testing and will not be sold. These blood and bone marrow samples are 
required from all patients with ALCL.  
 
How long will I be in the study? 
Your doctor may decide to take you off study if any of the following occur:  
 
• The side effects of PF -02341066 are too harmful for you 
• You need a treatment that is not allowed on this study 
• Your tumor does not improve or worsens 
• You are not able to follow study- related treatment instructions  
• New information beco mes available  
• The study is not in your best interest 
• The study is stopped 
 
After you are finished taking PF-02341066, the study doctor will ask you to visit the office for follow -up 
exams as they would normally do for patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.  
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide 
to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from  PF-02341066 
can be evaluated by your doctor.  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. 
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best 
interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
You may have sid e effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched 
carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side 
effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side 
effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the PF-02341066. In some cases, side 
effects can be serious, long lasting, may never go away, or possibly result in death.  
 
You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.

  *Vision changes may include blurred vision, double vision, discomfort in the eyes from light, swelling 
and redness of the eyelids,  impaired vision, seeing spots before the eyes (floaters), flashing lights, 
brightness, rings, shadows, and/or streaking. 
 
Some drugs or supplements may interact with your treatment plan. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or study team before starting any n ew prescription or over- the-counter drugs, herbals, or 
supplements and before making a significant change in your diet.   Supplements may come in many 
forms, such as teas, drinks, juices, liquids, drops, capsules, pills, or dried herbs. All forms should be avoided. 
 
*If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you may feel 
tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion.  
If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be more likely 
  ADVL0912 
  07/27/17
  
  Page 7 
to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the blood stream (sepsis).  If this 
happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics.  If your white blood cell 
count is very low and you get a fever, you may have to come to the hospital to get treated with antibiotics.  
If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy bruising 
or bleeding.  If the count is very low and there is bleeding, you might need platelet transfusions to help 
stop the bleeding. 
 Transfusions may be accompanied by or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney failure, 
heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections. 
Reproductive risks:  You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because 
the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby.  Women should not breastfeed a baby while on 
this study.   It is important you understand that you need to use birth control while on this study.  
Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them.  Some methods might not be approved for use in this study. A pr egnancy test will be obtained in female 
patients before beginning treatment with PF -02341066. 
 We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay 
in this study.  
Risks of blood drawing or placing an intravenous catheter for blood drawing: 
Risks associated with drawing blood are slight, but some risks include: pain, excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, bruising, infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken), and 
multiple punctur es to locate veins.  
Risks of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy : 
Risks associated with having a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy include: pain, bleeding, infection, or bruising.  
Risks of spinal tap (For patients with ALCL) : 
Spinal taps are part of routine care for patients with lymphoma and for some types of brain tumors. A spinal 
tap is a procedure where a special needle is inserted in the lower back through the space between the bones that surround the spinal canal.  This procedure has a slight risk of infecti on, bleeding, nerve 
damage, or headache.  Patients will be given medications to numb the pain and blur the memory 
before the test since it is painful. The pain is usually brief but occasionally may linger. Sometimes 
this procedure is done while the patient is under general anesthesia.  
Risks of Imaging Scans  
The following imaging scans are part of routine care for many types of cancer and are performed to assess the size and/or location of your tumor(s). 
 
Risks associated with having a PET-CT scan (For patie nts with ALCL) : 
For the PET -CT scan you will get a radioactive sugar (FDG) by vein. This exposes your body to 
radiation like a chest X -ray or CT scan. The amount of FDG that you get depends on what you 
weigh.  The radiation exposure for the PET scan is abo ut the same to about half that of a standard 
CT scan.   You will also get x -rays from the CT portion of the PET -CT scan. The total amount of 
radiation you get from the combined PET and CT scan will not be more than 2 to 6 times the amount 
of radiation that everyone gets in a year from natural sources like the atmosphere.   The risk from 
this amount of radiation is considered to be small when compared with other everyday risks.

Risks associated with having a MIBG scan (For Patients with Neuroblastoma) : 
A MIBG scan is an imaging test that involves exposure to radiation and uses a special camera to take 
pictures of specific tissues in the body after a radioactive tracer is injected in a vein in the arm. The 
risks associated with having a MIBG scan include pain a t the injection site, bleeding, fainting or 
feeling lightheaded, bruising, infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken), and multiple punctures to locate veins.  
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. 
 
Are there  benefits to taking part in the study?  
The potential benefit of the treatment with PF -02341066 is that it may cause your cancer to stop growing 
or to shrink for a period of time.  It may lessen the symptoms, such as pain, that are caused by the cancer.  
Because there is not much information about the PF -02341066 effect on cancers in humans, we do not 
know if you will benefit from taking part in this study. Information learned from this study may help future 
patients with cancer.  
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?  
Your other choices may include:  
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study  
• Taking part in another study  
• No further treatment, and comfort care only  
 
Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.  
 
Will my medical information be kept private?  
We will do our best to make sure that the personal information in your medical record will be kept private.  
However, we cannot guarantee total privacy.  Your personal information may be given out if required by 
law.  If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other 
personal information will not be used.  
 
The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, 
which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects.  The Certificate protects against the 
involuntary release of information about subjects collected during the course of our covered studies.  The 
researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to disclose the identity or any information collected in 
the study in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, 
administrative, or leg islative proceedings.  However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily 
disclose the protected information under certain circumstances.  For example, if the subject or his/her 
guardian requests the release of information in writing, the Cer tificate does not protect against that 
voluntary disclosure.  Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, 
such as a DHHS request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request under the 
Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.  
The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against the required reporting by hospital staff of 
information on suspected child abuse, reportable communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to 
self or others.

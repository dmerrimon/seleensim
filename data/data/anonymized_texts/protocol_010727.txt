CONFIDENTIAL Sponsor : Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol No .: CLAR-16015 
Study Drug Name : Testosterone Undecanoate Oral 
Capsule Phase of Development: Phase 2 
Active Ingredient : Testosterone Undecanoate Date of Protocol Synopsis : 15 September 2016 
Protocol Title :   
A Phase 2 Study of the Effect of Meals with Various Amounts of Fat Given Immediately After Dosing on the 
Pharmacokinetics of an Oral Testosterone Undecanoate 
Objectives :   
Primary Objective : 
 The objective of the study is to determine the effect of meals (breakfast) containing various amounts of 
fat on the pharmacokinetics of Clarus's formulation of oral TU at a dose of 237 mg TU (the highest 
strength capsule being developed by Clarus).   
Safety Objective : 
 To characterize the safety and tolerability of oral TU when consumed with various meals. 
Study Sites :  Two centers in the United States 
Study Population :  
Hypogonadal men aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive), and legally able to give informed consent, as applicable by 
law. 
Number of Subjects :  
Approximately 20 subjects. 
Methodology: 
This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, cross over, pharmacokinetic study.  Subjects will initially be dosed 
for 2 weeks (Run-In Phase) to allow suppression of endogenous testosterone production, while allowing the oral 
TU to reach steady state.  The subjects will then be confined to a clinical unit in which they undergo the PK 
Phase of the study.  During the PK Phase of the study, subjects will undergo a five-period cross-over in which 
oral TU is dosed twice daily.  Subjects will dose in the morning and in the evening immediately prior to protocol-defined meals.  The protocol-defined breakfasts will contain various levels of fat including 15 g, 30 g, 
45 g, a breakfast consistent with the fat and calorie content of the high-fat breakfast consistent with 
recommendations in the Guidance for Industry on Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence Studies (December 2002), or while fasting (with no meal until 4 hours post-dose).  Subjects will be randomized to a 
designated sequence of the protocol-defined breakfasts, or the fasted state.  The subjects will be required to 
consume the entire breakfast within 20 minutes during th e PK Phase.  The protocol-defined evening meal will 
be required to be consumed within 20 minutes.  The 5 meal periods will occur on sequential days. 
Approximately twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure completion of 16 subjects.

CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 7 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL Duration of Study Participation : 
Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 8 weeks, including up to a 28-day Screening Phase, 
a 14-day out-patient Run-In Phase, and a 6-day in-patient PK Phase, followed by a 5 to 7 day Safety Follow–up 
Phase to assess safety. 
Endpoints: 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoint : 
The testosterone pharmacokinetics associated with each breakfast diet (fasting, 15 g fat, 30 g fat, 45 g fat and a 
high  fat meal) will be evaluated using non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis.  The parameters C max, 
Tmax, AUC 12 and C avg will be derived using the assay results for total T.  The concentrations and 
pharmacokinetic parameters for the individuals will be listed, along with descriptive statistics. As the treatment doses will be administered while endogenous T production has been suppressed, the total T values will not be corrected for baseline T concentrations.  Comparisons will be made between the C
max and AUC 12 and C avg 
values obtained for each treatment, after log transformations. The 30 g fat breakfast treatment (“normal” fat 
content for the US population) will serve as the reference treatment in the comparisons to identify the effects of 
the different meals on the relative bioavailability of T.   
Safety Endpoints : 
Treatment emergent adverse events 
Pharmacokinetic Variables :  
Pharmacokinetic variables to be calculated include total T C max, time to maximum concentration (T max), area 
under the plasma concentration time-curve over the post-breakfast dosing interval (AUC 12) and C avg over the 
dosing interval. 
Safety Variables : 
Safety variables include: adverse events, routine vital sign measurements (including cuff measured sBP and 
dBP), physical examination findings, clinical laboratory tests. 
Statistical Methods : 
For all subjects enrolled in the study, descriptive tabular and/or graphical summarizations will be generated, if 
applicable. Continuous variables will be presented using descriptive statistics: number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean , median, and minimum and maximum values. Categorical 
values will be summarized with counts and percentages.  
All collected data will be presented in listings 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized for each  meal treatment. Non-compartmental analysis of the 
total T concentrations measured on the treatment days will be used to calculate PK parameters, including C
max, 
Tmax, AUC and C avg for each breakfast diet option. Actual sample collection times will be used for PK parameter 
determinations; summary listings and tables will be organized by nominal (scheduled) sample collection time.  
Safety 
Adverse events will be summarized and tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  
Physical examination and results will be summarized.  
Observed values and changes from baseline in vital sign measurements, including sBP, dBP, heart rate (HR), 
will be summarized.  
Observed values and changes from baseline in laboratory test results will be summarized. Laboratory tests will 
be performed at screening and following the Day 5 24 hour PK sample.

CONFIDENTIAL 6 INTRODUCTION 
The Endocrine Society defines hypogonadism as a clinical syndrome that results from failure of 
the testes to produce physiological levels of te stosterone (T) (androgen deficiency) and a normal 
number of spermatozoa because of disruption of 1 or more levels of hypothalamic pituitary-
testicular axis.2 Hypogonadism may result from a genetic abnormality or may occur secondary to a 
chronic disease or from certain drug therapies. Clinical findings in adult men with the androgen 
deficiency component of hypogonadism are non-specific. The signs and symptoms suggestive of 
androgen deficiency include reduced sexual desi re (libido); decreased spontaneous erections; 
breast discomfort and/or gynecomastia; low bone mineral density; dysthymia; decreased energy and/or motivation; reduced muscle bulk; and increased body fat. 
Testosterone is an endogenous androgen that is produced in men by Leydig cells under the 
influence of luteinizing hormone (LH) secreted by the pituitary gland. In normal men, the average 
daily production of T is approximately 7 mg. Testoste rone in circulation is primarily bound to sex-
hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Equilibrium exists between bound and unbound T such that only 1 to 3% of the total circulating T is free. Total T levels (serum or plasma) typically 
range between 300 and 1000 ng/dL in eugonadal men.
3 
Testosterone, in addition to being directly responsible  for certain actions, serves as a precursor to 2 
active metabolites, namely, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol (E 2). Dihydrotestosterone is 
formed by the intracellular action of 5 -reductase on T within target tissues (eg, muscle, prostate). 
Testosterone and DHT exert their pharmacological activity in androgen-sensitive target tissue by 
binding with the androgen receptor. At physiologic levels, the action of T and DHT differs. 
Although both androgens bind to the same receptor, the T-receptor complex regulates 
gonadotropin secretion and is re sponsible for Wolffian duct stimulation during sexual 
development. In contrast, the DHT-receptor comple x is responsible for external virilization during 
fetal development and DHT is the primary androge n responsible for sexual maturation and adult 
male sexual activity. Which androgen is responsib le for the control of spermatogenesis is poorly 
understood.4 
Testosterone deficiency is characterized by abnor mally low levels of circulating T. There are a 
variety of causes of male hypogonadism but essentia lly all of these fall into 1 of 2 categories: 
primary hypogonadism (resulting from a defect of androgen production/secretion at the testicular 
level) and secondary hypogonadism (resulting from a   defect in gonadotropin production/secretion 
at the hypothalamic-pituitary level). In prim ary hypogonadism, gonadotropin (ie, LH and follicle-
stimulating hormone [FSH]) levels are abnormally high because the negative feedback action of T 
to suppress secretion is absent. Conversely, secondary hypogonadism is associated with low 
gonadotropin levels. Some hypogonadal states may i nvolve a defect at more than 1 physiological

CONFIDENTIAL level. Regardless of the cause, adult male hypogonadism is generally associated with a 
constellation of symptoms, often composed of diminished libido, depressed mood, decreased 
muscle strength, increased fat mass and reduced energy. Testosterone deficiency is also a risk 
factor for osteoporosis and has recently been implicated as a potential risk factor in coronary artery 
disease.5,6 
The goal of T replacement therapy (TRT) is to restore T levels to the eugonadal range and thereby 
restore normal male secondary sexual characteristic s and behavior and to mimic the somatic action 
of T (eg, hemoglobin, muscle mass, nitrogen balance, bone mineral density). Several pharmacologic preparations of T (or active deri vatives or pro-drugs) have been developed and 
approved for androgen-replacement therapy. These pr oducts can be divided into 5 main categories: 
oral androgens (eg, methyltestosterone, T undecanoate [TU; not currently available in the United States]); intramuscular T-esters (eg, T-enanthate, T-cypionate, TU); transdermal T preparations (T-gels, T-solutions, and non-scrotal T-patches); a buccal T delivery system; and an intranasal T 
delivery system. 
The use of oral TU for TRT is not new. A non -self-emulsifying drug delivery system oral TU 
formulation containing 40 mg of TU dissolved in oleic acid is approved and has been available for 
use for decades in over 80 countries around the world (including Canada and most countries in 
Europe) but not in the United Stated. Following administration, the oral TU dose undergoes 
entero-lymphatic absorption from the gut, bypassing the portal circulation and thereby 
circumventing first-pass hepatic metabolism. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of this TU 
formulation is highly variable and, consequen tly, this TU formulation has generally not been 
regarded as optimal for the treatment of male hypogonadism.
7 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. (Clarus) is developing a unique oral TU formulation for TRT in 
hypogonadal men. Testosterone undecanoate (TU) is  an extremely lipophilic T-ester, much more 
lipophilic than T, and thus is recognized by the small intestine as a fat. Accordingly, most of an orally absorbed TU dose is absorbed via the inte stinal lymphatics thus avoiding first-pass hepatic 
metabolism. Clarus’s TU is formulated in a lipid matrix that contains other lipophilic substances 
and an emulsifier and is administered in a soft-gel capsule. All the excipients in the TU 
formulation are commonly used in the pharmaceutical and/or food industry and pose no known 
health risks. This orally administered TU formulation constitutes a 
self-emulsifying drug delivery 
system  designed to promote the solubility, absorption, and subsequent bioavailability of TU. Once 
absorbed, non-specific esterases cleave the fatty acid chain to yield T that provides the androgenic 
activity of this formulation.  
Clarus has evaluated its oral TU formulation in 5 Phase 2 studies and 2 Phase 3 studies. In repeat-
dose Phase 2 studies, the serum concentrations of T, DHT, and E 2 reached steady-state by the

CONFIDENTIAL seventh day of dosing.  In a single-dose, 5-period study of the effect of food with various levels of 
fat, in which the meal was consumed before dosing, demonstrated that the formulation can be 
taken across the spectrum of low-normal-high fa t meals but bioavailability was substantially 
reduced when the formulation was taken in the fasted state. Increasing fat in the diet increases the bioavailability of T, with a high-fat meal (50% of  calories of the approximately 1000 calorie meal 
as fat) resulting in about a 31% higher exposure compared to a standard (30% fat) meal. The 
formulation should not be taken in a fasted state, since fasting results in about a 40% reduction in 
absorption compared with a meal that has 30% of its  calories as fat.  In that study, a high dose of 
oral TU, 474 mg, was evaluated.  
Another phase 2 open-label, single oral TU do se study was conducted in eight (8) hypogonadal 
men at a single study site.  Each participant received a single oral TU dose of 316 mg TU (two 158 
mg TU capsules) immediately prior to a standardized breakfast meal comprised of 25 to 30 % of calories as fat.  Subjects were asked to consume the entire breakfast meal in no more than 30 
minutes. Blood samples were collected into four different types of tubes, Plain, with no additives, 
NaF +EDTA, NaF + Oxalate, and NaF containing tubes at pre-dose, and hourly for 12 hours post-
dose. This study was performed, in part, to confirm and expand the findings published by Lachance et al
7.  which demonstrated that when oral TU is administered to hypogonadal men, 
conversion of TU to T continues after blood collect ion unless the action of non-specific esterases is 
inhibited at the time blood is drawn for measurement of T.  Preliminary review of the data indicate 
an increased conversion of TU to T at every post dos e time point for results collected in plain tubes 
as compared to those tubes containing an esterase inhibitor (tubes containing sodium fluoride). 
Final analyses of this study are not yet available. 
In Phase 3, the formulation was initially evaluated in a 12-month, randomized, active-controlled, 
dose-titration study (CLAR-09007; N=325). The study initiated subjects on oral TU at 316 mg TU 
twice daily (BID) after meals. The meals at PK visits approximated the average fat content of the 
American male diet with about 30 g of fat.  Un like a food effect study, the subjects were not 
required to consume the whole meal. Only those subjects requiring dose titration on Day 30, based on a single time point (4 to 6 hours after dose) serum T determination, had an opportunity for a second titration on Day 60. Subjects who did not re quire dose titration at Day 30 continued on the 
316 mg TU BID dose to Day 90, without additional assessments of serum T levels. On Day 90, 87.2% of subjects on oral TU achieved a serum T average concentration (C
avg) in the eugonadal 
range (ie, 300 to 1000 ng/dL), meeting the primary efficacy endpoint of the study; however, 
roughly one-quarter of subjects on oral TU had serum T maximum concentrations (C max) that fell 
outside the targets for C max set by the Food and Drug Association (FDA). Approximately 14% of 
subjects had a C max >2500 ng/dL and 13% had a C max of 1800 to 2500 ng/dL. The safety profile of 
the oral TU group was similar to that of the active comparator group (AndroGel® 1%). In Study

CONFIDENTIAL CLAR-09007, the incidence of any adverse event (AE), any serious AE (SAE), and any AE 
leading to discontinuation of study drug for oral TU-treated patients was 68.3%, 6.8%, and 5.0%, 
respectively, as compared with 62.5%, 3.8%, and 3.1% in patients who received AndroGel. Some of the differences in the AE profile, such as the incidence of edema, and an increase in mean Day 
90 baseline systolic blood pressure (sBP)/diastolic blood pressure (dBP) of 2.6/2 mm Hg may have been related to the higher T exposure in the subjects who received oral TU, with the Day 90 serum T C
avg (standard deviation) in the oral TU group of 628 (343) ng/dL compared with 485 (220) 
ng/dL in the AndroGel group. 
The results of CLAR-09007 study led Clarus to deve lop a revised dose-titration algorithm and test 
it in a second Phase 3 trial. This trial (CLAR-12011) was a single-arm, 114-day dose-titration 
study. Like CLAR-09007, subjects were initiated on oral TU at a dose of 316 mg TU BID, but in 
this trial all subjects had 2 opportunities to under go dose titration.  Subjects in CLAR-12011 took 
their dose within 15 minutes of consuming meals. Subjects were provided with meal options which 
were similar to that used in the previous Phase 3 trial.  Titration decisions were based on a serum T 
concentration drawn 3 to 5 hours post-dose, and the T concentration upon which dose reduction 
occurred was lower than that used in CLAR-09007 study. On Day 114, 75.0% of subjects on oral 
TU achieved a T C avg in the eugonadal range (ie, 300 to 1000 ng/dL), meeting the primary efficacy 
endpoint of the study. The frequency of high C max values was substantially decreased. 
Approximately 3% of subjects had a C max > 2500 ng/dL and 6% had a C max of 1800 to 2500 ng/dL. 
The FDA has set targets for T C max > 2500 ng/dL  at 0% of subjects and 5% of subjects with a T 
Cmax of 1800 to 2500 ng/dL. The incidence of any AE, any SAE, and any AE leading to 
discontinuation of study drug was 48.6%, 1.4%, and 2.1%, respectively. No AE could be directly associated with an elevated T C
max. The mean change in baseline sBP/dBP at Day 114 was 
0.1/0.5 mm Hg, which was less than seen in the previous study and may reflect the lower mean T C
avg 422 ng/dL (standard deviation 171) in study CLAR-12011. Approximately 75% of 
CLAR-12011 subjects had a final dose that was lower than the starting dose; therefore, a lower starting dose was studied in the next Phase 3 study, CLAR-15012. 
Currently ongoing, CLAR-15012 is a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-
comparator group, efficacy (based on C
avg of T), and safety study in adult hypogonadal male 
subjects. Enrollment into the study is based on selection criteria designed to be the general population of hypogonadal men. Subject’s study drug dose is determined by a dose-titration 
algorithm that bases dose-titration decisions on total T C
avg. Subjects may be naïve to androgen 
replacement therapy or washed out of prior a ndrogen replacement therapies. A total of about 550 
subjects were screened in order to enroll 222 subj ects, which meets both scientific and regulatory 
objectives. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio such that 166 subjects were assigned to the oral TU treatment arm and 56 subjects were assigned to receive

CONFIDENTIAL 7 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
7.1 Primary Objective 
To determine the effect of meals (breakfast) containing various amounts of fat on the 
pharmacokinetics of Clarus's formulation of oral TU at a dose of 237 mg TU (the highest strength 
capsule being developed by Clarus).   
7.2 Safety Objective 
To characterize the safety and tolerability of oral TU when consumed immediately before various 
meals. 
8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This will be a multicenter, Phase 2, repeated, tw ice daily dose, food effect study in which subjects 
are randomized to a sequence of meals that vary primarily in fat content.  Approximately 20 
hypogonadal subjects will be enrolled in order to complete approximately 16 subjects.  Subjects 
may be naïve to androgen replacement therapy or washed out of prior androgen replacement therapies as detailed in exclusion criteria. 
There will be a Run-In Phase (twice daily dosing with meals) designed to suppress subjects’ 
endogenous testosterone production while allowing the oral TU to reach steady state followed by a 
PK Phase.  Throughout the study, the dose of study drug will be 237 mg TU twice daily, which is the highest strength formulation in development and the starting dose for the ongoing Phase 3 
study, CLAR-15012.  
After the 14 day Run-In Phase, subjects will be  confined in the clinic for approximately 6 
consecutive days for evaluations and serial blood draws in the PK Phase.  Subjects will present at 
the clinic on the evening of Day 14 prior to dinner time and will be dosed with oral TU 
immediately prior to a dinner meal.  They will remain in the clinic until collection of 24-hour serial 
sampling following morning dosing in Period 5 of the PK Phase. On each of the PK Phase Periods 
1 through 5, the subject will be dosed immediately  prior to the breakfast meal (or in the AM with 
240 mL of water for the fasting period).  The breakf asts will be defined and contain approximately 
850 calories with 15 g fat, 30 g fat, or 45 g fat and those meals suggested in the Guidance for 
Industry on Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence Studies (December 2002), namely 
after an overnight fast or with a high-calorie and high-fat meal (approximately 1000 calories and 
50% of the calories from fat).  The 15 g, 30 g, and 45 g fat meals are meal options that are incorporated into the ongoing Phase 3 study. Subjects will be randomized to a sequence of the five

 The confinement for the PK Phase will begin immediately prior to the evening dose and meal on 
Run-In Day 14, and will continue through collection of a blood sample 24 hours after the morning 
dose of the fifth dosing (Period 5) for a total of approximately 135 hours. During the PK Phase, 
subjects will have all meals provided, will undergo observed dosing (dosing of study medication 
taking from site inventory will be observed by site personnel), will have blood samples collected 
and will have limited activity. During this  phase, the subjects must consume their entire breakfast 
and dinner meals  and study drug will be administered in the morning and evening (approximately 
12 hours apart) immediately  before breakfast and dinner.  
For all subjects, serial blood samples will be collecte d as follows: 0 (pre-morning dose), 2, 4, 6, 9, 
12, 14, 16, 18, 21, and 24 hours after the morning dose.   Blood sample collection should be 
performed within ± 10 minutes of the scheduled time points (with the exception of the 0-hour time

CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 20 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL point which should be administered no more than 5 minutes before oral TU dose administration on 
each PK Phase Period).  
Subjects will be released from the clinic following the 24-hour blood draw and designated end of 
study activities of the PK Phase, which occurs the morning after the fifth PK Phase study period. 
8.2 Discussion of Study Design 
This will be a Phase 2 open-label, food effe ct study in adult hypogonadal male subjects. 
Enrollment into the study will be based on selection criteria designed to sample the general 
population of hypogonadal men. The study includes an up to 28-day Screening Phase, a 14 day 
outpatient Run-in Phase, followed by an in-patient PK Phase (6 days), and then a Follow up Phase.  
The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of meals (breakfast) containing 
various amounts of fat on the pharmacokinetics of Clarus's formulation of oral TU at a dose of 237 
mg TU.  The period associated with the randomly assigned 30 g fat breakfast meal will be considered the reference period.   
8.2.1 Anticipated Benefits 
This study only requires short term exposure to testosterone, yet the management of hypogonadism 
requires chronic therapy; therefore, participants in this study will not get therapeutic benefit for 
their hypogonadism.  However, the subjects may benefit from the screening evaluation as it may 
identify health issues that require further follow up.  Chronic treatment with TRT may provide a 
wide range of benefits for men with hypogonadism, including improvement in libido and sexual 
function, increased bone density, increased musc le mass, decreased adiposity, and increased 
quality of life. The goal of TRT is to restore T levels to the eugonadal range and thereby restore 
normal male secondary sexual characteristics and behavior and to mimic the somatic action of T 
(eg, hemoglobin, muscle mass, nitrogen balance, bone mineral density). Several pharmacologic preparations of T (or T pro-drugs) have been developed and approved for TRT. 
8.2.2 Anticipated Risks 
This study will only require short term exposure to testosterone, so any androgen associated risk is 
expected to be minimal.  In addition, screening criteria are designed to identify subjects who are at 
high risk and exclude them from participating in the study.  Clarus’s oral TU has been dosed for up 
to 2 years in Phase 3 studies with a well-tolerated safety profile, which is comparable to that of a 
commonly prescribed topical TRT, AndroGel.  The dose used in this study is lower than the dose 
that most subjects were exposed to in the Phase 3 studies.  Both Phase 3 studies dosed subjects for 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 21 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL the first 21 days of treatment at a dose level of 316 mg BID, but this study will dose subjects for 
less than 21 days at 237 mg BID, which should add a further margin of safety. 
Androgens are contraindicated in men with ca rcinoma of the breast and known or suspected 
carcinoma of the prostate. In men receiving a ndrogen-replacement therapy, surveillance for 
prostate cancer should be consistent with practic es for eugonadal men. Geriatric subjects treated 
with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hyperplasia and 
prostatic carcinoma.  Potential study participants will be screened by history, physical exam 
including digital rectal exam and lab testing [prost ate-specific antigen (PSA)], in order to identify 
subjects who are at higher risk. 
Other potential side effects with androgen ther apy include gynecomastia and edema with or 
without congestive heart failure in subjects with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. Oral 
therapy with high doses of 17- α –alkylated androgens (eg, methyltestosterone) has been associated 
with serious hepatic effects that can have life-threatening or fatal comp lications, although liver 
toxicity has not been observed following the oral administration of natural T or T esters including 
TU. 
Long-term clinical safety trials have not been  conducted to assess the cardiovascular (CV) 
outcomes of TRT in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have 
been inconclusive for determining whether or not the incidence of major adverse CV events, such 
as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and CV death, is higher in men who use T 
compared to non-users. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of major adverse 
CV events in association with use of TRT in men. Subjects should be informed of this possible risk. There have been post-marketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep 
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, in subjects using T products. All subjects who report 
symptoms of pain, edema, warmth, and erythema in the lower extremities should be evaluated for 
deep vein thrombosis and those who present with acute shortness of breath should be evaluated for 
pulmonary infarction. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate workup and management initiated. 
The total volume of blood to be collected from each subject during the study will not exceed 
approximately 500 mL, the volume of a routine blood donation, with possible reduction in 
hemoglobin and hematocrit.

CONFIDENTIAL 8.2.3 Dose Rationale 
Subjects enrolled in the CLAR-16015 will receive  237 mg capsules of oral TU.  The 237 mg TU 
capsule is the highest dose strength in development by Clarus.  The FDA food effect guidance 
indicates that the food effect study should investigate the highest dosage strength to be marketed.

CONFIDENTIAL 8.4 Investigational Product – Oral Testosterone Undecanoate 
8.4.1 Investigational Product Administered 
Subjects in the study will receive orally admini stered TU 237 mg BID for 14 (±2) days during the 
Run-In Phase and throughout Days 1 through 5 of the PK Phase.  
8.4.2 Identity of Investigational Product  
Oral TU capsules are soft-gel capsules. The capsules will be manufactured in accordance with 
current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations by Catalent Pharma Solutions (St. Petersburg, FL). The soft-gel capsules will be manufactured with 237.46 mg TU, which will nominally be 
referred to as 237 mg TU capsules. The 237 mg TU capsules are orange opaque in color and are 
equivalent to 150 mg T per capsule. Testosterone undecanoate will be solubilized in a proprietary 
mixture of lipid excipients and emulsifiers that are generally regarded as safe and/or commonly used by the pharmaceutical and food industries.  
Subjects will receive 237 mg TU BID for 14 (±2) days leading up to the 6 day PK Phase.  Doses of 
TU are to be taken BID with meals (breakfast and dinner), approximately 12 hours apart. The 
capsules are to be taken immediately  before the start of the meal.   
During the PK Phase, the subjects will take a single 237 mg TU capsule immediately before the 
protocol-defined breakfast and again immediately before the protocol-defined evening meal. Subjects should consume their entire morning and evening meals within 20 minutes.  Subjects will 
consume a standardized mid-day meal during PK Phase. Snacks may be provided to subjects only 
after the mid-day meal.  
8.4.3 Investigational Product Storage and Disposal 
The TU capsules will be packaged in a high-density polyethylene safety bottle that should be stored in a dry place at room temperature (25° C or 77°F). Excursions are permitted to 15°C to 
30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
Testosterone and related substances like TU ar e Schedule III non-narcotic, controlled substances. 
These study drugs must be stored at the site in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet 
or other substantially constructed enclosure with li mited access to prevent theft or diversion of the 
drug into illegal channels of distribution. 
Subjects must be instructed to ensure that all study drugs be kept out of reach of children.

CONFIDENTIAL Study site Standard Operating Procedures will be followed for the disposal of the study 
formulation upon approval of the Sponsor or designee. 
8.4.4 Packaging and Labeling 
The study drug is for investigational use only and is to be used only within the context of this 
study. The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and 
stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or returned to the 
sponsor. 
The clinical study labeling was done by Catalent Ph arma Solutions, Philadelphia, PA and an over 
label specific to this study, CLAR-16015, will be  applied to all investig ational product prior to 
study start at each center by a Clarus representative. All packaging and labeling operations will be 
performed according to Good Manufacturing Practi ce for Medicinal Products and the relevant 
regulatory requirements. 
The TU soft-gel capsules are packaged in high -density polyethylene bottles (120 capsules per 
bottle). 
8.4.5 Study Drug Dosing During Run-In Phase and PK Phase 
Subjects will self-administer 237 mg oral TU BID for a 14 day Run-in Phase. Subjects will be 
asked to record their morning and evening doses every day during the Run-In Phase. The evening 
of Day 14 (±2) subjects will report to the clinic or Phase 1 unit before their PM dose and dinner to 
begin the PK Phase.  Subjects will take their PM dose on Day 14 from the same bottle that was 
dispensed on Dosing Day 1.  Following that dose, study drug will be collected and accountability 
will be performed.   Subjects will take their study dose immediately prior to the protocol-defined 
dinner meal provided.  During the entire PK Phase of the study, subjects will be confined to the clinic/unit and will be administered 237 mg TU immediately prior to the protocol-defined 
breakfast, and immediately prior to the protocol-defined dinner. During the PK Phase Periods 1 
through 5, site personnel will administer all study drug from site inventory. 
In the event of a missed dose during the Run-In Phase, the missed dose will be documented and the 
subject will wait until it is time to take the next dose of study drug, in keeping with the scheduled 
dosing regimen.  
During the PK Phase if the subject’s AM or PM dos e is missed, he may be asked to repeat that 
study day including the assigned protocol-defined meals and serial sampling for 12 – 24 hours.

CONFIDENTIAL Per protocol, the 24 hour blood collection time point also serves as the time 0 for the next day’s 
serial sampling.  However, if the dose-associated m eal is not ready to be served at the 24 hour time 
point (ie., time 0) a window of up to one hour is acceptable and the sample collection clock for that dose (time 0) begins with the actual time of the dose. This may require that the 24-hour sample 
from the previous dose does not serve as time 0 for the following dose. 
8.4.6 Blinding and Randomization 
This is an open-label study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the five  sequences 
(shown below) of breakfast meals where the sequen ces follows a Latin square design for a 5 period 
cross-over study. 
1. ABCDE 
2. BCEAD 
3. CEDBA 
4. DABEC 
5. EDACB 
 
8.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
If any medication or nutritional supplement is taken, the name, dose, route, frequency of dosing, 
and reason for use will be recorded on the concomitant medication page in the CRF/eCRF. 
Subjects will be asked about their treatment history for hypogonadism and the start and stop dates 
for their most recent TRT. In addition, start dates for the use of any medications for hypertension, 
taken > 3 months within screening will be recorded in the CRF/eCRF. 
Eligible subjects must have a screening mean sBP < 150 mm Hg and/or dBP < 90 mm Hg. 
Subjects taking prescribed antihypertensives should be taking medications on the day of the 
screening visit with sips of water; the medication should be noted as a prior medication. Subjects < 
60 years of age and prescribed antihypertensives will be excluded if the mean of the triplicate 
assessment of sBP > 140 mm Hg and/or dBP > 90 mm Hg at screening. Any increase in the dose of the antihypertensive medication or any need to add new antihypertensive medications should be 
considered an AE and recorded in the CRF/eCRF. 
8.4.7.1 Prohibited Medication/Therapy 
Subjects must remain off all forms of T except for study drug throughout the entire study. Use of 
dietary supplements such as saw palmetto or phy toestrogens as well as any dietary supplements 
that may affect total T levels such as androste nedione or dehydroepiandrosterone during the study 
is not permitted. Use of antiandrogens, 5-alpha-reduc tase inhibitors (eg, dutasteride, finasteride),

CONFIDENTIAL estrogens or long-acting opioid analgesics (eg, methadone hydrochloride, buprenorphine 
hydrochloride) are not permitted during the study. 
8.4.7.2 Other Restrictions 
During the Run-In Phase subjects will be advised to avoid taking oral study drug while fasting (ie, 
“on an empty stomach”). Subjects should take the oral TU immediately before the breakfast and 
dinner meals. While in the clinic or Phase 1 unit dur ing the PK Phase, subjects will be required to 
consume the entire protocol-defined breakfast and dinner meals within 20 minutes after taking oral 
TU. 
Subjects will be asked to refrain from consuming grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or grapefruit 
supplements while on study drug. 
Subjects will be asked to observe all rules and smoki ng restrictions in place at the clinical facility 
during confinement. 
8.4.8 Treatment Compliance 
Subjects will return their unused study medication and compliance with study drug will be 
assessed on Day 14 of the Run-In Phase following the PM dose. Significant non-compliance with 
treatment during the Run-in Phase (<80% or > 120% compliant) will be documented as a protocol 
deviation. During the PK Phase dosing administration will be observed and compliance assessed.  
Any deviation from the prescribed dosage regimen will be recorded. In cases of significant non-
compliance, a subject may be discontinued from th e study at the investigator’s and sponsor’s 
discretion .

CONFIDENTIAL 9 TIMING OF STUDY PROCEDURES 
Subjects will provide written informed consent before any study-related procedures are performed.  
9.1 Screening Phase 
9.1.1 Screen 1 Day -28 to -7 
Screening of all subjects will be performed up to 28 days of the initial dose of study drug to assess 
subject eligibility. After the subject provides signed informed consent, the procedures of the 
Screen 1 visit will include: 
 Assess for eligibility (against th e inclusion and exclusion criteria) 
 Record medical history, including concomitant illnesses/diseases. The subject’s medical 
history (key events) will be recorded on the Medical History CRF/eCRF. If a clinical event 
concerns a chronic disorder, which means it starte d in the past and it is still present at the 
screening visit, it should also be recorded on the Medical History CRF/eCRF. 
 Record concomitant medications. Medication us e (prescription and/or over-the-counter, 
including vitamins and herbal supplements) from 3 months before study drug administration through the end of the study will be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF. If a 
subject reports taking any over-the-counter or prescription medications, vitamins and/or 
herbal supplement or if administration becomes necessary from 3 months before study drug administration through the end of the study, the name of the medication, dosage information 
including dose, route, frequency, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and 
reason for use must be recorded. For any medications taken after study drug administration 
and through the end of the study, the subject may continue to participate in the study only 
after the investigator agrees the subject may continue. 
 Subjects will be asked about their treatment history for hypogonadism and the start and stop 
dates of their most recent TRT. 
 Record demographic data, such as ethnic origin, and date of birth. 
 Obtain height, weight and BMI. 
 Record vital signs (sitting BP and heart rate [HR] in triplicate). If the subject is taking 
antihypertensives, then these medications shoul d be taken on the morning of the visit with 
sips of water.

CONFIDENTIAL  Ensure adequate venous access in the left or right arm to allow collection of a number of 
blood samples via a venous cannula. 
 
 Collect samples for hematology, clinical chem istry, and urine dipstick after subjects have 
fasted overnight. Eligibility laboratory tests will include complete blood count, chemistry 
panel, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amin otransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, 
creatinine, lipids, and albumin. 
 
 Obtain PSA 
 
 A glycosylated hemoglobin test will be performed for diabetic subjects only.  
 
 Obtain blood sample for total T determination between 6:00 and 10:00 AM. 
9.1.2 Screen 2 approximately 7 (± 2) days post Screen 1 
The Screen 2 visit should occur between 6:00 and 10:00 AM, approximately 7 (2±) days after the 
Screen 1 visit, and after results from the Screen 1 total T value have been received. Subjects should 
return for the Screen 2 visit only if the Screen 1 visit total T is < 300 ng/dL and no exclusionary 
values for safety are identified. No rescreening will be allowed for T levels ≥ 300 ng/dL.  
The Screen 2 assessments include: 
 Assess for eligibility (against the inclusion and exclusion criteria). 
 Record any changes in prior and concomitant medications. 
 Perform a physical examination (including DRE).  
 Obtain blood sample for the second total T determination approximately 7 days after the 
initial sample, between 6:00 and 10:00 AM.  
 Review for AEs.  
9.2 Run-In and PK Phases 
9.2.1 Run-In Phase (14±2 Days) 
During the Run-In Phase, subjects will be instructed to take study drug BID just before the morning (breakfast) and evening (dinner) meals ap proximately 12 hours apart, which will suppress 
subjects’ endogenous testosterone production while allowing the oral TU to reach steady state.

CONFIDENTIAL 9.2.2 Run-In Phase Dosing Day 1  
Once it has been confirmed the subject’s total T values at the Screen 1 and Screen 2 visits meet 
eligibility criteria (morning total T values of <300 ng/dL [obtained between 6:00 and 10:00 am] 
drawn on 2 separate days approximately 7 (±2) days apart), the subject will be asked to return to 
the clinic for Run-In Dosing Day 1 prior to breakfas t (ie, overnight fast). No rescreening will be 
allowed for total T levels ≥ 300 ng/dL. Study center personnel will review prior and concomitant 
medications.  
The following Run-In Dosing Day 1 procedures should be performed pre-dose: 
 Assess for eligibility (against the inclusion a nd exclusion criteria) and if the subject meets 
eligibility 
 Collect safety laboratory tests after an overnight fast.  
 Collect pre-dose blood samples for T, DHT and TU concentrations.  
 Record vital signs [sitting BP and heart rate (HR) in triplicate]. Obtain vital signs prior to 
blood draws. 
 Perform a brief physical examination. 
 
 Dispense one bottle of 237 mg capsules and instruct subject to take first dose immediately 
prior to the breakfast, which will be provided at  the clinic. Document in drug accountability 
record.   
 Instruct subjects to take study medication twice-daily immediately  before breakfast and 
dinner meals each day. Subjects will be instructed to maintain their regular diet throughout 
the Run-In Phase. 
 Instruct subjects to bring all study drug with them to the clinic the evening of Run-In Dosing 
Day 14 (±2) prior to the evening dose and meal.   
 Assess for AEs and changes in concomitant medications. 
9.2.3 Run-In Phase, Dosing Day 14 (±2) 
Subjects should not take their PM dose or eat before arrival at the overnight clinic in the evening of Run-In Phase Dosing Day 14. Vital sign measur ements will be obtained (sitting BP and HR in

CONFIDENTIAL concomitant medications (with sips of water) and morning dose of study medication. Subjects will 
be administered their evening dose of study medication immediately prior to the provided, 
protocol-defined evening meal at the clinic.  Site personnel will document any changes in concomitant medications and assess any previous and/ or new AEs, collect study medication and 
complete drug accountability and determine adequate treatment compliance to proceed with the in-patient PK Phase (>80% compliance). Subjects will take their study dose immediately prior to the protocol-defined meal provided at the Clinic.  Study drug accountability will be performed 
following the PM dose. 
9.2.4 PK Phase/Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5  
Each participating site will receive a bottle containing 120 capsules of 237 mg TU from which to 
dispense study medication to subjects duri ng Periods 1 through 5 of the PK Phase.   
Vital sign measurements will be obtained (sitting BP and HR in triplicate) and site personnel will confirm that each subject has taken his dose of concomitant medications (with sips of water).  
Blood samples for hematology and clinical chemistry will be collected prior to breakfast. Subjects will be administered their morning dose immediately prior to the protocol-defined breakfast, 
except for fasting period.  Study personnel will provide 1 of 4 defined breakfasts or a 240 mL glass 
of water (for the fasting treatment) on Periods  1 through 5.  Study personnel will provide 
standardized lunch and protocol-defined dinner meals. Subjects will be instructed to consume entire breakfast and dinner meals within 20 minutes .   Subjects will be administered their evening 
dose immediately prior to the protocol-defined di nner.  Subjects should not consume food within 
10 hours prior to the next morning dose during the PK Phase. 
Serial blood samples will be collected over 24 hour s. Samples will be collected as follows:, 0 (pre-
morning dose), 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, and 24 hours after morning dose  (serial sampling 
times are relative to the AM dose). The 24-hour sample collection following dosing on Days 1, 2, 
3, and 4 will also serve as the 0 (pre-dose) samples on Days 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Blood sample collection should be performed within ±10 minutes of the scheduled time points (with the 
exception of the 0-hour time point for each treatment during the PK Phase which should be 
collected within 5 minutes before oral TU dose ad ministration.  Dose administration, meal times 
and sample collection times will be recorded.  
The subject will be asked to consume the entire  breakfast (except during fasting Period) and dinner 
meals within 20 minutes. If unable to consume the entire meal, the subject will return any 
unconsumed portion of the meal to the site pers onnel who record the unconsumed portion. In 
addition to PK blood sampling, the subject will be assessed for AEs. Subjects will be instructed to take their concomitant medications every morning before breakfast (or fasting). Subjects should

9.2.5 PK Phase on Day 6 (Discharge from Unit) 
Subjects will be released from the clinic after the 24-hour blood draw following the 5th treatment 
period of the PK Phase (ie. PK Day 6). Vital signs will be measured (sBP, dBP, HR in triplicate) at 
least 30 minutes prior to collecting the final PK sample.  Complete fasting safety laboratory tests 
will be obtained at the time of the 24 hour PK sample.  A brief physical exam will be performed and AEs will be assessed.  Subjects will be provided with a non-protocol defined morning meal 
before being discharged from the unit.   
9.2.6 Safety Follow-up Phase (5 to 7 days post last-dose) 
Subjects should be contacted (or seen if necessary) 5 to 7 days after their final dose to assess the 
following: 
 Report of an AE that requires further evaluation. 
 Repeat of an abnormal laboratory value or for a laboratory result that requires additional 
follow up. 
 Repeat complete blood count for any subject with an elevated HCT value over 54% on PK Phase Period 5. Elevated HCT will be followed to resolution.  
 Subject may be contacted by telephone for this  safety assessment if no follow up laboratory 
work or assessment of adverse events is required. 
9.3 Early Withdrawal Visit 
Subjects who withdraw from treatment or the study will be asked to undergo the early withdrawal 
assessments and procedures including a physical examination, vital sign measurements (sitting BP and HR in triplicate), review for concomitant medications, AEs, and drug accountability, and if

CONFIDENTIAL 10 PHARMACOKINETICS AND SAFETY VARIABLES 
10.1 Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Serial blood sampling for total T, DHT and TU will be collected throughout PK Phase Periods 1 
through 5.  Samples will be collected at the following times:  0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14, 18, 21 and 24 hours post the AM dose on each day that a treatment (meal type) is administered.  
The concentrations of total T, DHT and TU collected following each of the defined breakfast 
meals will be analyzed to derive the PK parameters of C
max, time to maximum concentration 
(Tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the 12-hour dosing interval (AUC 12) 
following the AM dose.  
The time of dose administration and the timing of each blood sample collection will be recorded to 
the minute (nominal scheduled time points are li sted in Table 1). Blood sample collection should 
be performed within ± 10 minutes of the scheduled time points (with the exception of the 0-hour time point which should be within 5 minutes before oral TU dose administration on each PK Phase 
treatment day).

CONFIDENTIAL 10.2 Safety Variables 
10.2.1 Adverse Events 
The investigator will monitor each subject for clin ical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine 
basis throughout the study. The investigator will assess and record any AE in detail including the 
date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course, duration, 
outcome, relationship of the AE to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious AEs not 
considered "related" to study drug, the investigator  will provide an “Other” cause of the event. For 
AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse 
events, whether in response to a query, observed by  site personnel, or reported spontaneously by 
the subject will be recorded. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory resolution. 
10.2.1.1 Adverse Event Definition 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended  sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an exacerbation 
of pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction or the significant 
worsening of the indication under investigation th at is not recorded elsewhere in the CRF/eCRF 
under specific efficacy assessments. Anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, including 
the disease under study, that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening 
need not be considered AEs. 
The investigator is responsible for documenting all AEs that occur during the study. Adverse 
events will be elicited by asking the subject a non-leading question, for example, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” Adverse 
events should be reported on the appropriate page of the CRF/eCRF. 
10.2.1.2 Assessment of Severity 
Each AE will be assigned a category by the investigator as follows: 
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, 
and does not interfere with everyday activities. 
Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed. 
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed. 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 38 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event. 
10.2.1.3 Assessment of Causality 
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the following table: 
Definitely not 
related: Clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to study drug administration, and that could be explained by underlying disease or 
other drugs or chemicals or is incontrovertibly not related to the study 
drug. 
Probably not 
related: Clinical event whose time relation ship to study drug administration 
makes a causal connection improbable, but that could plausibly be 
explained by underlying disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Possibly related: Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug 
administration, but that could also be explained by concurrent disease 
or other drugs or chemicals. 
Probably related: Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug 
administration, and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Definitely: Clinical event with plausible time relationship to study drug 
administration, and that cannot be explained by concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals 
10.2.1.4 Action Taken 
The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the CRF/eCRF, as 
follows: 
 Drug withdrawn 
 Drug interrupted 
 Other, specify 
10.2.1.5 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All investigators should follow up subjects with AEs until the event is resolved or until, in the 
opinion of the investigator, the event is stabilized or determined to be chronic. Details of AE 
resolution must be documented in the CRF/eCRF. 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 39 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL Any open AEs at the end of the study should be fo llowed up for 7 days after the subject receives 
the last dose of study drug, and any spontaneous AEs that occur during this time should be 
reported according to the procedures outlined above. 
Pregnancy 
Subjects will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study, in 
female partners of study subjects, should be confirmed and reported to the investigator. The 
investigator should also be notified of pregnanc y occurring during the study but confirmed after 
completion of the study. In the event that a female partner of a study subject is subsequently found to be pregnant, any pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and child will be 
reported to the sponsor after delivery. 
10.2.1.6 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events 
AEs should be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures outlined below. All 
AEs occurring during the study must be documented on the relevant CRF/eCRF pages. The 
following data should be documented for each AE: 
 Description of the symptom event 
 Classification as “serious” or “not serious” 
 Severity 
 Date of first occurrence and date  of resolution (if applicable) 
 If the date of first occurrence is on or after date of initial dosing, the AE is regarded as 
“treatment emergent”. 
 Action taken 
 Causal relationship 
 Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not ye t recovered, recovered with sequelae, death 
[with date and cause reported]) 
10.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
10.2.2.1 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose, 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 40 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL  Results in death. 
 Is life threatening (an AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred, ie, it does not include a reaction that might have caused death 
if it had occurred in a more serious form). 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitali zation. (Complications occurring during 
hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current hospitalization. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing non-worsening 
condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of such hospitalizations must be 
recorded on the medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF). 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. (An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out 
normal life functions). 
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect of  an offspring or a female partner or a study 
subject. 
In addition, medical and scientific judgment is re quired to decide if prompt notification is required 
in situations other than those defined for SAEs above. This may include any event that the investigator regards as serious that did not st rictly meet the criteria above but may have 
jeopardized the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or that 
would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may be 
associated with the use of the investigational product. 
10.2.2.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE must be reported by the investigator if it occurs during the clinical study or within 7 days 
of receiving the study drug, whether or not the SAE is considered to be related to the 
investigational product. An SAE report consists of the SAE form, the AE form, and the 
concomitant medication form. A copy of these forms must be faxed within 24 hours  for the 
attention of the product safety scientist at: 
The investigator should not wait to receive additional information to document fully the event 
before notification of a SAE, though additional information may be requested. Where applicable, 
information from relevant laboratory results, hospi tal case records, and autopsy reports should be 
obtained. 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 41 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL Instances of death, congenital abnormality, or an event that is of such clinical concern as to 
influence the overall assessment of safety, if brought to the attention of the investigator at any time 
after cessation of study drug administration and link ed by the investigator to this study, should be 
reported to the study monitor. 
The sponsor will promptly notify all relevant in vestigators and the regulatory authorities of 
findings that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact on the conduct of the study or 
alter the institutional review board (IRB) approval/favorable opinion of the study. The sponsor, 
will expedite the reporting to all concerned investigators, to the IRBs, where required, and to the 
regulatory authorities of all adverse reactions that are both serious and unexpected. 
10.2.3 Clinical Laboratory  
The hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory analyses will be performed by certified laboratories. Reference ranges will be supplied by each laboratory and used by the investigator to 
assess the laboratory data for clinical significance and pathological changes. 
10.2.3.1 Hematology, Chemistry, and Urine Dipstick 
Blood samples for the clinical safety laboratory tests will be collected at Screening 1 and on PK 
Phase Period 5 (refer to Schedule of Assessmen ts Table in Appendix A). Samples for serum 
chemistry tests will be collected in the morning after obtaining vital signs and after overnight fasting, but before meals and study drug administra tion. The test results from screening will serve 
as the baseline for future clinical assessments. 
Certified laboratories will process and provide results for the tests conducted at screening and

Any laboratory test value obtained during the treatment phases that falls outside the reference 
range that the investigator considers to be clinically significant will be repeated to verify the 
out-of-range value and will be followed to a satisf actory clinical resolution. Investigators may 
consider laboratory abnormalities which are considered clinically significant to be AEs. A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the study or requires a subject 
to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE. Clinical laboratory testing must be performed by 
appropriately credentialed laboratory. 
10.2.3.2 Prostate-Specific Antigen 
Blood samples for PSA will be collected at Screen ing 1 and PK Phase Period 5 prior to discharge 
from the clinical facility. The blood sample must be collected before a DRE (if a DRE is also 
performed). 
10.2.4 Vital Sign Measurements 
Body temperature, BP and HR will be measured at screening and daily during the PK Phase. (see 
Appendix A). The vital sign measurements at screening will serve as the baseline measurements 
for clinical assessments. The subject should be sitt ing at rest for at least 5 minutes with his feet 
resting on the floor and before the BP and HR being measured 3 times at 1 to 2 minute intervals. 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 43 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL Blood pressure should be obtained prior to blood draws and measured by an automated, 
oscillometric device in the non-dominant arm, usin g a cuff that is appropriate for the size of the 
arm (during the course of the study, the same si ze cuff for the subject should be used). Study 
center personnel should ensure that there has been no recent caffeine or cigarette exposure (within 
30 minutes of reading) and that the subject’s bladder is empty. During BP measurements, the arm 
should be supported so that the bottom of the cuff is  at the height of the heart (1 to 2 cm above the 
elbow). The cuff bladder (the part that inflates) shoul d encircle at least 80% of the arm, if in doubt 
a larger cuff should be used. Whenever possible, the cuff should be in contact with skin, or very light clothing. Neither the subject nor the person measuring the BP should talk during the BP 
assessment. Study center personnel should explain th e need to remain silent for accurate readings 
in advance.   
10.2.5 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screen 2. A brief examination will be 
performed at the conclusion of PK Phase Period 5 and will include at minimum examination of 
head/eyes/ears/nose/throat. Height and weight will be measured at screening only. The subject will 
wear lightweight clothing and no shoes. Subject's he ight and weight will be used to calculate BMI. 
For all subjects, a symptom-directed physical examination will be performed when necessary. Any relevant findings from the physical examination dur ing screening will be recorded on the Medical 
History CRF/eCRF (for findings from the past). Any significant physical examination findings 
after dosing will be recorded as AEs. 
10.2.6 International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) 
The I-PSS, a validated questionnaire used to assess the severity and impact of urinary symptoms, 
will be used to exclude subjects with moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate hypertrophy 
(Appendix C). Subjects will complete the I-PSS provided by the sponsor as defined in the 
Schedule of Assessments Table (Appendix A). The screening I-PSS score (total I-PSS) must be ≤ 
19 to meet eligibility requirements. The I-PSS ques tionnaire will be repeated for early withdrawal 
subjects. 
10.3 Handling and Processing of PK Blood Sample Collections 
Results from a recent study evaluating the degradation of TU to T in conditions typically used in 
clinical studies showed that for subjects receivin g oral TU, the analysis of T in blood collected in 
red top tubes to separate serum causes overestima tion of T exposure. This overestimation occurs 
because of the ex vivo  conversion of TU to T by non-specific esterases in blood. Ex vivo  
conversion can be minimized by collecting blood into tubes that contain the esterase inhibitor 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 44 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL sodium fluoride (NaF), by immediately placing the samples on ice after collection, and by 
processing the samples at 4°C. Therefore analys is of T and TU in plasma, combined with the 
addition of NaF in the sample collection tube as an  esterase inhibitor is being used in this study.10 
The total volume of blood to be collected from each subject during the study will not exceed 
approximately 500 mL. Details on the handling and processing of samples are provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
10.4 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The PK and safety assessments planned for this st udy are widely used and generally recognized as 
reliable, accurate, and rele vant for a pharmacokinetics and tolerability study. 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 45 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL 11 STATISTICAL METHODS 
11.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
The PK, and safety variables and associated analyses are described in this section.  
General methodology will include descriptive tabular and/or graphical summarizations by meal 
type at each dosing session of the PK Phase. Continuous variables will be presented using the 
descriptive statistics of number of observations (n),  mean, standard deviation, standard error of the 
mean, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical values will be summarized with counts and percentages.  
All collected data will be presented in listings. 
11.2 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
The pharmacokinetics of total T will be assessed by using noncompartmental analysis to analyze 
the total T concentrations from PK samples collected during each of the 5 treatment periods within 
the PK Phase of the study. The primary comparison of interest will be the dosing interval 
following the five protocol defined breakfasts (AM dose).  The total T PK parameters to be 
assessed within each relevant dosing interval will be peak concentration (C
max), the time of peak 
concentration (T max), the area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC 12) and the time-
weighted average total T concentration (C avg).  Also to be calculated, when sufficient concentration 
data exist, will be the analogous parameters for the dosage interval following the PM dose of TU during each of the 5 treatment periods within the PK Phase, and the analogous PK parameters 
(C
max, Tmax, AUC 24 and C avg) for the combined 24-hour period that includes both the AM and the 
PM doses of TU for each specific treatment period. 
The concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters for the individual subjects will be listed, and 
tabular summaries provided by treatment, along with appropriate desc riptive statistics.  
The 30 gram fat breakfast treatment will serve as th e reference meal in the comparisons to identify 
the effect of meal type on C max, AUC 12 and C avg for total T.  Subjects must have consumed the 
reference meal containing 30 g fat and at least on e other treatment meal during the PK Phase, and 
to be evaluable for at least C max or AUC 12 with respect to those minimum two meals in order to be 
included in the PK population.  
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the natural logarithms of C max, AUC 12 and 
Cavg with treatment received, sequence, and period as  fixed effects and subject as a random effect 
within sequence.  Treatment carryover effects will be estimated by testing sequence using subjects 
within sequence as the error term. Two-way contrasts will be made using the 30 g fat meal as the 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 46 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL reference treatment, and the point estimate and 90% confidence interval (CI) for the least squares 
(LS) mean difference in PK parameters on the log scale between the contrasted treatments will be 
exponentiated to obtain estimates for ratios of LS geometric means on the original scale. No food 
effect will be concluded for a contrasted treatment if the 90% CI about the ratio of LS geometric 
means of C max and AUC 12 for that contrast lie totally within the 0.80 to 1.25 interval. 
11.3 Safety Endpoints 
11.3.1 Systolic Blood Pressure  
Observed values in vital sign measurements, incl uding sBP, dBP, HR, and changes from baseline 
in sBP, dBP, and HR will be summariz ed at each scheduled collection visit. 
11.3.2 Other Safety Endpoints 
Other key safety endpoints are:  
 Incidence of AEs 
 Change in physical examination findings 
 Change in vital sign measurements 
 Change in clinical laboratory tests, including hematocrit, and PSA. 
All safety endpoints will be analyzed using the safety population except if otherwise defined..  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 15.1. An AE is considered treatment-emergent if it begins or worsens in severity after the 
first dose of randomized study drug. The number  and percentage of subjects with treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be tabula ted by system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
term. A summary of the number of subjects with TEAEs will be provided by severity and by 
relationship to study drug. If for any AE severity and/or relationship to drug is missing, then the 
least favorable choice(s) (Severe and Definitely) will be assigned for purposes of tabulation and 
listing.  Subjects reporting more than 1 AE for a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted 
only once for that term using the most severe incident. Subjects reporting more than 1 type of event within an SOC will be counted only once for that SOC. Incidence of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, 
TEAEs resulting in discontinuation from study drug, and TEAEs resulting in death will be 
summarized. Listings will be provided for all AEs, SAEs, and AEs resulting in treatment 
discontinuation. 
Physical examination and results will be summarized at each scheduled visit.  
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 47 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL Laboratory tests will be performed at screening 1 and at Day 6 and will be summarized are noted 
in Section 10.2.3. 
11.4 Other Variables 
11.4.1 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to tabulate and summarize demographics and baseline 
characteristics (age [years], race, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index, I-PSS, etc.). 
11.4.2 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Duration of treatment in days will be summarized for all subjects. The number of subjects who 
required termination of study drug treatment will be summarized. 
Compliance will be calculated as the actual number divided by the expected number of dosages.  
11.4.3 Medical and Medication History 
Medications and a complete medical history will be obtained at screening. These will serve as the 
baseline for future clinical assessments. 
11.4.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the September 2012 World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. Prior me dications will be defined as medications 
documented on the Prior and Concomitant Medications CRF/eCRF as having started and stopped before the first dose of any study drug. Concomit ant medications will be defined as medications 
documented on the Prior and Concomitant Medications CRF/eCRF as having started after the start of study drug or having started before the start of study drug and continued on or after the first 
dose of any study drug. Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized in separate tables.  
All concomitant medications administered will be tabulated in a data listing. 
11.5 Handling of Missing Data 
Missing PK concentrations will not be imputed. A missing concentration value adjacent to the 
existing C
max will make a subject non-evaluable for C max and AUC calculations. If more than one 
concentration in sequence is missing the subject  will be considered non-evaluable for AUCs, 
unless the missing concentrations are embedded in a series of assay results that are below the limit 
of quantitation (BLQ). Single embedded missing c oncentrations will be treated as missing and the 
affected AUCs calculated by extending the trapezoid to the next existing concentration. Leading, 
Clarus Therapeutics, Inc.  15 September 2016 
CLAR-16015 Version 1.0 Page 48 of 68 
CONFIDENTIAL trailing and embedded BLQ values will be treated as 0.5 x lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for 
T. Missing actual sample collection times may be replaced with nominal scheduled sample 
collection times based on case-by-case review.  
11.6 Sample Size 
Approximately 20 hypogonadal subjects will be enrolled at two to three study centers. This 
number is based on the following considerations and assumptions: 
If 20 subjects are enrolled, approximately 16 subjects are expected to complete the PK Phase. 11.7 Protocol Deviations 
The investigator should not implement any deviation from the protocol without prior review and 
agreement by the sponsor and in accordance with the IRB and local regulations, except when 
necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. When a deviation from the protocol 
is deemed necessary for an individual subject, the investigator must alert one of the following 
people:

course of the study by the sponsor or its nominated  representative. In addition, inspections may be 
conducted by regulatory authorities at their discretion. 
12.2 Monitoring 
Data for each subject will be recorded on a CRF/eCRF. Data collection must be completed for 
each subject who signs an informed consent form (ICF) and is administered study drug. 
In accordance with current Good Clinical Practice  and International Conference on Harmonisation 
of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, 
the study monitor will carry out s ource document verification at regular intervals to ensure that the 
data collected in the CRF/eCRF are accurate and reliable. 
The investigator must permit the monitor, the IRB, the sponsor’s internal auditors, and 
representatives from regulatory authorities direct access to all study-related documents and pertinent hospital or medical records for confirmation of data contained within the DRF/eCRFs. 
12.3 Data Management and Coding 
Data Management and coding activities include setting up a relevant database and data transfer 
mechanisms, along with appropriate validation of data and resolution of queries.  
Study centers will enter data directly onto a paper CRF/eCRF for entry into a secure data base. All 
data must be verifiable against source documents at the study center. Data recorded directly on the 
CRF/eCRF will be identified and the CRF/eCRF wi ll be considered the source document.  
Medical coding will use MedDRA version 15.1 for concomitant diseases and AEs and WHODrug 
dictionary dated Septembe r 2012 for concomitant diseases and AEs and WHODrug for 
medications. 
Missing or inconsistent data will be queried in  writing to the investigator for clarification.

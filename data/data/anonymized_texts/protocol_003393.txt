1.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Disease Background  
1.1.1  Epidemiology  and scope  
Worldwide,  primary  liver cancer  is a major  health  problem  with more  than 500,000  
new cases  diagnosed  yearly.  It is the fifth most  common  neoplasm,  and the third most  
common  cause  of cancer -related  death.1 In some  areas  of Asia,  HCC  is the most  
common  cause  of death  due to cancer.  The American  Cancer  Society  estimates  that 
33,190  people  will be diagnosed  with HCC  or intrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma  in the 
US in 20142. The incidence  has been  increasing  in Europe3 3and in the US2,4and it is 
estimated  that its incidence  in the US will equal  that currently  reported  in Japan  within  
two decades.5 Primary  liver cancer  is one of 4 cancer  sites that has increased  death  
rates  between  1990  and 2004,  and is the only cancer  that has shown  more  than 10% 
increase  (41%  and 28% rate increases  for males  and females,  respectively). 2 This 
disease is  clearly a growing problem.  
 
1.1.2  Current  Therapies for unresectable intrahepatic cancer  
 
Complete  resection  is the most  effective  therapy  for HCC.  Unfortunately,  curative  
surgery  cannot be offered to most  patients.  Many patients are inoperable due to co-
morbidity, and others  present  with disease  extent  that requires  resections  that would  
not leave  sufficient  residual  functional  liver parenchyma.  For instance,  Abdalla  et al. 
reported  the M.D. Anderson  experience  with hepatic  resection. 6 Of 418 patients  who 
were  deemed  resectable  and were  explored,  only 190 patients  (45%)  underwent  
complete  resection.  Three major therapies have been  used for these  unresectable 
patients.  
 
1.1.2.1  Radiofrequency  Ablation (RFA)  
In a prospective  trial by Lencioni  and colleagues7, 10% of 206 patients  
initially  evaluated  for RFA had contraindications  based  on tumor  location.  
After  these  patients  were  excluded,  20% had an inadequate  response  to RFA 
(viable  tumor  remaining  after 1 month).  Of the patients  who had an inadequate  
response  to RFA,  only approximately  half of the patients  were  controlled  by a 
second  RFA.  Finally,  10% of patients  who were  thought  to be controlled  
recurred  locally  within  3 years.  In a systematic  review  of the use of RFA for HCC,  
local failures  over a 3 year period  tend to average  from 10 - 29%,  and failure  
elsewhere  in the liver approximately  50%.8 In the case  of metastases  from 
colorectal  cancer,  recurrences  after RFA range from 2-39%,  with other  liver 
failures  from 14-58%.8 In all series, local failure  increases  with tumor  size > 3-
4 cm. Our experience  at the University  of Michigan  suggests  a similar  or 
somewhat  higher  local failure  rate.9 In this proposal,  we anticipate  focusing  
on patients  who have  recurred  after RFA or have  tumors  that are not 
amenable  to RFA,  such  as tumors  greater  than 3.5 cm in size, as well as 
those abutting vasculature, lung, or bile duct.  
 
1.1.2.2  Transcatheter Arterial ChemoEmbolization (TACE)  
Although  some  trials  and an initial  randomized  trial showed  no difference  
between  chemoembolization  and best supportive  care1011more  recent  studies  
have  begun  to suggest  that chemoembolization  can improve  survival  of a subset  
of patients  with hepatocellular  carcinoma.12,13A systematic  review  of all modern  
randomized  trials suggests  that TACE  modestly  prolongs  survival  (from  
approximately  16 months  to 20 months),  compared  to best supportive  case,  for 
patients  with tumors  < 6 cm who have  excellent  performance  status  and do 
not have  portal  vein thrombosis14,15.However,  TACE  is not a curative  therapy  
and tumors  typically  recur  even  after multiple TACE a dministrations,  
7  suggesting  that additional therapies  are required.  
 
1.1.2.3  Radiation Therapy  
In our previous  series  of prospective  clinical  trials,16,17 we found  improved  
survival  with higher  radiotherapy  dose.  Further,  dose  delivered  was the most  
important  predi ctive factor  for survival.  Indeed,  approximately  20% of patients  
receiving  >75 Gy using 1.5 Gy BID are alive 4 years  after treatment;  historically  
that number  would  be very close  to 0%. These  data are proof  of principle  that 
focused  radiation  can control  intrahepatic  cancer,  and that we are experienced  
in these  techniques.18 Since  the mid 2000s,stereotactic  body  radiotherapy  
(SBRT) has gained  in popularity,  due to the improvement  in convenience,  with 
5, rather  than 30 or more  treatments.  We have  recently  published  our results,  
which  are in line with other  experiences.  In the immediately  preceding  study,  we 
used  stereotactic  body  radiotherapy  to successfully  and safely  treat liver tumors,  
with 97% 1 year local control  and no significant  liver toxicity.19 High efficacy  
and safety  were  obtained  by individualizing  treatment  based  on not only pre-
treatment  liver function,  but also each  patient’s  tolerance  to radiation.  In this new 
protocol,  we intend  to test our ability  to further  individualize  and adapt  
treatment  based  on the geometric  distribution of  functional  liver parenchyma  
for patients with larger tumors and poor liver function . 
 
1.1.3  Avoidance of Radiation Induced Liver Decompensation (Change in CP and ALBI 
score)  
 
Classically, radiation liver damage was measured with the endpoint of radiation induced 
liver disease (RILD) based  on prior work on whole liver radiation20,21. However, in the 
modern era with daily imaging and highly conformal radiotherapy, RILD is very rare22. 
Currently, radiation liver toxicity is more aptly defined by functional liver  decompensation 
in terms of the development of portal hypertension, new onset ascites, and encephalopathy  
as well as objective  lab values . Many groups have published on a change in Child -Pugh 
score of greater than or equal to 2 and change in the  albumin and bilirubin (ALBI score) as 
more meaningful endpoints23-26. One of the key hypotheses of this trial is that by avoiding 
functional liver and adapting dose based on liver function, we will minimize these toxic 
effects. The patients who are at highest risk of decompensation are patients who have poor 
liver function at baseline. Most patients with HCC present with concurrent cirrhosis which 
puts t hem at higher risk of decompensation post radiation. Using spatial functional 
information as well as direct global measures of liver function  e.g. ICG, baseline CP score 
and ALBI , we hope to deliver a tumoricidal dose without causing toxicity. 
 
 
1.1.4  Adjusting  global  RT dose  based  on liver function  as assessed  through  
clearance  of Indocyanine  Green.  Although  we developed  the most  accurate  
population -based  model  for predicting  RILD  for patients  receiving  fractionated  
radiation  therapy,  we are aware  that there  are limitations  when  applying  this 
to individual  patients,  with variable  sensitivity  to radiation.  Relying  solely  on the 
model  unnecessarily  exposes  patients  with high sensitivity  to radiation  to a 
high risk of toxicity,  while  at the same  time,  it also denies  patients  with 
average  and low sensitivity  to higher  doses  of radiotherapy,  which  could  
increase  tumor  control.  In the preceding  clinical  trial, we individualized  therapy  
based  on the sensitivity  of individual  patient.  Initial  liver function  was 
characterized  by measuring  the clearance  of indocyanine  green,  a dye taken  
up by the plasma  almost  exclusively  by the hepatic  parenchymal  cells and 
secreted  entirely  into the bile without  undergoing  any significant  extrahepatic  
or enterohepatic  circulation.  It has been  used  extensively  to predict  mortality  
after liver resection  and severe  trauma27 28.We delivered  3 treatments  of SBRT,  
waited  4 weeks  to detect  subclinical  decline  in liver function,  and adjusted  
radiation  dose  for 2 remaining  treatments,  based  on the stability  or decline  in 
8  function19. Insertion  of a treatment  break  did not compromise  tumor  control.  
Indeed,  1 year local control  for the first 76 patients  was 97%,  comparable  
to any other  prospective  or retrospective  report.  Patients  with very poor liver 
function  (Child  Pugh  B and even  C) were  treated  safely  on trial, suggesting  that 
modifying  radiation  dose  part-way through  treatment  successfully  avoided  
what would have been severe  toxicity.  Our initial analysis of the first 20 patients 
evaluable on the study showed that we need to begin adapting treatment prior 
to the first 3/5 of radiation delivery. We plan to accru e an additional 40 patients 
to examine the feasibility of up front individualization  in addition to mid treatment 
adaptation to minimize toxicity and maintain excellent local control.  We have 
demonstrated that patients with good liver function and small tu mors (<3.5 cm) 
have excellent local control and very low rates of toxicity. The current protocol 
looks at adapting therapy for patients with good liver function (CPA to B7) but 
larger tumors where more liver parenchyma would receive radiation thereby 
incre asing the risk of toxicity and those with poor liver function (CP B8 and above) 
who at baseline are at increased risk of liver decompensation post treatment.  
Our interim analysis has revealed that a combination of albumin and bilirubin, 
called ALBI , which is an accurate predictor of survival for patients with HCC with 
liver dysfunction36, is as or more useful than  ICG in estimating liver function  and 
predicting future toxicity .  Thus, either ICG or ALBI can be used in this trial . 
9   
 
 
1.1.4.1  Adjusting  spatial  RT distribution  based  on regional  liver function  as 
assessed  by perfusion  MRI. This protocol  builds  on over 25 years  of experience  with 
high dose liver RT, and in particular adaptive RT  aimed  at adjusting the global  radiation  
dose  based  on a patient’s  measured  sensitivity  to treatment.  The next leap forward  
is to use functional  imaging  to spare  highly  functional  portions  of the liver.  We have  
previously  demonstrated  that dynamic  contrast -enhanced  (DCE  or perfusion)  MRI 
correlates  with global  liver function  as measured  by ICG, and that regionally,  function  
declines  as a function  of delivered  radiation  dose.29 This and, potentially, o ther 
advanced MRI techniques,  provides  the opportunity  to sculpt  dose  away  from high-
functioning  parts  of the liver to improve  the safety  of treatment.  
 
1.2 Study  Agent(s)  Background  and Associated  Known  Toxicities  
We have  over 25 years  of experience  with liver radiotherapy.  As discussed above, change in 
Child Pugh status and ALBI are the primary toxicity endpoints .  Additionally,  depending on 
the tumor  location  and proximity to normal  structures  including stomach, small  bowel,  colon,  
and right kidney,  there  is a small  risk of GI bleed  or renal damage.  These  are quite rare in 
our experience, minimize  with careful treatment  planning and delivery.  Indocyanine  green is 
FDA approved and has been in use for 50 years  to estimate  liver function.  In patients 
without an  iodine  allergy, it is quite safe.  Patients  with iodine  allergies will  be excluded  from 
participation in this study.  
 
1.3 Rationale  
This is a pilot single arm study  with a goal of obtaining  preliminary  estimates  of safety  and 
efficacy. This protocol builds on over 25 years  of experience  with high dose liver  RT, and in 
particular adaptive  RT aimed at adjusting  the global  radiation  dose  based on a patient’s  
measured  sensitivity  to treatment.  Using functional imaging  to spare  highly functional 
portions of the liver is a novel  concept,  and as far as we know, we are the only ones  currently 
in a position to put this into practice.  We feel this will further  improve the safety and efficacy 
of RT for all patients  by customizing  treatments to each.  If this approach is promising, we will 
proceed to a phase II randomized  study of standard  versus spatially and dosimetrically  
adapted RT.  
  
1.4 Quality  of life  
The quality of life of patients with liver tumors  is not well-studied.  For these  patients,  
many  of whom already suffer from chronic  medical problems including cirrhosis, it is 
particularly important to understand how tumor -directed treatments impact quality of life.  
The Functional  Assessment of Cancer  Therapy -Hepatobiliary (FACT -Hep) version 4 

10  questionnaire will be used in this study to measure QOL.  This is a 45-item validated  
instrument used in other  clinical trials  of treatment for liver cancer, including  the RTOG  
1112  international randomized trial of sorafenib  +/- SBRT.  
 
1.5 Correlative  Studies  
 
1.5.1  Assessment of plasma  and serum biomarkers : Classic  RILD  is caused by veno -
occlusive  disease, which is likely related to endothelial cell apoptosis as  an 
initiating lesion.  Radiati on also induces various  proinflammatory cytokines, 
including tumor  necrosis  factor -alpha (TNF -alpha) and  transforming growth  factor -
beta 1,30 and hepatic microvascular pathogenesis  that lead to apoptosis  in the 
liver.31 Elevation  of TGF -beta has been associated wit h RILD in  wom en 
undergoing bone marrow  transplantation  for breast cancer32.   In addition,  an 
increased TNF -alpha  production has been associated with the progression of 
hepatic veno -occlusive  diseases  in stem cell transplant patients33, suggesting  the 
potential  role of cytokines  in radiation -induced liver  apoptosis.  Our preclinical 
studies demonstrate  the TNF alpha  may play a key role in  radiation injury of  the 
liver.33   We have  experience  measuring  cytokines in patient plasma.34 We propose  
to measure  these  cytokines  and other potential circulating biomarkers in plasma  
and serum , and retrospectively assess their potential contribution  to individualize 
our assessment of liver injury that could be used to adjust liver  dose.

After  informed consent is obtained and  PRIOR  to the initiation of pr otocol therapy all patients  
satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria  will have eligibility confirmed by the Clinical Trials Office.  
The patient will not be considered  registered and enrolled in the study until all information  is 
confirmed by  the Clinical Trials  Office  Data Manager.  
 
 
5.0 TREATMENT  PLAN  
5.1 Treatment  Dosage and Administration  
Protocol treatment must start within 30  business days of enrollment to the study.  
5.1.1  Global  and regional assessment of liver function  
5.1.1.1  Global  functional assessment  with indocyanine green (ICG) 
clearance  Preparation and administration of indocyanine green will be as 
per package  insert by trained personnel  in the Michigan Clinical Research 
Unit (MCRU).  In some patients, indocyanine green will not be used, in favor 
of ALBI score. 
13   
5.1.1.1.1  Evaluations with ICG or ALBI will occur  within  4 weeks prior to the 
start of RT, at  approximately 4 -6 weeks after the completion of the first 3/5 of 
planned  treatments, and approximately 1 -3 months after  RT is completed.  
5.1.1.1.2  For patients scheduled  to have  ICG testing  for other  reasons  
(including prior or  subsequent enrollment  in this or other protocols),  every 
effort will be made to use results  for both purposes,  to avoid  duplication, 
including extending windows by an extra 4 weeks in each  direction.  
5.1.1.2  Baseline bloodwork and physical exam to obtain ALBI and Child Pugh 
score  
5.1.1.3  Regional  functional  assessment wit h perfusion MRI  
MRIs  will be obtained by trained  personnel in the Department of Radiation  Oncology  
at the University of Michigan.  
5.1.1.3.1  Evaluations will  occur  within  4 weeks prior to the start of RT, at  
approximately 4 -6 weeks after the completion of the first 3/5 of planned  
treatments, and approximately 1 -3 months after  RT is completed.  
5.1.1.3.2  For patients scheduled  to have perfusion MRI for other  reasons 
(including prior or subsequent  enrollment in this or other  protocols), every 
effort  will be made  to use results for both purposes, to avoid duplication, 
including  extending  windows by an extra 4 weeks in  each direction.  
5.1.1.4  Functional assessment with MRI  
MRIs  will be obtained by trained  personnel in the Departm ent of Radiation  Oncology  
at the University of Michigan.  
5.1.1.4.1  Evaluations will  occur  within  4 weeks prior to the start of RT, at  
approximately 3-6 weeks after the completion of the first 3/5 of planned  
treatments, and approximately 1 -3 months after  RT is completed.  
5.1.1.4.2  For patients scheduled  to have MRI for other  reasons (including 
prior or subsequent  enrollment in this or other  protocols), every effort  will 
be made  to use results for both purposes, to avoid duplication, including  
extending  windows by an extra  4 weeks in  each direction.  
 
5.1.2  Initial  radiotherapy plan  
5.1.2.1  CT with or  without MRI simulation will be  performed in  treatment  
planning position, with appropriate immobilization, as is  standard of care.  
 
5.1.2.2  Radiation target  volumes.  The gross tumor  volume  (GTV)  will be defined  on 
CT or  MRI. Appropriate  patient -specific margins for motion  will be added for patients 
unable  to tolerate  breath hold for treatment.  No margin  will be added for microscopic 
extent, as per routine  clinical  practice.  A PTV margin  will be added as per standard  
practice, typically  5mm radially and 8mm superiorly and inferiorly.  
 
5.1.2.3  PTV Target Doses.  Doses will be prescribed  to a peripheral  covering  isodose 
covering the PTV, except in  cases where this would exceed  recommended  doses to 
organs at risk (OARs).  In these  cases, heterogeneous  dose distributions sparing 
these OARs  are expected.  The dose per fraction  will be determined by the risk of 
liver damage, which will  be fixed  at ≤10% for the initial  3/5 of treatment.  The full 
treatment  plan will be devised at this time in order to account for total normal tissue  
dose if patients are able to proceed  with the entire  treatment.  The remaining  2/5 of 
treatment will be determined as per section 11  and potentially reduced  based on liver 
function.  Maximum  prescribed tumor  dose will be 5 5 Gy in 5 fractions , which we 
have shown that this dose is adequate for 95% local control at 2 years  even for large 
tumors . 
 
 
5.1.2.4  OAR  Limits.  Standard  OAR limits in routine clinical practice  will be 
applied and  will take priority over target  coverage.  
 
14  5.1.3  Radiation Schedule.  The first 3/5 of the treatment  plan will be delivered in the initial  
phase.  The dose of radiation will be based on baseline ICG  or ALBI , CP score, and functional 
liver imaging for an NTCP < 10% for a predicted CP score change of greater than or equal to 
2. After  an approximately 4 week break  and re-assessment of liver function  with ICG  testing  
or ALBI , the final 2/5 of treatment  may be delivered, as  per section 11.  Patients who have , or 
would be predicted to have, u nacceptable Toxicity (as defined in section 8.6)  at the 
reassessment  point will receive  no additional therapy at that time.  
 
5.1.4  Adaptive radiotherapy plan for the final 2/5 of treatment.  Each patient will  be treated in 
two parts.  In the  first part, the dose will be determined using the current normal  tissue 
complication probabilit y (NTCP)  model and spatial liver function  considered in  treatment  
planning.  The patient's baseline and 2nd global and spatial liver function  assessments  will be 
used to individualize the second part of treatment. Based  on the MRI,  adjustments in  the 
dose distribution  will be  made to maximize remaining liver function and target  active  tumor  
subvolumes.  Accumulated data  from the trial will be used to update the individualization 
model.  
 
5.2 Toxicities  and Dosing  Delays/Dose Modifications  
Patients  who receive  radiation treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.  
Toxicity  will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse  
Events (CTCAE), version  4.0. If these  toxicities occur during treatment , then RT will be  held 
until resolution: Grade  ≥3 ascites, change in ALBI score by 0.5, Child Pugh score greater 
than or equal to 2 . 
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
Therapy  would  typically  continue until delivery  of the intended num ber of fractions . If liver 
function declines  after the first 3/5 of treatments  and does not recover  sufficiently for 
additional therapy, then treatment  will also be  considered  complete  after 3 fractions (see 
above for definition) . 
Treatment will also be  complete if a patient  voluntarily withdraws from treatment  or changes 
in the patient’s  condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in  the 
judgment of the investigator . 
 
5.4 Off Treatment Criteria  
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy when any of the criteria listed in Section  
5.3 apply, with documentation provided. All  patients who discontinue treatment  should  comply 
with protocol specific  follow -up procedures as outlined in Section 6.3. The  only exception to 
this requirement is when  a subject withdraws  consent for all study  procedures,  loses the 
ability to  consent freely,  or is removed from follow  up per the investigator’s  discretion, as in 
Section 5.6.  
 
5.5 Duration of  Follow -Up 
Patients  will be followed for 2 years  after completion of  treatment  or until death,  whichever 
occurs first.  If patients progress outside of the treated tumor, they will only be  followed for 
survival, without mandated  visits with study  personnel, as long as  they are  being  seen 
routinely every 3 -6 months by an oncologist or hepatologist. These clinic  notes  can be 
requested for study purposes, and tumor measurements tracked from  clinical scans.  
 
 
 
5.6 Off Study  Criteria  
Patients  can be taken off study  at any time at their own request,  or they may be  withdrawn 
at the discretion  of the investigator for safety, behavioral  or administrative  reasons. Patients  
will be considered off study  after completion of protocol treatment and  follow-up criteria.  
The reason(s) for discontinuation from study will  be documented and  may include:  
5.6.1  For patients planning to receive IC G testing in lieu of ALBI, patients  will be removed  if 
15  they are unable  to complete  the pre-treatment  and post- 3 fraction  IC Green tests, as 
these are necessary for dose adjustment.  
5.6.2  Patients will be removed if they are unable to receive  RT treatments.  
5.6.3  Patients may be removed from study  at any time by patient request.  
 
5.6.4  Patients  who enroll  in subsequent  liver radiation  therapeutic  trials  are considered  off 
study  for initial  enrollment.  Local  control  for all treated  lesions  will be tracked  on the 
follow  up schedule  for the subsequent  enrollment  to avoid  duplicate  procedures.  
5.6.5  Patients  who have  progression  of the treated  lesion  will be followed  for survival  
and toxicity only.  
5.6.6  Patients  who go on to receive  additional  liver-directed  to the treated  lesion  or 
systemic  therapy  (non-radiation  therapy,  on or off protocol)  will be followed  for 
survival only.  
5.6.7  Patients  can be removed  from study  if they are unable  to comply  with protocol  
requirements.  
5.6.8  Patients  can be removed  from study  if the treating  physician  judges  that 
continuation  on the study  would not be  in their best interest.  
 
5.7 Patient  Replacement  
Patients  who do not complete the pre-treatment and  post 3/5 of treatment IC Green  tests 
or bloodwork to evaluate ALBI score , along  with the initial 3/5 of treatment  are considered 
non-evaluable and will be replaced  until a total of 80 evaluable  patients  is reached  (80 
patients) . 
 
 
6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Screening/Baseline  Procedures  
Assessments  performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this study will be  done only  
after obtaining informed consent. Assessments performed for clinical indications  (not 
exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline  values even if the  
studies  were  done  before informed consent was obtained.  
 
All screening  procedures must be  performed within  30 days  prior to registration unless  
otherwise stated. Baseline  procedures to be completed prior to radiotherapy.  The 
screening procedures  include:  
6.1.1  Informed  Consent  
6.1.2  Medical history  
6.1.3  Review subject eligibility criteria  
6.1.4  Physical  exam: To include  ascites and encephalopathy  
6.1.5  Performance  status  
6.1.6  Baseline adverse event assessment  
6.1.7  Hematology: CBC  
6.1.8  Serum  chemistries:  Comprehensive metabolic panel  (CMP) to include: albumin,  
alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, BUN,  creatinine, electroly tes (sodium,  
potassium), glucose, and total bilirubin.  
6.1.9  Coagulation  assessment:  PT/INR  
6.1.10  Tumor  assessment:  The longest dimension of each tumor to be treated  will be  
measured  and recorded  either on the most  recent diagnostic scan or simulation  
scan.  
6.1.11  Indocyanine  green or ALBI baseline testing: ICG retention  or ALBI will be 
measured by blood test  after study  enrollment and  prior to radiotherapy.  
6.1.12  Blood draw for correlative studies after  study enrollment and prior to radiotherapy.  
See Section  10.0 for details.  
6.1.13  For patients  who consent to this portion of the study,  tumor biopsy  will also be  
performed  (see section 10.1.2)  after study  enrollment  and prior to radiotherapy.  
16   
Generally,  this would be performed at the time of clinically necessary fiducial  
placement for radiation targeting.  
6.1.14  Quality of life assessment  after study enrollment and prior to radiotherapy:  
FACT -HEP (Version 4).  
 
6.2 Procedures  During  Treatment:  See section  5 
 
6.3 Follow -Up Procedures  
Patients will be evaluated approximately  1 month after completion of therapy  and then at 
approximately 3 -6 month intervals until 2 years.  Evaluation will include H&P, laboratories  
(CBC, comprehensive  metabolic  panel,  INR, AFP if elevated at diagnosis),  and liver 
imaging  (beginning 3 months after treatment).  QOL  assessments  will be obtained at the 
same  intervals for 1 year.  ICG or ALBI will be assessed  approximately 1 and 3 months  
after completion of therapy.  Blood and urine (when patient is able to provide) will be 
collected at a pproximately 1 and 3 months after completion of therapy.   MRI will be  
assessed approximately  1 month after completion of therapy.   This follow up schedule will 
adhere to standard of care clinical follow up. Therefore, missed visits and visits that 
diverge from this regimen will not be considered protocol deviations. MRI and  ICG must 
be performed at the University  of Michigan.  However, if patients are not able to travel  for 
all other follow  up evaluations  and procedures, they may  have these  performed  by a local 
physician and records obtained by the study team.  If patients are concurrently  or 
previously enrolled in another research study  which  requires similar testing,  all efforts  will 
be made to avoid unnecessary repeat testing.

Green  in approximately  4 weeks  as a second  attempt.  
5 Patients  who do not qualify  for the final RT  phase  will not undergo  any of the treatment  or 
testing  associated  with that phase.  The final day of the initial  RT phase  will be counted  as 
the last day of treatment,  and the follow  up calendar  will be initiated.

previously  enrolled  on any trial utilizing  IC-Green  (including  this one),  then an evaluation  of 
IC-Green  retention  performed  for the other  trial may be used  as the pre- treatment  
assessment  for this enrollment,  as long as it is within  30 days  prior to initiation  of this new 
course  of RT.

7.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
7.1 Antitumor Effect - Solid  Tumors  
 
Response and progression will  be evaluated in this study using criteria similar to the 
international  criteria set by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  (RECIST)  
Committee  [JNCI 92(3):205 -216, 2000].  However, rather than tracking  the sum of longest  
diameters, each treated tumor will be assessed individually  and the longest diameter  
tracked  in these lesion -specific tumor measurements.  Additionally, at least 4mm  change  
is required for a lesion to be deemed to have progressed or  responded.  mRECIST will  
also be tracked  where possible.30 
 
7.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity.  All patients  will be  evaluable for toxicity  from the time of 
their first radiation treatment.  
 
Evaluable  for objective response.  Only those  patients who have measurable  
disease present at baseline, have completed at least  the first portion of  
treatment,  and ha ve had their disease re-evaluated  will be considered evaluable  
for response. These  patients will have their response  classified  according to the  
definitions  stated below.  
 
7.1.2  Disease Parameters  
All tumor  measurements  must  be recorded  in millimeters. The same method  
assessment and the same  technique should be used to characterize each  identified  
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up if at all possible.  
 
Target lesions . All tumors  treated with radiotherapy are considered  target  lesions  
and measured and recorded separately  at baseline and during follow up scans.  
 
Non-target lesions . All other tumors are  considered  non-target lesions  and will not  be 
tracked except when noted as  new or  progressive (either  within the liver or  outside of 
the liver) on followup  scans.  Measurements are not required.  
 
7.1.3  Response  Criteria  
 
7.1.3.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of target lesion.  
 
Partial  Response (PR ): At least a 30% decrease in the longest diameter  (LD) 
of target  lesion, and at least 4mm decrease, taking as reference the baseline 
LD. 
 
Progressive  Disease (PD ): At least a 20% increase in  the LD of target  lesion, 
and at  least 4mm increase,  taking as reference the smallest LD  recorded  
since the treatment started.  
 
Stable Disease (SD ): Neither sufficient  shrinkage to qualify for PR nor  
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking  as reference the smallest LD  
since the treatment started.  
Note: If subjects respond to treatment  and are able to have their disease  resected, 
19  the patient’s response will be  assessed prior to the surgery.  
 
7.1.3.2  Evaluation  of Remote Intrahepatic Lesions:  The presence of new or 
growing tumors  remote from previously treated tumor sites will be  interpreted 
based on the standard  criteria for the diagnosis  of metastatic  disease or 
HCC  and recorded.  The presence or  absence of these  will be  tracked  
separately from the target  lesions.  
7.1.3.3  Evaluation  of Extrahepatic Lesions:  Imaging  will be evaluated for the 
appearance of new or growing extrahepatic tumor  deposits. These will  be 
tracked separately  from the target  lesions and remote intrahepatic  lesions.  
7.1.4  Local Control:   Local  control is defined  as the lack of progression of the tumors  
treated  by RT, either by tumor  size or  enhancement.  Progression  or development  of 
new tumors elsewhere in the liver or  outside of the liver would not constitute a local 
control failure.  
7.1.5  Progression -Free Survival:  Progression -free survival (PFS)  is defined as the 
duration of time from start of treatment  to time of progression.  
7.1.7    Overall  Survival : Overall  survival (OS)  is defined as  the duration of time from start of 
treatment to death.  
 
7.2 Safety/Tolerability  
Analyses will  be performed for all patients having received at least the first part of  
treatment  with radiation. The study will  use the CTCAE version  4.0 for reporting of non- 
hematologic adverse events  (http://c tep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.htm l). 
 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.1 Adverse Event Reporting  Requirements  
Data on adverse events will be collected  from the time of the first radiation treatment  
through 2 years  after completion of radiation. Serious  Adverse Events  (SAEs) will  
continue to be followed until:  
• Resolution or the symptoms  or signs that constitute  the serious adverse event  
return to baseline;  
• There  is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment  for the changes  
observed; or  
• Death.  
 
The definitions  of AEs and  SAEs are given below.  
 
Any medical  condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial study  
treatment  is considered to be pre -existing in  nature. Any known pre-existing  conditions  
that are ongoing  at time of study entry should be considered medical history rather than 
an AE.  
 
In addition to new events, any increase  in the frequency or severity (i.e., toxicity  grade) of  
a pre-existing  condition that occurs aft er the patient begins treatment  is also considered  
an adverse event if it meets the definitions below.  
 
8.2 Definitions  
 
8.2.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward  medical occurrence in a patient receiving  
study treatment and which  does not necessarily have  a causal relationship with  
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including an  
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease temporally associated with the  
use of an experimental intervention, whether  or not related to the intervention.  
• All grade 3 and above AEs will be  collected, in addition to any grade  ≥2 
gastritis, hepatic pain, vomiting, and  fatigue.  The NCI CTCAE v 4.0 will be  
20  utilized to grade AEs and for AE reporting.  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic  non-invasive  and invasive (i.e., surgical)  
procedures  will not be reported as  adverse events. However, the medical  
condition for which the procedure  was performed must be reported if it meets  
the definition  of an adverse  event unless it  is a pre-existing (prior  to protocol  
treatment) condition or a condition  entirely unrelated to the study  
radiotherapy (e.g. cardiac,  lung, or bladder procedure).  
• Abnormal laboratory values  or test results constitute adverse events only if  
they induce clinical  signs or symptoms or require therapy. They  are to be 
captured under the signs,  symptoms  or diagnoses associated  with them.  
• When an event recurs after it is resolved, it should be handled as  a new AE.  
However, AEs  that occur intermittently can be recorded as one AE. 
 
8.2.2  Serious  Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered  “serious” if,  in the view  of either the investigator,  it 
results in any of the following  outcomes:  
 
o Death  
If death results  from (progression of) the disease (cirrhosis  or cancer), it is not 
considered an SAE.  
o A life-threatening adverse event  
An adverse event is considered ‘life -threatening’ if, in the view of the  investigator, 
its occurrence  places  the patient or subject  at immediate risk of  death.  
o Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing hospitalization for > 24 
hours unless  it was related  to the disease under study, pre -existing  conditions, 
or an accident, rather  than the radiation treatments themselves.  
o A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
 
Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries,  
hospitalizations, or procedures  should  not be reported as  SAEs  unless  the underlying 
medical condition has substantially worsened duri ng the course of the study, unless  
the investigator deems it definitely unrelated to treatment.  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization without a precipitating clinical  AE 
should not be considered SAEs.  
 
Other adverse events that will be excluded from SAE reporting:  
-Death due to cancer or  cirrhosis  
-Hospitalization secondary to expected  cancer  or cirrhosis  morbidity  
-Admission for palliative care or pain management  
-Admission for management of biliary obs truction or  cholangitis  
-Admission for management of deep venous thrombosis or  pulmonary  
embolism  
-Planned hospitalizations for surgical procedures  
-Accidental injury  
Event  reporting for oncology protocols,  particularly those  involving  patients  with liver 
disease, can be complicated and confusing to investigators, data managers,  and 
regulatory oversight  bodies  because patients typically develop  numerous  
complications such ascites, encephalopathy, peritonitis,  GI bleed, blood clot, etc  as 
part of the typical  course  of cirrhosis  and not related  to the study therapy.  
Therefore,  a well-conceived  event reporting plan separates background noise as  
might be seen  with any patient with cirrhosis  and cancer  from study -related  events 
that are relevant to subject  safety. In order to achieve this  goal, the DSM  plan for this 
study  will focus on rapid and specific identification  and reporting of  the following  as 
SAEs:  
• Events  which are serious and likely (probably or definitely)  related  to the 
investigational component  of study  therapy (high  dose  radiotherapy)  
• Events  occurring  at unusual  frequency  or severity in study subjects compared  to 
21  non-study  subjects  undergoing similar treatment  
• Events  that are serious and unexpected  
 
Therefore,  we will not report as SAEs events that coincide with  a typical  cirrhosis  or 
cancer  course  (ie, expected) unless  they are related  to the investigational  therapy  
 
8.2.3  Expected  Advers e Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if it is a common side effect  related 
to abdominal radiotherapy.  Examples of this include nausea, vomiting,  dehydration,  
fatigue, musculoskeletal discomfort/pain, and dermatitis in the treatment  field. 
 
8.2.4  Unexpected  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not a common side  effect 
related  to abdominal radiotherapy.  
 
8.3 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
8.3.1  CTCAE Term  
(AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading  scales  found  in the NCI 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be  utilized 
for AE reporting. All appropriate  treatment areas should have access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version  4.0. A copy  of the CTCAE version  4.0 can be down  loaded from the 
CTEP web site. (http://ctep.cancer.gov)  
 
8.3.2  Attribution  of the AE 
The investigator or co -investigator is  responsible for assignm ent of attribution.  
Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the study treatment  
Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment  
Possible – The AE may be related  to the  study treatment   Unlikely – 
The AE  is doubtfully related  to the study treatment  Unrelated  – The 
AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment  
8.4 Serious  Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
8.4.1  The Principal  Investigator  must  be notified within 5 business day of study team’s  
knowledge of  any event meeting the criteria and definition of a serious adverse  
event, regardless of attribution, occurring  during the study.  
8.4.2  The investigator must report all events  meeting  the criteria  and definition of a serious 
adverse event that are unexpected and possibly related  (definite, probable  or 
possible)  to study treatment to the local IRB within  7 days of study team’s  knowledge.  
8.4.3  All Serious Adverse that are unexpected  and possibly  related  (definite, probable  or 
possible)  to study  treatment will be reported to the IRB using  CTO Serious  Adverse 
Event form.  
 
8.5 Routine Reporting  
All other adverse events - such as  those  that are expected, or are unlikely or definitely not  
related to the study participation - are to be reported annually as  part of regular  data 
submission.  
 
8.6 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems  
There  are types of incidents, experiences  and outcomes that occur  during the conduct of 
human  subjects research  that represent  unanticipated problems but are not considered  
adverse events. For example, some unanticipated problems involve  social or economic  harm 
instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other 
cases,  unanticipated  problems place subjects or  others at increas ed risk of harm,  but no 
harm occurs.  
 
22  Upon becoming  aware of any incident, experience, or  outcome (not related to an adverse  
event) that may represent an  unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess  whether 
the incident, experience, or outcome  represents an unanticipated problem. The incident, 
experience or  outcomes is  considered unanticipated if it meets  all of the following  criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected  (in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly  related  to participation in the research; and  
3. Suggests  that the research  places  subjects or others  at a greater risk of harm  
than was previously  known or recognized.  
 
If the investigator  determines that the incident,  experience, or outcome  represents an 
unanticipated  problem, the investigator  must  report  it to the IRB within  14 calendar days  
of the study  team  becoming aware of the problem.  
 
8.7 Stopping  Rules  
There  are separate  stopping rules for efficacy and  toxicity.  The goal is to stop the trial if 
there  is evidence that the true rate of toxicity  (defined  in section 8.2) exceeds 10% OR 
the true rate of local progression  within  6 months  exceeds 30%.  The efficacy  rule will be  
evaluated  6 months  after the 10th patient is enrolled.  Given  expected enrollment  of about  
1 patient per  month,  this evaluation will  occur  when  approximately 16 patients have  been  
enrolled.  The trial will be stopped if 5 or more  of the 10 patients  with 6 month  follow -up 
experienced  disease -related progression within 6 months of treatment. When  the true 
probability of progression  within  6 months is 10, 30 or 50%,  the probability  of stopping  is 
1, 15 and 62%, respectively.  
 
The toxicity  rule will be evaluated  after 15 patients are evaluable for toxicity  which will 
occur  3 months after enrollment of the 15th patient.  If 4 or more patients  experience  
unacceptable toxicity,  defined  as radiation  induced liver  disease, the  trial will be 
halted.  When  the true probability  of toxicity  is 5, 10 or 30%,  the probability  of stopping  is 
<1, 6 and 70%, respectively.  
 
 
9.0 DRUG  INFORMATION  
 
9.1 Indocyanine green:  Indocyanine  Green has FDA approval for  determining hepatic function  
and liver blood  flow. Please  refer to the Package  Insert for complete  details.  
 
9.2 Description: IC -GREEN™  is a sterile,  lyophilized green  powder  containing 25 mg of 
indocyanine  green with no  more  than 5% sodium  iodide.  It is packaged  with Aqueous Solvent  
consisting  of Sterile  Water for Injection  used to dissolve  the indocyanine green.  ICОGRE EN™ is 
to be administered intravenously.  Indocyanine green  is a water soluble,  tricarbocyanine dye with 
a peak spectral  absorption at 800 nm. The  chemical name  for Indocyanine Green is 1 H- 
Benz[e]indolium,2 -[7-[1,3-dihydro -1,1-dimethyl -3-(4-sulfobutyl) -2H-benz[e]indol -2-ylidene] -1,3,5 - 
heptatrienyl] -1,1-dimethyl -3-(4-sulfobutyl) -hydroxide, inner  salt, sodium salt. IC-GREEN™  has a 
pH of approximately 6.5 when  reconstituted.  Each  vial of IC-GREEN™ contains  25 mg of 
indocyanine  green as a sterile  lyophilized powder.  
 
 
 
 

23  9.3 Side effects: Anaphylactic  or urticarial  reactions  have  been  reported  in patients  with or without  
history  of allergy  to iodides. If such  reactions  occur,  treatment  with the appropriate agents, e.g., 
 
epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids  should be administered.  See package insert  for 
comprehensive  list of adverse events.  
 
9.4 Drug  Interactions:  No interactions  with patient  medications.  Heparin  preparations  containing  
sodium bisulf ite reduce  the absorpti on peak of ICОGREEN™ in blood  and, therefore,  should  not be 
used as an anticoagulant for the collection of samples for analysis.  
 
 
9.5 Preparation  and Dispensing:  Under  sterile  conditions,  the IC-GREEN™  powder  should  be 
dissolved  with the Aqueous  Solvent  provided  for this product,  and the solution  used  within  6 hours  
after it is prepared.  If a precipitate  is present,  discard  the solution.  The amount  of solvent  to be 
used  can be calculated  from the dosage  form which  follows.  It is recommended  that the syringe  
used  for injection  of the dye be rinsed  with this diluent.  Isotonic  saline  should  be used  to flush  the 
residual  dye from the cardiac  catheter  into the circulation  so as to avoid  hemolysis.  With the 
exception  of the rinsing  of the dye injection  syringe,  saline  is used  in all other  parts  of the 
catheterization procedure.  
 
9.6 Administration  for patients indicated to receive IC -Green from the treating physician : 
9.6.1  IC-GREEN testing  will be administered according to the study  calendar.  
9.6.2  The patient will be studied in  a fasting state.  Patients  should not eat 4 hours prior to  
the test. Coffee  and/or  water  are allowed  up to approximately  two hours  before  the 
test. Patients  should  take all of their medications  as usual.  The patient  will be 
weighed  and the dosage  calculated  on the basis  of a recommended  0.5 mg/kg  of 
body  weight.  The dose  given  must  be within  20% of the total recommended  dose.  
There  will be approximately  a 6 cc blood  draw  followed  by rapid  IV push  of the IC- 
GREEN  at time 0. Following  I.V. administration  via catheter,  serum  samples  will be 
collected  at approximately  5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes  after injecting  the dye. Each  
blood  draw  will be approximately  6 cc. The patient  will have  two different  catheters  
one will be used  for the IC-GREEN  infusion,  and the other  catheter  will be used  to 
draw  the samples.  The catheter  will be flushed  with saline  following  each  blood  draw.  
9.6.3  The IC-GREEN  test will be administered  by trained  personnel  in the Michigan  Clinical  
Research  Unit “MCRU”.  The dye is commercially  available  and will be ordered  from 
UMHS  pharmacy  (formulary).  Radiographic  contrast  agents  are administered  
routinely  in the department  and it is fully equipped  to treat an anaphylactic  reaction,  
should one occur.  
 
10.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
The goal of the planned correlative studies is to collect data on plasma biomarkers of treatment  
efficacy,  toxicity,  and liver function t o plan  further  enhancements  to individualized RT.  
 
10.1 Sample Collection  Guidelines  
 
10.1.1  Blood and urine sample collection  and processing  
10.1.1.1  : Collection of approximately 30 -50 mls of blood will be  
performed by  venipuncture  at the specified time points.  When  possible, blood  
collection  will be coordinated with other  routine  blood  studies. These blood  
samples  will be drawn  at the clinical blood drawing station in the Radiation  
Oncology  department at UH or at the Michigan Clinical Research Unit (MCRU).  
10.1.1.2  Blood Spe cimen  Processing: Whole blood will be obtained by  
venipuncture at each time point and  will be processed  at Michigan  Clinical  
Research  Unit (MCRU)  specimen  core and processing  laboratory.  Blood  Samples  
will be labeled with the subject’s coded  study  number and collection date.  
24   
The processing will happen as described in the current SOP  of the  Biorepository.  
10.1.1.3  Subjects  will provide approximately 20 -40 ml of urine at the specified  
time points , if able . 
10.1.1.4  Urine Processing : The urine  samples  will be processed at the MCRU  
specimen core and processing laboratory.  A maximum  of 20 2 -ml aliquot tubes  
will be filled at each collection.  
 
10.1.2  Biopsy  collection and processing:  
10.1.2.1  For patients  who will undergo standard  of care percutaneous fiducial  
placement at the University  of Michigan for radiation targeting, they will optionally  
also consent to undergo  percutaneous tumor  biopsy during the same procedure.  
2-3 18G cores will be obtained following  routine  clinical practice.  
10.1.2.2  Biopsy Specimen  Processing:  Depending  on sample abundance,  the 
cores  will be  processed for RNA, DNA, and protein extraction, as  well as  standard  
histology.  For RNA, the cores  will be placed into an eppendorf  tube and the 
sample covered with RNAlater comple tely.  It will be stored in a 4 degree  
refrigerator  for 24 hours, then transferred to a -80 degree freezer for later 
extraction.  For frozen  section, part of the sample will  be placed into a plastic mold,  
and the sample covered  with OCT  compound  completely, and then stored in -80 
degree freezer immediately.  A separate  piece of tissue  will be  snap frozen at -80 
degree freezer separately for later DNA  and protein extraction.  Standard  methods  
for formalin -fixed paraffin  embedding will be followed.  
 
10.2 Specimen Banking  
Blood  and urine specimens not immediately utilized for plasma biomarkers will be stored  
for future  biomarker analysis, as  we anticipate advancement in experimental technology  
and preliminary results. Other  techniques  and tests also will be  applied if they are found  
to be superior.  
 
10.3 Virtual radiotherapy  planning  
CTs and MRIs obtained as part of this study will be coded and the information used for 
further advancements to treatment  planning,  including deformable  registration and dose  
accumulation.  
 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Study  Design  
This is a pilot study of individualized adaptive RT, which consists  of 3/5 of a planned total 
course of treatment, a one month break, assessment of global and spatial  liver function  
change using  IC-Green or ALBI,  and perfusion MRI, and the remainder of treatment  
adjusted for global and spatial changes  in liver function.   The primary endpoints are to 
establish the feasibility  of this approach and to obtain  preliminary estimates of safety and 
efficacy  both overall and as they relate to treatment and patient characteristics . At the 
completion of this trial we will have the necessary data to define a SBRT treatment 
approach that is individualized and adaptive and ready to be compared to standard SBRT 
in a randomized trial.   
 
Patients will have an initial plan with total dose  chosen  such that the estimated  probability  of 
toxicity (increase in CP of 2 points or more within 6 months of RT ) from the first three  of five 
planned treatments is at most 10%. In order to protect  the safety of individual patients, after 
delivering 60% of the planned  total treatment, there  will be a 1 month break at the end of 
which, ALBI or ICG will be measured  again and a new treatment  plan will be developed.  
This last course of  treatment  may be adapted  (relative  to the first course) globally  in one of 2 
ways.  First,  if there  is no remaining enhancement  on the MRI scan,  no further radiation will  
be given because the tumor  is likely to be cured.  The second possible adaptation is intended 
25  to prevent clinically significant decline  in liver  function  in patients whose livers  appear to be 
sensitive  to RT. Child -Pugh (CP) score is a standard measure of liver function, and  an 
increase of 2 points  or more  on this scale  is considered  clinically significant.  Early changes 
in  ICG retention  and ALBI  reveal  subclinical changes in liver function  that predict later liver 
toxicity, assessed  by a change  of 2 in CP  score  6 months after treatment .  
Maximizing tumor control and minimizing liver toxicity are competing objectives when 
selecting RT dose for these patients.  To make this tradeoff ex plicit and quantitative, t he dose 
during the second course of treatment will be selected as the minimum of  
1) The dose that maximizes Prob(Local C ontrol at 1 year) – 4*P(Toxicity)  
2) The dose associated with a 25% estimated risk of toxicity.   
That is, additional dose is deemed to be beneficial if the increase in local control is at least 4 
times greater than the increase in toxicity. The key a dvantage  of this approach over an 
isotoxic approach is that patients ar e exposed to risk of toxicity in direct proportion to their 
benefit in terms of increased local control.  Thus patients are not unnecessarily exposed to 
higher rates of toxicity (e.g. 20%) unless the improvement in expected local control is large 
enough.  Similarly, patients are not constrained to an arbitrary rate of toxicity (e.g. 15 or 20%) 
if allowing the rate of toxicity to exceed this threshold results  in a large enough increase in 
local control.  At the same time we still place a hard upper limit of 25% on the risk of toxicity 
to any patient. The overall rate of toxicity in this population of patients is expected to be lower 
than 25%.   
In the above, toxicity is defined as increase in CP of 2 points  or more within 6 months of RT 
and local control is d efined as absence of tumor progression within 1 year of treatment . For 
purposes of this dose selection, l ocal control  will be estimated from a simple Cox model as a 
function of tumor dose  while t he toxicity model will include  the change in ICGR15 at the mi d-
treatment timepoint.  
The decision to continue treating patients with further radiation is based on analysis of the 
information from the ICG results or ALBI, and not RECIST measurements. These 
measurements are recommended and are not requ ired to determine patients’ coming off -study 
treatment or study protocol. In addition, baseline measurements are not needed at the time of 
enrollment.  
 
 
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
This is a pilot trial to gather  the data necessary to plan a randomized  phase II study with a 
control group receiving standard  therapy.  The planned accrual is  80 evaluable  patients over  
two years. An evaluable patient  is a patient that has received their complete  prescribed 
treatment (including those whose IC G measurements or ALBI precluded  the second phase of 
treatment and those  for whom other  toxicity  prevented them  from receiving a full course of 
treatment).  The high level goal of this trial is to define an individualized and adaptive approach 
to use of RT in this patient population.  Key components of individualizing and adapting 
treatment are models that relate expected toxicity and tumor control outcomes to  RT dose and 
other patient level characteristics.  Part of the reason for the sample size of 80 is to refine 
these models prior to initiating a randomized trial.  For toxicity, our preliminary data suggests 
that mean liver dose (or some other measure of do se to normal liver), baseline liver function 
(e.g. CP score) and mid -treatment change in ICGR15 are the most important factors.  If our 
overall event rate for toxicity is about 20%, we expect to have approximately 16 toxicity events 
which, in combination w ith some data from similarly treated previous patients, should be 
sufficient to estimate parameters in a toxicity model with 3 predictors.  For tumor control, 
tumor dose is expected to be the most significant predictor.  There will likely be a lower rate o f 
local progression events so that this model may need to have fewer predictors.  In addition to 
further defining statistical models this trial will permit us to estimate rates of toxicity and tumor 
control that will be key when designing a randomized tria l with power to reject a specific null 
hypothesis.   
 
This treatment  will be considered  sufficiently  promising  to initiate  a phase II trial if itcauses  
toxicity  (increase in CP score of 2 points or more within 6 months of treatment ) in no more 
26  than 25% of patients  and results in a local control rate (at 1 year ) of at least 80%.    
 
We expect to be able to accrue 20 patients per year and thus to complete accrual in 
approximately 4 years.  
 
11.3 Data Analysis  Plans  
Primary  Aims: The first primary aim is feasibility  which is defined as the ability to  
successfully deliver the full treatment  including all adaptations  and in particular the  perfusion 
based planning and replanning.  In the  simplest analyses, feasibility  will simply  be 
summarized as the proportion of patients for whom the intended treatment  was feasible.  The 
reasons for lack of feasibility for any patients will be investigated  individually.  
 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint  is local control, measured as  the time to progres sion of the 
treated  lesion.  Patients with no evidence of local progression at the time of data analysis  will 
be censored at the last date on which they were evaluated for local progression.  Local 
progression  will be summarized with Kaplan -Meier curves.  The estimated rate of  local control 
at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months will be estimated and reported with 95% confidence  intervals.  Cox 
regression models will be used to assess the relation between the hazard of local progression 
and tumor dose and other covariates.   
 
The primary toxicity  endpoint is defined as a change in Child Pugh score of greater than or 
equal to 2 within 6 months of SBRT. Secondary toxicity endpoints include changes in ALBI 
scores and grade 3 toxicities described in section 8.   RILD is a rare but serious side effect 
that will also be summarized if it occurs .  Logistic r egression models will be used to estimate 
the association between  baseline (primarily baseline liver function such  as CP score and 
mean liver dose and other dose metric s such as D700) and mid-treatment variables  (e.g. 
change in ICGR15) and the probability of toxicity.  We will include interactions between dose 
and baseline liver function as there is some evidence that patients with worse liver function 
are more sensitive to radiation than patients with better baseline liver function.  
 
Secondary  Aims:  The relation betwe en various  biomarkers and treatment  efficacy will be  
assessed  by including the biomarkers as  covariates in Cox regression models for local 
progression.  The relation between biomarkers  and toxicity will be assessed in logistic  
regression models for the binary or ordinal toxicity  outcomes and linear  regression  models for 
continuous measures of toxicity or liver function  such as  ICGR15  or ALBI . 
 
Quality  of life  will be summarized descriptively at baseline (pre -RT) and at each  post RT  
timepoint.  Change from baseline will be calculated for each patient and summarized  
descriptively as well as tested for statistical significance using a paired t -test. 
 
12.0 DATA AND  SAFETY  MONITORING  
This trial will be monitored  in accordance  with the NCI approved  Universit y of Michigan  
Comprehensive  Cancer  Center Data and  Safety  Monitoring Plan.  The study specific Data and  
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), consisting of  the protocol investigators, data manager  or 
designee  and other members of the study team  involved with the conduct of the trial, will meet  
quarterly or  more frequently  depending  on the activity  of the protocol.  The discussion  will include  
matters  related to the safety of study participants (SAE/UaP reporting), validity and integrity of the  
data, enrollment  rate relative to expectations,  characteristics of participants, retention of 
participants, adherence to the protocol (potential  or real protocol deviations) and  data 
completeness.  
 
At the regular DSMC meetings, the protocol specific Data and Safety Monitoring  Report form will 
be completed. The report will be signed  by the Principal Investigator or by one of the co- 
investigators.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Reports will  be submitted  to the University  of Michigan  
Comprehensive Cancer  Center  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  on a quarterly basis  
27  for independent review.  
 
13.0 QUALITY  ASSURANCE AND  AUDITS  
The Data Safety Monitoring Board  can request a ‘for cause’ audit of the trial if the board identifies  
a need  for a more  rigorous  evaluation of study‐related issues. A “for cause”  audit would be  
conducted by  the Quality  Assurance Review Committee (QARC) of the University of Michigan  
Comprehensive Cancer  Center.  
 
A regulatory authority  (e.g. FDA)  may also wish  to conduct  an inspection of the study, during its  
conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory  
authority,  the site investigator must immediately  inform  the Clinical Trials  Office that such a 
request has been made.

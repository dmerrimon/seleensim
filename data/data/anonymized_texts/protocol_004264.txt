PRÉCIS 
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option to treat aortic valve stenosis or failure of a sur-
gically implanted tissue valve.  Sometimes  TAVR displaces the diseased aortic valve leaflets outwards, caus-
ing life -threatening obstruction of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. This is more com-
mon in surgically implanted tissue valves that are designed to achieve the largest aortic valve orifice area.  
Despite attempts to protect the coronary arteries from obstruction in these  patients using coronary stents, 
the mortality of TAVR -associated coronary artery obstruction remains prohibitively high.  
The investigators have developed and tested a technique to tear the existing aortic valve leaflet and enable 
TAVR in such patients . The procedure is called B ioprosthetic or native A ortic Scallop Intentional Laceration 
to prevent I atrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA).  
The purpose of this study is to perform BASILICA in patients who have no good options to prevent coronary  
artery obstruction during TAVR.

1.0 Protocol Summary  
Title:  Bioprosthetic  or native  Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatro-
genic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA) prospective investigation  
Précis:  Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option to treat aortic 
valve stenosis or failure of a surgically implanted tissue valv e.  Sometimes 
TAVR displaces the diseased aortic valve leaflets outwards, causing life -
threatening obstruction of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the 
heart. This is more common in surgically implanted tissue valves that are de-
signed to achieve t he largest aortic valve orifice area.  Despite attempts to 
protect the coronary arteries from obstruction in these patients using coro-
nary stents, the mortality of TAVR -associated coronary artery obstruction re-
mains prohibitively high.  
The investigators ha ve developed and tested a technique to split the existing 
aortic valve leaflet and enable TAVR in such patients. The procedure is called 
Bioprosthetic or native Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent I atro-
genic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA).  
The purpose of this study is to perform BASILICA in patients who have no 
good options to prevent coronary artery obstruction during TAVR.

tients during TAVR

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 7 of 39 2018- 03-09 2.0 OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this protocol is further to characterize  the feasibility and safety of B ioprosthetic  or native  
Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent I atrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA), in pa-
tients at high risk of coronary artery obstruction complicating TAVR.  
In this protocol, we use transcatheter heart valves  (THV)  according to their marketed indication , on-label.  
3.0 BACKGROUND  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an effective alternative to surgical aortic valve replace-
ment in intermediate and high -risk patients.  TAVR is also an effective treatment for failure of bioprosthetic 
surgical aortic valves, a treatment known as valve -in-valve TAVR. Valve- in-valve TAVR is associated with low 
mortality, satisfactory hemodynamics, and good intermediate -term f unc-
tional outcomes in selected high risk patients [ 1, 2].  Valve- in-valve TAVR 
commonly exacerbates valve under -sizing (a phenomenon known as pa-
tient -prosthetic mismatch), which increases one -year mortality [1, 2].   
Coronary artery obstruction is a devastating complication of valve -in-valve 
TAVR with a greater than 50% mortality [ 3].  Coronary artery obstruction 
occurs when the transcatheter heart valve displaces the underlying surgic al 
or native aortic valve leaflets outwards and obstructs the coronary artery 
ostia, usually by sealing the sinus of Valsalva at the sinotubular junction 
(Figure 1 ). Coronary artery obstruction occurs most commonly during TAVR 
for surgical bioprothesis designs intended to maximize effective aortic ori-
fice area (“stented” bioprostheses that have externally mounted leaflets, 
and “stentless” surgical biopro stheses). Coronary artery obstruction can be 
predicted by pre -procedure morphology and CT.   
4.0 CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION  
We propose a solution based on our non- clinical [5] and initial clinical [ 6] 
LAMPOON procedure (intentional catheter -based traversal and laceration 
a mitral valve leaflet structure in order to prevent the complications of 
leaflet displacement after related transcatheter mitral valve implantation).  
In LAM POON, we use catheter techniques to split the mitral valve leaflet to 
prevent obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract.    
Figure 1. Coronary artery obstruction a
 
 
 

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 8 of 39 2018- 03-09 Using a simple modification of the LAMPOON technique, we have developed a technique to split an aortic 
valve leaflet, whether bioprosthetic or native, to prevent coronary artery obstruction af ter TAVR.  The new 
technique is called Bioprosthetic Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery 
obstruction (BASILICA).  Figure 2 shows a representative BASILICA TAVR procedure.  
To date, seven patients have undergone  compassionate BASILICA to enable TAVR.  All survived to discharge 
without major adverse events.   
4.1 Predictors of coronary artery obstruction after TAVR  
Table 1 lists anatomic and artificial valve factors thought to contribute to the risk of coronary artery ob-
struction during TAVR.  Many of these are continuous parameters and are thought to interact with each 
other, such as narrow and short sinuses of Valsalva. One of the most powerful predictors is thought to be a 
small “virtual tube to coronary artery distance (VTC)”, especially when less than 3 -4mm [3, 7].  However, 
the risk determination must integrate all of these factors, and must incorporate judgement.

5.0 TREATMENT OPTIONS
Candidates for TAVR  with BASILICA have no good alternative treatment options.  They are not eligible for 
definitive treatment using surgical aortic valve repair or replacement.  Despite pre -positioning of bailout 
coronary stent delivery systems before TAVR, the outcome of TAVR -induced coronary artery obstruction is 
catastrophic with a mortality > 50% [ 3].

6.2 Overview of Study Design  
This is a prospective, open -label, single -arm, multi- center, investigator -initiated, independently -adjudicated 
trial of BASILICA immediately before TAVR in subjects at high risk of coronary artery obstruction.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 10 of 39 2018- 03-09 Candidates will be identified by the participating structural heart disease programs.  In evaluation of aortic 
valve disease, candi dates will undergo clinical evaluation , echocardiography,  and contrast -enhanced gated 
cardiac CT.  Eligibility will be reviewed and proposed by the local multidisciplinary heart teams.  Candidates 
will then undergo central eligibility review by the sponsor  and designated investigators.  If deemed eligible, 
candidates will be offered participation in the study.  
Once enrolled, subjects will undergo baseline assessment and blood tests.  
Subjects will be admitted to the hospital and undergo TAVR with BASILICA .  They will undergo endpoint as-
sessment before discharge, after 30 days, and then 12 months.  
6.3 Study Population  
Subjects are undergoing planned TAVR because of high or prohibitive risk of surgical aortic valve replace-
ment for bioprosthetic aortic valve failur e or native aortic valve stenosis.  The subjects are deemed to have 
excessive risk of TAVR -induced coronary artery obstruction based on features enumerated in Table 1  in 
section 4.1. 
6.4 BASILICA TAVR  Procedure  
The BASILICA TAVR  procedure is planned from a contrast -enhanced CT of the heart to select a suitable 
transcatheter heart valve size, predict suitability of the sub-  and supra -annular landing zone, and predict 
post -TAVR coronary obstruction related leaflet encroachment  on the sinotubular junction and coronary ar-
tery ostia .  Knowl edge of the aortic valve operative history is integrated into this assessment.  These data 
are used to select a BASILICA traversal point, radiographic landmarks, and fluoroscopic projection angles.  
The procedure is performed under general anesthesia  or und er moderate sedation at the discretion of the 
institutional heart team .   The BASILICA  procedure has three steps: (1) leaflet traversal with a guidewire, 
followed by (2) leaflet laceration, immediately followed by (3) TAVR .  These are all guided by fluoros copy 
and adjunctive echocardiography as needed.  
Research study participation is defined as beginning the moment BASILICA traversal is attempted.  
First catheter access is obtained typically via four arterial  introducer sheaths  (two for BASILICA, one for he-
modynamics and angiography , and one for TAVR ) and at least one  venous introducer  sheaths for tempo-
rary transvenous pacing.  Anticoagulation  with heparin or equivalent achieve s an activated clotting time > 
300s .   
Hemodynamic and echocardiography measurements are recorded at baseline including gradients across 
the aortic valve, severity of valvular obstruction and  severity of valvular regurgitation.  
Two retrograde catheters are positioned, using a guidewire anchor as needed, in the LVOT and Aorta re-
spectively.  Care is taken to avoid entrapment of mitral valvular structures. A  snare catheter is positioned in 
the LVOT .  A coaxial traversal guiding catheter system (typically tandem catheters) directs electrosurgery 
devices (typically a rigid 0.014” guidewire inside a polymer jacket wire convertor) against the base  of the 
coronary cusp targeted for laceration, using fluoroscopic and /or echocardiographic guidance.   
Traversal is accomplished by transcatheter electrosurgery by connecting the back end of the 0.014 ” guide-
wire to an electrosurgery pencil during short bursts of “pure, cutting” radiofrequency energy at approxi-
mately 30W.  The guidewire is repositioned as needed until it crosses the aortic  leaflet and is snare -re-
trieved  and externalized . Nonionic conduc tive flush (dextrose 5%) can be administered as needed via the 
guiding catheters to reduce guidewire char and thromboembolism.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 11 of 39 2018- 03-09 Next the polymer jacket wire convertor is withdrawn, and the traversal wire is modified by the operator by 
(1) denuding a non- circumferential segment ~2mm in length, 90o arc and (2) kinking the denuded segment 
to enforce its position at the inner curvature of the intended guidewire lacerating surface.  Next the poly-
mer jacket radiopaque marker tip is locked adjacent to the kinked de nuded shaft segment.  Next the en-
snared guidewire is externalized to position the lacerating surface across the base of the leaflet.  
BASILICA may be performed on one or two valve leaflets that may threaten coronary artery obstruction.  
Next, at operator discretion, the transcatheter heart valve may be positioned before or after the laceration 
step.  If before, the operator assures no entrapment of the TAVR system with the laceration system of cath-
eters.  
At operator discretion, stroke pre vention strategies may be employed, including external carotid artery 
compression and intravascular embolic protection devices.  
Laceration is performed by positioning the laceration surface along the intended leaflet base, and applying 
tension on both free  ends of the guidewire while simultaneously apply electrosurgery energy (typically 
70W) in short bursts, until the laceration is complete and the guidewire is free.  
Hemodynamics are recorded quickly after laceration before TAVR .  Coronary artery stent syst ems are posi-
tioned prophylactically at the discretion of the operator.  Predilatation, including intentional disruption of 
the bioprosthetic valve frame, is performed at operator discretion , before or after TAVR . Then TAVR  is per-
formed using established te chniques  typically during rapid ventricular pacing.  The device size and inflation 
volumes are selected and applied at the discretion of the operator.  Post -dilatation is performed at opera-
tor discretion to achieve an optimum TAVR result.  Coronary artery patency is established using angi-
ography and, if employed, using prepositioned pressure -tip guidewires.  Coronary artery pressure ( instanta-
neous wave- free ratio, iFR ) may further be examined if possible at the discretion of the operator.  
Completion hemodyn amics and echocardiography are recorded.   Finally, percutaneous femoral artery and 
vein vascular hemostasis is obtained and the subject  convalesces in the appropriate inpatient recovery unit.  
Before discharge, follow -up transthoracic echocardiography is recorded.   A single contrast -enhanced CT of 
the heart is obtained before discharge if renal function allows, otherwise it is deferred as long as 30 -days. 
Blood tests are recorded for research only as obtained for medical care.  
Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy is prescribed after discharge at the physicians’ discretion, and is 
recorded.  
All subjects are to be enrolled in the TVT -Registry postmarketing TAVR registry.

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 15 of 39 2018- 03-09 6.7 Milestones  
 
This section is submitted to comply with recent NIH IRP initiatives . Should a milestone not be met, all milestones will 
be shifted in time until the protocol is complete within the predicted protocol completion timeline.   
- Milestone one: Regulatory phase  
Regulatory approval including scientific and ethics review, at NIH and at participating sites, and FDA review, is ex-
pected to be complete by October 1 2017.  
- Milestone two: Contracting phase  
NIH contracts for services including clinical events adjudication are expecte d to be complete by October 1 2017.  
- Milestone three: Site initiation  
Site selection, training, and initiation is expected to be complete before November 1 2017.  
- Milestone four: Enrollment  
First patient should be enrolled 30 days from the initiation of the first site.  Should this not occur, then the 30 day 
period will be extended.  Enrollment should be completed within 12 months.  We expect the tempo of enrollment to 
increase over time as additional sites and experience accrue.  
Continuing reviews to IRB, DSM B, and FDA will be performed during this period.  
- Milestone five: Follow -up and reporting  
After the last patient is enrolled, follow -up is performed for 12 months.  The study phase is changed from recruit-
ment to follow -up and to analysis, as appropriate. We  expect the primary manuscript to be prepared based on data 
from 30 day follow -up.  We expect the final analysis to be complete within 12 months after follow -up is complete.

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 16 of 39 2018- 03-09 7.0 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT  
7.1 Inclusion Criteria   
• Adults age ≥ 21 years  
• High or extreme risk of surgical aortic valve replacement according to the local multidisciplinary 
heart team  
• Undergoing TAVR for valve- in-valve or native aortic valve failure (“on -label” TAVR)  
• Deemed likely to suffer coronary artery obstruction from TAVR according to mul tidisciplinary heart 
team  
• Concurrence of the study eligibility committee  
7.2 Exclusion criteria  
• Subjects u nable to consent to participate , unless the subject has a legally authorized representative  
• Excessive target aortic leaflet calcification or masses on ba seline CT  
• Survival despite successful procedure expected < 12 months  
• Planned concurrent valve intervention in the same setting (such as transcatheter mitral valve ther-
apy or paravalvular leak therapy)  
• Subjects unwilling to participate or unwilling to return for study follow- up activities.  
• Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant prior to completion of all protocol follow- up procedures  
7.3 Rationale  for selection criteria  
The selection criteria allow enrollment of the intended population with little anticipated selection bias. In-
stead of functional or geometric selection criteria, the study will enroll all subjects deemed otherwise suita-
ble for TAVR  yet at risk of the probl em to be addressed by BASILICA , the investigational procedure.  
There are no validated prediction models for coronary artery obstruction. Features predictive of coronary 
obstruction will be specifically outlined to the heart team and to the study eligibili ty committee and cap-
tured in the data collection form.  
Subjects are eligible if BASILICA laceration is contemplated for one or for two threatened coronary arteries.  
The inclusive selection criteria and geographic extent of enrolling sites are expected to a llow recruitment of 
a diverse economic, ethnic, and racial mix of patients that reflects the incident disease.  
Composition of the study eligibility committee is described in section 14.10 . 
8.0 Strategies for Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited from the Structural Heart Disease clinical programs of the participating hospitals.   
The distribution of planned enrolling sites assures accessibility of the trial to ethnically, racially, and eco-
nomically diverse populations.  The study will track sex, age, ethnicity, and racial background of subjects.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 17 of 39 2018- 03-09 Once recruited, subject retention rate is expected to be high because follow -up activities are not onerous 
and are timed to correspond with routine follow- up medical care, without prohibitively expensive follow- up 
testing.  
During the early clinical development of the BASILICA  procedure, 3 clinical patients were treated in one 
week at two centers, which suggests the recruitment objectives will be met.  
 
9.0 SAMPLE COLLECTION , STORAGE AND TRACKING  PLAN  
Imaging data (from angiography , CT, and echocardiography ) constitute the only specimens to be collected.   
CT examinations performed for clinical evaluation prior to signing informed consent may be used as the 
baseline scan.  
CT and fluoroscopy data will be analyzed at the  NHLBI DIR Core Laboratory . These data will be transmitted 
on electronic media such as a DVD  via carrier or using secure file transfer mechanisms abiding FISMA, 
HIPAA and local institutional standards (such as SFTP or https://secureemail.nih.gov ).  
Imaging data  are transmitted to a central facility ( NHLBI) using secure HIPAA compliant methods and are 
stored in a secure Picture Archive Computer Sy stem (PACS), according to local institutional standards . 
Necropsy specimens will be handled according to local institutional medical standards and will be disposed 
accordingly.  
10.0 BIOSTATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Sample Size  
The sample size is not statistically derived .  This is a safety and feasibility study that enables patient access 
to a novel medical procedure , when these patients have no other  good medical options to treat sympto-
matic aortic  valve failure .  
Up to 60 subjects will be consented until  30 subjects undergo attempted BASILICA TAVR  in this protocol .   
10.2 Study Analysis  
Clinical events are classified by the local site Principal Investigator and confirmed by the NIH Principal Inves-
tigator.   The results of the study will be released within 12 months of study completion.  
Primary and secondary a nalyses will be stratified acc ording to the setting for TAVR , whether native or bio-
prosthetic, and whether the bioprosthetic valve will intentionally be over -expanded to achieve a greater 
than nominal orifice area.  
The study will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, including a ca se-by-case narrative summary of major 
adverse events.  Kaplan -Meier estimates will be used to estimate the overall survival and the event -free 
survival Afterwards, we will survey for parameters associated with an increased risk of major adverse 
events  by e xploratory subgroup analysis and regression models . 
10.2.1  Primary  efficacy  endpoint  
The primary endpoint is Clinical  success (measured at exit from the catheterization laboratory).  All of the 
following must be present:  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 18 of 39 2018- 03-09 - Successful BASILICA  traversal and laceration  of the intended aortic leaflet; and  
- Absence of procedural mortality; and  
- Successful access, delivery, and retrieval of the BASILICA  device system; and  
- Successful TAVR  device implantation ; and  
- Absence of acute life -threatening ostial coronary artery obstruction (by  immediate hemodynamics,  
by angiography , and by iFR <0.89 if obtained ) 
- Freedom from emergency cardiac surgery or reintervention related to  the BASILICA TAVR proce-
dure, including attempted implantation of coronary artery stents to treat TAVR -induced coronary 
artery obstruction .   
Additional details about primary endpoint  
Valve post -dilatation is not considered  unplanned  re-intervention.  When pre- positioned coronary artery 
stents are not able to be retrieved, they may be i mplanted without impacting the primary endpoint.   
10.2.2  Primary safety endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint is freedom from major adverse clinical events (MACE) according to VARC -2 at 
30days.  
10.2.3  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include   
- Technical success, de fined as clinical success irrespective of coronary artery stenting  
- Clinical success without stroke , as determined by site  physicians  
- Technical success of BASILICA only (delivery and removal of BASILICA catheter equipment, tra-
versal, and laceration of intended aortic leaflet)  
- Coronary artery  obstruction measured as instantaneous wave -free pressure ratio (iFR) or related 
measurements using a solid -state  pressure -transducer guidewire , if measured  
- Survival to discharge, to 30d, and to 12mo  
- Neurological eve nts as reported by the site clinicians  
- Access and vascular complications  
- Peri-procedural and spontaneous acute myocardial infarction  
- Pericardial effusion or tamponade  
- VARC -2 bleeding complications  
- AKIN acute kidney injury  
- Freedom from hemolytic anemia related to BASILICA TAVR  
- BASILICA Device or Procedure related technical failure: acute embolism, mitral valve injury, tra-
versal into left atrium, coronary artery injury induced by BASILICA, etc.  
- Rotational orientation of transcatheter heart valve commissures with regard to coronary artery os-
tia 
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 19 of 39 2018- 03-09 - Hemodynamic instability caused by BASILICA before TAVR  
- TAVR thrombosis  on CT or echocardiography during follow- up 
- Endocarditis during follow- up 
- Outcomes for laceration of native ver sus surgical aortic valves, for single versus double scallop lac-
eration, and for procedures with versus without bioprosthesis intentional overexpansion  
 
10.2.4  Rationale for primary endpoint  
The main clinical objective of BASILICA  is to allow TAVR without causing  death from acute coronary artery 
obstruction  in patients identified at baseline because of existing valve design and geometry.   The primary 
endpoint is selected to provide a binary summary assessment of procedure success to help assess the clini-
cal utility of the investigational procedure.  
10.2.5  Independent Clinical Events Adjudication  
An independent Clinical Events Adjudication Committee will review all  of the following that occur in the 
first year:  
- Deaths  
- Primary endpoints  
- Site-reported strokes  
The CEAC will classify relatedness of the above events to the BASILICA procedure.  The PI and the CEAC will agree on a 
charter, but only after the CEAC contract is awarded.  CEAC adjudication prevails over PI classifications.  
10.3 Stopping Rules  and Data Safety Monitoring  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research will 
monitor the safety of subjects in the study as described in the investigational plan. All members of the 
DSMB are unaffiliated to the study. Th e NHLBI DSMB will review the protocol  progress report  at six month 
intervals , or more frequently upon request of PI, IRB, and/or NHLBI Clinical Director . The DSMB may recom-
mend early termination of the study for considerations of safety and efficacy. Unanticipated Adverse De-
vice Effects (UADEs) will be submitted to the DSMB following the same timelines as the IRB (See section 
9.2.4 ). 
In the case of death or serious UADE, if the sponsor and the principal investigator determine that the event 
presents an unre asonable risk to the participating subjects, the clinical trial will be terminated within 5 
working days after making that determination and not later than 15 working days after the sponsor first 
receives notice of the effect. [21 CFR 812.46]. All clinical  sites will be notified of this action.  
Each institutional IRB will review all Serious Adverse Events, Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects, and Un-
anticipated Problems, and may choose to suspend or terminate the protocol based on those findings. We 
believe this will protect subject safety.   
We propose different stopping rules  based on whether the operator elects intentionally to over -expand the 
bioprosthesis . 
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 20 of 39 2018- 03-09 10.3.1  Anticipated mortality  
There are few data available to guide mortality assumptions. In an international registry of valve -in-valve 
TAVR, th e short -term (30 -day) mortality of coronary obstruction complicating TAVR was 50%, despite coro-
nary stenting {Ribeiro, 2017 #362183}. The long -term  mortality is expected to be larger. There is no registry 
of subjects not offered valve- in-valve TAVR because of threatened coronary obstruction.  
Absent data, we are forced to use judgement and experience to estimate clinically acceptable mortality for 
this group of patients with “no good options.”  We assume that intentional fracture of surgical biopros-
thetic va lve frames would confer incremental mortality, although there are no available data. To come to 
this determination, we polled our lead site investigators, who are selected for their high -volume experience 
and quality.  The best estimate of clinically -accep table 30 -day mortality was 15% for standalone BASILICA 
and 20% for BASILICA with valve fracture.  
10.3.2  Stopping Rules for no intentional overexpansion of bioprosthesis  stratum  
The study will be monitored to ensure that the mortality with in 30-days after the proc edure does not sub-
stantially exceed an anticipated rate. We anticipate the rate of 30 -day mortality is 15% or less and determine 
the stopping rule by a Bayesian approach  [8]. The stopping boundary is reached if the posterior probability 
that the 30 -day mortality rate exceeds 15 % is at least 90%.  We take our prior distribution to be a beta 
distribution so that our prior clinical opinion is worth 20% of the weight we will place on the new study data, 
which gives the prior parameters a = 0.9, b =5.1. Hence when we make decisions a bout stopping the study, 
the data from the study will dominate over the prior opinion.  
The following table summarizes the threshold numbers for the stop rule boundary, which would lead to a 
recommendation to stop the study due to the excess 30 -day mortali ty.

We investigated the performance of the above stopping rule by a simulation study. In each simulation run, 
we generated a study with 30 independent Bernoulli trials, each with a true certain 30 -day mortality, and 
compared these outcomes with the above stopping boundary to determine whether the study was stopped.  
We repeated the simulation 100,000 times and comput ed the proportion of stopped studies using the above 
stopping rule.  The following table summarizes the performance of this stopping rule:  
True 30 -day mortality rate  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  35%  
Proportion of Stopped Studies  4.8%  17.3%  39%  62.3%  81.3%  92.2%  
Average number of subjects  29.1  27 23.5  19.4  15.4  12.1  
Average number of 30 -day mortality  2.9 4 4.7 4.9 4.6 4.2 
These simulation results suggest that our stopping rule has a low probability stopping a study when the 
true 30 -day mortality rate is 15 % or less, and the probability of stopping a study is high when the true 30 -
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 21 of 39 2018- 03-09 day mortality rate exceeds 15%.  There, we believe that our Bayesian stopping rule for 30 -day mortality has 
satisfactory statistical properties.  
10.3.3  Stopping Rules for intentional overexpan sion of bioprosthesis stratum  
The study will be monitored to ensure that the mortality with in 30-days after the procedure does not sub-
stantially exceed an anticipated rate. We anticipate the rate of 30 -day mortality is 20% or less and determine 
the stoppin g rule by a Bayesian approach [ 8]. The stopping boundary is reached if the posterior probability 
that the 30 -day mortality rate exceeds 20 % is at least 90%.  We take our prior distribution to be a beta 
distribution so that our prior clinical opinion is worth 20% of the weight we will plac e on the new data. This 
gives the prior parameters a = 1.2, b =4.8. Hence when we make decisions about stopping the study, the data 
from the study will dominate over the prior opinion.  
The following table summarizes the threshold numbers for the stop rule  boundary, which would lead to a 
recommendation to stop the study due to the excess 30 -day mortality.

thesis” stratum  Stop if the number of deaths within 30 days

We investigated the performance of the above stopping rule by a simulation study. In each simulation run, 
we generated a study with 30 independent Bernoulli trials, each with a true certain 30 -day mortality, and 
compared these outcomes with the above stopping boundary to determine whether the study was stopped.  
We repeated the simulation 100,000 times and computed the proportion of stopped studies using the above 
stopping rule.  The following table summarizes the  performance of this stopping rule:  
True 30- day mortality rate  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  35%  40%  
Proportion of Stopped Studies (%)  1.6%  6.9%  18.9%  38.3%  60.5%  78.5%  90.5%

Average number of 30 -day mortality  3 4.3 5.3 5.9 5.9 5.6 5.1 
These simulation results suggest that our stopping rule has a low probability stopping a study when the 
true 30 -day mortality rate is 20 % or less, and the probability of stopping a study is high when the true 30 -
day mortality rate exceeds 20%.  There, we believe that our Bayesian stopping rule for 30 -day mortality has 
satisfactory statistical properties.

damage to the body, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE): Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was 
not previously identifi ed in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of  subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
Unanticipated Problem ( UP): An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
ALL of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to:  
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent docu-
ment, Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and  
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied, and  
• Related or possibly related to participation  in the research, and

Non-Compliance  
Non-compliance is defined as failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program 
(HRPP) policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements  for the protection of human research sub-
jects.  
Non-compliance may be further characterized as:  
1. Serious non -compliance: Non -compliance that:  
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants.  
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants.  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP.  
d. Invalidates the study data.  
2. Continuing non- compliance: Non -compliance that is recurring.  
3. Minor (non- serious) non -compliance: Non -compliance that is neither serious nor continuing.  
 
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 25 of 39 2018- 03-09 11.2 Adverse event management:  
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each subject  
while on the study.  Adverse events and adverse device effects will be attributed to study procedure and 
graded by severity according to the fol lowing tables:  
11.2.1  Grading of adverse events and adverse device effects  
Category  Description  
Mild  Awareness of symptom. Not expected to have a clinically significant effect on 
the subject’s condition. Not surpassing the expected standard medical inter-
vention.  
Moderate  Condition creates a level of discomfort that interferes with the subject’s usual 
activity or affects clinical status. May require medical intervention.  
Severe  Incapacitating and significantly affects the subject’s clinical status. Likely re-
quires medical intervention and prolonged hospitalization.  
 
11.2.2  Attribution of adverse events to  the research protocol  
The relatedness of adverse events will be classified as:  
Classification  Description  
Definite  The event is clearly related to the research protocol . 
Probable  The event is likely related to the research protocol . The event has a reasonable 
temporal relationship to the  research device or research procedure and alter-
native causes , such as underlying disease, concomitant medications, or con-
comitant treatment -can be excluded.  
Possible  The event may be related to the research protocol . The event has a reasonable 
temporal relationship to the research device or research procedure, and at-
tribution of the event to the device or procedure cannot be excluded. How-
ever, alternative causes —such as underlying disease, concomitant medica-
tions, or concomitant treatments —are presumably responsible.  
Unlikely  It is doubtful the event is related to the research protocol . The event can rea-
sonably be explained b y other factures, including underlying disease, concomi-
tant medications, or concomitant treatments.  
Unrelated  The event is clearly not related to the research protocol . There either is no 
temporal association with the research device or procedure, or the  event is 
readily explained by other factures, including underlying disease, concomitant 
medications, or concomitant treatments.  
 
 
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 26 of 39 2018- 03-09 11.2.3  Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse event recording will start on Day (0) of the BASILICA TAVR  procedure and will continue through the 
12 month Follow Up. New events or conditions present at baseline that increase in severity will be rec-
orded and evaluated and reported on the case report form. Once the subject has completed the 30 day 
follow up, onl y serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE), unanticipated device 
effects (UADE) and unanticipated problems (UP) will be reported to the Sponsor.  It is the responsibility of 
the site investigator to report adverse events and adve rse device effects to their respective IRB s or other 
regulatory bodies  according to their reporting requirements . Monitoring visits will be conducted by the 
Sponsor to review source documentation, and accuracy and completion of the adverse event case repor t 
forms.  
11.2.4  Adverse event reporting timeframes:  
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
• All serious adverse events will be reported to the Sponsor immediately but not later than 3 
working days from the event. The respective institutional IRB should be notified according to 
their requirements.  
• The serious adverse event will be evaluated by the sponsor. If determined to be an unantici-
pated adverse device effect that increases the risk to the participating subjects, the sponsor 
will terminate the investigation within 5 da ys after making the determination, and not later 
than 15 working days after the sponsor was first notified of the event. [21 CFR 812.46]  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE)  
• Must be reported to the Sponsor and the institutional IRB immediately but n o later than 10 
working days after the investigator learns of the event. [21 CFR 812.150]  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects should be reported via telephone as well as on the ad-
verse event section of the case report form.  
• If the event is determined by the Sponsor to be a UADE, the Sponsor will report the event to all 
investigators to enable reporting to their respective IRB/regulatory bodies. The Sponsor will 
provide this notification  to participating sites and to the FDA  within 10 working days after th ey 
first receive notice of the effect.  [21 CFR 812.150]  
• All Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects will be reported by the Sponsor to the N HLBI  IRB im-
mediately upon notification but no later than 10 working days.  
Deaths  
• The investigator will notify the Sponsor immediately but within 3 working days of notification 
of a subject’s death, whether the death is device related or clinical condition. Institutional IRB’s 
will be notified according to the specific institutional reg ulatory requirements for reporting a 
death.  
• The Sponsor will notify the NHLBI IRB of a subject’s death within 7 days.  
• A subject’s death will be recorded on the Case Report Form.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 27 of 39 2018- 03-09 12.0 HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTION  
12.1 Rationale for Subject Selection  
12.1.1  Study population:  
Subjects are selected for being adults who are determined otherwise likely to benefit from transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement yet are expected to suffer TAVR -related left coronary artery  obstruction. The de-
termination will be made by the local institutional multidisciplinary heart team.   No patient will be ex-
cluded from participation based on gender, race or ethnicity.   
Subjects who are unable to provide consent may be enrolled, if allowed by partici pating IRBs.  
12.2 Risks and Discomforts  
A formal risk analysis is provided in APPENDIX A. 
Risks of TAVR  will be considered separately from the risks of preparatory BASILICA  before TAVR .  Known  
risks of TAVR, which is a clinical procedure using approved medical devices as intended, include:  
• Death  
• Stroke/transient ischemic attack, clusters or neurological deficit  
• Paralysis  
• Permanent disability  
• Respiratory insufficiency or respiratory failure  
• Hemorrhage requiring transfusion or intervention  
• Cardiovascular injury including perforation or dissection of vessels, ventricle, myocardium or 
valvular structures that may require intervention  
• Pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade  
• Embolization including air, calcific valve material or thrombus  
• Infection including septicemia and endocarditis  
• Heart failure  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Renal insufficiency or renal failure  
• Conduction system defect which may require a permanent pacemaker  
• Arrhythmia  
• Retroperitoneal bleed  
• AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm  
• Reoperation  
• Ischemia or nerve injury  
• Restenosis  
• Pulmonary edema  
• Pleural effusion  
• Bleeding  
• Anemia  
• Abnormal lab values (including electrolyte imbalance)  
• Hypertension or hypotension  
• Allergic reaction to anesthesia, contrast media, or device materials  
• Hematoma  
• Syncope  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 28 of 39 2018- 03-09 • Pain or changes at the access site  
• Exercise intolerance or weakness  
• Inflammation  
• Angina  
• Heart murmur  
• Fever  
• Cardiac arrest  
• Cardiogenic shock  
• Emergency cardiac surgery  
• Cardiac failure or low cardiac output  
• Coronary flow obstruction/transvalvular flow disturbance  
• Device thrombosis requiring intervention  
• Valve thrombosis  
• Device embolization  
• Device migration or malposition requiring intervention  
• Valve deployment in unintended location  
• Valve stenosis  
• Structural valve deterioration (wear, fracture, calcification, leaflet tear/tearing from the stent 
posts, leaflet retraction, suture line disruption of components of a prosthetic valve, thickening, 
stenosis)  
• Device degeneration  
• Paravalvular or transvalvular leak  
• Valve regurgitation  
• Hemolysis  
• Device explants  
• Nonstructural dysfunction  
• Mechanical failure of delivery system, and/or accessories  
• Rotational mal -orientation of Sapien 3 THV such that commissural post obstructs coronary os-
tium despite successful BASILICA  
 
Anticipated  risks of preparatory BASILICA  before TAVR include:  
• Death  
• Embolization of air, valve debris, atheroma, or thrombus to coronaries, brain, limbs, or viscera 
causing myocardial infarction, stroke, or limb ischemia  
• Severe aortic regurgitation after laceration before TAVI, causing hypotension or cardiogenic 
shock including requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, chest compressions, vasoactive medi-
cations, and/or  mechanical circulatory support  
• Avulsion or other injury  of the native or prosthetic aortic valve leaflet  
• Inadvertent injury of the mitral valve apparatus  
• Traversal into the left atrium  or other non -target chamber  
• Pericardial effusion or tamponade requiring drainage  
• Electrical coupling of traversal guidewire an d bioprosthetic valve frame  
• Native coronary artery ostial injury from electrosurgery or BASILICA guide catheter mechanical 
disruption  
• Vascular access site injury  
• Hemolysis related to blood flow around the lacerated aortic leaflets  
• Acute kidney injury relat ed to BASILICA and to follow- up CT examination  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 29 of 39 2018- 03-09  
The sponsor and investigators recognize these risks are high and reflect the underlying comorbidities, yet 
consider procedural hemorrhage overall to be an acceptable compromise to enable treatment of the un-
derlying mitral valve failure in patients otherwise ineligible.  
12.2.1  Risks Related to Radiation  
In this research protocol, subjects will be exposed to radiation from 2 CT scans.  The CT scans are per-
formed for research surveillance of transcatheter heart valve dysfunction.  It is estimated that the amount 
of research radiation that a subject will be exposed to during participation in this research protocol will be 
approximately 3-4 REM from the CT scans , and 72mS v[9] from approximately 60-100 minutes of research 
fluoroscopy during performance of BASILICA and TAVR .  This is equivalent to 740 chest X -rays.  We be-
lieve the total fluoroscopy exposure to be justifiable in this setting, given the seriousness of their cardiovas-
cular disease and limited options. We estimate the benefit to the research subjects for these procedures to 
outweigh the risks.  
12.2.2  Data colle ction from patients who have undergone BASILICA  at participating sites 
before this protocol begins enrollment  
As of the time of submission of this protocol for review, 3  patients are known to have undergone 
standalone TAVR with  BASILICA .  We wish to aggreg ate all available follow- up data on these patients to the 
extent possible, including patients who have died during the follow -up period. This number of patients ana-
lyzed retrospectively will not count against (“reduce”) the number of prospectively enrolled  patients.  
Subjects must have undergone BASILICA TAVR  before enrollment begins in this protocol, which is expected 
October  2017.  R etrospective findings will be analyzed separately from the subjects in the main (prospec-
tive) investigational IDE arm. 
12.2.3  Person al Identifiable Information  
Clinical data from subjects participating in this trial will retain personally identifiable information. This includes CT 
scans, echocardiograms, and medical records.  
Abstracted data will be coded and de -identified for transmiss ion to participating subcontracting investigators, such as 
core imaging laboratories, clinical events adjudication committee, and statistician.  
DICOM data will be stored in a secured NIH research PACS system for analysis, including personally identifi-
able information.  
13.0 TEST ARTICLE  
13.1 Asahi -Intecc Astato XS 20 , 510(k) K103057  
13.1.1  Indications For Use  
The Astato 0.014” guidewire is used for transcatheter electrosurgery in two steps in this procedure.  First it 
is used for leaflet traversal during electrification.   This procedure is similar to the use of the Astato XS20 
and an amputated Asahi Confienza Pro 12 in the transcaval IDE investigation recently published [10]. 
Second, the midshaft is focally denuded and electrified for the leaflet traversal step.   This is described in 
the pre -clinical [5] and early clinical [ 6] LAMPOON manuscript s. 
Neither of these procedures are addressed in the indications for use:  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 30 of 39 2018- 03-09 Asahi -Intec Astato XS 20:  This product is intended to facilitate the placement and exchange of diagnos-
tic and therapeutic devices during intravascular procedures. This device is intended for peripheral vas-
cular use only.  
13.1.2  In vitro testing  of bedside modification  
We performed a benc htop investigation of the tensile strength implications of intended (“conventional”) 
and unintended (“undesirable”) bedside modification of the Astato guidewire shaft.   Using the available 
testing equipment, the BASILICA modification of the Astato guidewi re left a fracture force exceeding 75N in 
all tests, compared with the ISO 11070- 2014, part 8.6 limit (which is 5N) by over tenfold.  See Appendix B.  
We believe this demonstrates the safety of the guidewire modification when following the prescribed tech-
nique.  
14.0 INVESTIGATOR ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS  
14.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 
(Guideline for Good Clinical Practice), Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 50 (Protection of 
Human Subjects), and 56 (Institutional Review Boards), and other  appropriate regulatory requirement(s). 
The Investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the BASILICA TAVR  technique as described in the prot ocol 
and the Investigation al plan . Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of 
the study and the integrity of the data collected. Regulatory files should be established at the beginning of 
the study, maintained for the duration of the study and re tained according to the appropriate regulations.  
14.2 IRB Submissions  
The IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies will review all appropriate study docu-
mentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety, and well -being of the subjects. The study will only be 
conducted at sites where IRB/IEC and other ap propriate institutional regulatory body approval have been 
obtained. The protocol, informed consent, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to 
these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulator y bodies by 
the Investigator.  
14.3 Subject Information and Informed Consent  
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from the subject or 
his/her legal representative prior to study participation. The method of obtainin g and documenting the in-
formed consent and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH -GCP and all applicable regulatory re-
quirement(s).  
Subjects who are unable to provide consent may be enrolled, if allowed by participating IRBs.  Consent for 
these s ubjects must be obtained from a legally authorized representative. The process for obtaining this 
consent must conform to local human subjects pro tection policies and to state laws.  
Waiver of consent is requested to collect de- identified clinical data into  a retrospective registry  arm of pa-
tients treated before IDE enrollment begins nationwide , on the grounds that the retrospective collection of 
de-identified clinical data imparts no increase over minimal risk and that informed consent is impractical in 
this population of extremely ill and elderly patients, many of whom have poor survival despite TAVI, and 
many of whom have severe disability.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 31 of 39 2018- 03-09 14.4 Subject Confidentiality  
In order to maintain subject privacy, all CRFs, accountability records, study reports, and co mmunications 
will identify the subject by initials and the assigned subject number. The Investigator will grant monitor(s) 
and auditor(s) from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority ( ies) access to the subject’s origi-
nal medical records for v erification of data gathered on the CRFs and to audit the data collection process. 
The subject’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent per-
mitted by the applicable laws and regulations.  
14.5 Protocol Compliance  
The Investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol provided by the Sponsor, and given 
approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies. Modifica-
tions to the protocol should not be made wit hout agreement of both the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory body 
approval/favorable opinion prior to implementation, except when the modification is needed to eliminate 
an immediate hazard(s) to subjects. The IRB/IEC may provide, if applicable regulatory authority ( ies) permit, 
expedited review and approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that have the ap-
proval /favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies. The Sponsor 
will submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the governing reg-
ulations.  
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to elimi nate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects, 
the Investigator will contact the Sponsor, if circumstances permit, to discuss the planned course of action. 
Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the CRF and source documentation.  
14.6 Direct Acce ss to Source Data  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by the Sponsor will be followed, in order to comply with 
GCP guidelines.  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies, and/or the Spon-
sor may reques t access to all source documents, CRFs, and other study documentation for on- site audit or 
inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by the Investigator, who must provide 
support at all times for these activities.  
14.7 Case Report Form Com pletion  
CRFs will be completed for each study subject. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s CRF. Source documentation 
supporting the CRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study and should document the 
dates and details of study procedures, AEs, and subject status.  
The Principal Investigator or designated representative, should complete the CRF screens as soon as possi-
ble after inform ation is collected, preferably on the same day that a study subject is seen for an examina-
tion, treatment, or any other study procedure  but no more than 5 days post procedure . An explanation 
should be given for all missing data.  
The Principal Investigator must sign and date the Investigator’s Statement at the end of the CRF to endorse 
the recorded data.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 32 of 39 2018- 03-09 14.8 Record Retention  
The Investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH -GCP and applicable regulatory require-
ment(s). Records will be retained fo r at least 2 years following marketing application approval or 2 years 
after formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational product or according to ap-
plicable regulatory requirement(s). If the Investigator withdraws from the resp onsibility of keeping the 
study records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility. The Sponsor 
must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs.  
The Sponsor has full rights over any invention, discovery, or innov ation, patentable or not, that may occur 
when performing the study.  
14.9 Publication and Presentation of Study Findings and Use of Information  
It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings and/or published in a 
peer reviewed scientific or medical journal. A Publications Committee comprised of Investigators participat-
ing in the study and representatives from the Sponsor, as appropriate, will be formed to oversee the publi-
cation and presentation of the study results, which will reflect the experience of all participating clinical 
sites. No publication or disclosure of study results will be permitted except under the terms and conditions 
of a separate written agreement between Sponsor and the investigator and/or the inves tigator's institu-
tion.  
14.10  Study Eligibility Committee  
Clinical data for all research candidates are confirmed by the study eligibility committee before enroll-
ment.  
The study eligibility committee consists of the NHLBI investigators and the local site principal investiga-
tors.  A quorum of the committee requires a local site investigator where the candidate is not to be en-
rolled, as well as at least two NHLBI investigators.  
 
15.0 SPONSOR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
15.1 Role of Sponsor  
As the study sponsor of this clinical study, Dr. Robert Lederman  has the overall  responsibility for the con-
duct of the study, including assurance that the study meets  the regulatory requirements of the appropriate 
regulatory bodies.  
15.2 General Duties  
The Sponsor's general duties consist of submitt ing the appropriate regulatory  applications , selecting inves-
tigators, obtaining their signed agreement, providing them with the information necessary to conduct the 
study, e nsuring proper clinical site monitoring , and ensuring  study subject  informed consent is obtained.    
15.3 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor designee, an independent contract research organization. 
Monitoring will be done by personal visits and will include on -site review of the informed consent docu-
ments and case report forms for completeness and clar ity, cross -checking with source documents, and clar-
ification of administrative matters will be performed. The review of medical records will be performed in a 
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 33 of 39 2018- 03-09 manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained. The site monitor will ensure that th e investiga-
tion is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements by frequent communications 
(letter, e- mail, telephone, and fax).  
15.4 Site Selection and Training  
The sponsor or its designee ( national co -principal investigator) will ensure appropriate training in the tech-
nique of caval -aortic access prior to enrollment at any participating institution.  
15.4.1  Site selection:  
Site selection will be based on  
1. Physician expression of interest and need to apply this treatment approach to patients at the site.  
2. Physician prior experience performing or proctoring 10 transcaval TAVR procedures to assure com-
petence in transcatheter electrosurgery .  Preference given to sites with prior experience with LAM-
POON TMVR experience.  
3. Site prior participation in IDE p rotocols evaluating a treatment of structural heart disease  
4. Site ability to obtain CT examinations that are satisfactory for consideration of BASILICA TAVR . 
5. Site investigators willing and able to comply with the requirements of this protocol.  
A waiver for criterion 2 is specifically applied to Site #1, which was the first to perform BASILICA TAVR in 
patients. To compensate for limited transcaval experience, every research BASILICA procedure will be proc-
tored by experienced transcaval operators until the cri terion is met.  
15.4.2  Site training:  
Site training will consist of  
• Principal investigator and/or sponsor didactic training about the technique, preclinical, and clinical 
experience to date.  
• Proctored conduct of BASILICA TAVR  procedure s in patients  at the local si te, at the sole discretion 
of the Sponsor and/or Principal Investigator .   
• Completion of training, and suitability for independent BASILICA TAVR enrollment, will be certified 
by the Principal Investigator and with the concurrence of the Sponsor.

1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Open Label Study to Compare Nivolumab plus 
Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab or 
Nivolumab plus CCRT Followed by Nivolumab vs CCRT followed by Durvalumab in Previously Untreated, Locally Advanced Non -small Cell Lung Cancer (LA NSCLC)  
(CheckMate  73L, CHECKpoint  pathway  and nivoluMAb clinical  Trial  Evaluation 73L) 
Study Phase:  3 
Rationale: CA20973L is a phase 3, randomized, open label study to compare nivolumab plus 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by durvalumab in previously untreated locally advanced non- small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC).  
Adding anti- PD-1 treatment  concurrently  to CCRT  is hypothesized to improve  anti- tumor activity. 
Subsequently, combining immunotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action in the maintenance  period following  CCRT  may offer the possibility  of a synergistic response. PD-1 and 
CTLA -4 are both co-inhibitory molecules,  but evidence suggests that they use distinct mechanisms 
to limit T cell activation. Therefore, combining anti- PD-1 and anti -CTLA -4 immunotherapies 
following CCRT has the potential to improve outcomes. 
The current study aims to demonstrate that incorporation of nivolumab to definitive CCRT, followed by nivolumab with/without ipilimumab will be efficacious in participants with newly diagnosed untreated LA  NSCLC, compared with CCRT followed by durvalumab. Additional 
objectives of the study include characterization of safety and tolerability, as well as pharmacokinetics,  , and changes in patient -reported outcomes for 
quality of life assessments. The safety and efficacy of ipilimumab added to nivolumab maintenance therapy will be characterized descriptively.  
Study Population: Previously untreated locally advanced non- small cell lung cancer (LA 
NSCLC).  
Objectives,  Endpoints,  and Estimands:  
The study objectives  and endpoints described  below will be evaluated  for the following treatment 
regimens:  
• Arm A: Nivolumab  + CCRT  followed  by nivolumab + ipilimumab  maintenance  
• Arm B: Nivolumab + CCRT  followed  by nivolumab maintenance  
• Arm C: CCRT  followed  by durvalumab maintenance

advanced NSCLC (1:1:1) to the 3 treatment arms. 
Treatment Arms and Duration: Participants will be randomized (1:1:1) across the 3  treatment 
arms: 
• Arm  A: 
− CCRT Period:  Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (IV Q3W) for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy (total dose of 60 -66 Gy) for 
cycles 2 to 3

− CCRT Period:  Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (IV Q3W) for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy (total dose of 60 -66 Gy) for 
cycles 2 to 3  
− Maintenance  Period:  Nivolumab (480 mg flat dose IV Q4W)  for up to 12 months  
• Arm  C: 
− CCRT Period:  Platinum doublet chemotherapy (IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy 
(total dose of 60-66 Gy) for cycles 2 to 3 
− Maintenance  Period: Durvalumab  (10 mg/kg IV Q2W)  for up to 12 months.  
 
If radiotherapy  planning is complete  prior to the initiation  of systemic anticancer  therapy at Cycle  1 
of the CCRT  Period  (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone, and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic 
anticancer therapy (Cycle 2). All study procedures for Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 during the CCRT Period  are still to be followed. The Recovery  Period  will begin after the final dose of radiotherapy 
and the completion of Cycle 3 procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities.  An additional 
cycle of consolidation chemotherapy + nivolumab (Arms  A and B) or chemotherapy  alone 
(Arm C) will not be administered after the completion of radiotherapy in this situation.

3DRT.  
The order of the treatment for D1 of C2 and C3 are nivolumab,  followed  by chemotherapy. 
It is recommended that radiotherapy be 
administered after the completion of systemic 
anti-cancer therapy and on the same day if 
logistically feasible. Otherwise, a window of  
± 3 days is permitted.  
Note: If radiotherapy planning is complete 
prior to the initiation of systemic anticancer therapy at Cycle 1 (Arms A, B or C), the Investigator has the option to skip Cycle 1 
procedures (with systemic anticancer therapy 
alone) and initiate the CCRT period with Cycle 2 procedures  (radiotherapy  concurrently 
with systemic anticancer therapy). All study procedures for Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 are still to be followed in this situation.

Radiation  therapy  starts  on Day 1 of Cycle 2. See note.  
Participants will receive radiotherapy for 5 days every 
week  in daily  fraction  of 2 Gy. The total target  dose will 
be 60 -66 Gy in 30 -33 fractions  Each participant will receive thoracic 
radiotherapy in form  of IMRT,  VMAT, or 
3DRT.  
The order of the treatment for D1 of C2 and C3 
are nivolumab, followed by chemotherapy. It is 
recommended  that radiotherapy be administered 
after the completion of systemic anticancer 
therapy and on the same day if logistically 
feasible. Otherwise, a window of ± 3 days is 
permitted.  
Note: If radiotherapy planning is complete prior 
to the initiation  of systemic  anticancer  therapy  at 
Cycle 1 (Arms A, B or C), the Investigator has the option to skip Cycle 1 procedures (with 
systemic anticancer therapy alone) and initiate 
the CCRT period with Cycle 2 procedures 
(radiotherapy concurrently with systemic 
anticancer therapy). All study procedures for Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 are still to be followed in 
this situation.

See note.  No scheduled scan until the recovery period but 
unscheduled scans  are permitted  per investigator 
judgment. For participants with progressive 
disease that has not been confirmed by BICR, if 
the planned start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy is sooner  than the time of next scheduled 
tumor assessment, every effort should be made 
to repeat tumor imaging prior to initiation of 
subsequent anticancer therapy.

During  treatment  beyond  progression  (TBP),  a follow  up scan is required  within  6 
weeks of initial Investigator -assessed PD to determine if there has been a 
reduction in tumor size, SD, or continued progression. If TBP continues beyond 
the 6 week scan (based on Investigator judgment), subsequent scans should be 
performed every 12 weeks (±7 days), or if additional worsening is suspected.  
Other anatomical sites should be imaged in the presence of signs or symptoms suggesting disease progression.  Tumor  assessment  schedule  should be maintained

performed  at week  24 (± 7 days) from  the date of randomization,  then every 
12 weeks (± 7 days) during treatment.  
During treatment  beyond progression (TBP),  a follow  up scan is required  within 
6 weeks of initial Investigator -assessed PD to determine if there has been a 
reduction  in tumor  size, SD, or continued progression.  If TBP continues  beyond 
the 6 week scan (based on Investigator judgment), subsequent scans should be performed every 12 weeks (± 7 days), or if additional worsening is suspected.  
Other  anatomical  sites should  be imaged  in the presence of signs  or symptoms 
suggesting disease progression. Tumor assessment schedule should be maintained regardless of dose delays.  
Tumor assessments will continue until BICR confirmed disease progression, Investigator -assessed distant metastases, or treatment discontinuation due to 
additional  PD during  TBP,  whichever occurs  later.  Use same  imaging  method 
as was used at screening.  
All study  treatment  decisions  will be based  on the investigator’s  assessment  of

 3 INTRODUCTION  
CA20973L is a phase 3, randomized, open label study to compare nivolumab plus concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone versus CCRT followed by durvalumab in previously untreated locally advanced non- small cell lung 
cancer (LA NSCLC).  
Immunotherapeutic approaches have recently demonstrated clinical efficacy in several cancer 
types, including NSCLC.
1 Tumors may modulate  and evade the host  immune response through a 
number of mechanisms, including down regulation of tumor -specific antigen expression and 
presentation, secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines, and upregulation of inhibitory ligands. T 
cell checkpoint regulators such as CTLA -4 and programmed death -1 (PD -1, CD279) are cell 
surface molecules that, when  engaged by their cognate ligands,  induce signaling cascades down- 
regulating  T cell activation  and proliferation.  One proposed model by which  therapeutic  T cell 
checkpoint inhibitors  derive antitumor activity is through breaking of immune  tolerance  to tumor 
cell antigens.  
Nivolumab (BMS -936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype mAb that binds PD -1 on 
activated  immune cells and disrupts  engagement of the receptor  with its ligands PD-L1 
(B7-H1/CD274) and PD -L2 (B7 -DC/CD273), thereby abrogating inhibitory signals and 
augmenting the host antitumor response (see Section 3.2.2.2 and Section 3.2.3  for clinical 
background on nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination). 
Durvalumab is  a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa subclass that 
inhibits binding of PD -L1 (B7 -H1, CD274) to PD -1 (CD279) and CD80 (B7- 1). In the phase 3 
PACIFIC trial, durvalumab was compared with  placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with 
stage III NSCLC that did not progress after CCRT. Durvalumab significantly prolonged PFS 
(median 17.2 months vs 5.6 months, HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63), and OS (HR 0.68; 99.73%  
CI, 0.47 to 0.997, P=0.0025).2 Updated analyses  at 48 months further  observed an estimated PFS 
and OS rate of 35.3% and 49.6%, respectively.3 
Ipilimumab  is a fully  human  monoclonal IgG1κ  that binds to the CTLA -4 antigen expressed on a 
subset of T cells from human and nonhuman primates. The proposed mechanism of action for ipilimumab  is interference  of the interaction  of CTLA -4 with B7 molecules on antigen-presenting 
cell (APCs),  with  subsequent blockade of the inhibitory  modulation of T- cell activation  promoted 
by the CTLA-4/B7 interaction. 
The CA20973L study will allow for direct comparison of novel therapeutic strategy: CCRT with 
concurrent programmed  cell death  protein-1 /programmed  death -ligand 1 (PD-1/PD -L1) blockade 
followed by PD -1/PD -L1 blockade with or without CTLA -4 blockade, compared with  PD-1/PD - 
L1 blockade alone after CCRT,  as measured  by PFS,  OS, and other clinical endpoints in previously 
untreated LA NSCLC.

 3.1 Study Rationale  
Adding anti PD -1 concurrently to CCRT is hypothesized to improve anti -tumor activity (see 
Section 5.4.2). In the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab was given after the completion of CCRT. In 
subgroup analyses,  more  pronounced improvement in median  PFS and OS was seen in participants 
randomized within 14 days of  the last radiation dose compared to participants randomized later, 
suggesting that initiating PD -1/PD -L1 blockade closer to CCRT may be beneficial.4 In a mouse 
model, different  combination  schedules were  assessed.  It was observed that initiating  PD-1/PD -L1 
blockade during radiotherapy  led to longer survival times,  whereas starting  PD-1/PD -L1 blockade 
7 days after the completion of radiotherapy yielded similar survival results when compared with radiotherapy  alone, which might be due  to an acute increase in PD -L1 expression on tumor  cells 
during radiotherapy.
5 Ineffective  PD-1/PD -L1 blockade when  given in a delayed manner might be 
explained by the deletion or anergy of tumor- reactive CD8+ cells. In a phase 2 trial  (NICOLAS), 
nivolumab is given concurrently with chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC. Preliminary data (see Section 3.2.4 ) suggested this approach is feasible and safe.  
6 Another phase 2 trial 
combining atezolizumab concurrently with chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC showed similar findings.
7 
Furthermore, in the Maintenance Period following CCRT, combining immunotherapeutic agents 
with different mechanisms of action offers the possibility of a synergistic response. PD -1 and 
CTLA -4 are both co-inhibitory molecules,  but evidence suggests that they use distinct mechanisms 
to limit T cell  activation  (see Section 3.2.3 and Section 3.2.4 for clinical  experience).  Preliminary 
indirect data from peripheral T cell assessments suggest that a given T -cell checkpoint inhibitor 
may modulate host immune cell phenotype rendering them more susceptible to alternate 
checkpoint inhibitors  and thereby enhancing anti-tumor activity.  Available  evidence also indicates 
that incorporating ipilimumab  into radiotherapy -based  strategy  holds promise  as, besides  abscopal 
effect, durable response has been observed with ipilimumab in the context of palliative radiotherapy in treating metastatic, refractory NSCLC (see Section 5.4.3).  
The current study aims to demonstrate that incorporation of nivolumab to definitive CCRT 
followed by nivolumab with/without ipilimumab will be efficacious in participants with newly 
diagnosed untreated LA  NSCLC, compared with CCRT followed by durvalumab. Additional 
objectives of the study include characterization of safety and tolerability, as well as pharmacokinetics,  and changes in patient -reported outcomes for 
quality of life assessments. The safety and efficacy of ipilimumab added to nivolumab maintenance therapy will be characterized descriptively.  
3.1.1 Research Hypothesis  
CCRT  with concurrent nivolumab followed  by nivolumab plus ipilimumab  will improve  PFS and 
OS in previously untreated LA NSCLC compared with CCRT followed by durvalumab.

 3.2 Background  
3.2.1 Epidemiology/Indication  
Lung cancer has been the most common cancer in the world for several decades. There were 
estimated to be 1.8 million new cases in 2012 (12.9% of the total). Lung cancer is the most 
common cause of death  from  cancer  worldwide, estimated  to be responsible for nearly  one in  five 
(1.59 million deaths, 19.4% of the total).8 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80% to 85% of all lung cancers 
and 30% of patients present with Stage III disease. Standard treatment for patients with a good 
performance status and unresectable Stage III NSCLC was definitive chemoradiation. A meta- 
analysis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus sequential chemoradiotherapy showed better outcomes with concurrent therapy.
9 With  improvements  such as in staging  by using PET and in 
radiation  technologies, 5- year overall survival (OS)  was reported  up to 30-35%.10 
Attempts to improve OS include radiotherapy dose escalation/acceleration; new chemotherapy combinations, addition of biological agents, targeted agents, and cancer vaccines to standard regimens.  Technical  radiotherapy  modifications have also  been  explored. However,  none of these 
efforts has led to an improvement in OS thus far, except for acceleration of radiotherapy in the non-concurrent setting.
11 Recently,  durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 agent, showed  an improvement in 
median  PFS,  as well as OS in maintenance after CCRT.2 It is becoming the new standard  of care. 
However, the majority of patients still experienced disease progression or death during the first 
two years of therapy (18-month PFS rate of 44.2%), and only 57% of patients  were  alive  at 
3 years.4,12 As this stage of disease is potentially curable, new treatment strategies are needed.  
3.2.2 Mechanism of Action 
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumors can be recognized  as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this  setting is  thought to rely on immune  surveillance of tumor antigens  expressed  on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses
.13,14,15 
Current immunotherapy  efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating regulatory  checkpoints of the immune  system.  T-cell stimulation  is a complex process 
involving the integration  of numerous positive  as well as negative co-stimulatory  signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by the TCR . 16 Collectively, these signals govern the balance 
between T -cell activation and tolerance.  
3.2.2.1 Ipilimumab Mechanism of Action  
CTLA -4, an activation- induced T -cell surface molecule, is a member of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin superfamily that competes with CD28 for B7. CTLA -4 mediated signals are 
inhibitory and turn off T cell-dependent immune  responses.  17 Ipilimumab  is a fully  human

 monoclonal IgG1κ  that binds to the CTLA -4 antigen  expressed  on a subset  of T cells from  human 
and nonhuman primates.  The proposed mechanism  of action  for ipilimumab  is interference  of the 
interaction of CTLA -4 with B7 molecules on APCs, with subsequent blockade of the inhibitory 
modulation of T -cell activation promoted by the CTLA 4/B7 interaction.  
3.2.2.2 Nivolumab Mechanism  of Action  
PD-1 is a member  of the CD28  family  of T- cell co-stimulatory  receptors  that also includes CD28, 
CTLA -4, ICOS, and BTLA . 18 PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD -28-mediated 
upregulation of IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-γ  and Bcl-xL. PD-1 expression also has been noted to 
inhibit T cell  activation,  and expansion of previously activated  cells.  Evidence for a  negative 
regulatory role of PD-1 comes  from studies of PD-1 deficient  mice,  which  develop a variety  of 
autoimmune phenotypes .19 These results suggest that PD -1 blockade has the potential to activate 
anti-self T-cell responses,  but these responses are variable  and dependent upon various host genetic 
factors.  Thus,  PD-1 deficiency  or inhibition  is not accompanied  by a universal loss of tolerance  to 
self-antigens.  
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS -936558) binds to PD -1 with high affinity (EC50 0.39- 2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD -1 to its ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2 (IC50 ± 1 nM). Nivolumab binds 
specifically  to PD-1 and not to  related  members  of the CD28  family  such  as CD28,  ICOS,  CTL -4 
and BTLA. Blockade of the PD -1 pathway by nivolumab results in a reproducible enhancement 
of both proliferation  and IFN-γ release in the MLR.  Using  a CMV  re-stimulation  assay  with human 
PBMC, the effect of nivolumab on antigen specific recall response indicates that nivolumab 
augmented IFN-γ secretion from  CMV specific memory  T cells in a dose-dependent  manner versus 
isotype- matched  control. In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog of nivolumab enhances the 
anti-tumor immune response and results in tumor rejection in several immunocompetent mouse  
tumor mo dels  (MC38, SA1/NPAN02).20 
3.2.2.3 Clinical Experience with Nivolumab in NSCLC  
Approval of nivolumab in advanced NSCLC was based on 2 phase 3 trials (CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057) which demonstrated survival benefit over docetaxel across histologies in previously treated patients. 
The approval in squamous NSCLC was based on the results of CA209017, a randomized trial  of 
nivolumab versus docetaxel. The median OS for patients in the nivolumab arm was 9.2 months versus 6 months for those in the docetaxel arm (HR = 0.59). Improvement in survival was observed 
for nivolumab regardless of PD -L1 expression, although there was a trend toward better efficacy 
for those with PD -L1 expressing tumors. A single -arm trial (CA209063) of 117 patients with 
metastatic squamous NSCLC with progression after platinum- based chemotherapy and at least 1 
additional systemic regimen showed a 15% objective response rate (ORR); 59% of participants  
with a response had response durations of 6 months or longer.
21 
The approval of nivolumab for the treatment of non-squamous NSCLC  is based  on a second phase 
3 study, CA209057, which  met its primary  endpoint of superior OS of nivolumab versus  docetaxel 
in patients  with previously treated  non-squamous NSCLC  at a preplanned interim analysis.

 Patients in  the nivolumab arm had a 27% reduction in risk of death  (HR = 0.73; P = 0.0015). The 
safety profile was also more favorable for nivolumab vs docetaxel.22 
Although the first- line CA209026 trial  did not  demonstrate that single agent nivolumab provided 
superior efficacy over platinum doublet chemotherapy, the efficacy of nivolumab was similar to 
that of chemotherapy in this first line patient population.23 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of nivolumab is 
provided in the Investigator Brochure and local package insert. 
3.2.3 Clinical  Experience with Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab  Combination 
Therapy  
Multiple clinical studies have evaluated nivolumab combined with ipilimumab at different doses 
and schedules across various tumor types.  
CA209012 was a multi -arm phase 1b trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in 
patients with chemotherapy -naïve advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as either 
monotherapy or in combination with other agents including ipilimumab, at different doses and schedules. The primary endpoint of the study was safety with secondary endpoints of objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 and 24- week progression- free survival (PFS). Participants 
were assigned to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q12W (n=38), nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W (n=39) and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W (n=52). The confirmed  ORR was 47% (N3 Q2W  + I1 Q12W), 39% (N3 Q2W + I1 Q6W)  and 23% 
(N3 Q2W).  
The rate of treatment -related  adverse events (AEs)  in the Q12W (82%)  and Q6W  (72%) arms  were 
comparable to monotherapy (72%). In the study, Grade 3/4 adverse events were 37%, 33%, and 19% for the Q12W, Q6W, and nivolumab monotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment -related 
Grade  3-4 AEs led to discontinuation in 5% and 8% of participants in the Q12W and Q6W  cohorts, 
respectively,  and were  similar  to nivolumab monotherapy. There  were  no treatment -related  deaths. 
The treatment- related  select  AEs in patients  administered  the optimized  dosing schedule (3 mg/kg 
of nivolumab Q2W plus 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab Q6W) were skin related (36%), gastrointestinal 
(23%),  endocrine (20%),  and pulmonary (5%)  and there  were ≤ 5% treatment related  Grade  3 and 
Grade 4 AEs per category. 
Efficacy  and safety  profiles  were  further  described  with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab  in 
the ongoing phase 3 CheckMate 227 study which enrolled patients with stage IV or recurrent 
NSCLC who were  not previously treated.  Those with a level  of tumor PD-L1 expression  of at least 
1% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab monotherapy, or chemotherapy. Those  with a tumor PD-L1 expression level  of less than 1% were 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. Co- primary endpoints were PFS in patients with a TMB ≥ 10 
mutations/Mb  using the FoundationOne CDx  assay,  and OS in patients with PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1%.

 In the PFS  analysis of patients  with high tumor mutational  burden (≥ 10 mutations/Mb), PFS was 
significantly longer in the group treated by nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with 
chemotherapy, demonstrating a median  PFS of 7.2 months vs 5.5 months, respectively  (HR = 0.58; 
97.5%  CI: 0.41, 0.81, P < 0.001), and was numerically  better  than that of nivolumab alone (HR = 
0.75; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.07).24 
In the OS analysis in patients with PD -L1 expression ≥1%, the combination of nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab significantly prolonged survival compared with chemotherapy, reducing the risk of 
death  by 21% (HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.96).25 The median  duration of OS was 17.1 months  
(95%  CI: 15.0, 20.1) with  nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and 14.9 months (95%  CI: 12.7, 16.7) with 
chemotherapy (P = 0.007), and 2- year survival rates were 40.0% and 32.8%, respectively. The 
ORR was 35.9%  (95%  CI: 31.1, 40.8) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (5.8% of patients had a  
complete response) versus 30.0% (95% CI: 25.5, 34.7) with chemotherapy (1.8% of patients had 
a complete response). The median duration of response was 23.2 months and 6.2 months, respectively. The response rate and duration of  response for nivolumab monotherapy was 27.5% 
and 15.5 months, respectively, showing the added anti -tumor activity of the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  combination. An OS benefit  was also observed in patients  with PD-L1 expression  less 
than 1%, with a median survival duration of 17.2 months (95% CI: 12.8, 22.0) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and 12.2 months (95%  CI: 9.2, 14.3) with chemotherapy. Across trial participants 
(irrespective of PD -L1 expression), the median duration of OS was 17.1 months (95% CI: 15.2, 
19.9) with  nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and 13.9 months (95%  CI: 12.2, 15.1) with  chemotherapy. 
The percentage of patients with grade 3 or 4 treatment -related AE in the overall population was 
32.8%  with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and 36.0%  with  chemotherapy. The  overall safety  profile 
was consistent with previously reported data, with no new safety signals. 
Overall,  the results from the CheckMate 227 trial demonstrate the potential of the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  combination to improve  treatment outcomes in patients with  NSCLC, irrespective of 
PD-L1 expression. 
The approval of nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus 2 cycles of chemotherapy in first -line NSCLC 
was based on the results of CA2099LA, a randomized trial of nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks 
(Q3W)  plus ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q6W  plus 2 cycles  of chemotherapy (treatment arm)  vs 4 cycles 
of chemotherapy with optional pemetrexed as maintenance (control arm) for non -squamous 
histology. This trial met its primary  endpoint of OS at the interim analysis with a minimum follow 
up of 8.1 months (HR = 0.69, 96.71% CI: 0.55, 0.87; p = 0.0006). After a minimum follow up of  
12.7 months, median OS was 15.6 months in the treatment arm, and 10.9 months in the control a
rm, yielding  a HR of 0.66 (95%  CI: 0.55, 0.80) with OS benefit  also observed across  prespecified 
subgroups. A PFS advantage was demonstrated  in the treatment  arm vs control arm with a median 
of 6.7 vs 5.0 months (HR  = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.82), respectively. A  significant improvement in 
ORR was also observed with a response rate of  38% in the treatment arm vs 25% in the control 
arm (Odds Ratio = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 2.6). The safety profile remains consistent with previous findings with no new toxicity signals and Grade  3/4 treatment- related  AEs rates being 47% in the 
treatment arm and 38% in the control arm.

 3.2.4 Clinical  Experience with Nivolumab and CCRT  
The safety, tolerability, and feasibility of administering nivolumab concurrently with CCRT in 
patients with  stage III locally  advanced NSCLC is supported by data from  the Phase 2 NICOLAS 
trial.27 In the NICOLAS trial, participants received 3 cycles of platinum- based chemotherapy 
(cisplatin or carboplatin combined with etoposide, pemetrexed or  vinorelbine) concurrently with 
radiotherapy (66 Gy/ 33 fractions) and nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks). Radiotherapy techniques during CCRT included VMAT, IMRT or 3DRT, with a mean lung dose of <  20 Gy. 
Following CCRT,  participants  received  nivolumab maintenance therapy for up to 1 year at a dose 
of 480 mg every 4 weeks. 
The primary endpoint in the NICOLAS trial was pneumonitis -free rate (Grade ≥ 3) observed at 
any time during 6 months post -radiotherapy. One formal interim safety analysis was performed 
when  the first 21 participants  reached  3 months post-radiotherapy follow -up. Success at the interim 
analysis would be declared if there were zero Grade ≥  3 pneumonitis events in the 21 evaluable 
participants.  Otherwise,  at the final analysis,  at least 33 of the 41 participants  would be required  to 
be Grade ≥  3 pneumonitis- free at 6 months post -radiotherapy to reject the null hypothesis.  
At the interim analysis (completed in September 2017), zero Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis events were 
observed, demonstrating the safety and tolerability of nivolumab combined with CCRT. By 
August 2018, 41 evaluable participants reached 6 months post -CCRT follow- up. Thirty- six 
participants had not experienced Grade ≥  3 pneumonitis, above the boundary for null hypothesis 
rejection of ≥ 33 participants remaining event -free. These results provide additional support for 
the interim analysis conclusion that nivolumab + CCRT is safe and tolerable.  
In this ongoing trial, up to May 2019, data are available for 77 safety- evaluable patients with a 
median follow -up of 20.9 months. In this safety cohort, 8 Grade 3 pneumonitis events were 
reported, 7 of which resolved.
28 
Based on the formal interim safety analysis in the first 21 participants, the informal safety 
verification in the first 41 participants, and the incidence of pneumonitis Grade ≥  3 in the full 
safety  cohort of 77 participants,  NICOLAS  study investigators determined  that no unexpected AEs 
or increased safety risk was observed in the trial.  
In part 2 of another phase 2 trial (DETERRED) combining atezolizumab concurrently with 
chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC also suggested that PD -L1 blockade given 
concurrently with chemoradiation  was feasible and safe.7 The chemotherapy component consisted 
of weekly  low dose carboplatin  and paclitaxel  concurrently  with radiotherapy  followed  by 2 cycles 
of full dose carboplatin/paclitaxel as consolidation. Of the 30 participants who received at least 1 
dose of therapy, 3 participants  (10%) reported pneumonitis (two Grade  2 events and one Grade 3 
event). The overall toxicity  profile  of atezolizumab  with CCRT  followed  by consolidation and 
maintenance  atezolizumab  was similar to CCRT  alone followed by consolidation and maintenance 
atezolizumab.  
In the Keynote 799 study, patients with unresectable, locally advanced, Stage III NSCLC were 
randomized into two cohorts containing pembrolizumab and chemoradiation given concurrently

 with the chemotherapy component consisting of  carboplatin/paclitaxel  in Cohort A (N  = 112) and 
cisplatin/pemetrexed in Cohort B (N = 73). An ORR of 69.6% (n = 78; 95% CI: 60.2- 78.0) in 
Cohort A and 70.5% (n = 43; 95% CI: 57.4- 81.5) in Cohort B was observed with an estimated 
response duration of ≥ 12 months in most patients  with a response.  1-year OS rates in both cohorts 
were > 80%. Safety results were also consistent with findings in other similar studies. Given a 
median  follow up of  8.3 months  in Cohort A and 5.8 months in Cohort B, Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis 
occurred in 9 (8.0%) patients in Cohort A, and in 4 (5.5%) patients in Cohort B.29 
Collectively, the results from the NICOLAS, DETERRED, and Keynote 799 trials support the 
combination of nivolumab with CCRT in the CA20973L trial. 
3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Lung cancer has been the most common cancer in the world for several decades and the most 
common cause  of death from  cancer  worldwide. Non- small cell lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  represents 
approximately 80% to 85%  of all  lung  cancers  and 30%  of patients  present with  Stage  III disease. 
Standard treatment for patients  with a good performance  status and unresectable Stage  III NSCLC 
has been  definitive  chemoradiation. CCRT  as standard of care has a well-established  safety  profile. 
A meta -analysis of concurrent versus sequential chemoradiotherapy showed better  outcomes with 
concurrent therapy.9 
Durvalumab, an anti- PD-L1 agent, showed  an improvement in median  PFS and OS as maintenance 
therapy in patients who did not experience disease progression after CCRT.2 However, the 
majority of patients still experienced disease progression or death during the first two years of 
therapy (18-month PFS rate of 44.2%), and only 57% of patients  were  alive  at 3 years.4,12 Updated 
analyses  at 48  months further observed a decrease in PFS and OS with  an estimated  rate of 35.3% 
and 49.6%, respectively.3 Therefore,  further improvement in cure rate is needed, given this stage 
of disease is potentially curable. In addition, the PACIFIC trial only included patients in whom 
disease had not progressed after CCRT.  Mitigating  the risk of disease progression on or right after 
CCRT  represents another high unmet medical  need. Please refer  to the approved Product Label  for 
durvalumab for additional information.  
Clinical a nd  preclinical data have  shown the potential  for concurrent administration  of 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1 therapy with CCRT to improve clinical outcomes.5,12 Safety data from the 
NICOLAS trial provides evidence for the feasibility of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W given 
concurrently with CCRT, with no increased safety  risk.6,27,28 Furthermore, clinical evidence from 
CheckMate 227 supports the potential for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab 
maintenance therapy  to further improve the cure rate and overall treatment outcomes for patients 
with LA NSCLC.25 
Extensive details on the safety profile of nivolumab and ipilimumab are available in their 
respective Investigator Brochures and will not be repeated herein.  
Overall,  the safety  profile  of nivolumab monotherapy as well as in combination with ipilimumab 
is manageable and generally consistent  across completed  and ongoing clinical  trials  with no MTD

 reached  at any dose tested  up to 10 mg/kg. Most  AEs were  low-grade (Grade  1 to 2) with relatively 
few related high -grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level. 
A pattern  of immune -related adverse events has been defined, for which management algorithms 
for nivolumab and ipilimumab  have been  developed; these are provided in Appendix 6. Most  high- 
grade events were manageable with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy 
(endocrinopathies) as instructed in these algorithms.  
Additional details on the safety  profile  of nivolumab, including  results from other clinical  studies, 
are also available in the nivolumab IB. 
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) has given consideration regarding the benefit/risk of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccination during participation in BMS clinical trials of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab.  Based  on the review  of current available data and evidence to date,  knowledge of 
the mechanisms of action of  the COVID-19 vaccines and nivolumab or ipilimumab investigation 
[medicinal] products (IPs/IMPs), a biological or pharmacological interaction occurring between 
the vaccine and the IPs that would negatively impact the benefit/risk for participants in BMS clinical trials of nivolumab and ipilimumab is not expected; however, data will continue to be reviewed. Therefore, at this time, a COVID -19 vaccine given to participants in this trial is 
considered a concomitant medication with no interaction. 
Non-live COVID-19 vaccination is  considered  a simple  concomitant medication  within  the study. 
However,  the efficacy  and safety  of non-live vaccines (including non- live COVID-19 vaccines)  in 
participants receiving nivolumab or ipilimumab is unknown. 
To assure an ongoing favorable risks/benefit assessment for participants, an independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be utilized to monitor the safety and efficacy of treatments throughout the conduct of the trial. Furthermore,  quality  assurance for radiotherapy  will be in place 
to ensure adherence to the radiation plan.

5 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 Overall Design  
This is a multicenter, randomized, open -label, Phase 3 study to compare nivolumab plus CCRT 
followed  by nivolumab and  ipilimumab  combination (Arm A) or nivolumab plus CCRT  followed 
by nivolumab alone (Arm  B) with CCRT  followed  by durvalumab (Arm C) in previously untreated 
LA NSCLC.  The safety  and efficacy  of ipilimumab  added to nivolumab maintenance  therapy will 
also be characterized by evaluating Arm A vs Arm B descriptively.  
The study is  divided into a Screening  Period, a Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy  (CCRT) Period, a 
Recovery  Period, a Maintenance Period,  and a Long -term Follow-up Period.  The treatment period 
will contain a CCRT Period, a Recovery Period, and a Maintenance Period.  
Participants  will be randomized  (1:1:1) across 3 treatment  arms:  
• Arm  A: 
− CCRT  Period: Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (IV Q3W) for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy (total dose of 60 -66 Gy) for 
cycles 2 to 3  
− Maintenance Period: Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W) + ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV 
Q6W) for up to 12 months

of the CCRT  Period  (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic 
anticancer therapy (Cycle 2). All study procedures for Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 during the CCRT Period  are still to be followed. The Recovery  Period  will begin after the final dose of radiotherapy 
and the completion of Cycle  3 procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities.  An additional 
cycle of consolidation chemotherapy + nivolumab (Arms  A and B) or chemotherapy  alone 
(Arm C) will not be administered after the completion of radiotherapy in this situation. 
• Randomization will be stratified  by: 
• Age: 
− < 65 years 
− ≥ 65 years  
• T
umor PD-L1 status:  
− ≥ 1% 
− < 1% 
− indeterminate  or not evaluable  
• Stage  (per AJCC  8th edition):  
− IIIA 
− IIIB 
− IIIC 
 
The proportions of participants with indeterminate or not evaluable tumor PD -L1 status will be 
monitored and reassessed as needed to  ensure that the sample size in this stratum is adequate for 
analysis. Details will be described in the statistical analysis plan.

5.1.1 Screening Period  
Participants will provide written informed consent (ICF) to participate in the study before 
completing any protocol -specified procedures or evaluations not considered to be part of the 
participant’s standard care. After signing the ICF, participants will be evaluated for entry  criteria 
during the Screening Period within 28 days before randomization. Re -enrollment after screen 
failure will be allowed. Tumor imaging during Screening will include whole body PET/CT (including contrast) of the base of the skull through the upper thighs, within 28 days prior to randomization. PET component can be performed within 42 days prior to randomization. A separate contrast enhanced CT of chest, CT or MRI of upper abdomen  (including adrenal glands, 
and full liver),  and other suspected  sites of disease  is required if the CT component of the PET/CT 
is not of sufficient  diagnostic quality for RECIST  1.1 assessments.  Imaging  of the brain  with MRI 
(with  and without contrast)  is required of all participants  during Screening  within  28 days prior to

 randomization. CT of the brain (without and with contrast) can be performed if MRI is 
contraindicated or based on Investigator discretion. 
All participants  must have  tissue submitted  during screening. See Section 6.1 (Inclusion  Criteria) 
and Section  9.8 (Biomarkers) for specifications. Sufficient, recent tumor tissue  obtained within 
3 months prior to enrollment from a tumor lesion (formalin -fixed, paraffin- embedded block or 5 
to 10 unstained slides, obtained from core biopsy, excisional  biopsy or surgical specimen) will be 
submitted to the central laboratory along with an associated pathology report. Fine needle aspiration is unacceptable for submission. In order for the participants to be treated, the sample must be submitted to the central laboratory for the PD -L1 test, and the PD -L1 status must be 
available to IRT prior to randomization. PD -L1 testing will be performed using the validated 
Agilent/Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay.  Participants  should not have received  any local  or 
systemic anticancer therapy after the date that the submitted tumor tissue was obtained.  
Clinical TNM  staging  should be performed  per major guidelines (eg, ESMO,  NCCN).  Participants 
must be evaluated  by the site’s  multidisciplinary  team  (eg, medical  oncologist, surgeon, radiologist) 
during screening to assess the suitability of the participant for the study. 
Except for overt cT4 disease, nodal  status N2 or N3 must  be proven by biopsy in at least one N2 
or N3 node via endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS),  mediastinoscopy, or thoracoscopy. In addition, 
T3N1  status must be proven in  at least one N1 node (if lesion  amenable or medically  feasible)  via 
one of these modalities. See Appendix 8 for summary for recommendations for nodal GTV 
delineation.  
5.1.2 CCRT Period  
Participants in all arms will receive CCRT. Participants in Arm A and Arm B will receive the 
addition of nivolumab concurrently  with CCRT;  whereas participants  in Arm C will receive CCRT 
alone during the CCRT  Period. After randomization, participants  must commence systemic study 
treatments (chemotherapy ± nivolumab) within 7 days.  
Chemotherapy consists  of up to 3 cycles of platinum -based  doublet treatment,  administered  in 
3-week cycles (Cycles 1 to 3). Prior to randomization, the planned chemotherapy regimen, the 
planned number of cycles of chemotherapy (up to 2 cycles or up to 3 cycles), the planned dose level  of chemotherapy at the start  of treatment for agents with more  than 1 possible dose level  per 
protocol (e.g. carboplatin, paclitaxel), and the radiation modality must be pre -defined and 
documented in the IRT and medical records by the investigator. Please note that if the actual treatment regimen administered to the participant during the CCRT Period changes from the planned regimen  documented in  the IRT prior to randomization, the rationale  for the  change must 
also be recorded  in the case report form  (CRF)  and documented in the medical  record.  Participants 
with tumor of squamous histology will receive etoposide/cisplatin or paclitaxel/carboplatin. Participants with tumor of non -squamous histology will receive either etoposide/cisplatin, 
paclitaxel/carboplatin, or pemetrexed/cisplatin. If cisplatin cannot be tolerated, cisplatin may be replaced with carboplatin and the rationale must be documented in the CRF and medical record. If pemetrexed cannot be tolerated, pemetrexed may be replaced with etoposide and the rationale 
must be documented in the CRF  and medical  record. Recommended  dose modification  schedule

 (Section  7.4.5) should be followed; however, local  standards and clinical  judgment should be used 
for individual cases.  
Radiotherapy starts  on the first day of  Cycle 2 of chemotherapy and consists  of a target physical 
dose of 60-66 Gy  in 30-33 daily  fractions  of 2 Gy  (typically  on a 5 days on/2 days off schedule as 
appropriate, over 6-7 weeks)  by intensity -modulated radiation  therapy  (IMRT), 
volumetric -modulated arc therapy (VMAT),  or 3-dimentional RT (3DRT).  It is recommended  that 
radiotherapy be administered on the same day and after the completion of systemic anticancer 
therapy. If logistically infeasible,  a window of ± 3 days is  permitted.  In case the  administration  of 
systemic anticancer therapy must be delayed due to toxicity, radiotherapy must start ± 3 days of 
the start of systemic anticancer therapy in Cycle 2.  
If radiotherapy  planning is complete  prior to the initiation  of systemic anticancer  therapy  at Cycle  1 
of the CCRT  period (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone, and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic anticancer  therapy  (Cycle  2). All study procedures for Cycle  2 and Cycle  3 during the CCRT  period 
are still to be followed. An additional cycle of  consolidation systemic  anticancer therapy  will not 
be administered after the completion of radiotherapy in this situation.  
Sites must be equipped and qualified to deliver standard of care radiotherapy concurrent with systemic anticancer therapy. Radiotherapy  will be subject to a QA process. This will involve site 
qualification/credentialization and real time review of radiotherapy  plans with  real time feedback 
to sites. Upon completion of radiotherapy, all data must be submitted for final analysis. QA services will be provided by an external vendor who will  provide a separate radiotherapy manual 
to describe detailed radiotherapy requirements and QA processes.  
In Arm A and Arm B, nivolumab 360 mg IV Q3W  for up to 3 cycles  (Cycles  1 to 3) will be given 
concurrently to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, starting on the first day of each cycle and must be given prior to the administration  of chemotherapy. It is also recommended  that nivolumab 
be given prior to radiotherapy on the same day if logistically feasible.  
Every  e
ffort should be made  to continue radiotherapy  during the CCRT  Period  in an uninterrupted 
manner. In case of severe toxicities, such as high -grade esophagitis necessitating interruption of 
systemic anticancer therapy, radiotherapy may continue as appropriate provided the investigator believes supportive care will enable the participant to complete this part of therapy without excessive risk. Additional details are included in chemotherapy and radiotherapy toxicity management sections of the protocol  (Sections 7.4.5 and 7.6). Compliance will be documented in 
the eCRF.  
Participants who have confirmed disease progression by blinded independent central review (BICR)  during the CCRT Period will  be discontinued from the  treatment  and enter  the Follow-up 
Period. However, all study treatment decisions will be based on the investigator’s assessment of 
tumor images. In case of premature discontinuation of CCRT with reasons other than PD, as confirmed by BICR, continuation of the participant into the recovery period may be considered based on discussion with the Medical Monitor and Investigator.

 5.1.3 Recovery Period  
Recovery  Period  lasts approximately  3 weeks  up to 6 weeks from  the end of the CCRT  Period  (ie, 
last dose of radiotherapy). For participants who are recovering from toxicities associated with 
CCRT treatment, the first dose of maintenance immunotherapy may be delayed up to 6 weeks from the end of CCRT (ie, last dose of radiotherapy). If further delay (> 6 weeks) is needed, approval by medical monitor or designee is required to move on to the maintenance period, and this must be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
Tumor measurement imaging, safety evaluations, and other procedures should be performed 
approximately 3 weeks following the completion of CCRT (ie,  last dose of radiotherapy). Tumor 
imaging during the Recovery Period will be the first on -treatment scan for the study. Other 
examinations during the Recovery Period should be performed as close as possible to the 
anticipated commencement of maintenance immunotherapy. 
The maintenance immunotherapy begins when  the investigator determines  that the participant has 
recovered from the effects of the combined modality treatment sufficiently. For entry into the Maintenance Period, participants must meet all eligibility criteria detailed in Section 6.1.2. 
Participants receiving pemetrexed during  the CCRT Period should continue their scheduled folic 
acid until 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed or per local standard. 
Participants  who do not meet  any criteria  of initiating  maintenance immunotherapy should proceed 
to the Follow-up Period. 
5.1.4 Maintenance Period  
Maintenance Period lasts for up to 12 months of treatment for Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C. The 
first dosing in maintenance can be initiated  within  2 weeks from the end of CCRT  (ie, last dose of 
radiotherapy) but  no less than 18 days from the previous dosing  of nivolumab  (Arm  A and B) and 
should be given within 3 calendar days from completion of the last visit in the Recovery Period provided eligibility criteria are met.  
Maintenance Period of  the study consists of multiple  treatment cycles with associated  evaluations 
and procedures specified  in Table  2-5, Table  2-6, and Table  2-7. One cycle  of treatment  is defined 
as 6 weeks for Arm A, as 4 weeks for Arm B, or as 2 weeks for Arm C. Every effort should be made to schedule visits within the protocol-specified windows. 
Contrast enhanced  CT of chest,  CT or MRI  of upper abdomen (including adrenal  glands, full liver), 
and other suspected  sites of disease should be performed  24 weeks (± 7 days)  from randomization, 
then every  12 weeks (±7  days) during treatment  according  to Table  2
-5, Table  2-6, and Table  2-7. 
Tumor imaging should be submitted to BICR on an ongoing basis. In the case of  PD as assessed 
by the investigator (per RECIST 1.1), the images and any associated documentation should be submitted to BICR for independent review of progression. Tumor assessment imaging should continue per protocol schedule and be submitted  to BICR until progression is confirmed  by BICR, 
regardless of the start of subsequent anticancer therapies. Furthermore, if the PD is assessed as locoregional progression (i.e. still within the thorax) by the Investigator, imaging must continue

the Sponsor.  according to the protocol schedule until distant metastasis is assessed by the Investigator (per 
RECIST 1.1). These images do not need to be submitted to BICR for review. 
Participants will be treated until Investigator -assessed disease progression, death, unacceptable 
toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, the Investigator’s decision to discontinue treatment, 
withdrawal of consent on further treatment,  lost to follow -up, BMS  decision  to terminate  the study, 
or completion  of required treatment  in the Maintenance Period. Additional assessments  may occur 
when the decision is made to discontinue treatment. 
In certain circumstances, participants with PD per RECIST  1.1, but with otherwise stable or 
improved performance and clinical status, may continue to be treated in the event  of a perceived 
benefit per Investigator; see Section 8.1.6 for treatment beyond progression criteria.  
Participants  who cannot  complete  planned maintenance  therapy  should enter  the Follow -up Period.  
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all participants on treatment in the CCRT Period, Recovery Period, or Maintenance Period, if applicable. At the time of this request, each participant will be contacted to determine his/her survival status unless the participant has withdrawn consent for all contact.  
5.1.5 Follow Up Period  
Long- term follow-up should continue until withdrawal of consent,  death, or study termination  by 
Timing  for long- term follow -up will be as follows: 
Assessments  should continue as described  in Table  2-8. 
Safety  Follow  up: Participants  must be followed for safety  for at least 100 days after the last dose 
of study treatment.  Safety  Follow-up Visit 1 should occur 30 days from the last dose (± 7 days). If 
participant  delays treatment  and later discontinues treatment  > 42 days from the last treatment,  the 
Safety  Follow -up Visit 1 may be performed at time of discontinuation. Safety Follow -up Visit 2 
occurs approximately 100 days (± 7 days) from the last dose of study treatment. Both follow -up 
visits  should be conducted in person. If the participant discontinues study treatment  for a clinically 
significant  AE, the participant will be followed  until resolution  of the AE or the event is considered 
to be stable and/or chronic. 
Survival Follow Up : Post the Safety Follow up, all participants will be contacted for survival 
every 3 months (± 14 days), by visit (if due for tumor assessments) or phone contact by 
Investigator’s discretion. BMS may request that survival data be collected on all treated participants  outside of  the 3 month specified  window.  At the time of this request,  each  participant 
will be contacted  to determine  his/her survival status  unless the participant has withdrawn  consent 
for all contact. Tumor assessments should be performed as  outlined in Table 2 -8
 . Information on 
the subsequent PD, subsequent anticancer  therapy,  and outcome must be collected.  Subsequent PD 
assessment  takes participant status  at the initial PD as re-baseline,  is defined per local standard

 practice,  and may entail  radiological PD, clinical  PD, or other. In addition, outcome measures will 
be collected based on Section 9.1.2. 
5.1.6 Optional  Retreatment  during Follow -up Period in Arm A and Arm B 
After completing 12 months of Maintenance Period treatment, retreatment is allowed for 
participants in Arm A and Arm B. Participants must have entered the Follow -up Period with 
ongoing disease control (CR, PR, or SD) and without history of treatment beyond progression. After BICR -confirmed PD during the Follow -up Period and at the discretion of  the investigator, 
participants  will be treated  with the same  maintenance dose and schedule from  randomization. For 
Arm A, participants may be retreated with only nivolumab, if ipilimumab was not tolerated. Ipilimumab  monotherapy is not allowed  during retreatment.  The maximum duration of retreatment 
is up to 1 year and retreatment is allowed only  one time for both Arm A and Arm B.  
Before  retreatment,  
• participants  must not meet  dose delay  criteria  for nivolumab (see Section  7.4.1) or ipilimumab 
(see Section 7.4.2).  
• participants  must not have been  treated  with any anticancer  therapy during the Follow -up 
Period.  
• participants  must not have clinical conditions that require  urgent medical  interventions.  
• participants  must be re-consented before  initiation  of retreatment.  
 
At retreatment,  
• participants must have a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days before the first dose of 
retreatment.  
• participants will have tumor assessments every 12 weeks (± 7 days) from BICR confirmed 
initial disease progression (starting  from  date of scan).  Scans during the Retreatment  Period  do 
not need to be submitted to BICR. The assessment  of PD during the Retreatment Period will 
be per investigator’s assessment using RECIST 1.1.  
• participants without Investigator -assessed distant metastases must continue tumor imaging 
during the Retreatment Period until metastasis is assessed by the Investigator.  
• participants will follow study procedures outlined in Table 2 -9 (Arm A) and in Table 2 -10 
(Arm B).  
 
Participants who complete or discontinue retreatment must complete assessments for Safety 
Follow-up Visit 1, Safety Follow-up Visit 2, and Survival Follow- up (see Table 2 -8). 
5.1.7 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees  
5.1.7.1 Data Monitoring Committee  
A Data Monitoring Committee has been established to provide oversight of safety and efficacy considerations in protocol  CA20973L and to provide advice to the Sponsor regarding actions the 
committee  deems  necessary  for the continued protection  of participants  enrolled  in the study. The 
DMC will be charged  with assessing such actions  in light of an acceptable benefit/risk profile for

 nivolumab given concurrently with CCRT as well as in combination with ipilimumab. The DMC 
will act in an advisory capacity to BMS and will monitor participant safety and evaluate the 
available efficacy data for the study. The oncology therapeutic area of BMS has primary responsibility for design and conduct of the study. 
When  required, adjudicated events  will be submitted  to the DMC  and Health  Authorities for  review 
on a specified timeframe in accordance with the adjudication documentation. 
Additional details concerning DMC oversight are provided in the DMC charter.  
5.1.8 Radiotherapy Quality  Assurance and Quality  Control  
A designated vendor will credentialize sites including the use of  a mock case prior to enrollment 
of the first participant at each site. Furthermore, the vendor will perform real -time review of the 
radiation plan for the first enrolled participant and provide feedback to the site within 3 days. 
Treatment  will not be delayed, but adjustment  of radiation  plan may be made  as a result  of quality 
review.  All participants  will have their radiation  plans  and actual  delivery reviewed  for the purpose 
of measuring  compliance to protocolled radiation  prescription.  The RT quality  assurance (QA)  and 
quality control (QC) data submission requirements and protocol compliance criteria are detailed in the RT QA & QC manual.  
5.2 Number of Participants 
It is expected  that approximately  1400 participants will be screened  in order to randomize 
888 participants with previously untreated locally advanced NSCLC, assuming a screen failure 
rate of approximately 40%. Participants  will be randomized (1:1:1) into 1  of the 3 treatment  arms 
(Section 5.1 ). 
5.3 End of Study Definition  
The start  of the trial is  defined as the first participant’s  first visit.  End of trial is  defined as the last 
participant’s last study visit or last survival assessment/confirmation. The total duration of the study is up to 5 years from randomization of the last participant, or until the time of final OS 
analysis, whichever occurs later.  
5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
5.4.1 Rationale for Study Population and Study Comparator  
This study will evaluate the potential for CCRT  + nivolumab followed by nivolumab with/without 
ipilimumab to improve treatment outcomes compared with CCRT followed by durvalumab for participants with previously untreated, locally advanced Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC NSCLC. Participants will be enrolled if their NSCLC is amenable to treatment with definitive CCRT. Participants who are not planned for potential curative surgical resection will be eligible. Please refer to Section 6.1 for detailed eligibility requirements.  
Durvalumab, an anti- PD-L1 agent, showed an improvement in median  PFS and OS as maintenance 
therapy in patients who did not experience disease progression after CCRT (PACIFIC trial).
2 
CCRT followed by durvalumab is becoming the new standard of care. However, the majority  of 
patients  still experienced disease progression or death  during the first two years of therapy 
Clinical  Protocol

 (18-month  PFS rate of 44.2%), and only 57% of patients  were  alive  at 3 years.4,12 Updated analyses 
at 48 months further observed a decrease in PFS and OS with an estimated rate of 35.3% and 
49.6%, respectively.3 Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed, given this stage of  disease 
is potentially curable. In addition, the PACIFIC study only included patients whose disease had 
not progressed after CCRT. Mitigating the risk of disease progression on or right after CCRT 
represents another high unmet medical need.  
5.4.2 Rationale of Combining Nivolumab with CCRT  
Clinical evidence suggests that  the combination of checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy  may be 
beneficial. In a secondary analysis of KEYNOTE -001, a phase I trial of  pembrolizumab, patients 
who received radiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab experienced significantly longer 
progression- free survival and overall survival than  did those who had not undergone radiotherapy 
before anti-PD-1 therapy.30 Mechanistically,  radiation,  acting  as an in-situ tumor vaccine,  releases 
tumor antigens and helps  their presentation  to dendritic  cells,  thus, modulating  the immune  system 
and helping to mount an immune  response against  the tumor.31 Radiation  also provides a pro- 
immunogenic effect on the tumor microenvironment.32 Consistently, radiotherapy led to PD -L1 
upregulation in tumor cells which was observed in a mouse model, as well as in patients.5,33 This 
upregulation of PD-L1 was mediated  by interferon  gamma  produced by CD8+  T cell blockade of 
PD-1/PD -L1, which  enhanced the efficacy  of radiotherapy.  
Similarly, chemotherapy may modulate the tumor/immune system interaction in favor of the 
immune system. Chemotherapy can result in tumor cell death with a resultant increase in tumor antigen delivery to antigen- presenting cells. Tumor cell death may also lead to a reduction in 
soluble and membrane -bound factors inhibiting tumor- infiltrating  T-cells.  Chemotherapy may also 
disrupt immune system regulatory networks by decreasing numbers of T -regulatory cells. 
Consistently, chemotherapy may induce PD -L1 expression, which relates to cancer 
immunoresistance.
34 
Taken together, combining PD -1/PD -L1 blockade with chemoradiation has the potential to 
orchestrate multi- dimensional anti -tumor activities and maintain a pro -immunogenic tumor 
microenvironment, to improve clinical outcomes in untreated stage III NSCLC.  
5.4.3 Rationale of Incorporating Ipilimumab into Radiotherapy- based 
Strategy  
Supportive evidence of incorporating ipilimumab into a radiotherapy -ba sed approach mainly 
comes from the metastatic, refractory, and palliative settings. Abscopal effect (ie, anti -tumor 
effects that occur outside the radiation field) was first described in 195335 and before the advent 
of immunotherapy. Recently, an anecdotal case of a durable complete abscopal response to 
palliative  radiotherapy and ipilimumab  in a patient with metastatic  NSCLC was reported.36 Similar  
clinical findings continue to accumulate in NSCLC and other tumor types.  37 Data from a 
prospective phase 2 trial to evaluate radiotherapy and ipilimumab in chemo- refractory metastatic 
NSCLC indicate an ORR of 18% (7/39) with 2 CR, in addition, 5 patients had SD, leading to a 
DCR  of 31%. At median  follow-up of 43 months,  median  OS was 7.4 months for the entire  cohort,

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 whereas it was 20.4 months for participants who achieved disease control.38 Thus, incorporating 
ipilimumab into radiotherapy -based treatment may also improve outcomes in earlier stages of 
disease (such as, untreated locally advanced NSCLC).  
5.4.4 Rationale of Concurrent  Scheduling of Nivolumab with CCRT  
The optimal schedule for combining checkpoint blockade and chemoradiation  is still unknown. In 
the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab was given after the completion of CCRT. In subgroup analyses, 
more  pronounced improvement in median  PFS was seen in patients  randomized  within  14 days of 
the last radiation dose than in those randomized later, suggesting that initiating PD -1/PD -L1 
blockade closer to CCRT may be beneficial.  
In a mouse model, different combination schedules were assessed. It was observed that initiating 
PD-1/PD -L1 blockade during radiotherapy lead to longer survival times,  whereas starting 
PD-1/PD -L1 blockade 7 days after  the completion  of radiotherapy  yielded similar  survival  results 
when compared with radiotherapy alone.5 This might be due to an acute increase in PD -L1 
expression on  tumor cells  during radiotherapy; ineffective  PD-1/PD -L1 blockade when  given in a 
delayed manner might be explained by the deletion or anergy of tumor- reactive CD8+ cells.  
Safety and tolerability may be of concern when further intensifying CCRT by adding 
immunotherapy. Data from the phase 2 NICOLAS study, designed to evaluate the safety and 
feasibility  of nivolumab given concurrently with CCRT, demonstrated that  this combination was 
well tolerated. Results showed no major increase in prohibitive toxicity including pneumonitis.24 
Two phase 2 trials combining atezolizumab and pembrolizumab, respectively, concurrently with 
chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC also suggested that PD -L1 blockade given 
concurrently with chemoradiation was feasible and safe.7,29 
Therefore, concurrent scheduling of nivolumab with CCRT may offer enhanced efficacy with an 
acceptable toxicity profile.  
5.4.5 Rationale of Duration of Maintenance Therapy  
Durvalumab, the control treatment in the CA20973L trial, was approved for 1 year of therapy following CCRT and is becoming the new standard of care. Therefore, a 1- year maintenance 
duration is opted for in all study arms in the CA20973L trial. Nivolumab (with or without ipilimumab)  will be administered  for a duration of up to 1 year in alignment with  the comparator, 
durvalumab.  
5.4.6 Rationale of Backbone CCRT  
The standard dose -fractionation of  radiation in unresectable stage III NSCLC is 60 -66 Gy, given 
in fractions of 2 Gy once per day over 30-33 days during definitive CCRT. 
The ideal  concurrent chemotherapy regimen  has not been  determined. The most common regimens 
are cisplatin/etoposide and carboplatin/paclitaxel in ASCO endorsed ASTRO recommendation, 
whereas in ESMO recommendation, cisplatin/etoposide and cisplatin/vinca alkaloid were 
cited.

 In the PROCLAIM trial in which pemetrexed/cisplatin was compared with  etoposide/cisplatin in 
the context of concurrent chemoradiation, pemetrexed/cisplatin  failed  to show an  improvement in 
OS; however, high grade drug related  toxicities  were  less with pemetrexed/cisplatin.10 In addition, 
the ongoing phase 2 NICOLAS trial suggested that nivolumab given concurrently with CCRT 
containing cisplatin/etoposide, cisplatin/vinorelbine,  or cisplatin/pemetrexed was well tolerated.6 
A phase 2 trial combining atezolizumab concurrently with chemoradiation with carboplatin/paclitaxel  as the chemotherapy component in locally  advanced  NSCLC also suggested 
that PD -L1 blockade given concurrently with chemoradiation was feasible and safe.
7 Similar 
findings were also obtained from a phase 2 trial with pembrolizumab given concurrently with chemoradiation using carboplatin/paclitaxel  (Cohort A) or cisplatin/pemetrexed  (Cohort B) as the 
chemotherapy component ( Section  3.2.4).
29 Therefore, cisplatin/etoposide,  carboplatin/paclitaxel, 
and cisplatin/pemetrexed have been selected as concurrent chemotherapy options for the 
CA20973L trial. 
Chemotherapy is generally  given in 2 to 4 cycles and up to 3 cycles in the phase 2 NICOLAS  trial. 
In the CA20973L trial, systemic therapy (chemotherapy ± nivolumab)  will start at Cycle 1 in the 
CCRT Period and be administered for up to 3 cycles (Cycles 1 to 3). Radiotherapy will start at 
Cycle  2 and be administered  for Cycles 2 to 3. However,  if radiotherapy  planning is complete  prior 
to the initiation of systemic treatment at Cycle 1 of the CCRT period (Arms A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle 1 of  systemic therapy  alone, and initiate treatment with 
radiotherapy  concurrently with systemic therapy (Cycle 2). All study  procedures for Cycle 2 and 
Cycle  3 during the CCRT  period are still to  be followed.  There is no clinical evidence supporting  
further consolidation therapy, 
41 and as such, an additional cycle of consolidation systemic 
anticancer therapy will not be administered after the completion of radiotherapy if Cycle 1 is 
skipped.  
5.4.7 Rationale for Open- Label Design  
Immune related toxicities require early recognition and prompt intervention with special management algorithms.  Furthermore,  PFS and other key tumor response- based  endpoints will be 
assessed by BICR and OS assessment is an objective. Therefore, an open -label design is not 
expected to introduce bias in this trial. 
5.5 Justification for Dose  
5.5.1 Justification for Dosing Regimen of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab monotherapy was originally  approved as a body-weight based  dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W, 
and was updated to 240 mg Q2W  or 480 mg Q4W  in multiple  indications.
42,43 Nivolumab  360 mg 
Q3W is also under evaluation in monotherapy and in combination therapy studies. Less frequent 
360 mg Q3W and 480 mg Q4W dosing regimens can reduce the burden to patients of frequent, 
lengthy IV treatments and allow combination of nivolumab with other agents using alternative 
dosing regimens. 
The benefit -risk profiles of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, 360 mg Q3W, and 480 mg Q4W are 
predicted  to be comparable to 3 mg/kg Q2W.  This assessment  is based  on a comprehensive 
Clinical  Protocol

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 characterization of nivolumab PK, safety, efficacy, and exposure -response relationships across 
indications. Population PK (PPK) analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with 
proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no clinically  meaningful differences 
in PK across ethnicities and tumor types were observed. Using the PPK model, the exposures following  administration  of several  dosing regimens of nivolumab administered  as a flat dose were 
simulated,  including 240 mg Q2W,  360 mg Q3W,  and 480 mg Q4W.  The simulated  average serum 
concentration at steady state following administration of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and 480 mg Q4W  are predicted  to be similar to those following  administration  of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W  and 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W administered to patients over a wide body weight range (34- 180 kg) 
across tumor types.  
Extensive exposure -response (E -R) analyses of multiple PK measures (maximum serum 
concentration at Day 1, average serum concentration at Day 28 [Cavg28], and trough serum concentration  at Day 28)  and efficacy  and safety  endpoints indicated  that the efficacy  of the 
flat-dose 480 mg IV regimen are similar to that of 3 mg/kg Q2W IV regimen. In E -R efficacy 
analyses for OS and ORR conducted in melanoma, RCC, and NSCLC using Cavg28 as the exposure measure, probabilities of achieving a response and survival probabilities at 1 year and 
2 years for IV 480 mg Q4W were similar to that of IV 3 mg/kg Q2W. In E -R safety  analyses, it 
was demonstrated that the exposure margins for safety are maintained following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, and the predicted risks of discontinuations due to AEs or death, AE Grade ≥ 3, and immune -mediated  AEs (IMAEs)  Grade  ≥ 2 are similar  following nivolumab  480 mg Q4W relative 
to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W across tumor types. In addition, nivolumab exposures with 240 mg Q2W,  360 mg Q3W, and 480 mg Q4W flat -dose IV regimens across tumor types are maintained 
well below the corresponding exposures observed with the well-tolerated  10 mg/kg IV nivolumab 
Q2W dose regimen. 
5.5.2 Justification for Dosing Regimen of  Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab  
The phase 2 CA209568 study had a safety lead -in phase which evaluated the safe dosing level of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab plus platinum -based doublet chemotherapy, which is applied in the 
CA2099LA treatment arm. In CA209568, participants received  nivolumab 360 mg every  3 weeks 
and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg  every  6 weeks combined with 2 cycles of platinum -based  chemotherapy, 
followed by nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
The safety  lead-in phase  of CA209568 treated  36 participants  with a minimum follow-up of 
11 weeks (longest follow -up of  9 months, median follow -up of  4.7 months). There was 1 case of 
dose limiting toxicities  (DLTs)  as defined by hepatic enzyme elevation. No safety  concerns were 
observed with ongoing monitoring (DBL: July, 2018). In August 2017, the independent DMC 
recommended  to initiate  CA2099LA based  of the evaluation of safety  data from study CA209568, 
where the same dosing regimen was investigated.  
Moreover, and in addition to the regular monitoring of the CA2099LA study, the independent 
D
MC had an early review of the safety data after 15 patients were treated with nivolumab and 
ipilimumab  combined with platinum -based  doublet chemotherapy with at least 9 weeks of follow -

 up. As planned in the CA2099LA DMC Charter, the independent DMC reviewed the safety data 
during the first safety  review meeting in May 2018 and recommended the study to continue with 
no modification. As of March 2019, 361 patients were randomized in the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab treatment arm (with 2 cycles of histology -based platinum doublet chemotherapy) in 
the CA2099LA study. 
In CA209568 and CA2099LA trials, nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
every 6 weeks combined with  2 cycles of  platinum- based chemotherapy, which was followed by 
nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, has been tolerated. 
Therefore, the CA20973L study using this same IO combination (nivolumab 360 mg Q3W + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q6W)  without chemotherapy should have a less toxic  profile  and thus should 
be tolerated. Additionally, safety will be regularly monitored by independent DMC review throughout the CA20973L trial.

is required  to move on to the maintenance period, and this must  be documented in the participant’s 
medical record.  
Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of the study 
participants and that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that participants fully 
meet all eligibility criteria.  
6.3 Lifestyle Restrictions  
During the CCRT Period, esophageal complaints are common with combined modality therapy. Esophagitis does not constitute a reason to interrupt or delay radiotherapy or chemotherapy provided oral intake is sufficient to maintain hydration. Participants should be advised to avoid alcoholic, acidic, or spicy foods or beverages. 
6.4 Screen Failures  
Screen  failures  are defined  as participants  who  consent to  participate  in the clinical study but who 
are not subsequently randomized in the study/included in the analysis population. A minimal set 
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, as applicable, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes date of consent, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs.  
6.4.1 Retesting During Screening Period  
Participant Re -enrollment: This study permits the re -enrollment of a participant that has 
discontinued the study as a pre- treatment  failure  (ie, participant  has not been  randomized / has not 
been treated). If re -enrolled, the participant must be re -consented and assigned a new participant 
number from IRT.  
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening Period will be permitted (in addition to any  parameters that require a confirmatory value).  
The most current result prior to Randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be 
assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current clinical state.

Testing  for asymptomatic  SARS -CoV-2 infection,  for example  by reverse  transcription  (RT) -PCR 
or viral  antigen is not required. However, some participants may develop suspected or confirmed 
symptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 infection or be discovered to have asymptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 
infection during the screening period. In such cases, participants may be considered eligible for the study after meeting  all inclusion/exclusion criteria  related  to active  infection, and after meeting 
the following criteria:  
• At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical  illness)  have passed  since symptoms first appeared 
or positive RT -PCR or viral antigen test result, and  
• At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications, 
and 
• Acute  symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath)  have resolved  and 
• In the opinion of the investigator,  there  are no COVID-19- related  sequelae  that may place the 
participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment, and  
• Negative follow -up SARS- CoV-2 RT-PCR or viral antigen test based on institutional, local, 
or regional guidelines 
 
7 TREATMENT  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo or medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study randomization or treatment allocation. 
Study  treatment  includes   both   Investigational   [Medicinal]  Product   (IP/IMP)  and 
Non-investigational [Medicinal] Product (Non -IP/Non -IMP) and can consist of the following: 
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceutical  form of an active substance or placebo being tested  or used as a reference 
in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 7.1.1 Nivolumab Dosing  
In Arm A and Arm B during CCRT Period , pa rticipants should receive nivolumab at a dose of 
360 mg over an approximately 30 ( ± 5) minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle up to 
3 cycles and prior to the administration of chemotherapy. If needed, flush the IV line with an 
appropriate amount of diluent (eg, 0.9%  Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose in water)  to ensure that 
the complete dose is administered  over approximately 30 minutes. Participants  may be dosed Q3W  
± 3 days. See Section  7.4.5 for timing  of chemotherapy dosing in case of dose delay  of nivolumab. 
Participants may  be dosed  no less than 18 days from  the previous dose of nivolumab during Q3W 
cycles. See Section 7.1.5 for option to skip cycle 1 of nivolumab + chemotherapy alone if RT 
planning is completed prior to the first dose at Cycle 1. 
In Ar m  A Maintenance Period , participants  should receive nivolumab  at a dose of 360 mg over an 
approximately 30 ( ± 5) minute infusion followed by ipilimumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg over an 
approximately 30 (± 5) minute infusion on Day 1 of every cycle (Q6W cycles). In addition, 
nivolumab will be administered on Day 22 of every cycle, at a dose of 360 mg over an approximately 30 (± 5) minute infusion. Treatment will continue until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of approximately 12 months of 
treatment, or the study  ends, whichever occurs first. Participants may  be dosed  Q3W ± 3 days  for 
nivolumab. When  study treatments  nivolumab and ipilimumab  are to be administered  on the same 
day, nivolumab is to be administered first. Nivolumab infusion must be promptly followed by a 
flush  of diluent to clear  the line of nivolumab before starting  the ipilimumab  infusion. The second 
infusion will always be the ipilimumab study treatment and will start after the infusion line has been  flushed,  filters  changed,  and participant has been  observed  to ensure no infusion reaction  has 
occurred.  
There  
 will be no dose  escalations or  reductions of  nivolumab or ipilimumab  allowed. Participants 
may be dosed no less than 18 days from  the previous dose of nivolumab during Q3W  cycles.  When 
dose is  delayed, see Section  7.4.4 for rules  of rescheduling. Premedications  are not recommended 
for the first dose of nivolumab.  
In Ar m  B Maintenance Period , participants should receive  nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg over an 
approximately 30 ( ± 5) minute infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle until progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of approximately 12 months of treatment,  or the study ends, whichever occurs first. If needed,  flush  the IV line with an appropriate 
amount of diluent (eg, 0.9%  Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose  in water)  to ensure that the complete 
dose is administered  over approximately 30 minutes.  Participants  may be dosed Q4W  ± 3 days for 
nivolumab.  
There  w
ill be  no dose  escalations or reductions of  nivolumab allowed. Participants may be dosed 
no less than 25 days from the previous  dose of nivolumab during Q4W  cycles.  Premedications are 
not recommended for the first dose of nivolumab. 
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions during nivolumab and/or 
ipilimumab  administration.  If an acute infusion reaction is noted, participants  should be managed 
according to Section 7.4.4.2.

 Doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on 
how well the participant tolerates the treatment.  
Please refer to the current IB and/or Pharmacy Manual for further details regarding storage, 
preparation, and administration of nivolumab. 
Care must  be taken  to assure sterility  of the prepared solution  as the product does not contain any 
antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent.  
In Arm A  and Arm  B, participants may be retreated with nivolumab after completing 12  months 
of treatment during the Maintenance Period, if the participant has achieved disease control (CR, 
PR, or SD) and subsequently progresses. See Section 5.1.6. 
7.1.2 Ipilimumab Dosing  
In Ar m  A Maintenance Period , after the infusion  of nivolumab, the infusion line should be flushed 
and the filters changed. Participants should then receive ipilimumab 1 mg/kg over an 
approximately 30 (± 5) minute infusion IV every 6 weeks (Q6W) starting on Day  1. Participants 
will be dosed Q3W ±  3 days for nivolumab and Q6W ± 3 days for ipilimumab. Treatment will 
continue until confirmed  progression, unacceptable toxicity,  withdrawal of consent, completion  of 
approximately 12 months of treatment,  discontinuation of nivolumab, or the study ends, whichever 
occurs first.  
Ipilimumab dosing calculations should be based on the body w eight. Dosing calculations should 
be based  on the body weight assessed  on C1D1  in Maintenance.  It is not necessary  to re-calculate 
subsequent doses if  the participant  weight is within 10% of the baseline weight. All  doses should 
be rounded to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose modifications allowed. Participants 
may be dosed no less than 37 days from the previous dose of ipilimumab. 
Ipilimumab  is not permitted  to continue  on study after nivolumab  is discontinued. The assessment 
for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the assessment made for 
discontinuation of ipilimumab. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab 
may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued.  
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions during ipilimumab administration.  If an acute infusion reaction  is noted, participants  should be managed  according  to 
Section 7.4.4.2. 
Doses of ipilimumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the 
participant tolerates the treatment. Dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed. 
Use separate  infusion bags and filters  when  administering  nivolumab and ipilimumab  on the same 
day. 
For details regarding ipilimumab storage, preparation, and administration, please refer to the 
current IB and/or Pharmacy Manual.

control (CR, PR,  or SD) and subsequently progresses. Ipilimumab monotherapy is not permitted. 
See Section 5.1.6. 
7.1.3 Durvalumab Dosing 
In Arm C Maintenance Period , participants  should receive durvalumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a 
60 (±  5) minute infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle until confirmed progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of approximately 12 months of 
treatment, or the study ends, whichever occurs first.  
There  w ill be no dose escalations or reductions of durvalumab allowed. Participants  may be dosed 
Q2W ± 3 days. Premedications are not recommended for the first dose of durvalumab.  
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions during durvalumab 
administration.  If an acute infusion reaction  is noted, participants  should be managed  according  to 
the local durvalumab prescribing information.  
Doses of durvalumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the 
participant tolerates the treatment.  Dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed. Please refer to the 
approved local Product Label for durvalumab for additional information.  
7.1.4 Chemotherapy Dosing  
During the CCRT Period, participants will be given chemotherapy for up to 3 cycles, with each 
cycle lasting 3  weeks. See Section 7.1.5 for option to skip cycle 1 of chemotherapy ± nivolumab 
alone if RT planning is completed prior to the first dose of therapy at Cycle 1. While etoposide/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin are applicable to any histology, participants with tumor of  non-squamous histology have an additional  option which  is pemetrexed/cisplatin. In the 
case cisplatin  cannot be given (eg, poor tolerability),  carboplatin can replace cisplatin.  The reasons 
must be recorded in the eCRF  and medical  record. In the case pemetrexed  cannot be given 
(eg, poor tolerability), etoposide can replace pemetrexed. The reasons must be recorded in the eCRF and medical record.  
7.1.4.1 Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Dosing  
Each  cycle of paclitaxel  + carboplatin will last for 3 weeks.  Treatment  with paclitaxel  and 
carboplatin will be administered as follows for Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and Cycle 3: 
• Cycle  1; Day 1: carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 + paclitaxel  175 or 200 mg/m
2 
• Cycle  2 and Cycle  3; Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15: carboplatin  AUC 2 + paclitaxel  45 or 50 mg/m2 
 
Days  8 and 15 may be interrupted,  delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the participant 
tolerates the  treatment and per investigator’s discretion. The carboplatin dose must be calculated 
according to Calvert formula. When calculating creatinine clearance (CrCl), the formula of 
Cockcroft-Gault (see below) should be used or per local standard:

min 72 × serum creatinine (mg) 
dL 
 
Carboplatin doses (AUC  2 or AUC  5 or 6) will be administered  IV over approximately 30 minutes 
(or per local standard).  
Paclitaxel  doses of 175 or 200 mg/m2 will be administered  IV over approximately  180 minutes  (or 
per local  standard). Paclitaxel  doses of 45 or 50 mg/ m2 will be administered  IV over approximately 
60 minutes (or per local standard).  
7.1.4.2 Etoposide/cisplatin  
Each cycle of etoposide + cisplatin will last for 3 weeks. Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV will be 
administered  over approximately 60 minutes (or per local  standard) on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 
of each cycle. Days 2 and 3 may be interrupted,  delayed, or discontinued  depending on how well 
the participant tolerates the treatment and per investigator’s discretion. Cisplatin will be 
administered at a dose of 80 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle. Recommended infusion time is 
approximately 60 minutes (or per local standard).  
7.1.4.3 Pemetrexed/cisplatin  
Each  cycle of pemetrexed  + cisplatin  will last for 3 weeks.  Participants  will receive  pemetrexed  at 
a dose of 500 mg/m2 as a 10- minute  IV infusion (or per local standard) on Day 1 with  cisplatin  at 
a dose of 75 mg/m2 as a 60 -minute (or per local standard) IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Pemetrexed should be infused before cisplatin on Day 1 of a cycle. 
Pre-medications  for use with pemetrexed  are as follows:  
• Oral corticosteroid should be given according to local standards at a dose equivalent to 
dexamethasone 4 mg BID on the day prior to, the day  of, and the day after the administration 
of pemetrexed.  
• Daily oral folic acid 350 mcg to 1000 mcg should be given starting 1 week prior to the first dose of pemetrexed, with at least 5 doses of folic acid administered in the 7 days prior to the 
first dose. Oral folic acid should be continued daily  throughout the treatment  with pemetrexed 
and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. 
• Intramuscular (IM) injection of vitamin B12 1000 mcg should be given approximately one 
week prior to the first dose of pemetrexed. 
• Participants with non -squamous histology may begin folic acid and vitamin B12 prior to 
randomization in anticipation of administration of pemetrexed  
• Antiemetic  premedication  may be given  per local  standard.  
 
7.1.4.4 Carboplatin Dosing (with  Etoposide or Pemetrexed)  
In the event  that carboplatin  is administered  instead  of cisplatin  with etoposide or pemetrexed, the 
reasons are to be documented in CRF as well as in medical  record. Carboplatin at AUC 5 will be

 given as a 30- minute (or per local standard) IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3 week cycle during 
CCRT. Carboplatin dose must be calculated according to Calvert formula. When calculating 
creatinine clearance (CrCl), the formula of Cockcroft -Gault should be used or per local standard.  
7.1.4.5 Premedication 
Antiemetic premedication will be administered according to local standards. Recommended antiemetic  treatments  are dexamethasone (dosing according  to local  standards; an equivalent dose 
of another corticosteroid may be substituted) and a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist (type per 
investigator discretion and local standards -of-care). Additional use of antiemetic premedications 
may be employed at the discretion  of the Investigator. Doses of chemotherapy may be interrupted, 
delayed, reduced, or discontinued depending on how well the participant tolerates the treatment. See the following sections for more details: Section 7.4  (dose delays) and Section 8 (dose 
discontinuations).  
Pre- and post -hydration for cisplatin should be administered per institutional protocol or per the 
following recommendation: Pre -treatment hydration of 1 to 2 liters of fluid infused IV prior to 
cisplatin  infusion; Adequate hydration and urinary  output must  be maintained  for at least 24 hours 
following  cisplatin  administration.  Use of mannitol following  the cisplatin  infusion is allowed  per 
local standard. 
7.1.5 Radiotherapy Planning and Delivery  
Each  participant will receive  thoracic  radiotherapy  in form of IMRT,  VMAT,  or 3DRT.  Irradiation 
commences on D1 of Cycle 2 of systemic anticancer therapy (chemotherapy ± nivolumab) and 
will be delivered  5 days per week  in once daily  fraction,  2 Gy per fraction,  to a target  dose of 60-66 
Gy in 30-33 fractions. 
If radiotherapy  planning is complete prior to the initiation  of systemic anticancer  therapy  at Cycle  1 
of the CCRT  period (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone, and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic 
anticancer  therapy  (Cycle  2). All study procedures for Cycle  2 and Cycle  3 during the CCRT  period 
are still to be followed. An additional  cycle of  consolidation systemic  anticancer therapy  will not 
be administered after the completion of radiotherapy in this situation.  
If the administration  of systemic anticancer  therapy at Cycle  2 must  be delayed  due to toxicity  (for 
participants  who start systemic treatment  at Cycle  1), radiotherapy  should start ± 3 days of start of 
systemic anticancer therapy in Cycle 2. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if chemoradiation is delayed for administrative  reasons (eg, holidays), provided the full planned dose 
of radiotherapy is delivered. More detailed  radiotherapy  requirements  can be found in the Thoracic 
Radiotherapy Guidelines, and QA & QC processes are subject to the CA20973L Radiotherapy Manual.  
7.2 M
 ethod of Treatment  Assignment  
Before the study is initiated, each user will receive log -in information and directions on how to 
access the IRT. Each participant will be assigned a unique participant number after signing the ICF. Participant numbers will be used on all participants’ study information. Participant numbers

 will not be reassigned. An IRT will be employed to manage participant randomization. The 
investigator or designee will register the participant for enrollment by following the enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following information is required for enrollment: 
• Date that informed consent was obtained  
• Year  of birth 
• Gender at birth  
 
Once  enrolled  in IRT, enrolled participants  who have met all eligibility  criteria  will be ready  to be 
randomized through the IRT. Refer  to the IRT  manual for the information  required  for participant 
randomization. Please note that prior to randomization, the planned chemotherapy regimen, the planned number of cycles of chemotherapy (up to 2 cycles or up to 3 cycles), the planned dose 
level  of chemotherapy at the start  of treatment for agents with more  than  1 possible dose  level  per 
protocol (eg, carboplatin, paclitaxel), and the radiation modality must be pre -defined and 
documented in the IRT and medical records by the investigator. Please note that if the actual 
treatment regimen administered to the participant during the CCRT Period changes from the planned regimen  documented in  the IRT prior  to randomization, the rationale  for the change must 
be recorded in the CRF and documented in the medical record. 
Participants meeting all  eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 treatment arms 
and stratified  by age, PD-L1 status,  and stage (per AJCC staging system,  8th edition) as described 
below:  
• Age: 
− <65 years old  at time of randomization  
− ≥65 years old at time of randomization  
• Tumor PD-L1 status (from  IRT):  
− ≥1% 
− <1% 
− Indeterminate  or not evaluable  
• Stage  (per AJCC 8th edition) : 
− Stage  IIIA  
− Stage  IIIB

 7.4 Dosage Modification  
Dose reductions or dose escalations of nivolumab, ipilimumab, or durvalumab are not permitted 
in this study. Dose modifications for chemotherapy are allowed (see Section 7.4.5).  
Dose  Delay  Criteria  
• SARS -CoV-2 infection  either  confirmed  or suspected.  
 
Criteria  to Resume Treatment  
Participants with SARS -CoV- 2 infection (either confirmed or suspected) may resume treatment 
after all of the following : 
• at least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical illness)  have passed  since symptoms first appeared 
or positive test result (eg, RT -PCR or viral antigen), 
• resolution of  acute symptoms (including at least 24 hours has passed since last fever without 
fever reducing medications),  
• evaluation by the Investigator with confirmation that there are no sequelae that would place 
the participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment, and 
• consultation by the medical  monitor.  
 
For suspected cases, treatment may also resume if SARS -CoV- 2 infection is ruled -out and other 
criteria to resume treatment are met.  
7.4.1 Nivolumab Dose Delay Criteria  
Nivolumab administration  should be delayed  for the following: 
• Grade  2 non-skin, drug- related  AE, with the exception of fatigue  
• Grade  2 drug- related  creatinine,  AST,  ALT,  and/or total bilirubin  abnormalities  
• Grade  3 skin,  drug- related  AE 
• Grade  3 drug-related  laboratory  abnormality, with  the following exceptions:  
− Grade  3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic  amylase  or lipase does not require  dose delay  
− Grade  ≥ 3 AST,  ALT,  total bilirubin  will require dose discontinuation  
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of nivolumab. 
 
Participants who require delay  of nivolumab should be re- evaluated  weekly  or more  frequently if 
clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when retreatment criteria are met.  
7.4.1.1 Criteria  to Resume Nivolumab  
Participants  may resume treatment with nivolumab when  the drug- related  AE(s)  resolve to 
Grade ≤  1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
• P articipants  may  resume  treatment in  the presence of Grade  2 fatigue  
• Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related  skin AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 • For participants with Grade 2 AST, ALT and/or total bilirubin abnormalities, dosing may 
resume when laboratory values return to baseline and management with corticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete.  
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Participants with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after completion of a steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and approved by BMS Medical Monitor (or designee). 
• Participants may resume treatment with study treatment if they have completed AE 
management (ie, corticosteroid taper) or are on ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent.  
 
Participants with drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement  may resume  treatment  after consultation with the BMS  Medical  Monitor (or 
designee). Nivolumab therapy must be delayed until such time as this requirement is met. Please 
refer to Section 8.1.1 for special requirements for adrenal insufficiency.  
Protracted delay or discontinuation of nivolumab during the CCRT Period does not prevent 
participants from entering the Maintenance Period in Arm A or Arm B if: 
1) the delay  or discontinuation is not due to nivolumab- related  toxicities,  and 
2) eligibility  criteria  for initiation  of the Maintenance Period  are met. 
 
In addition, nivolumab may not be resumed  sooner than 18 days after the prior nivolumab dose.  
7.4.2 Ipilimumab  Dose Delay  Criteria  
Ipilimumab  administration  should be delayed  as described  in dose delay  criteria for nivolumab in 
Section 7.4. 
In addition, participants receiving ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab that have drug- 
related toxicities that meet the criteria for dose delay, should have both drugs (ipilimumab and nivolumab) delayed  until retreatment  criteria  are met.  Exceptions apply to the retreatment criteria 
after dose delay  of ipilimumab  and nivolumab for Grade  ≥ 3 amylase  and lipase abnormalities  that 
are not associated with  symptoms or clinical manifestations  of pancreatitis and that are attributed 
to ipilimumab alone. 
Participants who require delay should be re -evaluated weekly or more frequently if clinically 
indicated. Participants should resume dosing when retreatment criteria are met.  
7.4.2.1 Criteria  to Resume Ipilimumab  
Participants  may resume treatment  with nivolumab  and ipilimumab  when  drug- related  AE(s) 
resolve(s) to Grade 1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
• Participants  may  resume  treatment in  the presence of Grade  2 fatigue.  
• Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related  skin AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: 30 -Oct-2023  109 
Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 • Participants with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for 
reasons other than a 2 -grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in the 
presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT or total bilirubin.  
• Participants with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters ( Section 8.1.2) should have treatment permanently discontinued. 
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed.  
• Participants who received systemic corticosteroids for management of any drug -related 
toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of prednisone 
≤ 10 mg/day. 
• Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the BMS Medical Monitor. 
Ipilimumab therapy must be delayed until such time as this requirement is met.  
• Dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosing for > 12 weeks requires 
ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 8.1.2. 
• Ipilimumab  may not be resumed  sooner than 37 days after the prior ipilimumab  dose. 
• In general, participants who meet criteria to resume ipilimumab will also have met criteria to 
resume nivolumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dosing of both drugs when  resuming 
ipilimumab. In  order to facilitate this, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be 
adjusted within the permitted ± 5 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are 
given at least 18 days apart.  
NOTE: One exception occurs when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses are delayed due to 
drug- related  Grade  3 amylase or lipase  abnormalities  not associated  with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis. If the investigator assesses the Grade 3 amylase or lipase 
abnormality  is related  to ipilimumab  and not related  to nivolumab, nivolumab may be resumed 
when  the amylase or lipase  abnormality  resolves to Grade  < 3 but ipilimumab  may only resume 
when  the amylase or lipase  abnormality  resolves to Grade  1 or baseline.  Investigator attribution 
of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dosing must be clearly noted in the participant's medical chart. The BMS Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to resuming ipilimumab in the participant.  
 
7.4.3 Dose Delay  Criteria  for Durvalumab  
Durvalumab- related toxicities should be managed according to the approved Product Label 
requirements for durvalumab. Please refer to the approved durvalumab Product Label for criteria to delay, resume, and discontinue durvalumab treatment. 
7.4.4 Rescheduling Nivolumab and Ipilimumab  for Arm A Maintenance 
Period:  
• Ipilimumab should be infused on the same day as nivolumab on Day 1 of every cycle unless 
ipilimumab is delayed.  
• On Day 22 visit of  any cycle, if nivolumab dosing is delayed by more than 7 days, the dosing 
on the Day 22 visit within  the cycle  should be skipped. Dosing with both nivolumab and

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: 30 -Oct-2023  110 
Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 ipilimumab may resume on D1 of the subsequent cycle as long as the minimum ipilimumab 
dosing interval is 37 days. 
• If an ipilimumab dose is delayed beyond 6 weeks from the prior ipilimumab dose, then 
subsequent ipilimumab  doses should be rescheduled with nivolumab as long  as the minimum 
dosing interval for 2 consecutive nivolumab dosing is 18 days. 
• A dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosing for >12 weeks requires 
ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 8.1. 
 
7.4.4.1 Management  Algorithms for Ipilimumab,  Nivolumab,  or Durvalumab  
Immuno -oncology agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration from 
AEs caused  by other therapeutic classes.  Ipilimumab,  nivolumab, and durvalumab  are considered 
immuno -oncology agents in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated 
with immuno -oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management Algorithms (see 
Appendix 6) and nivolumab and ipilimumab  Investigator Brochures have  been  developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs: 
• Gastrointestinal 
• Renal  
• Pulmonary  
• Hepatic  
• Endocrinopathy  
• Skin 
• Neurological  
• Myocarditis  
 
Management algorithms for durvalumab may follow the principles aforementioned or per local 
approved Product Label requirements. 
7.4.4.2 Treatment of Nivolumab or Ipilimumab Infusion Reactions  
Since  nivolumab  and ipilimumab  contain  only human  immunoglobulin protein  sequences,  they are 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity  reactions.  However,  if such  a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, 
arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or  other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reactions  should be reported  within  24 hours to the BMS  Medical  Monitor and reported  as an SAE 
if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) guidelines.  
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: 30 -Oct-2023  111 
Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 For Grade  1 symptoms: (mild  reaction; infusion  interruption not indicated;  intervention  not 
indicated)  
• Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30  minutes  before 
additional nivolumab or ipilimumab administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds  promptly  to symptomatic  treatment  [eg, antihistamines,  non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; 
prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours) 
• Stop the nivolumab or ipilimumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol  325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted,  then restart the infusion at 50% of 
the original  infusion  rate when  symptoms  resolve; if no further complications ensue after 
30 minutes,  the rate may be increased  to 100%  of the original infusion rate. Monitor participant 
closely. If  symptoms recur,  then no further nivolumab or ipilimumab will be administered at 
that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the participant until resolution of symptoms. The amount of study treatment infused must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
• For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab or ipilimumab infusions. If necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used. 
 
For Grade  3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction,  Grade  3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly  responsive 
to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms 
following  initial improvement; hospitalization indicated  for other  clinical  sequelae  [eg, renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated)  
• Immediately  discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipilimumab.  Begin  an IV infusion of normal 
saline and treat the participant as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 
1 mg of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 
solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Participant should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab or ipilimumab will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery of the symptoms.

 In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms  (eg, appearance of a localized  or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).  
7.4.5 Chemotherapy Dose Delay,  Dose Modification,  and Criteria  to Resume 
Treatment  
Clinical judgment should guide chemotherapy dose modifications in the study and follow local 
institutional standards and approved product labeling. When administering granulocyte colony 
stimulating  factors (G-CSF)  for supportive measures,  local  standard of care and approved product 
labeling should be utilized. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, G -CSFs may be used only to 
assist with hematologic recovery. General guidelines for coordinating chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy are listed below. 
7.4.5.1 Etoposide or Pemetrexed + Platinum  Regimens  
1) During the CCRT Period, systemic anticancer therapy begins on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 
radiotherapy  begins on Day  1 of Cycle  2. However,  if radiotherapy planning  is complete prior 
to the initiation of  systemic anticancer therapy  at Cycle 1 (Arms A, B, or C), the investigator 
has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic anticancer  therapy alone, and initiate  treatment  with 
radiotherapy  concurrently with systemic anticancer  therapy (Cycle  2). All study procedures for 
Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 during the CCRT period are still to be followed. An additional  cycle of 
consolidation systemic anticancer therapy will not be administered after the completion of 
radiotherapy in this situation.  
2) When radiotherapy is initiated, systemic anticancer therapy and radiotherapy should be 
administered  on the same day (i.e. Day 1), with radiotherapy administered  after the completion 
of systemic anticancer therapy, if logistically feasible. Otherwise, a ± 3 day window will be 
permitted for the initiation of radiotherapy. For participants randomized to Arms A or B, chemotherapy must be administered after the completion of nivolumab administration AND on the same day nivolumab is administered. 
3) Repeated chemotherapy dose delays are allowed if needed. If  a single chemotherapy agent is 
delayed, the other chemotherapy  agent(s)  and nivolumab should be delayed. Nivolumab may 
resume only when criteria to resume both chemotherapy  and nivolumab are met. 
4) In the case that systemic  anticancer  therapy was administered  during Cycle  1: 
a) If Cycle 2 chemotherapy is delayed, radiotherapy should not be initiated, and nivolumab not administered (in Arms A and B), until chemotherapy is resumed. Participants should be monitored at least on a weekly  basis.  If Cycle  2 chemotherapy  is delayed  for >3 weeks, 
then Cycle 2 chemotherapy should be skipped, and radiotherapy should be administered. 
The date of the first radiotherapy dose is defined as C2D1. 
b) If Cycle 2 chemotherapy is skipped, participants may receive nivolumab treatment on 
C2D1 for Arms A and B (± 3 days of initiation of radiotherapy). 
c) If Cycle 2 chemotherapy is discontinued, in Arms A and B, participants may receive 
nivolumab treatment  on C2D1  (± 3 days of initiation  of radiotherapy), and C3D1  (± 3 days 
of continuation of radiotherapy).

 5) Regardless of whether Cycle  1 systemic  anticancer  therapy is skipped or not: 
a) If Cycle 3 chemotherapy is delayed, in Arms A and B, nivolumab should be delayed, but 
radiotherapy should continue as scheduled. 
b) If participant meets  criteria  to resume chemotherapy,  chemotherapy (and nivolumab in 
Arms A and B) may be administered at any  time during radiotherapy in Cycle 3. 
c) If Cycle  3 chemotherapy is discontinued, participants  in Arms  A and B may receive 
nivolumab treatment at any time during radiotherapy in Cycle 3. 
d) After the end of radiotherapy, any planned remaining  systemic anticancer  therapy that has 
yet to be dosed should be omitted. 
 
7.4.5.2 Paclitaxel + Carboplatin Regimen  
1) During the CCRT Period, systemic anticancer therapy begins on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 
radiotherapy  begins on Day  1 of Cycle  2. However,  if radiotherapy  planning is  complete  prior 
to the initiation of  systemic anticancer therapy  at Cycle 1 (Arms A, B, or C), the investigator 
has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic anticancer  therapy alone, and initiate  treatment  with 
radiotherapy  concurrently with systemic  anticancer  therapy (Cycle  2). All study procedures for 
Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 during the CCRT period are still to be followed. An additional  cycle of 
consolidation systemic anticancer therapy will not be administered after the completion of 
radiotherapy in this situation.  
2) When radiotherapy is initiated, systemic anticancer therapy and radiotherapy should be 
administered  on the same day (i.e. Day 1), with radiotherapy administered  after the completion 
of systemic anticancer therapy, if logistically feasible. Otherwise, a ± 3 days window will be 
permitted for the initiation of radiotherapy. For participants randomized to Arms A or B, chemotherapy must be administered after the completion of nivolumab administration AND on the same day nivolumab is administered. 
3) Repeated chemotherapy dose delays are allowed if needed. If  a single chemotherapy agent is 
delayed, the other chemotherapy  agent(s)  and nivolumab should be delayed. Nivolumab may 
resume only when criteria to resume both chemotherapy and nivolumab are met. 
4) In the case that systemic  anticancer  therapy was administered  during Cycle  1: 
a) If Cycle 2 chemotherapy is delayed, radiotherapy should not be initiated, and nivolumab 
not administered (in Arms A and B), until chemotherapy is resumed. Participants should be monitored at least on a weekly  basis.  Carboplatin + paclitaxel  treatment in  Cycle  2 and 
Cycle  3 entails  3 weekly  doses in  each  cycle.  Weekly  doses that are delayed  by more than 
1 week should be skipped and the next weekly dose administered when criteria to resume chemotherapy are met. If Cycle 2 chemotherapy is delayed for >3 weeks, then Cycle  2 
Day 1 chemotherapy should be skipped, and radiotherapy should be administered.  The date 
of the first radiotherapy dose is defined as C2D1.

 b) If Cycle 2 Day  1 chemotherapy is skipped, participants may receive nivolumab treatment 
on C2D1 (± 3 days of initiation of radiotherapy) in Arms A and B. If remaining weekly 
chemotherapy  within C2 can resume afterwards,  chemotherapy doses may be administered. 
From C2D8 onwards, if weekly chemotherapy is delayed beyond 7 days, this weekly 
chemotherapy should be skipped; if chemotherapy can’t resume beyond two consecutive 
weeks, the chemotherapy should be discontinued. 
c) If Cycle  2 chemotherapy is discontinued, participants  may receive nivolumab treatment on 
C2D1 (± 3 days of initiation of radiotherapy), and C3D1 (± 3 days of continuation of radiotherapy).  
5) If Cycle  1 systemic anticancer  therapy  was skipped:  
a) From  C2D8 and onwards, if weekly chemotherapy is delayed beyond 7 days, this weekly 
chemotherapy should be skipped; if chemotherapy can’t resume beyond two consecutive weeks, the chemotherapy should be discontinued. 
6) Regardless of whether Cycle  1 systemic  anticancer  therapy is skipped or not: 
a) If Cycle 3 Day 1 chemotherapy is delayed, nivolumab (in Arms A and B) should be delayed, but radiotherapy should continue as scheduled. 
b) If participant meets criteria to resume chemotherapy, chemotherapy (and nivolumab in 
Arms A and B) may be administered at any time during radiotherapy in Cycle 3 and the dose resumption date is defined as C3D1. 
c) If the criteria to resume the remaining weekly chemotherapy within Cycle 3 are met, remaining C3D8 and/or C3D15 chemotherapy may be resumed as long as radiotherapy does not come to an end. 
d) If Cycle 3 chemotherapy is discontinued, participants in Arms A and B may receive 
nivolumab treatment at any time during radiotherapy in Cycle 3. 
e) After the end  of radiotherapy, any planned remaining  systemic anticancer  therapy that has 
yet to be dosed should be omitted. 
 
Chemotherapy toxicity may be managed per local standards. The following tables provide

If weekly low dose chemotherapy cannot resume beyond 7 days, this dose should be skipped. If 
weekly dose cannot resume beyond 2 consecutive weeks, chemotherapy should be permanently discontinued. 
7.4.6 Radiotherapy Dose Modification  
In principle,  radiotherapy  should continue with ≤ Grade  3 non-hematological toxicities  and should 
be held for Grade  4 non-hematological toxicities,  then resume when  toxicities  resolve to ≤ Grade  2. 
Holding radiotherapy for Grade  4 hematological  toxicities  other  than lymphopenia and leukopenia 
may be considered. 
7.4.6.1 Esophagitis from Radiotherapy  
Esophageal complaints are common with combined modality therapy. Esophagitis does not 
constitute a reason to interrupt or delay radiotherapy or chemotherapy provided oral intake is sufficient  to maintain  hydration. Participants  should be advised to avoid alcoholic, acidic,  or spicy 
foods or beverages. Viscous xylocaine, carafate, or other medications should be used for symptomatic relief. As the esophageal transit time is clearly prolonged with radiotherapy and reflux may occur, the use of PPIs or H2 antagonists is recommended. Opioids may be required, especially  in managing high grade esophagitis. In case of Grade  2 esophagitis occurring during the 
first 2 weeks of radiotherapy, a fungal infection, mainly candida albicans, may have occurred. 
Treatment with anti-fungal agents such as nystatin or fluconazole should be considered . 
Acute esophagitis may persist for 4 -6 weeks. If Grade 4 esophagitis occurs, and a treatment 
interruption is being considered, every effort should be made to limit it to ≤  3 treatment days. 
Participants  requiring hospitalization  because of esophagitis may have their treatment interrupted.  
Acute  esophageal  toxicity  should be pharmacologically  managed with the recommended  treatment 
options  per local standard  practice  and should be initiated  at the first signs  or symptoms  of esophageal 
toxicity.  See Table  7.4.6.4-1 for recommended  management  of high grade  esophagitis.

Additional chemoradiotherapy  modifications  are as follows:  
1) If treatment is interrupted  ≥ 3 weeks for pneumonitis, discontinue all protocol therapy in CCRT 
period.  
2) In case of interruptions due  to machine breakdown or public holidays or any interruptions of 
therapy up to 7 days, radiation should be completed to the prescribed doses. Total number of 
fractions and elapsed days should be carefully reported 
3) In the case of Grade 3 esophagitis related to the concomitant treatment, chemotherapy  should 
be suspended if the investigator believes continued use will jeopardize the delivery  of full-dose 
radiotherapy; radiation is to be continued  
 
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator, or designee where permitted, to ensure that investigational 
product is only dispensed to study Participants. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations.  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treatment arise, the study treatment should not be dispensed and contact BMS immediately. 
Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the approved Product 
Label.  
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS  or not) must be maintained  that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets). 
• Further guidance and information  for final disposition of unused study treatment are provided 
in Appendix 2 and CA20973L Study Manual.

 7.6 Treatment Compliance  
Study treatment compliance will be periodically monitored by drug accountability. Study 
treatment will be administered in the clinic by trained personnel. Drug accountability should be reviewed by the site study staff at each visit to confirm treatment compliance.  
7.7 Concomitant Therapy  
7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments  
The following medications are prohibited and/or restricted  during the study  (unless utilized  to treat 
a drug- related adverse event or as premedication):  
• Immunosuppressive agents  
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids  (except  as stated  in Section  7.7.3)  
• Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy other than specified as study treatments (ie, 
chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, extensive, non- palliative  radiation  therapy, 
or standard or investigational agents for treatment of NSCLC) 
• Any complementary medications (eg, herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) 
intended to treat the disease under study or provide supportive care. Use of marijuana and its 
derivatives for treatment of symptoms related to cancer or cancer treatment are permitted if obtained by medical prescription or if its use (even without a medical prescription) has been legalized locally  
• Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio, and measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during treatment and until 100 days post last dose 
• Investigators should refer to the approved local  product labeling for the chemotherapy drugs 
for additional prohibited and restricted concomitant medications. After the first cycle of 
chemotherapy, prophylactic G -CSFs can be administered only to assist with hematologic 
recovery.  
 
7.7.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Any medications (prescription  and OTC),  vitamin  and mineral supplements, and/or herbs taken  by 
the participant from screening through the treatment phase of the study will be documented and 
recorded,  including start and stop date,  dose and route of administration,  frequency, and indication. 
Medications taken for any procedure are encouraged to be included. 
COVID-19 vaccines that are NOT  live are allowed and should be handled in the same manner  as 
other vaccines. Administration may occur during the study. 
7.7.3 Other Restrictions and Precautions  
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses >  10 mg 
daily of prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg, 
delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted. 
Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>  10 mg 
daily  prednisone equivalent)  or other immunosuppressive medications  within  14 days of

 randomization are excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids,  and adrenal replacement  steroid  doses  
> 10 mg daily  prednisone equivalent, are permitted  in the absence of active autoimmune disease.  
7.7.4 Imaging Restriction and Precaution  
It is the local  imaging facility’s  responsibility to determine,  based  on participant  attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen per imaging study. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks are to be considered  in this assessment.  Participants  with renal  insufficiency are to be assessed  as to whether 
or not they should receive contrast  and if so, which  contrast agent  and dose is appropriate. Specific 
to MRI,  participants  with severe renal  insufficiency  (ie, estimated  glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR)  
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic  systemic fibrosis and MRI contrast is 
contraindicated. In addition, participants  may be excluded from MRI  if they have tattoos,  metallic 
implants, pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the image acquisition manual. 
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow local standard of care. The ultimate 
decision to perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the site radiologist, the investigator, and standards set by the local Ethics Committee.  
7.8 Treatment  After  the End of the Study  
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to provide BMS supplied study treatment to participants/investigators  unless BMS  chooses to extend the study. The investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate standard of care to treat the condition under study. 
BMS  reserves the right to terminate  access to BMS  supplied study treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b) the development of study drug is 
terminated  for other reasons,  including, but  not limited  to, lack of efficacy  and/or not meeting  the 
study objectives; c) the participant  can obtain medication  from a government-sponsored or private 
health program. In all cases, BMS will follow local regulations.  
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
8.1 Discontinuation from  Study Treatment  
Participants MUST discontinue investigational product (and non- investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons:  
• Participant’s request to stop study treatment. Participants who request to discontinue study 
treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when  a participant  specifically  withdraws 
consent for any further contact  with him/her or persons previously authorized  by participant to 
provide this information.  
• A
ny clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator,  indicates that continued  participation  in the study is not in the best 
interest of the participant  
• Completion of the course of study treatment  
• Termination  of the study by Bristol- Myers Squibb (BMS)

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: 30 -Oct-2023  122 
Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 • Loss of ability  to freely  provide consent  through imprisonment  or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. (Note: Under 
specific circumstances, a participant who has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue on the study. Strict conditions apply and BMS approval is required.) 
• Disease progression in the absence of clinical benefit as determined  by the Investigator 
• See Section  8.1.1, Section 8.1.2, Section 8.1.3, Section 8.1.4, and Section 8.1.5 for 
discontinuation criteria for nivolumab, ipilimumab, durvalumab, chemotherapy, and CCRT, 
respectively.  
• Noncompliance of  the participant with protocol- mandated procedures based on the judgment 
and agreement of both the Investigator and Sponsor 
 
If a participant has not progressed following discontinuation of study treatment(s), every effort 
should be made to continue to obtain radiographic tumor assessments until BICR confirmed progression and Investigator -assessed distant metastases.  
A participant may also be withdrawn from investigational product/study by the Sponsor, Regulatory Authorities, or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/ Independent Ethics Committees (IECs).  
Participants  may choose to discontinue the study at any time,  for any reason,  and without prejudice 
to further treatment.  
Refer  to Section  2: Schedule of Activities  for data which  must be collected  at the time of treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that can be completed. 
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately,  within  24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant safety).  
All participants  who discontinue study  treatment should comply with protocol specified  follow -up 
procedures as outlined in Table 2 -8. The  only exception to this requirement is when a participant 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatment study follow -up or loses the 
ability  to consent  freely  (ie, is imprisoned  or involuntarily incarcerated  for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If study treatment is  discontinued prior  to the participant’s  completion  of the study, the reason  for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical  records per local  regulatory 
requirements in each region/country  and entered  on the appropriate case report form  (eCRF)  page. 
8.1.1 Discontinuation Criteria  for Nivolumab  
Treatment  with nivolumab  should be permanently  discontinued for any of the following:  
• Any Grade 2 drug- related uveitis, eye pain, or blurred vision that does not  respond to topical 
therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the retreatment period OR requires 
systemic treatment

 • Any Grade 3 non- skin, drug-related AE lasting > 7 days or recurs, with the following 
exceptions for laboratory  abnormalities,  drug- related  uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, 
neurologic toxicity, myocarditis, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions, and 
endocrinopathies:  
− Grade  3 drug- related  uveitis,  pneumonitis, bronchospasm , neurologic  toxicity , myocarditis, 
hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation 
− Grade 3 drug- related endocrinopathies, adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement do not require discontinuation. Adrenal insufficiency requires 
discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement. 
− Grade 3 drug- related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation 
except:  
♦ Grade 3 drug- related  thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated with bleeding requires 
discontinuation  
♦ Grade  ≥ 3 drug- related  AST,  ALT  or total bilirubin  requires discontinuation*  
♦ Concurrent AST  or ALT  > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin  > 2x ULN  
* In most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study treatment(s) will be permanently 
discontinued. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study treatment(s), a discussion between the investigator and the BMS medical monitor or designee must occur.  
• Any Grade 4 drug- related adverse event or laboratory  abnormality  (including but not limited 
to creatinine, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin), except for the following events which do not 
require discontinuation: 
− Grade  4 neutropenia ≤ 7 days 
− Grade  4 lymphopenia or leukopenia or asymptomatic  amylase or lipase 
− Isolated  Grade  4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities  that are not associated  with clinical 
sequelae and are corrected  with supplementation/appropriate management within  72 hours 
of their onset 
− Grade 4 drug- related endocrinopathy adverse events, such as, hyper - or hypothyroidism, 
or glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic 
hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose -controlling agents, 
respectively, may not require  discontinuation after discussion with and approval from  the 
BMS Medical Monitor.  
• Any event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 8 weeks from the previous dose requires discontinuation (exception  is for nivolumab 480 mg Q4W  where  the delay  can last up to 
10 weeks), with the following exceptions: 
− Dosing delays to allow  for prolonged steroid  tapers to manage  drug- related  adverse events 
are allowed.  
− Dosing delays lasting  > 8 weeks from the previous  dose (> 10 weeks for nivolumab 480 mg 
Q4W) that occur for non-drug- related reasons may be allowed if approved by the BMS 
Medical Monitor (or designee).

 Prior to re -initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 8 weeks (> 10 weeks 
for nivolumab 480 mg  Q4W),  the BMS  Medical  Monitor (or  designee) must  be consulted. Tumor 
assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to 
assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if 
clinically indicated during such dosing delays. 
Nivolumab should be discontinued for  any adverse event, laboratory  abnormality, or intercurrent 
illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the 
participant with continued nivolumab dosing. 
NOTE: For participants in Arm A, during the Maintenance Period, receiving nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab, the assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately  from  the assessment  made for discontinuation of ipilimumab.  Although there  is overlap 
among the discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued. 
If a participant meets criteria for discontinuation and the investigator is unable to determine 
whether the event is related to nivolumab, or ipilimumab, the participant should discontinue all treatment: and be taken off the treatment phase of the study. Continuation of ipilimumab after discontinuation of nivolumab is not allowed on study. 
8.1.2 Ipilimumab Discontinuation Criteria  
Ipilimumab  should be permanently  discontinued if any of the following  criteria  are met: 
• Any Grade  ≥ 2 drug- related  uveitis  or eye pain or blurred  vision that does not respond to topical 
therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 2 weeks OR requires systemic 
treatment; 
• Any Grade  ≥ 3 bronchospasm or other  hypersensitivity  reaction;  
• Any other Grade  3 non-skin, drug- related  adverse with the following exceptions for laboratory 
abnormalities,  grade ≥ 3 nausea and vomiting, grade  3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and 
symptomatic endocrinopathies which resolved (with or without hormone substitution); 
• Any drug- related  liver function  test (LFT)  abnormality  that meets the following  criteria  require 
discontinuation:  
− Grade  ≥ 3 drug related AST, ALT or  total bilirubin  required discontinuation 
♦ In most  cases  of Grade  3 AST,  ALT  evaluation study treatment(s) will be permanently 
discontinued. If the investigator  determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuation of study treatment(s), a discussion between the investigator and the BMS medical monitor or designee must occur.  
− Concurrent AST  or ALT  > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin  > 2X ULN  
• Any Grade 4 drug- related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the following 
events, which do not require discontinuation: 
− Gr
ade  4 neutropenia ≤ 7 days 
− Grade  4 lymphopenia or leukopenia

 − Isolated  Grade  4 amylase  or lipase abnormalities which  are not associated  with symptoms 
or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis.  
− Isolated  Grade  4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities  that are not associated  with clinical 
sequelae and are corrected  with supplementation/appropriate management within  72 hours 
of their onset 
− Grade  4 drug-related  endocrinopathy adverse events such as adrenal insufficiency, ACTH 
deficiency, hyper - or hypothyroidism, or glucose intolerance, which resolve or are 
adequately controlled with physiologic hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid 
hormones) or glucose controlling agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the BMS Medical Monitor.  
• Any treatment delay resulting in no ipilimumab dosing for > 12 weeks with the following 
exceptions: Dosing delays to manage drug- related adverse events, such as prolonged steroid 
tapers,  are allowed. Prior to re- initiating treatment in a participant with  a dosing delay lasting 
> 12 weeks,  the BMS  medical  monitor must  be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue 
as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the participant with continued ipilimumab dosing  
 
The assessment  for discontinuation of ipilimumab  should be made  separately  from the assessment 
made for discontinuation of nivolumab. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation 
criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued. 
If a participant meets criteria for discontinuation and the investigator is unable to determine whether the event is related to nivolumab or ipilimumab, the participant should discontinue nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
8.1.3 Durvalumab Discontinuation Criteria  
The toxicity  management strategy  for durvalumab (see Section  7.4.3) may lead to discontinuation 
or resumption  of durvalumab upon clinical  outcomes.  See local  approved prescribing information 
for durvalumab. 8.1.4 Discontinuation Criteria  for Chemoradiotherapy  
As highlighted in dose modification  for chemotherapy (see Section  7.4.5) and chemoradiation  (see 
Section 7.4.6), despite diligent management, if toxicities remain unmanageable, components in 
question should be discontinued. 
Specifically, one or both chemotherapy components should be discontinued for any of the 
following:  
• Grade  ≥3 drug- related  thrombocytopenia associated  with clinically  significant bleeding 
• Any drug- related grade 3/4 adverse event (eg, ANC, PLT) which recurs after two prior dose 
reductions for the same drug related adverse event requires discontinuation of the drug(s) 
which was/were previously dose reduced

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 • Any drug- related  liver function  test (LFT)  abnormality  that meets the following  criteria: 
− AST  or ALT  > 5-10x ULN for > 2 weeks  
− AST  or ALT  > 10x ULN 
− Total  bilirubin >  5 x ULN 
− Concurrent AST  or ALT  > 3 x ULN  and total bilirubin  > 2 x ULN  
• Any Grade ≥ 3 drug -related hypersensitivity reaction or infusion reaction requires 
discontinuation of the drug(s) that is suspected to be causing the reaction. The drug(s) not 
suspected to be related to the hypersensitivity  reaction or infusion reaction may be continued 
• In case of renal toxicity, if CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min but ≥ 20 mL/min, cisplatin should be 
discontinued and a switch  to carboplatin at AUC 5 could be opted  for. In addition, participants 
receiving cisplatin with pemetrexed must discontinue cisplatin if the calculated creatinine 
clearance decreases to < 50 mL/min (based on the Cockcroft Gault formula). The other drug (pemetrexed) may be continued, and the platinum agent may, at the investigator’s discretion, 
be switched to carboplatin for the remainder of the platinum- based doublet cycles when the 
participant meets retreatment criteria. Carboplatin should be discontinued if CrCl <  20 
mL/min. In case of CrCl < 45 mL/min, pemetrexed should be discontinued and may be substituted with etoposide with 25% dose reduction. In case of CrCl < 20 mL/min, any chemotherapy should be stopped 
• Participants  with non- hematologic  toxicities  ≥ Grade  3 (excluding  neurotoxicity),  pemetrexed 
should be withheld until resolution to better than or equal to baseline 
• In case of  peripheral neuropathy grade > 2, cisplatin should be stopped and be substituted by 
carboplatin at  AUC 5. Stop chemotherapy for  Grade  3/4 neurotoxicity, except for carboplatin 
which may be withheld until ≤ Grade 2 
• Any Grade 4 drug- related adverse event which the investigator deems inappropriate to be 
managed by dose reduction(s) requires discontinuation of the drug(s) felt to be causing the 
event. The drug not felt to be related to the event may be continued. 
• Regarding rules  of dose skipping or discontinuation due to exceeding  the maximum dose delay, 
please refer to Section 7.4.5. 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the participant with continued chemotherapy dosing. Investigators should consult local labeling for the chemotherapy drugs being administered to any participant for additional guidance on dose discontinuation. 
 
8.1.5 Multimodality  in CCRT  Period Discontinuation Criteria  
In cases where  one or a few components in the multimodality  therapy  meet  discontinuation criteria, 
other components may continue as judged appropriate  by investigator.  It is of ultimate  importance 
to try the best to deliver radiotherapy as planned without delay  or interruption.  Full supportive care 
should be in place. Chemotherapy (and/or nivolumab) may be delayed or discontinued to ensure 
the delivery of radiotherapy. Maintaining the planned cumulative platinum chemotherapy dose 
takes the second priority, followed by nivolumab in Arm A and Arm B. 
8.1.6 Tr
 eatment beyond Progression  
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of participants treated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD.20

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 Participants will be permitted to continue maintenance treatment in Arm A, Arm B, and Arm  C 
beyond initial RECIST 1.1 defined PD, as assessed by the investigator, for up to a maximum of 
12 months from date of first dose, as long as they meet the following criteria:  
1) Investigator- assessed  clinical  benefit.  
2) Tolerance of study treatment  
3) Stable  performance  status 
4) Treatment  beyond progression will not delay  an imminent  intervention  to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)  
5) Participant  provides written  informed  consent prior to receiving additional maintenance 
treatment.  
6) Crossover between  study  treatments/arms  is not allowed.  
 
All other elements of the main consent including description of reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options will still apply.  
A radiographic assessment/  scan should be performed  within  6 weeks of initial 
investigator- assessed  progression to determine  whether there  has been  a decrease in the tumor size 
or continued PD. The assessment  of clinical  benefit  should be balanced  by clinical  judgment as to 
whether the participant is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment with maintenance treatment in Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C.  
If the investigator feels that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by continuing treatment, the participant should remain on the treatment and continue to receive monitoring according to Section 2 (Schedule of Activities).  
For the participants who continue study treatment beyond progression, further progression is defined as an additional  10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase 
from time of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. Treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further progression. 
New lesions  are considered measurable at the time  of initial progression if  the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes which  must have  a short axis of at least 
15 mm).  Any new lesion  considered non- measurable at the time of initial  progression may become 
measurable and therefore be included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes which  must have a short  axis of at least 15 mm). 
In situations  where  the relative  increase  in total tumor burden by 10% is solely  due to inclusion of 
new lesions  which become measurable,  these new lesions must  demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.  
8.2 D
 iscontinuation from the Study  
Participants  who request  to discontinue study treatment will remain  in the study and must  continue 
to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when a

 participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. 
• Participants should notify the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow -up in writing , whenever possible 
• The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator,  as to whether  the withdrawal is from further treatment with study treatment only 
or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up, and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page  
• In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law  
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent 
 
In this study, PFS and OS are key endpoints. Post study follow -up is of critical  importance  and is 
essential to preserving participant safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who 
discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed for collection  of outcome and/or survival 
follow -up data as required and  in line with Section 5 , until death or the conclusion of the study. 
 
BMS  may request  that survival data be collected  on all  treated/randomized  participants outside of 
the protocol -defined window. At the time of this request, each participant will be contacted to 
determine their survival status unless the participant has withdrawn consent for all contacts  or is 
lost to follow -up. 
8.2.1 Post  Study Treatment  Follow -up 
In this study, PFS -2 is an important endpoint. Post study follow -up, including subsequent 
treatment/progression,  is of critical importance and is essential  to preserving  participant safety  and 
the integrity of the study. Participants who discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed (in this study or a rollover study) for collection of outcome and/or survival follow -up 
data as required and in line with Section 5 until death or the conclusion of the study. 
Participants  who discontinue study treatment  may continue to be followed.  
8.3 Lost  to Follow -Up 
The following actions must  be taken  if a participant fails to return  to the clinic  for a required  study 
visit: 
• All reasonable efforts  must  be made to locate participants  to determine  and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the participant. 
• Lost to follow -up is defined by the inability  to reach the participant after a minimum of three 
documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered  mail letter.  All attempts  should be documented in the participant’s medical records.

 • If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use permissible local methods  to 
obtain date and cause of death. 
• If investigator’s  use of third -party  representative to assist  in the follow -up portion of the study 
has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s 
contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up 
portion of the study. 
• The site staff  and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. 
• If after all attempts,  the participant  remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive  date as 
determined  by the investigator should be reported and documented in the participant’s  medical 
records.  
 
9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and timing  are summarized  in Section  2: Schedule of Activities.  
• Protocol waivers  or exemptions are not allowed.  
• All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements,  including those specified in Section 2: Schedule 
of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet  all eligibility  criteria  before randomization.  The investigator will maintain  a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm  eligibility  or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s  routine  clinical management  (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.  
 
Additional measures, including non- study required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply  with local  regulations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver  enzyme  evaluations)  will be monitored  during the follow- up phase via on- site/local 
labs until all study treatment- related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible.  
If a participant shows pulmonary -related signs (hypoxia, abnormal heart rate or changes from 
baseline) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations) consistent with 
possible pulmonary adverse events, the participant should be immediately evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity management algorithm in the 
BMS -936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure (and in Appendix 6).

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 Some  of the assessments referred  to in this section  may not be captured  as data in the eCRF.  They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating physician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary  or where required by institutional or local 
regulations.  
9.1 Efficacy Assessments  
9.1.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study  
Images must be submitted to a central imaging vendor for blinded independent central review (BICR). Prior to scanning the first participant sites should be qualified and understand the image acquisition guidelines and submission process as outlined in the CA20973L Imaging Manual provided by the central imaging vendor. Screening and on study images should be acquired as outlined in Section 2 (Schedule of Activities).  
Collect any additional imaging that may demonstrate tumor response or progression (including scans performed  at unscheduled time points and/or at an outside institution) for RECIST  1.1 tumor 
assessment  and submit to  central  imaging  vendor. X-rays and  bone scans  that clearly  demonstrate 
interval progression of disease, for example most commonly as unequivocal lesions that are unmistakably new since the prior CT/MRI, should be submitted to central imaging vendor. Otherwise, x -rays and bone scans do not need to be submitted centrally. 
9.1.1.1 Methods of Measurement  
Contrast- enhanced  CT of the chest,  CT/MRI  of the abdomen, and all other  known and/or suspected 
sites of  disease  should be performed for tumor assessments.  Images should be acquired  with  slice 
thickness of 5 mm or less with  no intervening gap  (contiguous). Every  attempt should  be made to 
image  each participant  using  an identical  acquisition protocol on the same  scanner  for all imaging 
time points. Tumor measurements  should be made  by the same  investigator or radiologist for each 
assessment whenever possible. Change in tumor measurements and tumor response to guide ongoing study treatment decisions will be assessed by the Investigator using the RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
Should a participant have contraindication for CT  intravenous contrast, a non- contrast CT of  the 
chest and a contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdomen, and other known/suspected sites of disease 
should be obtained. 
Should a participant have contraindication for both MRI and CT intravenous contrasts, a non- 
contrast CT of the chest  and a non- contrast  MRI  of the abdomen, and other known/suspected sites 
of disease should be obtained. 
Should a participant have contraindication for MRI (eg, incompatible pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindication to CT intravenous contrast, a non- contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, and other 
known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.  
Use 
of CT component  of a PET -CT scanner: Combined modality  scanning such as with PET- CT 
is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; 
therefore, the recommendations outlined here may change rather quickly with time. At present, low dose or attenuation correction  CT portions of a combined PET- CT are of limited  use in

 anatomically -based efficacy assessments and it is therefore suggested that they should not be 
substituted for dedicated  diagnostic contrast enhanced  CT scans for anatomically -based 
RECIST 1.1 measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast)  then the 
CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST 1.1 measurements. Note, however, that the 
PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
Bone scan or PET scan is not adequate for assessment  of RECIST 1.1  response in target lesions. 
In selected circumstances where such modalities are the sole modality used to  assess certain  
non-target organs, those non- target organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone 
scans may need  to be repeated  only when  complete response is identified  in target  disease or when 
progression in bone is suspected. 
Bone scans may be collected per local standards, as clinically  indicated.  
MRI of  brain must be acquired as outlined in Section 2 (Schedule of Activities). CT of the Brain 
(without and with contrast) can be performed if MRI is contraindicated or based on Investigator 
discretion.  
9.1.1.2 Clinical Assessment  and Imaging  
Tumor assessments should continue at the same frequency even if dosing is delayed or discontinued. Changes in  tumor measurements  and tumor responses will be  assessed  by the same 
investigator using RECIST  1.1 criteria.  Investigators will report the number and size of new lesions 
that appear while on study. The time point of tumor assessments will be reported on the eCRF based  on the investigator’s  assessment  using RECIST  1.1 criteria  (see Appendix 8  for specifics  of 
RECIST 1.1 criteria to be utilized in this study). Specific to this study, lesions that received irradiation  during the CCRT  Period  and remain  measurable,  continue to be considered  measurable. 
Assessments  of PR and CR must be confirmed  at least 4 weeks (28 days) after initial response.  A 
best overall response of SD requires a minimum of 56 days on study from randomization to the date of the first imaging assessment.  
Tumor assessment by the Investigator must continue until distant metastases is assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1. 
9.1.1.3 BICR Confirmation of Progression or Recurrence  
Sites should submit all scans to the central imaging vendor on a rolling basis, throughout the 
duration of the study until PD is confirmed by the BICR. BICR of scans will occur on a rolling basis, blinded to treatment arm, clinical data, and investigator assessment of submitted scans. When  progression per RECIST  1.1 criteria  is assessed  by the investigator, the site will inform the 
central  imaging vendor, in order for BICR assessment of progression to be performed. The BICR 
review will be completed and the results provided to the site as specified in the imaging vendor documents, provided there  are no pending imaging  queries to the site. All details  on the timelines 
and associated process requirements will be outlined in the Imaging Manual.

 Participants whose progression is not confirmed by the BICR will be required to continue tumor 
assessments (if clinically feasible) according to the protocol- specified schedule, or sooner if 
clinically indicated for submission to BICR. Also, if participants discontinue treatment without BICR confirmed radiographic progression, tumor assessments will continue according to the protocol specified schedule, as noted in Section 2  (Schedule of Activities) for submission to the 
BICR until progression has been  confirmed  by BICR.  If the planned start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy is sooner than the time of next scheduled tumor assessment, every  effort should be made 
to repeat tumor imaging prior to initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy unless clinically infeasible.  
All study  treatment decisions will be based on the investigator’s assessment of tumor images and 
not on the BICR assessment. Tumor assessment by the Investigator must continue until Investigator- assessed distant metastases, as noted above.  
9.1.2 Outcomes Research Assessments 
The evaluation of patient-reported outcomes is an increasingly  important aspect  of clinical  efficacy 
in oncology trials. Such data provide an understanding of the impact of treatment from the participant’s perspective and offer insights into patient experience that may not be captured through physician  reporting. Additionally,  generic health -related quality  of life measures provide 
data needed for calculating utility values to inform health economic models. 
Participants will be asked to complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lung Cancer (FACT -L) Module, the Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer – Symptom Assessment 
Questionnaire (NSCLC -SAQ), 5 -level version of the EuroQol Group’s EQ -5D (EQ -5D- 5L) and 
the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI- S). 
The NSCLC -SAQ,  PGI-S, FACT -L, and EQ -5D-5L will be administered  via an  electronic  device 
during specified clinic visits, and will be completed prior to any other assessments or study procedures when they are being administered during study visits. In addition, the PRO measures 
will be completed at designated time points during the long -term Follow -up Period and entered 
into the CRF. If exceptional circumstances preclude the continued administration of measures using planned modalities, then alternate administration methods may be required, after consultation with Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative. 
Section  2 (Schedule of  Activities) provides information  regarding  the timing  of PRO assessments 
during the CCRT  Period, Recovery  Period, Maintenance Period,  and during the long- term Follow- 
up Period. 
Additional information  about the timing  of each assessment  is described  below.  
9.1.2.1 FACT -L 
The Functional Assessment  of Cancer  Therapy – Lung (FACT -L) cancer  module, is a widely -used, 
reliable,  and valid  measure of multidimensional health  status  among people who have lung cancer. 
The FACT -L scale is a 36 -item self -report instrument that measures multidimensional QOL by 
asking participants to rate a series of statements on a 5 -point Likert scale. The FACT -L, version 
4, is a combination of the 27- item FACT -General  (FACT -G) and the 9- item Lung Cancer  Subscale

 (LCS). A subset of the 7 items from FACT -L (2 of the 9 items are not scored, and will not be 
administered) will be used to calculate the LCS, which will be used to assess disease- specific 
symptom severity.  
A total FACT -G score is calculated by summing the physical well -being (PWB), social/family 
well-being (SWB), emotional well -being (EWB), and functional well -being (FWB) subscale 
scores. A  total FACT -L score is obtained by summing the FACT -G score with the LCS,  thereby 
augmenting the FACT -G with  lung cancer –specific QOL  information.  The FACT -L also contains 
the GP5 item from the FACT -G, which is used to assess the bother associated  with the side effects 
of treatment. Each of the items is scored on a five -point scale from  zero (Not at all) to four (Very 
much). Higher  scores indicate greater  quality of life. The FACT -L uses a recall  period of “the past 
7 days.” 
The FACT -L will be administered per Section  2 (Schedule of Activities).  
9.1.2.2 Non-Small  Cell Lung Cancer  Symptom  Assessment  Questionnaire 
(NSCLC -SAQ)  
The NSCLC -SAQ is a 7-item PRO measure intended  for use in advanced  NSCLC clinical  trials  to 
support medical  product labelling.45 The NSCLC -SAQ uses a 7-day recall  period and verbal rating 
scales. It was developed in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration’s PRO 
Guidance and scientific best practices, and the resulting qualitative interview data provide 
evidence of content validity. The NSCLC -SAQ total score measures overall severity of the 
following NSCLC symptoms: cough, pain, dyspnea, fatigue,  and appetite. The NSCLC -SAQ has 
been qualified for exploratory use to measure symptoms of non- small cell lung cancer in drug 
development programs. Further evaluation is needed on the instrument’s longitudinal 
measurement properties and the interpretation of clinically meaningful within -patient change in 
score.  After  the NSCLC- SAQ’s  longitudinal measurement  properties and the interpretation  of 
clinically meaningful within -patient change have been evaluated, the NSCLC- SAQ  total score is 
intended to support labeling claims related to change in overall symptoms of  NSCLC. Data from 
this study will help to interpret the psychometric properties and threshold  for clinically  meaningful 
within -patient change in the NSCLC -SAQ total  score within locally  advanced untreated NSCLC 
participants.  
The NSCLC -SAQ will be administered  per Section  2 (Schedule of Activities).  
9.1.2.3 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L46 is a standardized instrument used to measure self -reports of health status and 
functioning. The instrument’s descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels, reflecting 
no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. A dimension for which there are no problems is said to be at level 1, while a dimension for which there are extreme problems is said to be at level 5. Thus,  the vectors 11111 and 55555 represent 
the best health state and the worst health state, respectively, as described by the EQ -5D- 5L. 
Altogether, the instrument describes 5
5 = 3,125 health states.

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 Empirically -derived weights can be applied to an individual’s responses to the EQ -5D- 5L 
descriptive system to generate an index measuring the value to society of his or her current 
health. 47 Utility index values range from a 1 (full health) to 0 (dead) with negative values 
indicating a state considered worse than being dead. In addition, the EQ -5D- 5L includes  a visual 
analog scale  (VAS)  that allows  respondents to rate their own current  health  on a 0-100 point scale 
ranging from “the worst  health  you can imagine”  to the “best  health  you can imagine.” The 
EQ-5D-5L uses a recall period of “today.” 
The EQ-5D-5L will be administered  per Section  2 (Schedule of Activities).  
9.1.2.4 Patient  Global  Impression of Severity (PGI- S) 
PGI-S will be included as an additional exploratory endpoint. The PGI -S is a single item that 
assesses participant’s perceptions of  overall severity  of cancer symptoms for the last 7 days with 
response options ranging from “none” to  “very  severe.” Data  collected  via the PGI -S will be used 
as an anchor measure to assess the psychometric measurement properties and the threshold for 
meaningful change for the NSCLC- SAQ.  
The PGI-S will be administered  per Section  2 (Schedule of Activities).  
9.2 Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse  event (SAE)  can be found in Appendix 3 . 
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally acceptable representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet  the definition  of an AE or SAE  and remain  responsible for following up 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting  are specified  in Appendix  3. 
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
Collect  all nonserious adverse events (not only those  deemed  to be treatment- related) continuously 
during the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 days following discontinuation of study treatment. See Section 9.2.3 for additional details on Follow-up. 
All SAEs must be collected from the  time of signing the informed consent form, including those 
thought to be associated  with protocol- specified  procedures and within  100 days of discontinuation 
of dosing. 
All AEs (SAEs and non -ser
 ious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV- 2 
infection must be collected from the time of signing the consent and within 100 days following 
discontinuation of dosing. 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after  these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy).

 • Medical  occurrences  that begin before  the start of study treatment  but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module. 
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported  to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3. 
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE  data to the sponsor or designee within  24 hours 
of updated information being available.  
 
For participants  randomized  to treatment  and never treated  with study treatment,  collect  SAEs for 
30 days from the date of randomization. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been  discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably  related  to the study 
treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when 
collecting AE  and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgment in 
the context of known adverse events, when appropriate for the program or protocol. 
Every AE must be assessed by the investigator with regard to whether it is considered immune - 
mediated. For events which are potentially immune -mediated, additional information will be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.  
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious (see Appendix 3). 
• Follow- up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. 
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. 
 
After the  initial AE/SAE  report,  the investigator is required to  proactively follow  each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, non- serious AEs of special interest (as defined in  
Section  9.2, and AEs (SAEs and non- serious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected 
SARS -CoV- 2 infection will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, the event is deemed irreversible, or until the participant is lost to 
follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3) or for suspected cases of SARS -CoV- 2, until infection is 
ruled out.

9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
 
Sponsor or designee will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics 
committees according to local applicable laws including Regulation EU No. 536/2014 and FDA Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements. 
9.2.5 Pregnancy 
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is pregnant or may have been  pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5 half- lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical  Monitor/designee of this event  and complete  and forward  a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS  Designee within  24 hours of awareness of the event. Pregnancy reporting must  follow  the 
same transmission timing and processes to BMS as those used for SAEs, in accordance with reporting procedures described in Appendix 3. 
If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of 
study treatment, or re -initiation of study treatment, a discussion between the investigator and the 
BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occur. If, for whatever reason, the pregnancy has ended, 
confirmed  by negative serum  pregnancy test, treatment may be resumed (at least 3 weeks and not 
greater than 6 weeks after the pregnancy has ended), following approvals of participant/sponsor/IRB/EC, as applicable. 
Follow- up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partner,  the female partner must sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of  this information. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
In cases where a study treatment can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to potentially cause fetal toxicity,  and if any sexual activity  (eg, vaginal, anal,  oral) has occurred

 between  a male  participant and a pregnant WOCBP  partner(s),  the information  should be reported 
to the Sponsor or designee,  even  if the male  participant  has undergone a successful  vasectomy.  In 
order for Sponsor or designee to collect  any pregnancy surveillance information from  the female 
partner, the female partner(s) must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this 
information. Information  on the pregnancy  will be collected  on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back -up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning. 
• Any laboratory test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets the definition  of an SAE 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study treatment 
discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific corrective therapy  
 
It is expected  that wherever possible,  the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
9.2.7 Potential  Drug  Induced Liver  Injury (DILI) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver- related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of  a potential  drug induced liver injury (DILI) event.  All occurrences 
of potential DILIs meeting the defined criteria must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 and 
Appendix 3 for reporting details). A potential DILI is defined as:  
1) Aminotransaminases  (ALT  or AST)  elevation  > 3 times  upper limit  of normal (ULN), 
AND 
2) Total  bilirubin  > 2 times  ULN,  without initial findings  of cholestasis (elevated  serum  alkaline 
phosphatase), 
AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
 
9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations,  electrocardiogram 
(ECG), x -ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol 
should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

 9.2.8.1 Immune- mediated Adverse Events  
Immune -mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune- mediated mechanism or 
immune -mediated component for which non- inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection or tumor 
progression) have been  ruled  out. IMAEs  can include events with an alternate etiology which  were 
exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunity. Information supporting the assessment will be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.  
9.3 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental  or intentional administration  of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses that meet the regulatory definition of SAE will be reported as an SAE (see Appendix 3).  
9.4 Safety  
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are listed  in Section 2: Schedule of Activities.  
9.4.1 Physical Examinations  
See Schedule of Activities.  
9.4.2 
Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will be recorded per Section 2 (Schedule of Activities). Vital signs include 
heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and temperature. It is preferred that the same arm be 
used for all blood pressure readings, if possible. 
9.4.3 Electrocardiograms  
All participants will have 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) done during Screening and at End of 
the Recovery Period, as specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2).  
9.4.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
A list of the clinical  laboratory  analyses to be tested  is provided in Table  9.4.4-1. All clinical  safety 
laboratory assessments will be performed locally per the Schedule of Activities (Section 2 ). 
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The Investigator or 
qualified Sub- Investigator will review all results for clinical significance. Any laboratory result 
deemed clinically significant (ie, is associated with signs and symptoms, requires treatment, or requires follow up) will be recorded as an AE as described in Section 9.2.

 relative  to the start of the first study drug administration.  All on-treatment time points are intended 
to align  with days on which  study drug is administered;  if dosing occurs on a different day, the PK 
and IMG  sampling  should be adjusted accordingly. If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, 
then the predose sample should be collected just  prior to the delayed  dose. However,  if a predose 
sample is  collected  but the dose is  subsequently delayed,  an additional predose sample  should not 
be collected.  
Further details of sample collection, processing, and shipment will be provided in the laboratory 
procedures manual. Serum  PK samples will be analyzed  for nivolumab/ipilimumab  by a validated 
ligand binding assay. Additionally, selected serum PK samples may be analyzed by exploratory 
and/or research methods  that measure nivolumab and/or ipilimumab; exploratory/research  results 
will not be reported.  
Immunogenicity  samples  will be analyzed  for anti-nivolumab/ipilimumab  antibodies by validated 
immunogenicity  assays. Samples may  also be analyzed for  neutralizing  antibodies by a validated 
method. Serum samples may be analyzed by exploratory and/or research methods that measures anti-drug antibodies for  technology exploration purposes; exploratory/research  results  will not be 
reported. Serum/plasma samples designated for PK or may also be used 
for immunogenicity analysis if required (eg, insufficient volume for complete immunogenicity assessment or to follow up on suspected immunogenicity related AE).

 9.8.1 Tumor Tissue Specimens  
Archival (or fresh)  FFPE tumor tissue is to  be collected  within  3 months prior to enrollment with 
no intervening systemic anti -cancer treatment between time of acquisition and randomization. A 
sample block or 5 to 10 unstained slides must be submitted to the central laboratory. In order for 
the participant to be treated, the sample must meet the minimum quality requirements, as 
determined by the central laboratory during the Screening Period.  
 
Tumor samples must be a core biopsy, excisional biopsy, or surgical specimen. Biopsy of 
pathological lymph nodes can be submitted. Fine needle aspirates/biopsy or other cytology 
specimens are  insufficient for enrollment.  Target  lesion  should not be biopsies  unless there  are no 
other lesions suitable for biopsy. If  a target lesion is used  for biopsy, the lesion must be > 2 cm  in 
the longest diameter.

records information about hospital  admissions, including number of days spent in various wards 
and discharge diagnosis, as well as non-protocol specified  visits  related  to study therapy,  including 
date of visit, reason for visit, and type of visit. The health care resource utilization data will be used to support subsequent economic evaluations.

10 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size is determined  based  on the primary  endpoint of  PFS between  Arm A and Arm C. 
A total of 888 participants are planned to be randomized across the 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 
ratio.  
If the PFS comparison between  Arm A and Arm C is statistically  significant,  then 0.05 alpha will 
be passed  to the OS comparison between  Arm A vs Arm C, followed  by OS comparison between 
Arm B vs Arm C. All  tests will be 2-sided. Figure  10.1- 1 graphically presents the planned testing 
procedure.  
Figure  10.1- 1: Testing  Procedure for Primary  and Key Secondary  Endpoints  
 
Abbreviations:  OS, overall  survival;  PFS, progression -free survival. 
Note: Arms A, B, and C are described in Section 5.1. 
 
UPDATE: Due to the Ukraine -Russia conflict, the Sponsor made the decision to discontinue 
clinical trials in Russia by the end of June 2022 as a result of increased logistical challenges of 
ensuring continuity of care for study participants.  The study team  performed  an assessment  of data 
quality and concluded that data collected among Russian participants (30 randomized) appeared adequate for inclusion in the primary analysis, though many participants would not be able to receive the full course of their randomized intervention and would have short follow -up. A 
sensitivity analysis for exclusion of all Russian participants is planned. Consequentially, enrollment was permitted to continue slightly beyond the original target of 888 randomized participants  to account for potential data and statistical  power loss in Russian  sites and, ultimately, 
925 participants were randomized.

The stopping  boundaries  for the above  PFS interim  and final analyses  10.1.1 Sample Size Justification for PFS 
Based on the 4 -year update from the PACIFIC trial and the PROCLAIM PFS curve,3,10 a non - 
constant PFS hazard was observed. For the sample size calculation for PFS per BICR between 
Arm A and Arm C, a piecewise exponential distribution with a 3-month delay  period was assumed.  
 
A total of  (ie, progression events or deaths) in Arms A and C will provide 
approximately 82% power considering the above PFS assumptions with 0.05 2- sided  alpha. Two 
will be based on the actual number of PFS events at the time of the analysis using Lan- DeMets 
alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. 
 
  
 
However, the PFS analyses are driven by the required 
number of events, and the actual  analysis time will depend on actual  enrollment speed  and events 
accrual and may be different from projections.

observed, then subsequent OS analyses will be triggered  by accumulating OS  events as described

However, the timing of the OS final analysis is based on OS 
events accrual  rate from  an exponential distribution. Assuming a lower  events rate towards the end 
of the curve, the final analysis may occur later.

10.3 Statistical  Analyses  
In general, continuous data will be summarized by descriptive statistics, including number of 
participants,  mean,  standard  deviation, median, minimum,  and maximum.  Categorical  data will be 
summarized by the number and percentage of participants. Unless otherwise specified, data will be summarized by treatment arm.  
No formal testing for PFS between Arm B vs Arm C nor PFS/OS for Arm A vs Arm B will be performed. These evaluations will be performed  descriptively,  as outlined in the statistical analysis 
plan.  
A detailed  description  of analysis  methods will be provided in the statistical analysis  plan (SAP).  
The statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before the first efficacy interim database lock. The SAP will describe the selection of participants  to be included in the analyses, 
and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. Below is a summary of planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.

Primary  analyses  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Progression- 
free Survival 
(per BICR) 
A vs C  Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and 
the first date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1, as determined by BICR, or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurs first, regardless of receipt of subsequent anti -cancer 
therapy prior to the documented progression as confirmed by BICR. Participants who die without a reported  progression will be considered  to have  progressed  on the date of their death. 
Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable 
tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not 
die will be censored on their date of randomization. First on -study scans are expected only 
after completion of CCRT (ie, last dose of radiotherapy) during approximately the Week 3 Recovery Period check. Following that, tumor assessments are scheduled to be performed at week 24 (±7 days) from the date of randomization, then every 12 weeks (±7 days) for 36 
months (from date of randomization), then every 24 weeks (±7 days) after 36 months from 
randomization. Tumor assessments will be submitted to BICR until BICR -confirmed disease 
progression.  
 A log- rank test stratified by 3 stratification factors (age, PD -L1 status, and stage) will be used 
to compare PFS between Arm A and Arm C at 0.05 level. A Cox proportional hazards model with treatment  as the single  covariate,  stratified  by the above  stratification  factors,  will be used 
to estimate  the hazard  ratio and corresponding  95% CI. The Kaplan -Meier  method  will be used 
to further summarize PFS, including PFS curves, medians with corresponding 95% CIs. The PFS rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, etc months will also be estimated depending on minimum follow -up 
duration.  
Secondary/Exploratory  analyses  
 
Overall 
Survival  
A vs C Overall  survival (OS) is defined  as the time between  the date of randomization  and the date of 
death due to any cause. OS will be censored on the last date a participant was known to be alive. OS will be followed continuously while participants are on the study treatment and  
every  3 months  via in-person  or phone  contact  after participants  discontinue  the study 
treatment.  
B vs C OS will be analyzed  using  similar  method  as PFS. 
A vs B OS in A vs C, B vs C will be tested  following  the hypothesis  testing  procedure  described  in 
Section 10.1. No hypothesis testing will be performed for A vs B.

Objective 
Response Rate 
(ORR) per 
BICR  
A vs C 
B vs C 
A vs B Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number of participants with a confirmed 
BOR of CR or PR divided by the number  of randomized  participants  for each treatment  group. 
BOR is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the date of randomization 
and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST 1.1 as determined by BICR 
or the date of initiation of local therapy or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy, 
whichever occurs first. For participants without documented progression or local therapy or 
subsequent anticancer therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR determination. For participants who continue study medication beyond progression, the BOR 
should be determined based on response designations recorded at the time of the initial 
RECIST 1.1 defined progression.  
An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using a Cochran -Mantel 
Haenszel  (CMH) methodology  stratified  by the 3 stratification  factors  (age,  PD-L1 status,  and 
stage). The ORR difference between the 2 treatment arms with its 95% CI will be reported.  
The ORR  and its corresponding  95% exact  CI will also be calculated  by Clopper -Pearson 
method for each randomized arm.  
 
 
 
 
Time to 
Response and 
Duration of 
Response (per 
BICR)  Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the first objective documentation of PR or better assessed per BICR. Time to response is restricted to 
the population  of participants  who achieved  a best response  of PR or better  assessed per BICR.  
Duration of objective response (DoR) is defined as the time between the date of first 
confirmed response to the date of the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1) 
per BICR assessment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who 
neither  progress  nor die will be censored  on the date of their last evaluable tumor  assessment. 
Participants who started any subsequent anticancer therapy without a prior reported 
progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to or on the date of 
initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy. DoR will be evaluated for responders (ie, participants with confirmed CR or PR) only as assessed by BICR.  
The Kaplan -Meier  method  will be used to further summarize  DOR, including DOR  curves, 
medians with corresponding 95% CIs.  
PFS, ORR,  
DoR,  TTR per 
Investigator 
assessment of 
tumor  imaging  See definition  of endpoints  above.  Per Investigator  assessment of tumor  imaging  according  to 
RECIST 1.1.  
ORR,  PFS, DOR,  TTR assessed  by investigator  per RECIST  1.1 will be analyzed  similarly  to 
these endpoints assessed by BICR. No hypothesis testing will be performed.  
 
 
 
Time  to death 
or distant 
metastases 
(TTDM)  TTDM is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of distant metastasis or death in the absence of distant metastasis. Distant metastasis is defined as any new lesion  that is outside  of the thorax (except  for heart)  according  to RECIST  1.1, as assessed 
by the Investigator. Participants who have not developed distant metastasis or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last  
RECIST 1.1 assessment. However, if the participant has distant metastasis or dies after 2 or 
more missed visits, the participant will be censored at the time of the latest RECIST 1.1 
assessment prior  to the 2 missed  visits.  If the participant has no visits  or does not have  baseline 
data they  will be censored at Day 1 unless they die within 2 visits of baseline.  
TTDM will be analyzed  similarly  as primary  time-to-event  endpoints  as PFS, OS. No 
hypothesis testing will be performed.  
 
PFS on Next 
Line Therapy 
(PFS- 2) PFS on next -line therapy (PFS -2) is defined as the time from randomization to objectively 
documented progression,  per investigator  assessment,  after the next line of therapy or to death 
from any  cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who were alive and without progression 
after the next line of therapy will be censored at last known alive date.  
PFS-2 will be analyzed  similarly  as primary  time-to-event  endpoints  as PFS, OS. No 
hypothesis testing will be performed.

 APPENDIX  2 STUDY GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS  
The term ‘Participant’ is  used in the protocol to refer  to a person who has consented  to participate 
in the clinical research  study. The term ‘Subject’  used in the eCRF  is intended to refer  to a person 
(Participant) who has consented to participate in the clinical research study.  
REGULATORY AND ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
This study will be conducted in accordance with: 
• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration 
of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines Good Clinical Practice (GCP),  
• as defined by the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH)  
• in accordance with the ethical  principles  underlying Regulation EU No. 536/2014  
• United  States  Code of Federal  Regulations, Title  21, Part 50 (21CFR50)  
• applicable local  requirements.  
 
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol  and any amendments 
and the participant informed consent will receive approval/favorable opinion by Institutional 
Review  Board/Independent Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC),  and regulatory authorities according to 
applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study.  
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor or designee immediately. A serious breach is a breach  of the conditions and principles  of Good Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  (occurring in 
any country) in connection with that trial or the protocol  related  to the trial which  is likely  to affect 
to a significant degree the safety or physical or mental integrity of 1 or more participants of the 
trial or the scientific value of the trial.  
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform their respective tasks.  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where  sanctions have  been  invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  BOARD/INDEPENDENT  ETHICS COMMITTEE  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion from
 the IRB/IEC  for the protocol,  consent  form, participant  recruitment  materials 
(eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to participants. 
The investigator or BMS  should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator Brochure 
or product labeling information to be provided to participants and any updates. The in
vestigator,  Sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/IEC  with reports,  updates and other

 COMPLIANCE WITH  THE PROTOCOL  AND PROTOCOL  REVISIONS  
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study participants.  
If a deviation  or change to  a protocol is implemented  to eliminate  an immediate  hazard(s)  prior to 
obtaining relevant  approval/favorable opinion(s) the deviation or change will be submitted, as soon 
as possible to:  
• IRB/IEC  
• Regulatory Authority(ies),  if applicable  by local  regulations (per national requirements)  
 
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority must be sent to BMS.  
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from participants  currently  enrolled  in the study if they are affected  by the amendment; and (3) the new 
form must be used to obtain consent from new participants prior to enrollment.  
If the revision  is done via an administrative  letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE  
Investigators and sub- Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information  on financial interests  during the course of 
the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. 
INFORMED CONSENT  PROCESS  
Investigators must ensure that participants are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to 
participate.  
In situations where  consent cannot be given by participants,  their legally  acceptable representatives 
(as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant volunteers to participate.  
The Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) 
sample informed consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and 
applicable regulatory  requirements.  The sample informed consent form  will adhere  to the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 Investigators must: 
• Provide a copy of the consent form and written  information  about the study in the language in 
which  the participant is most proficient  prior to clinical  study participation.  The language must 
be non-technical and easily understood. 
• Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.  
• Obtain  an informed  consent signed and personally dated  by the participant or the  participant's 
legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion.  
• Obtain  the IRB/IEC’s  written  approval/favorable opinion of the written  informed  consent form 
and any other information  to be provided to the participants,  prior to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
 
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and  the participant subsequently becomes capable  of making  and communicating his  or 
her informed  consent during the study, consent must  additionally be obtained from the participant.  
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the participant's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be documented.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify participants must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the participant’s signed 
ICF and, in the US, the participant’s signed HIPAA Authorization. 
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records.  
Participants unable to give their written consent (e.g., stroke or participants with or severe 
dementia)  may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally  acceptable representative. 
The participant must also be informed  about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with 
his or her understanding, and should this participant become capable, he or she should personally 
sign and date the consent form  as soon  as possible. The explicit  wish  of a participant  who is unable 
to give his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing 
information  to refuse  participation  in, or to be withdrawn  from,  the clinical study at any time should 
be considered by the investigator. 
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study participants are the most important considerations 
and should prevail over interests of science and society.

 BMS COMMITMENT  TO DIVERSITY IN CLINICAL  TRIALS  
The mission of BMS is to transform patients’ lives through science by discovering, developing, 
and delivering innovative medicines that help them prevail over serious diseases. 
BMS is committed to doing its part to ensure that patients have a fair and just opportunity to 
achieve optimal health outcomes.  
BMS is working to improve the recruitment of  a diverse participant population with the goal  that 
the clinical  trial becomes more  reflective  of the real-world  population and the people impacted  by 
the diseases studied.  
DATA  PROTECTION,  DATA PRIVACY,  AND DATA SECURITY 
BMS collects and processes personal data of study participants, patients, health care providers, and researchers for biopharmaceutical research and development to advance innovative, high - 
quality medicines that address the medical  needs of patients.  BMS  ensures the privacy, protection, 
and confidentiality  of such personal  data to comply with applicable laws. To achieve these goals, 
BMS  has internal  policies  that indicate measures and controls for processing personal data. BMS 
adheres to these standards to ensure that collection  and processing of personal data are limited  and 
proportionate to the purpose for which BMS collects such personal data. This purpose is clearly and unambiguously notified  to the individual at  the time  of collection  of personal data.  In the true 
spirit of science,  BMS  is dedicated  to sharing clinical  trial information  and data with  participants, 
medical/research  communities,  the media,  policy makers,  and the general public. This is done in a 
manner that safeguards participant  privacy and informed  consent while  respecting  the integrity  of 
national regulatory systems. Clinical trial data, health -related research, and pharmacovigilance 
activities on key -coded health data transferred by BMS across national borders is done in 
compliance with the relevant data protection laws in the country and GCP requirements. 
BMS protects Personal Information with adequate and appropriate security  controls as indicated 
under the data protection laws. To align with the recommended security standards, BMS has 
adopted internal security standards and policies to protect personal data at every stage of its processing.  
To supplement these standards, BMS enters into Clinical Trial Agreements (CTAgs) with confidentiality obligations to ensure proper handling and protection of personal data by third parties accessing and handling personal data.  
BMS takes unauthorized access and disclosure of Personal Information very  seriously. BMS has 
adopted the security standards that include National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity  Framework  for studies in  the US.  BMS  aligns with  these  standards to  continuously 
assess and improve its ability  to protect, detect,  and respond to cyberattacks and other unauthorized 
attempts to  access personal data. These standards also aid in mitigating possible adverse effects. 
Furthermore, BMS Information Technology has defined 6 principles to protect our digital resources and information: 
1) Responsibilities of IT Personnel  
2) Securing the BMS Digital Infrastructure

SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attributable,  whether the data are hand- written  on paper  or entered 
electronically.  If source data are created  (first  entered),  modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computerized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such systems must be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/or electronic signatures. Such  systems may include, but are not limited  to, electronic medical/health  records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol required assessments, and/or drug accountability records).  
When  paper records from  such systems are used in place of electronic  format to perform regulated 
activities, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy consists of a copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy having all of the same attributes and information as the original. 
STUDY TREATMENT  RECORDS  
Records for study treatments  (whether supplied by BMS,  its vendors, or the site) must substantiate 
study treatment integrity and traceability from receipt, preparation, administration, and through 
destruction or return. Records must be made  available for review at the request of BMS/designee 
or a Health Authority.

CASE REPORT  FORMS  
An investigator  is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories  designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or  the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and analyzed in an effort  to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may  be requested  for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study. 
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs will be prepared  for all data collection  fields  except  for fields  specific  to SAEs  and pregnancy, which  will 
be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively. If electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used.

 APPENDIX 3  ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Adverse Event Definition:  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting  medical  condition in a clinical  investigation participant administered  study treatment 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom, or disease temporally  associated  with the use of study  treatment,  whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements),  including  those that worsen  from  baseline,  considered  clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of  the investigator.  Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available.  Once  the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing  condition including either an  increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected  or diagnosed after study intervention  administration  even  though it 
may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  drug-drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  overdose  of either  study intervention 
or a concomitant  medication.  Overdose,  as a verbatim  term (as reported by the investigator), 
should not be reported  as an AE/SAE  unless it is an intentional overdose taken  with possible 
suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of  sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term 
Events NOT Meeting  the AE  Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which  an untoward medical  occurrence did not occur  (social  and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital). 
 
DEFINITION OF SAE 
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE  even if serious conditions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused  death  if it were 
more severe)  
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing  hospitalization  (see NOTE 
below)  
NOTE:  
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs  in BMS  clinical studies:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective  surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol  for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy) 
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases 
• admission  encountered for  another life  circumstance that carries  no bearing  on health  status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of  housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)  
• admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy in the absence of any other  SAEs  (applies 
to oncology protocols)  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical  event(s) that may not  be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious  outcomes listed  in the definition  above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.)

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: 30 -Oct-2023  185 
Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 Pregnancy and potential  drug induced liver injury (DILI) must  follow  the same transmission  timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).  
Any component of a study  endpoint that is  considered related  to study therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).  
EVALUATING  AES AND SAES 
 
Assessment  of Causality  
• The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study intervention and  each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or  
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors,  as well as the temporal  relationship of the event to study intervention  administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information  to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However,  it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality  assessment is one of  the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required.  (Note: Follow- 
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study treatment or if new 
information  becomes available,  the SAE  report must be updated and submitted  within  24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs  must be followed  to resolution or stabilization.

 REPORTING  OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE 
 
• SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs  must be recorded  on the SAE  Report Form.  
− The required  method for SAE  data reporting is through the eCRF.  
− The paper SAE Report Form is only intended as a back- up option when the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system is unavailable/not functioning for transmission of the eCRF 
to BMS (or designee). 
♦ In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission  
♦ When  paper forms  are used, the original paper forms  are to remain  on site 
• Pregnancies must be  recorded  on a paper Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  and transmitted  via

 APPENDIX 4  WOMEN  OF CHILDBEARING  POTENTIAL  DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing  Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following  categories  are not considered  WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal  female with  1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of other  biological or physiological causes.  In addition,  females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.  
 
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR  FEMALE  PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING 
POTENTIAL  
One of the highly effective  methods of contraception listed  below is required  during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 months after the end of study 
treatment, or according to local Product label requirements for individual chemotherapy agents, 
whichever is longer.* 
 
 
Highly  Effective  Contraceptive Methods  That  Are User Dependent

ovulation b  
• Intrauterine  hormone- releasing  system  (IUS)c  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c  
• Bilateral tubal  occlusion  
• Vasectomized  partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male  sexual  partner of the WOCBP  and the absence of sperm  has been  confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
• Sexual  abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual  intercourse during the entire  period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2.  
• Acceptable alternate  methods of highly effective contraception  must be discussed  in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence 
NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local  regulations  regarding  the use of contraceptive  methods  for participants  participating  in clinical  studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive  method.  Hormonal contraception  is permissible  only when  there  is sufficient  evidence  that 
the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result  in increased  exposures  that could be potentially  hazardous.  In this case,  alternative  methods 
of contraception should be utilized.  
c Intrauterine  devices  and intrauterine  hormone  releasing  systems  are acceptable methods  of contraception  in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness

• Withdrawal  (coitus interruptus).  
• Spermicide only 
• Lactation  amenorrhea  method (LAM)  
 
* Local laws  and regulations may require use of alternative and/or  additional  contraception 
methods.  
 
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR  MALE  PARTICIPANTS WITH  PARTNER(S)  OF 
CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL.  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential  are eligible to participate if they 
agree to the following during the treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure.  
• Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the need to 
comply with contraception instructions as directed by the investigator. 
• Male participants are required to use a condom for study duration and until end of relevant 
systemic exposure defined as 7 months after the end of  study treatment, or according to local 
Product label requirements for individual chemotherapy agents, whichever is longer. 
• Female partners of males participating in the study to consider use of effective methods of 
contraception until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 7 months after the end of 
treatment in the male participant, or according to local Product label requirements for individual chemotherapy agents, whichever is longer. 
• Male participants with a pregnant or breastfeeding  partner must  agree  to remain  abstinent from 
penile vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration during the treatment  and until 7 months after the end of study  treatment,  or according to local 
Product label requirements for individual chemotherapy agents, whichever is longer. 
• Refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study  treatment and until 7 months after 
the end of study treatment, or according to local Product label requirements for individual chemotherapy agents, whichever is longer.

 APPENDIX 6  MANAGEMENT  ALGORITHMS  FOR  STUDIES UNDER CTCAE 
VERSION 4.0  
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all immuno -oncology agents and regimens. 
For additional guidance on management of durvalumab- related toxicity, please refer to the 
approved Product Label for durvalumab. 
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately 
treated.  
Corticosteroids  are a primary  therapy  for immuno -oncology drug- related  adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low - 
grade toxicity.  The lower  bioavailability  of oral corticosteroids  should be taken  into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.  
The frequency  and severity  of the related  adverse  events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

 APPENDIX 7  RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) WITH  BMS MODIFICATIONS 
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS  
Solid tumors will be evaluated using R esp onse Evaluation C riteria In Solid T umors version 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1) guideline with BMS modifications.1 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable as 
follows:  
1.1 Measurable  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10 mm  by CT/MRI  scan  (scan  slice  thickness no greater  than 5 mm),  or ≥2x slice  thickness if 
greater than 5mm.  
Malignant lymph  nodes:  To be considered  pathologically enlarged and measurable,  a lymph node 
must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when  assessed  by CT/MRI  scan (scan  slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified  as target lesions must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of 
≥ 15 mm by  CT/MRI  scan.  Only  the short axis of  these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Nodal  size is normally  reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal  or coronal). The smaller  of these measures is the short  axis. For 
example,  an abdominal node which  is reported  as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm 
and qualifies  as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥  10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non- target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. 
Note:  Lesions on X- Ray are not to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.  
1.2 Non-Measurable  
All other lesions are considered non-measurable,  including small lesions (longest diameter  
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis)  as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
Note:  Lesions on X- Ra
 y are not to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.

 1.3 Special  Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
1.3.1 Bone lesions  
• Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic  bone lesions or mixed  lytic -blastic  lesions,  with identifiable soft tissue  components , that 
can be evaluated by  cross sectional  imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
•  
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’  And ‘Non -Target’  Lesions  
When more  than one measurable lesion is  present  at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded).  
Note: A maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system. For example, a maximum  of 
two lung lesions can be selected  (selected  from  one lung or one lesion  from each).  A maximum of 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated  measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest  lesion does 
not lend itself to  reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
A sum  of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is  added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters  will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’,  ‘absent’,  or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more  details  to follow). In addition, it is  possible to record multiple non -target lesions  involving 
the same organ  as a single item on the case record  form (eg, ‘multiple  enlarged pelvic lymph  nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

 2 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
• Complete  Response (CR): Disappearance  of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph  nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest  on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must  also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more  new lesions is also 
considered progression). 
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient  shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
• Not Evaluable  (NE):  If one or more  target lesions  cannot be measured  or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too small to measure (due to missing or poor quality images), and the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above.  
 
2.1.1 Special  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target Lesions  
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodes  
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when  lymph nodes are included as target  lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short  axis of < 10 mm. Case report forms  or other data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate section where, in order  to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. 
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’  
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non- nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded  on the case report form.  If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the measurement  should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present  and is faintly  seen but too small  to measure,  a default  value of 5 mm should be assigned 
as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely  that this rule will be used for lymph nodes  since 
they usually have a definable size when  normal and are frequently  surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default  value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 default value  is derived from  the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore 
providing this default value will prevent  false  responses or progressions based  upon measurement 
error.  To reiterate,  however, if the radiologist is able to provide  an actual measure,  that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment  
When non- nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be 
added together  to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
2.2 Evaluation of Non-Target  Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of  the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non- target  lesions. While  some  non- target  lesions may actually  be measurable,  they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at  the time points specified in 
the protocol. 
• Complete  Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non- target lesions.  All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  
• Progressive  Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing  non- target lesions.  
 
2.2.1 Special  Notes  on Assessment  of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
The concept of progression of non- target disease requires additional explanation as follows:  
2.2.1.1 When the patient  also has measurable disease  
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there 
must be an overall  level  of substantial  worsening in non- target disease  such  that,  even  in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non- target lesions is 
usually not sufficient  to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural  effusions, pericardial 
effusions and ascites  will not be followed as target  or non- target  lesions and will not contribute  to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
2.2.1.2 W
 hen the patient  has only non- measurable disease  
This circumstance arises in some trials  when  it is not a criterion  of study entry  to have measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment  to factor  into the interpretation  of an increase in non- measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily  quantified  (by definition: 
Clinical  Protocol 
BMS -936558  CA20973L  
nivolumab  
Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: 30 -Oct-2023  205 
Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 if all lesions are truly  non- measurable)  a useful test that can be applied when  assessing  patients  for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based  on the change 
in non- measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease:  ie, an increase  in tumor burden representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should  be considered  to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal  to have 
objective criteria to apply to non- measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.  
2.2.2 New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions  denotes disease  progression; therefore,  some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable  to differences in  scanning  technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre- existing lesions).  This is particularly important when  the patient’s baseline 
lesions show  partial or complete  response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion  may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not. 
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered  new lesions and will not contribute  to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is seen  on a post- baseline imaging  exam,  a comment may be made,  but the appearance 
of a new fluid  collection alone should not result in an assessment of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion  and will indicate  disease  progression. An  example of this is  the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identified on Chest X -Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).  
If a new lesion  is equivocal,  for example  because of its small  size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. While FDG -PET 
response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of 
FDG- PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible ‘new’  disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging  can be identified  according 
to the following algorithm:  
1) N
egative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of  PD based 
on a new lesion.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: 30 -Oct-2023  206 
Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 2) No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If  the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of  disease on CT, additional follow -up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If  the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
2.3 Response Assessment  
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from  the start of the study  treatment until 
disease progression or the last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmation  and censoring rules  regarding  subsequent therapy. The patient’s  best overall response 
assignment  will depend on the findings of both target  and non- target  disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.  
2.3.2 Time Point Response  
At each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Table 2.3.2 -1 provides a 
summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have measurable  disease  at baseline.  When  patients have non- measurable  (therefore  non- target)  disease 
only, Table 2.3.2-2 is to be used.

a Non-CR/non -PD is preferred  over SD for non-target  disease since  SD is increasingly  used as endpoint  for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.  
 
2.3.3 Best Overall Response  
Best response determination of complete or partial response requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial  responses may be claimed  only if the criteria  for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥ 4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3- 1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified 
minimum time from the date of first treatment or randomization date.  
For example, if the first scheduled follow -up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made  after the participant  is on-study for a minimum 
of 6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study of 35 days from  the 
reference start date (reference date is considered  Day 1 on study). If the participant is  not on-study 
for at least this amount of time, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.  
Special  note on response assessment:  When  nodal disease is included in the sum of target  lesions 
and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement  should be recorded  even  though the nodes are normal in order  not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

a If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria  relative  to baseline,  makes  the disease PD at that point (since  disease must  have  reappeared  after CR).  Best 
response  would depend  on whether minimum  duration  for SD was met. However,  sometimes  ‘CR’  may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is  PR. 
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans 
Verification  of Response:  To be assigned a status  of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by consecutive or  subsequent repeat  assessments that should be performed no 
less than 28  days after the criteria for response are first met. Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may provide confirmation of a previously identified CR even with an intervening NE or PR  (eg, 
CR NE CR or CR PR CR). Subsequent documentation of a PR may provide confirmation of a 
previously identified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (eg, PR NE PR or PR SD PR). However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR/CRs for confirmation. 
Verification  of Pr
 ogression : Progression of disease  should be verified  in cases where  progression 
is equivocal. If repeat  scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared  using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the participant is considered to not have progressive disease.

 APPENDIX 8  SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NODAL GTV 
DELINEATION BASED ON FDG -PET–CT AND E(B)US- NA 
 
 
When  incidental nodal irradiation  is low,  such as with IMRT  or VMAT,  it is advised  to add 
E(B)US -NA to FDG- PET–CT for mediastinal staging as it may:  
• decrease geographical miss 
• detect  other benign reasons for PET -positivity  
• confirm malignancy in PET-positive LN 
Do NOT  exclude LN that are PET- positive  and E(B)US -negative from GTV as FN rate 
remains high (14% -16%), except if:  
• a clear  benign  reason  for PET- positivity  is found at pathological examination e.g. 
anthracosilicosis or granulomatosis  
• high suspicion of infection  with symmetrical  pattern  and less FDG-avid compared with 
primary tumor; take into account clinical parameters  
• negative pathology at E(B)US -NA is confirmed  by mediastinoscopy  
Select  carefully  which  LN station  to be sampled  with E(B)US  under local  anesthesia:  
• confirm malignancy or find benign etiology for PET- positivity  
• sample “suspicious” PET-negative LN 
• consider to discuss the selection  of critical LN with endoscopist beforehand 
• E(B)US  should be performed  after FDG -PET–CT  scan to avoid  FN PET-positive LN

Section  Number  & Title  Description of Change  Brief  Rationale  
3, INTRODUCTION  
3.3, Benefit/Risk  Assessment  
5.4.1, Rationale for Study 
Population  and Study Comparator  Added  sentence  indicating  that 4- year 
follow  up data results  were  consistent 
with previously cited data.  Added  updated  data for 
durvalumab.

10.1,  Sample  Size Determination 
Figure 10.1 -1 
10.2,  Populations  for Analyses  
10.3.1,  Efficacy  Analyses  Updated PFS assumptions and added 
OS for Arm A vs Arm C as a 
secondary objective. This includes 
updates for control arm assumption, 
delay effect, testing procedures, 
comparisons  between  arms,  method of 
analysis descriptions.  To mitigate  prolonged timing, 
OS is now a key secondary 
endpoint and will be tested 
hierarchically after PFS.  
3.2.3,  Clinical  Experience with 
Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab 
Combination Therapy  Removed  statement  about DoR for 
CA209012.  
Updated safety data for  
CheckMate 227 and added  data for 
CheckMate 9LA.  
Removed  TMB  data for 
CheckMate 227. Added  supporting  information 
for use of nivolumab in combination  with ipilimumab.

Nivolumab and CCRT  
5.4.4, Rationale of Concurrent 
Scheduling  of Nivolumab  with 
CCRT  
5.4.6,  Rationale of Backbone  CCRT  Updated  text with data from 
Keynote 799.  Added  supporting  information 
for use of nivolumab in 
combination with CCRT.  
3.3, Benefit/Risk  Assessment

Medications  Added text indicating non- live 
coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID -19) 
vaccinations will be considered a 
simple concomitant medication and 
handled in the same manner as other 
vaccines.  Current data suggests that non - 
live vaccine for COVID -19 will 
not negatively impact the benefit -risk for participants in 
this study.  
4, OBJECTIVES AND 
ENDPOINTS  For secondary  analysis  of ORR, 
reference to CR rate has been 
removed.  ORR (CR+PR) is of primary 
interest  and will be compared 
formally.

Section  6.1 Study  Population  Inclusion 
Criteria  Inclusion criteria  was updated  to 
include: 
• Participant’s  legal  authorized 
representative may sign the 
approved ICF on behalf of participant  
• Participants must be evaluated  
by the site’s multidisciplinary team (eg, medical oncologist, surgeon, radiologist) during 
screening  to assess  the suitability 
of the participant for the study.  
• Adherence to local  product  label 
contraception requirements for 
chemotherapy  request 
Given the multidisciplinary nature of treating patients with stage III NSCLC, 
evaluating  the suitability  of a 
participant  for the trial within 
the multidisciplinary team ensures that the study is in 
the best interest of the participant  
request  to 
account for labeling of chemotherapy agents  
To provide  flexibility  for 
clinical discretion of the Investigator

Section  6.2 Study  Population  Exclusion 
Criteria for Maintenance   
 
Radiotherapy dose constraints 
relaxed  for eligibility  purposes  
 
 
 
Exclusion criteria  was updated  for 
hearing loss, neuropathy  
 
 
 
 
Participants  with myelosuppression 
may be allowed to proceed with 
maintenance therapy at the 
investigator’s discretion  Radiotherapy planning may 
not be complete at time of eligibility assessment during 
Screening.  Radiotherapy  dose 
constraints are now specified 
in the separate radiotherapy 
guidelines document  
Criteria  for hearing  loss and 
neuropathy will adhere to 
local product label.  
Following  CCRT,  it may take 
longer than 42 days for 
hematological values to 
recover,  while  a participant  is 
in suitable health to continue with maintenance  IO therapy. 
Flexibility permitted per 
investigator’s clinical 
judgement of hematological values.

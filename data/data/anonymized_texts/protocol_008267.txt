 1 INTRODUCTION - BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background -Ovarian Cancer 
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths, and the fifth most 
common cause of cancer deaths in women  [1].  Although about 75% of patients with 
epithelial ovarian cancer will respond to first- line chemotherapy with  
carbo platin/cisplatin and paclitaxel, most patien ts with advanced stage epithelial ovarian 
cancer will recur. While there are several active cytotoxic agents for the treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, median survival after recurrence is about 2 years.   
Patients who recur more than 6 months after completing their adjuvant chemotherapy are referred to as “platinum -sensitive.”  They are oftentimes re -treated with a platinum agent, 
sometimes in combination with additional chemotherapy and, generally speaking , have a 
durable response to subsequent therapy.  Women who recur within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy are referred to as “platinum -resistant.”  These patients 
represent an unfortunate sub- group.  There are multiple agents with clinical activity in 
this setting but the ideal treatment modality is not known.  A recent Cochrane review identified topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel as having the greatest potential benefit for these patients.  The overall response rate for these agents 
ranges from 10 -15% in platinum- resistant disease.  The choice of treatment is often based 
on the side- effect profile and the patient’s specific situation  [2].  Given these poor 
response rates, new treatment options are needed in this patient population. 
 
1.2 Tivozanib Hydrochloride 
Tivozanib hydrochloride (also known as AV-951; previously known as KRN951) has the chemical name (N -{2-Chloro-4-[(6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinolyl)oxy]phenyl}- N'-(5-methyl-3- 
isoxazolyl) urea hydrochloride monohydrate). Tivozanib is a novel and potent pan-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity against all 3 VEGF receptors (VEGFR -1, -2, and -3) [3] . In 
nonclinical models and studies performed in humans, tivozanib has shown strong anti-angiogenesis and antitumor activity. VEGF is a potent induction factor, playing a central role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability of tumor tissues. By inhibiting VEGF-induced VEGFR activation, tivozanib inhibits angiogenesis and vascular permeability in tumor tissues, leading indirectly to inhibition of tumor growth  [4]. 
 
 Non-clinical  Studies 
Tivozanib hydrochloride potently and selectively inhibited VEGF ligand-induced VEGFR -1, 2, 3 phosphorylation and proliferation of human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs). In nonclinical studies, oral tivozanib hydrochloride was highly bioavailable (70%-80%). Daily oral administration of tivozanib hydrochloride demonstrated antitumor effects against a broad panel of tumor types subcutaneously engrafted into nude mice or rats. The minimum effective dose in rats was 0.2 mg/kg/day; average blood levels of tivozanib (free base) during continuous dosing at 0.2 mg/kg/day were estimated to be 70ng/mL. At these dose levels, the antitumor effects in nude rat xenograft models correlated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Conversely, the inhibitory activity of tivozanib hydrochloride in vitro against the growth of various cancer cells was weak (IC50 > 1), suggesting that the an ti-tumor effect of

  Amendment 8: 1 /3/201 9 
 tivozanib hydrochloride in vivo is not attributable to cytotoxicity or direct 
inhibition of the growth of tumor cells. This suggests that, by inhibiting VEGF-induced VEGFR activation, tivozanib hydrochloride inhibits angiogenesis and vascular permeability in tumor tissues, and such inhibition leads to an indirect but 
broad spectrum of inhibition of tumor growth. Neither long- term therapy nor 
intermittent dosing resulted in any detectable drug resistance in xenograft models.  
All safety pharmacology evaluations were performed after a single oral (gavage) administration of tivozanib hydrochloride. There were no significant gross behavioral or physiological changes observed in the Irwin test carried out in rats. In the monkey telemetry study, 0.015 or 0.3 mg/kg of tivozanib hydrochloride had 
no significant effect on arterial blood pressure (systolic, diastolic or mean), however, 3 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride increased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure transiently by as much  as 14 –19 mmHg. Evaluation of 
electrocardiograms showed that tivozanib hydrochloride had no effects on heart rate, respiration rate, PR, QT, or QTc intervals or QRS duration at any of the doses tested. Tivozanib hydrochloride produced no inhibition of huma n ether -a-
go-go (hERG) -related channel tail current in HEK293 cells stably transfected with 
hERG cDNA. Finally, tivozanib hydrochloride had no significant effect on the respiration rate or tidal volume of conscious rats at any of the time points or doses (0.3–400 mg/kg) tested  [5]. 
Nonclinical toxicology studies were conducted in multiples species (rats, mice, rabbits and nonhuman primates) to support the safety of tivozanib hydrochloride. The investigations included single- dose, repeat -dose (up to 39 weeks ), 
genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, mechanistic toxicology and phototoxicity studies. Toxicities were similar across species and consistent with toxicities expected for a drug of this class, namely hypertension, effects on growth plate hypertrophy, and renal and gastrointestinal effects. Higher drug doses generally caused more profound toxicities, including death, presumably attributable to direct pharmacological effects. In general, adverse findings resolved or showed signs of ongoing reversal after withdrawal of treatment. For all nonclinical studies, tivozanib hydrochloride was used, unless otherwise specified. For all oral nonclinical studies, tivozanib hydrochloride was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose vehicle. For IV studies, tivozanib hydrochloride was in a 40% dimethylacetamide solution.  
Tivozanib hydrochloride demonstrated antitumor effects against a broad spectrum of solid tumor models after daily oral administrations. These include human tumor xenografts subcutaneously implanted into nude mice and rats, as well as genetically engineered murine tumor models bearing specific human oncogenes such as mutated KRAS and HER2. 
The pharmacokinetics of tivozanib hydrochloride has been studied in rats and 
monkeys. Following a single oral dose, the time to max serum concentration for 
tivozanib (free base) is 2 -4 hours and the half- life is 7 -12 hours in both species. 
Systemic exposure was approximately dose-proportional in both species with

 slight accumulation after multiple doses, consistent with a long half- life relative to 
the dosing interval. The mean bioavailability of tivozanib (free base) in rats is 
71.8% - 82.4%. Following oral administration of [14C]-tivozanib hydrochloride to rats, radioactivity was widely distributed throughout t he tissues, reaching 
maximum tissue concentrations at four hours post- dosing. Following both oral and IV administration in rats, dosed radioactivity was recovered principally in the feces.  
Tivozanib hydrochloride has been assayed for protein binding in pl asma. The 
proportion of drug that is protein-bound is 97.6%, 99.3%, and 99.7% in monkey, rat, and human plasma, respectively. 
In vitro studies have shown that the cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzyme system is 
involved in the metabolism of tivozanib hydrochloride. The primary human hepatic isoform shown to be involved in the biotransformation of tivozanib hydrochloride was CYP3A4. 
A cardiovascular study in conscious telemetered cynomolgus monkeys did not 
show any effects on QTc interval. In the same study, oral administration of 0.015 or 0.3 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride to cynomolgus monkeys had no effects on arterial blood pressure; however, administration of 3.0 mg/kg tivozanib hydrochloride increased arterial blood pressure transiently by 14-19 mmHg. Tivozanib h ydrochloride had no marked effects on heart rate or ECG parameters 
at any tested dose.  
Nonclinical cutaneous and ocular phototoxicity studies indicate that tivozanib hydrochloride has no potential phototoxicity [6]. 
 Clinical Studies  
The substantial growth inhibition observed with tivozanib across pre- clinical 
models led to a Phase I study in advanced solid tumors. Key eligibility criteria included a life expectancy of at least 3 months and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 2.  Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis were excluded, as were patients with evidence of severe cardiovascular disease (i.e., uncontrollable hypertension or symptomatic heart failure). A starting dose of 2.0 mg was selected based on the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in primates. Extensive pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling was performed, and pharmacodynamic  studies were also performed to assess the effect of tivozanib therapy on serum VEGF and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2). A total of 41 patients were enrolled into the study. Metastatic colon cancer (n = 10), metastatic renal cell cancer  (MRCC)  (n = 9), and pancreatic cancer (n = 6) 
represented the most common tumor types represented in the study. Two patients in the 2.0 mg- daily cohort experienced dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
specifically, grade 3 asymptomatic proteinuria in one patient and grade 3 ataxia in another. No DLTs were observed in 6 patients treated at 1.0 mg daily, and therefore, an intermediate dose of 1.5 mg daily was explored. DLTs observed at this cohort included grade 3 and 4 transaminitis, uncontrollable hypertension,

 grade 3 fatigue, and grade 3 dyspnea. Given these toxicities, an expansion cohort 
including 12 patients treated at 1.0 mg daily was assessed. With respect to efficacy, two patients with mRCC had partial responses (one confirmed, one 
unconfirmed), whereas the majority of patients in the study (55.2%) had stable disease as a best response. Eight patients (20%) received therapy for more than 9 months. PK analyses accompanying the study showed a mean half- life of 4.7 days (range, 1.3 to 9.7 days). The time to achieve maximum serum concentration (tmax) was between 2 and 24 hours. Other correlative studies showed that although VEGF- A levels rose consistently at the sta rt of tivozanib therapy in a 
dose-dependent manner, these levels normalized after 14 days off therapy. In contrast, sVEGFR2 levels were reduced with increasing doses of tivozanib with the most marked decrease noted toward the end of the cycle (i.e., a larger decrease was observed at day 27 of therapy versus day 14). Dynamic contrast- enhanced 
MRI (DCE -MRI) was performed in a small subset of patients enrolled in the 
study (n = 8). Consistent with pre-clinical observations, a decrease in tumor vessel density w as observed over time [7]. 
In the setting of colorectal cancer, a Phase Ib study was conducted to assess the activity of tivozanib in combination with 5- flurouracil/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) 
chemotherapy. A regimen of modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6), which incorporates an 85 mg/m2 dose of oxaliplatin, was administered on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Escalating doses of tivozanib were administered on a 3 weeks on, 1 week off cycle. To supplement PK analyses, a single dose of tivozanib was given 5 days preceding therapy with tivozanib. A total of 30 patients were ultimately enrolled in the study, with a median age of 58 years. In total, 9 patients received tivozanib at a dose of 0.5 mg daily, 3 patients received 1.0 mg daily and 18 patients received 1.5 mg daily. The median duration of treatment was 5.2 months, and 30.8% of patients achieved a response with this combination. An additional 36% of patients had stable disease as a best response. With respect to safety, there were four DLTs observed. In dose escalation cohorts, a DLT of uncontrolled hypertension was observed. In an expansion cohort including an additional 10 patients, three DLTs were observed; specifically, two episodes of reversible transaminitis and one episode of uncontrolled hypertension. PK analyses  from this Phase I experience did not suggest any appreciable interaction 
between mFOLFOX6 and tivozanib ---- levels of tivozanib were akin to those observed with monotherapy. The appreciable safety and efficacy associated with the combination of mFOLFOX6 and tivozanib have culminated in a larger, randomized Phase II effort. In this study, patients will be randomized to receive either mFOLFOX6 with tivozanib or bevacizumab. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, response, and health- related 
quality of life (HRQoL). The study also aims to explore a variety of serum biomarkers, including VEGF- A, VEGF -C, and VEGF- D and will assess a 42 -
gene signature. A second ongoing effort will explore the combination of capecitabine and tivozanib in patients with all solid tumor types, but will include 
an expansion cohort in two malignancies ----namely, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of the

 combination. If a maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) is not reached in a general 
population of solid tumor patients, then a recommended Phase II dose will be 
determined and an expansion cohort including breast and colorectal cancer patients will be assessed  [8]. 
Assessment of tivozanib in breast cancer thus far is limited to a Phase I dose-finding study in combination with paclitaxel. The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of tivozanib in combination with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic bre ast cancer and to evaluate the PK profile 
of this combination. Patients with metastatic breast cancer with an ECOG performance status 0 - 2 and < 4 prior lines of therapy were enrolled. Notably, 
patients were allowed to receive one prior taxane and there w as no limit to the 
number of prior biologic or endocrinologic treatments, although prior treatment with a VEGF -TKI was not allowed. Key exclusion criteria included evidence of 
brain metastasis or pre -existing neuropathy. The treatment regimen included 
week ly paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 intravenous, 3 out of 4 weeks) and escalating doses 
of tivozanib therapy (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg daily). Ultimately, a total of 18 patients were included in the study. The median age of the cohort was 48, with 56 and 22% of patients demonstrating hormone receptor and HER2- positivity. All 
patients had received at least one prior taxane, with 61% of patients having received taxane therapy in the adjuvant setting. Notably, over half of patients (56%) had received prior bevacizumab. Two dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
encountered in the study. Namely, one patient treated at the first dose level (tivozanib at 0.5 mg/day) experienced grade 1 palpitations while another patient treated at the third dose level (tivozanib at 1.5 mg/day) developed grade 2 asymptomatic pneumoperitoneum. Otherwise, fatigue and alopecia were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events. The median duration of tivozanib therapy was 5.4 months. Among the 13 patients evaluable for response, partial r esponses were observed in 5 patients (38%), whereas stable disease was 
observed in 7 patients (54%). Although detailed PK data were not available for the patients enrolled, it was suggested that the PK parameters for tivozanib in combination with paclitaxel were similar to those associated with tivozanib monotherapy [9]. 
A randomized Phase II discontinuation study of tivozanib in mRCC provided key 
insights related to the drug’s activity in this disease. Eligibility in the study was limited to mRCC  patients with up to one prior therapy (other than a VEGF-
directed agent) and a Karnofsky performance status of >= 70%. Patients were not allowed to enroll if they had evidence of brain metastasis or had evidence of substantial cardiovascular disease (i.e. , uncontrollable hypertension or clinically 
significant heart failure). In accordance with the randomized Phase II design, patients received open -label tivozanib at 1.5 mg oral-daily (3 weeks on, 1 week 
off) for a total of 16 weeks. At the end of the 16- week interval, those patients with 
> 25% tumor shrinkage proceeded on open label tivozanib therapy, whereas those patients with > 25% tumor growth (or progression as otherwise defined by RECIST) discontinued protocol treatment. Those patients falling between these

 cutoffs were randomized in a 1:1 double-blind fashion to receive either tivozanib 
or placebo for the next 12 weeks, and all patients were unblinded at that point. Those patients without evidence of progression or intolerable adverse events with tivozanib were allowed to proceed on tivozanib therapy. The primary objective of 
the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of tivozanib, the latter defined by the objective response rate (ORR) after the first 16 weeks of open label therapy. A secondary objective was a comparison of PFS in subgroups within the randomized discontinuation phase. Ultimately, a total of 272 patients with mRCC were enrolled. The majority of patients had clear cell histology (83%), had received prior nephrectomy (73%) and wer e classified as intermediate risk by 
Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk criteria (60%). After the 
16-week open -label phase, 18 and 66% of patients achieved objective response 
and stable disease respectively. The median PFS among all treated patients was 11.7 months, with censoring performed at the time of allocation to placebo. This value was considerably higher (14.7 months) in the subset of patients who had undergone prior nephrectomy and had clear cell histology -- this observation accou nts for the refined eligibility noted in the subsequently described Phase III 
effort. Within the randomized discontinuation phase, PFS was significantly higher among those patients who received tivozanib (10.3 months vs 3.3 months, p = 0.01). The most common non-hematologic adverse events noted with tivozanib were hypertension, dysphonia, diarrhea and asthenia. Grade 3/4 events occurred at a frequency of less than 10%, with the exception of hypertension (12%) and GGT elevation (17%) [10]. 
The Phase III TIVO -1 trial was initiated on the basis of the compelling data for 
tivozanib monotherapy in the aforementioned randomized, Phase II study in 
mRCC. Eligibility for the study included clear cell histology with measurable disease and ECOG performance status between 0 - 1. Furthermore, participants were required to have had prior nephrectomy. Although participants may have had 1 prior therapy, prior use of VEGF or mTOR directed agents were not permitted. Patients were stratified by geographic region, the number of prior therapies, and the number of metastatic lesions. In a 1:1 fashion, patients were randomized to receive either tivozanib at 1.5 mg/day orally, 3 weeks on, 1 week off, or sorafenib at 400 mg oral twice daily. The primary objective of the study was to d etermine superiority of tivozanib as compared to sorafenib in terms of 
PFS, with secondary objectives including assessment of response rate, safety, and survival. Ultimately, a total of 517 patients were enrolled between February and August of 2010 at a total of 76 sites with the majority (approximately 90%) derived from European sites. Patient characteristics were similar on both study arms with an identical median age (59 years for both) and proportion of patients with no prior therapy (70% for both). Notably, there were  a higher proportion of 
patients receiving sorafenib with an ECOG performance status of 0 (54%, as compared to 45% for tivozanib; p < 0.05). By independent review, there was a statistically significant improvement in PFS with tivozanib  therapy (11.9 months 
vs. 9.1 months; p = 0.042), and this difference was slightly higher in those patients who had received no prior therapy (12.7 vs. 9.1 months, p = 0.037). A

 more pronounced difference in PFS was noted by investigator assessment (14.7 
months vs. 9.6 months, p = 0.003). Subset analyses based on demographic or clinicopathologic characteristics showed benefit across subgroups, including distribution by MSKCC risk stratification. With respect to secondary endpoints, there was a higher proportion of objective responses with tivozanib as compared to sorafenib (33 vs. 23%, p = 0.014) [11].  
 Safety  
Detailed final safety data are available for 5 completed studies of tivozanib as monotherapy in subjects with cancer.  Treatment- emergent adverse even ts 
(TEAE) were defined as any adverse event (AE) not present prior to the initiation of study drug treatment or any AE already present that worsened in either grade or frequency following exposure to study drug.  With the exception of Study KRN951/030B01, the severity of an AE was classified based on the CTC Grading Scale, Version 3. For Study KRN951/03-B01, the severity of an AE was classified based on the NCI CTCAE Grading Scale, Version 2.0 (Grades 1 through 4).  Safety data will be presented in relation to each study.  
Study KRN951/03-B01 was a  first-in-human Phase I study in patients with 
advanced solid tumors, 3 doses of tivozanib hydrochloride were studied (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg) in a regimen of 4 weeks of daily dosing followed by a 2- week rest 
period. Each 6 -week regimen was considered one cycle. All 41 subjects enrolled 
in Study KRN951/03- B01 experienced at least 1 AE. The most frequently 
reported AEs were fatigue (27 subjects, 65.9%), hypertension (24 subjects, 58.5%), diarrhea (23 subjects, 56.1%), hoarseness (20 subjects, 48.8%), and nausea (18 subjects, 43.9%). The proportion of subjects who were reported to have each of these AEs was higher in the 2.0 mg tivozanib hydrochloride group than the 1.0 and 1.5 mg tivozanib hydrochloride groups. There were 31 of 41 subjects with at least one Grade 3/4 AE. The most frequently reported Grade 3/4 AEs were hypertension (20 subjects, 48.8%) and fatigue (4 subjects, 9.8%). No other Grade 3/4 AE occurred in more than 2 subjects. Two deaths within 30 days of the final dose of tivozanib hydrochloride were reported in subjects participating in Study KRN951/03-B01. One subject in the 2 mg tivozanib hydrochloride group had an AE of malignant neoplasm progression during Cycle 1, which led to death. This AE was not considered related to study drug. One subject in the 1.0 mg tivozanib hydrochloride group died from disease- related causes after 3 cycles of 
treatment, 25 days after withdrawal from the study due to an AE (general physical health deterioration) [6]. 
Study AV -951-07-201 was a phase II randomized trial in 272 patients with 
recurrent or metastatic RCC, or primary RCC not amenable to surgery treated 
with 1.5 mg/day. TEAEs were reported in 242 of the 272 treated subjects (89.0%). The most frequently reported AEs were combined hypertension (125 subjects, 46.0%), dysphonia (62 subjects, 22.8%), asthenia (61 subjects, 22.4%), dyspnea (51 subjects, 18.8%), and fatigue (46 subjects, 16.9%).  There were 132 treated subjects (48.6%) who had at least 1 >= grade 3 AE. The most frequently reported >=Grade 3 AEs were combined hypertension (32 subjects, 11.8%),

 asthenia (23 subjects, 8.5%), dyspnea (16 subjects, (5.9%), and GGT increased 
(15 subjects, 5.5%).  There were 15 deaths reported within 30 days of the final dose of tivozanib. None was considered to be related to study drug (as determined by the investigator) and 7 were due to disease progression  [6]. 
Study AV -951-08-105 was a phase 1b multicenter study to evaluate the safety and 
activity of tivozanib in 17 subjects with NSCLC treated with either 1.0 mg or 1.5 mg daily.  All 17 subjects in Study AV-95-08- 105 experienced at least 1 AE 
during their participation in the study. The most frequently reported AEs were fatigue (13 subjects, 76.5%), nausea (9 subjects, 52.9%), diarrh ea (8 subjects, 
47.1%), hypertension (7 subjects, 41.2%), constipation (6 subjects, 35.3%), stomatitis (5 subjects, 29.4%), headache (5 subjects, 29.4%), cough (5 subjects, 29.4%), and decreased appetite (5 subjects, 29.4%). Twelve of the 17 subjects (70.6%) experienced at least 1 >= Grade 3 AEs occurring in more than 1 subject was hypertension (5 subjects, 29.4%), fatigue (3 subjects, 17.6%), and vomiting (2 subjects, 11.8%). Four deaths were reported in subjects participating in Study AV-951-08-105 (1 death due to respiratory failure and 3 deaths related to progressive disease/lung cancer). None of the deaths were thought to be related to the study drug [6]. 
Forty -five of the 50 subjects (90.0%) dosed in Study AV-951-10- 112 experienced 
at least 1 AE. This was an investigational study of electrocardiogram and 
pharmacokinetic-electrocardiogram dynamics in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors treated with 1.5 mg daily of tivozanib. The most frequently reported AEs were hypertension (21 subjects, 42.0%), fatigue (12 subjects, 24.0%), and headache (11 subjects, 22.0%). Nineteen of the 50 dosed subjects (38.0%) had experienced at least 1 >= grade 3 TEAE. The only events reported in more than 1 subject were hypertension (9 subjects, 18.0%) and dyspnea (2 subjects, 4.0%).  Two of the 50 dosed subjects died both due to progression of disease (and both deaths were considered unrelated to study drug) [6]. 
Study AV -951-09-301 is the recently published phase III randomized trial of 1.5 
mg daily of tivozanib versus 400 mg t wice daily of sorafenib in patients with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Fewer patients receiving tivozanib (as compared 
to sorafenib) required dose interruptions (18% vs. 35; p < 0.001) or dose 
reductions (12 vs. 43%, p < 0.001) due to adverse events. The extent of drug discontinuation on account of treatment- related adverse events was similar on 
both arms (4% with tivozanib vs. 5% with sorafenib). Hypertension, diarrhea, and dysphonia were the most common adverse events noted with tivozanib. In comparing  grade 3/4 toxicities, hypertension was more frequent with tivozanib 
(26 vs. 17%), whereas hand-foot syndrome was more common with sorafenib (17 vs. 2%). The development of hypertension was noted to be a clinical biomarker predictive of efficacy, a phenomenon observed among other VEGF- TKIs for 
mRCC. Those patients with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg had an improved PFS with tivozanib (18.3 months vs. 9.1 months). Similarly, a systolic pressure greater than 150 mmHg developed while on study conferred a benefit in the same endpoint (16.7 months vs. 9.0 months) [11] .

 Clinical Pharmacology  
Final PK data are available for 3 monotherapy studies (KRN951/03- B01, AV -
951-07-201, and AV-951-08-105) and 2 combination therapy studies (AV-951-
07-102 and AV-951-08-104) in subjects with cancer. Additionally, final PK data are available for 2 healthy volunteer studies (Studies AV -951-09- 109 and AV -
951-10-111). 
In summary, across studies, median time to peak serum concentration, (tmax), of 
tivozanib (free base), ranges from about 2 to 24 h with substantial variability between subjects. In studies from healthy volunteers with detailed sampling regimens in the first 24 h, median Tmax is 10 h. Across the multiple studies, exposure (Cmax and AUC) of tivozanib (free base) generally increases in a roughly dose proportional manner and accumulation at steady- state is 
approximately 6 -7 times single dose levels. This accumulation is consistent with 
the long t1⁄2 of tivozanib (free base), the mean between studies being approximately 3.6 to 4.7 days. Also, the PK of tivozanib (free base) is similar in 
oncology patients compared to the profile in healthy volunteers. 
In combination studies of tivozanib hydrochloride with temsirolimus (AV-951-
07-102) and in another with paclita xel (AV -951- 08-104), there was no indication 
of a PK interaction that influenced tivozanib (free base) levels or those of the coadministered agent.  Data from the mass balance study (Study AV -951- 10-111) 
found that 79.3% of the total radioactivity was recovered from feces. Urine contained no detectable tivozanib (free base) but various metabolites were detected in urine and accounted for 11.8% of recovered radioactivity. The findings are consistent with elimination of tivozanib (free base) via feces and some degree of metabolism.  
In vitro data suggest the possibility that tivozanib hydrochloride may interact with CYP3A4 inducers and/or inhibitors. Formal drug-drug interaction studies are currently underway to assess whether such interactions may be clinically relevant. Data are not yet available from these studies  [6]. 
 Drug -Drug Interaction Studies 
Results from drug-drug interaction studies conducted in vitro indicate that tivozanib hydrochloride had no inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP 2C9, or CYP2C19. Further, tivozanib hydrochloride did not show 
any propensity to induce CYP450 isoforms in an in vitro assay system at clinically relevant exposures. Due to the low likelihood of tivozanib hydrochloride causing a drug- drug interaction by inhibiting the metabolism of a 
co-administered agent, no clinical studies to evaluate this question are planned. 
In vitro studies with cDNA -derived CYP450 showed that only CYP1A1 
(primarily extrahepatic) and CYP3A4 were capable of metabolizing tivozanib hydrochloride.  Clinical trials in healthy volunteers investigating the effect of 
ketoconazole (AV-951- 11-116) and rifampin (AV-951-11-117) are in progress 
[6].

 1.3 Study Rationale 
 Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth 
Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting 
vasculature. Angiogenesis is classified into 2 types: physiologic and pathologic. Physiologic angiogenesis includes embryonic development, reproduction, and wound healing. Pathologic angiogenesis is involved in diseases such as ca ncer, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy. Angiogenesis plays an important role in the control of cancer progression and metastasis. Tumors cannot grow beyond 2 to 3 mm
3 in size in the absence of the new vascularization. While 
angiogenesis is a complex process involving endothelial cell proliferation, 
survival migration, vessel morphogenesis and maturation, signaling through endothelial growth factors such as the VEGF ligands is known to be rate limiting for angiogenesis. Inhibiting tumor angiogenesis is believed to be a promising therapeutic modality  [12]. 
  
 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Pathway  
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway appears to be the dominant pathway involved in tumor angiogenesis. The VEGF family consists of five structurally related proteins (VEGF -A, VEGF -B, 
VEGF -C, VEGF -D and Placental Growth Factor (PLGF), and signaling 
through this pathway is mediated by the binding of these growth factors to three receptors (VEGFR -1, VEGFR -2, and VEGFR-3). The ligands bind 
each receptor with distinct but overlapping specificity as well as distinct biological function, together acting to effect proliferation, migration and morphogenesis of endothelial cells to form functional vasculature [13]. 
 
 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor  
Two high- affinity cognate endothelial receptors for VEGF have been 
identified. One is VEGF receptor -1 (VEGFR -1, also known as Flt1) and 
the other is VEGFR-2 (also known as kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/Flk1). The se receptors have a characteristic structure with 
7 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain with a long kinase insert region. They are members of a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases and are localized on endothelial cells. Activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 receptors occurs through ligand binding, which facilitates receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues. VEGFR-2 is considered the major mediator of the mitogenic, angio genic and 
permeability -enhancing effects of VEGF.  In addition, recent studies have 
also suggested the role of VEGFR- 3 (FLT -4), another tyrosine kinase, in 
tumor angiogenesis. VEGFR-3 is expressed in the tumor vasculature and targeting its activity is known  to retard tumor formation by inhibiting 
angiogenesis  [14].

 receptor tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFR -1, 2, and 3. It has been shown 
to block various VEGF-induced biologic responses i n endothelial cells in 
vitro . Furthermore, tivozanib hydrochloride demonstrated a marked 
antitumor activity against human tumor xenograft models in nude mice 
and nude rats. Tivozanib hydrochloride has good pharmacokinetic profiles in various animal models. In toxicology studies conducted using Good Laboratory Practices, toxicities were similar across species, were generally dose responsive and showed signs of recovery following cessation of treatment. Tivozanib hydrochloride has exhibited significant anti-tumor effects against a wide variety of tumors in rat and mouse xenograft models. Pharmacologic studies showed that tivozanib hydrochloride is a potent inhibitor of VEGFR phosphorylation, which plays a major role in tumor angiogenesis and vascular permeabil ity, but does not have obvious 
direct tumorcidal activity. These data indicated that the mechanism of the anti-tumor activity for tivozanib hydrochloride is through the inhibition of 
tumor angiogenesis and vascular permeability  [6]. 
  
 Rationale for Clinical Trial Design  
This is a single arm phase II trial. All patients will receive 1.5 mg orally of tivozanib given daily for 3 weeks with one week off to complete a 4 week cycle.  At the start of each cycle, patients will have a visit with a clinician who will obtain a pertinent history, perform a physical exam, draw serum CA-125 values and a CBC and CMP and determine if the patient is appropriate for therapy.  Treatment will continue until documented disease progression or the patient is unable to tolerate fur ther therapy due to excessive toxicity.  
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary  
The primary objective of this single -arm, phase II clinical trial will be to determine the  
clinical activity of tivozanib in patients with platinum- resistant, recurrent ovarian, 
fallopian  tube or primary peritoneal cancer.  For this protocol text, these disease entities 
will be referred to collectively as ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint of this trial will 
be the overall response rate of patients with platinum- resistant ovarian cancer to  
treatment with single agent tivozanib as measured by physical exam findings, serum CA -
125 levels and/or measurement of index lesions via appropriate imaging studies using 
RECIST criteria.  
 
2.2 Secondary  
 The secondary objectives of this trial will include determining the potential survival advantage and characterizing the safety of single agent tivozanib in patients with platinum- resistant ovarian cancer.  
 The secondary endpoints will include the duration of progression -free survival in 
patients with platinum- resistant ovarian cancer treated with single agent tivozanib.

 Additionally, toxicity will be reported using Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 4.03. 
 
2.3 Exploratory 
 The first e xploratory endpoint is a r etrospective analysis of archival tissue from 
all patients who have enrolled to measure the expression of proteins that play a role in VEGF signaling and other relevant oncogenic pathways.  T he level of 
expression  will be correlated  with  the best response to treatment ( CR, PR, SD, 
PD). 
 The second exploratory endpoint is a r etrospective analysis of genetic reports 
from all patients who have enrolled, if available. This analysis will be used  to 
correlate genetic mutation burden with response to treatment.

 4 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
4.1 Overview  
This is a single arm phase II trial. All patients will receive 1.5 mg orally of tivozanib  
given daily for 3 weeks with one week off to complete a 4 week cycle.  At the start of 
each cycle, patients will have a visit with a clinician who will obtain a pertinent history,

 perform a physical exam, draw serum CA -125 values and a CBC and CMP and 
determine if the patient is appropriate for therapy.  Treatment will continue until 
documented disease progression or the patient is unable to tolerate further therapy due to 
excessive toxicity.  
 
4.2 Study Drug Administration: Tivozanib  
 Drug Dispensing: The patient will be dispen sed enough pills for 1 cycle at each 
monthly visit. Patient pill calendar will be revie wed by study coordinator or nurse. 
Pill count will be done, and any unused pills will be returned each cycle.    
 Dosing Schedule:  Tivozanib hydroc hloride will be administered orally, at a  dose 
of 1.5 mg/day, beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Subjects will receive tivozanib 
hydrochloride once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off treatment. One cycle is defined as 4 weeks. Cycles will be repeated every 4 weeks in the absence 
of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. 
 
 Dosing Information:  The prescribed daily dose of tivozanib hydrochloride is to 
be taken, once per day, preferably in the morning, with water. Tivozanib should be taken on an empty stomach either 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals at the same time each day. The tablets should be swallowed whole and cannot be crushed or broken. Only one capsule of tivozanib hydrochloride should be taken each day. If a dose is vomited or otherwise missed that day for any reason, the dose for that day should not be made up. The next dose should be taken as prescribed at the next scheduled time (i .e., one capsule is to be taken even if the 
previous dose was vomited or otherwise missed; additional dose(s) should not be taken at any time to make up for any missed dose(s). Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided during the study.  
In the event that tivozanib hydrochloride dosing is interrupted, the duration of cycle/treatment will not be extend ed; doses missed during the interruption will be 
captured as omitted rather than delayed. 
 Dosing Parameters: Subsequent cycles of therapy will not begin (day 1 of each 
cycle) until the ANC is ≥1500 cells/mcl and the platelet count is ≥ 100,000/mcl. 
Therapy  will be delayed for a maximum of two weeks until these values are 
achieved. Patients who fail to recover adequate counts within a two week delay will be removed from study therapy.  Grade 1 or 2 toxicity will not result in a dose reduction or treatment de lay.  Drug -related g rade 3 or 4 toxicit ies will result 
in an interruption in treatment until the toxicity is less than or equal to grade 2.  Additionally, a dose reduction will be performed. If there is no recovery to ≤ grade 2 or recurrent grade 3 or 4, then tivozanib will be discontinued. 
 
4.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 Premedications for Study Drug- Related Toxicities  
 Patients  should not be premedicated prior to receiving the first dose of study 
drug.

4.4 Duration of Therapy  
Patients may continue to receive cycles of treatment until any of the following occur:  
• Disease progression  
• Development of an inter- current illness that prevents further administration of 
treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)

• The treating investigator determines that the patient should be taken off 
treatment for any reason (i.e. changes in condition, inability to comply with 
study treatment or pro cedures) 
 
4.5 Duration of Follow Up 
Patients will return for a n end of treatment visit within ±14 days  of the decision to  
discontinue treatment.   Subjects  will be followed approximately 30 days after discontinuation of 
treatment and then approximately  every 3  months for 2 years and then 
approximately every 6 months for 3 years after removal from study or until death, 
whichever occurs first.  Subjects will be monitored for survival for this 5- year 
period.  Subjects  removed from study for unacceptable adverse ev ent(s) will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
 
4.6 Removal of Subjects from Study Treatment and/or Study as a Whole 
Patients can be taken off the study treatment and/or study as a whole at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation must be clearly documented on the appropriate eCRF and may include:

• Patient becomes lost to follow -up (LTF)  
 
4.7 Dose Delays/Dose Modification 
Comprehensive assessments of any toxicity experienced by the patient will be performed throughout the course of this study. A nticipated toxicities that may be experienced are 
detailed in the section on adverse events in prior studies of tivozanib.  Grades of toxicity (NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events [CTCAE- Version 4.03]), as well as clinical judgment, will be used to determine appropriate management of the patient experiencing any adverse event while participating in this study.  Any adverse event, whether observed by the investigator, or observed or experienced by the patient, will be reported. All clinical and labora tory adverse events must be carefully evaluated for 
severity, duration and relationship to tivozanib. 
 
 Tivozanib Hydrochloride Dose Modification 
Clinical judgment will be used to determine appropriate management of the subject experiencing  any adverse even t (AE).  The suggested criteria for dose 
modification for tivozanib hydrochloride drug -related AEs (excluding 
hypertension) are summarized in the table below.

  Amendment 8: 1 /3/201 9 
 1. Hypertension must be treated as described in Appendix C  prior to any dose modification   
2. Referring to toxicity that persists despite appropriate medical care.  
3. Tivozanib may be interrupted for up to 2 weeks. If a subject is able to resume treatment after an 
interruption of ≤ 2 weeks, missed doses will not be made up (i.e. the cycle duration will remain 
unchanged). If any drug related toxicity results in interruption of >2 weeks, the subject should be 
discontinued from study treatment unless there is clear benefit.  
 
Patients should be followed for assessment of the toxicities until the AEs resolve 
or are deemed irreversible. The maximum delay of drug administration by the treating investigator or the patients’ own decision for any reason, including toxicities, is 2 we eks. If the drug is withheld for more than 2 continuous weeks 
due to a treatment -related toxicity that does not resolve, the patient will be 
withdrawn from study treatment.  The exception is HTN, which must first be 
treated as described in Appendix C prior to any dose modification.   
Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they fail to recover to grade ≤ 1 or tolerable grade 2 (or within 1 grade of starting values for pre- existing laboratory 
abnormalities) from a treatment- related toxicity within 2 wee ks OR if they 
experience agent related adverse events requiring dose modification despite  previous dose reductions (i.e. would require a 2nd dose reduction) unless the investigator agree s that the subject should remain in the study because of evidence 
that the patient is/may continue deriving benefit from continuing study treatment. The appropriate reduced dose will be determined after discussion with the principal investigator and approva l of the Data Monitoring Committee. Patients 
requiring dose reductions should not have the dose re- escalated with subsequent 
treatments.   If treatment was interrupted for < 1 week, the patient will resume 
dosing on the current treatment cycle.  If treatmen t was interrupted for ≥ 1 week, 
the patient will start a new cycle of treatment.  
 Tivozanib Hydrochloride Dose Reduction 
Dose reductions of tivozanib hydrochloride to 1.0 mg/day will be allowed for subjects with ≥ Grade 3 drug- related adverse events.  The exception is 
hypertension, which must be treated with anti-hypertensive drugs prior to dose reduction.  Once a subject’s dose of tivozanib hydrochloride is reduced, it may not be re-escalated through the remainder of the subject’s participation in the study.  If a subject is unable to tolerate a reduced dose due to toxicities thought to be related to treatment, treatment should be discontinued. 
5 RESPONSE ASSESSMENT  
 The measures used to determine the objective overall response rate will be those that are alre ady 
in place for determining treatment efficacy.  Specifically, we will utilize physical exam findings performed at the commencement of each 4 -week cycle of treatment during a clinician visit.  
Additionally, serum CA- 125 levels will be checked at the commencement of each 4 week cycle 
of treatment to determine disease status.  If otherwise indicated by disease state, we will obtain CT scan or MRI or chest x -ray and utilize index target lesions and RECIST 1.1 criteria to

  Amendment 8: 1 /3/201 9 
 determine treatment efficacy and response rate.  
 
5.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [16]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
5.2 Disease Parameters  
 Measurable disease  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >10 mm with CT scan, as >20 mm by chest x -ray, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centim eters). Lymph nodes are considered measurable in RECIST 1.1 if their 
short diameter exceeds 15 mm. Lymph nodes are considered normal if they have a short axis of less than 10 mm; this applies to determination of response as well. 
Lesions that are previousl y irradiated must show clear evidence of progression 
over a minimum of 3 months to include as measurable. This period of time is used 
to discount tumor edema in an irradiated field as a false sign of disease progression. 
 Non-measurable disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with >10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, l ymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast 
disease, abdominal masses (specifically abdominal masses that can not be 
followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non- measurable. 
Note : Bone lesions: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic  lesions, with 
identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. 
 
Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions ’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 
 Target lesions

Study Number: NU12G11  
30  Initial Version Date:  04/28/2013 
  Amendment 8: 1 /3/201 9 
 All measura ble lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  
and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The ba seline sum LD will be used as reference 
by which to characterize the objective tumor response.  
 Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-targe t lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
 
5.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before the beginning of the treatme nt.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods ha ve 
been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
 
 Clinical lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are >= 10 mm 
diameter.  For superficial lesions measured by caliper, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler in the field of view is strongly recommended. 
 Chest x -ray 
Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. 
 
 Conventional CT and MRI 
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans), but NOT lung. 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables

 involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and 
measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline, and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, subsequent image acquisitions should use the same type of scanner and follow the baseline imaging protocol as closely as possible. If possible, body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques. 
 
 PET- CT 
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. PET -CT scans are not always done with  oral and IV contrast. In 
addition, the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data that  may bias an 
investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. For these reasons, we will 
not allow PET-CT use for RECIST 1.1 response criteria. 
 
 FDG -PET 
While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be identified according to the 
following algorithm:  
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a 
sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not 
confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurri ng at that site 
(if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET 
scan). If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
Note : A “positive ” FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG 
avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
 Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and  should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their

 entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements 
will be taken from  one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by 
ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is  concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT 
in selected instances.  
 Endoscop y, Laparoscopy  
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 CA-125 (Ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer trials)   
If CA125 is initially above the upper normal limit then it may be used as a marker  
of treatment efficacy. It must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Specific guidelines for CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian 
cancer) have been published [15]. In  addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup 
has developed CA-125 progression criteri a that are to be integrated with objective 
tumor assessment  for use only in first- line trials in ovarian cancer [ 17].   See 
section 5.4.3 for explanation of clinical response. 
 Cytology, Histology  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between  partia l responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases, e.g., residual  lesions in tumor types, such 
as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain. 
It is mandatory to obtain cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when measurable disease has met criteria for response or stable disease. This confirmation is necessary to differentiate response or stable disease versus progressive disease, as an effusion may be a side ef fect of the treatment.  
5.4 Response Criteria  
Determination of response should take into consideration all target and non- target lesions 
and, if appropriate, biomarkers. 
  
 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the

  Amendment 8: 1 /3/201 9 
 baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to th e relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: 
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor suff icient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph 
nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm sho rt axis).  
Note : If CA -125 is initially above the upper normal limit, it must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s)  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
Not evalua ble (NE):  When at least one non- target lesion is not evaluated at a 
particular time point.  
Although a clear progression of only ‘non- target ’ lesions is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 Evaluation of Biomarkers 
If serum CA -125 is initially above the upper normal limit, it must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  A partial response according to CA 125 has occurred if there is at least a 50% reduction in CA 125 levels from a pretreatment sample but the value remains above the normal range. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days.  A complete response has occurred if the CA -125 level decreases into the normal range.  
Progressive disease will be defined as a doubling of CA-125 levels.  Stable disease will be any CA -125 level that falls within the range of progressive disease 
and partial response. 
5.5 Duration of Response 
 Duration of overall response 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time me asurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for

 progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. 
 Duration of stable disease 
Stable disease is measured from the start  of the tre atment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as  reference the small est measurements recorded since 
date of study entry,  including the baseline measurements.  
5.6 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. 
 
5.7 Survival 
Survival is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of death or the date of last contact.

8 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
Statistical analyses wi ll focus on estimation of overall response rates in patients with 
platinum- resistant ovarian cancer as stated in the Primary Objective.   Specific definitions 
for complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive 
disease (PD) are defined in the Primary Endpoint section according to physical exam findings, serum CA-125 levels and imaging studies.  Response frequencies and percentages will be tabulated for all four groups and then an overall frequency of response (CR or PR) v. non- response (SD or PD) will be calculated along with a one-
sided lower limit 95% confidence interval, consistent with the approach used to specify 
staging of accrual .  For the secondary objective, t he Kaplan -Meier method will be 
utilized to estimate the median and overall distribution of progression- free survival.   
Toxicity will also be evaluated as a secondary objective and grades will be summarized by counts and frequencies. For description of other continuous variables, means, standard deviations, minimum and maximum values will be used.  Other  categorical variables will 
be summarized by counts and frequencies.  In addition, the extent to which treatment is completed will be monitored and tabulated according to the number of complete weeks of treatment.     
 
Total anticipated accrual to this phase II single -arm trial is 30 patients.  Recruitment will 
be completed in two stages with 10 patients accrued in the first stage and 20 accrued in the second stage according to Simon’s two-stage design (Simon, 1989; Jung et al. 2004) with a null hypothesis that the true response rate is less than or equal to 5% and 5% type I error and 80% power when the true response rate is greater than or equal to 20%.  In the first stage, if there are 0 responses (CR or PR) in the 10 patients that are accrued, the study will be stopped.  Otherwise, 20 additional patients will be accrued, with rejection of the null hypothesis occurring if 4 or more responses are observed in the total 30 patients. On 10/12/16 the Northwestern DS MC re viewed the first 9 evaluable patients and 
approved the study to open to an additional 21 patients.   Calculations were conducted using the online software at http://cancer.unc.edu/biostatistics/program/ivanova/SimonsTwoStageDesign.aspx. 
 
With an expected response rate of 20%, if all 30 patients are accrued, a one -sided 95% 
lower -limit confidence interval will have a distance from the sample proportion to the 
lower limit of about 14%.   For exploratory aims  we will proceed as follows. The first exploratory endpoint is the 
expression of proteins that play a role in VEGF signaling and other relevant oncogenic pathways.  The level of expression of each protein will be correlated via ANOVA with 
response to treatment (CR, PR, SD, PD) ; The second exploratory endpoint is a 
retrospective genetic mutation burden to be correlated via ANOVA or contingency table analysis with response to treatment (CR, PR, SD, PD).

 9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (please refer to Appendices for additional information). The level of risk attributed to th is study requires high -risk monitoring  as outlined in the DSMP.
 In 
addition, the study will abide by all safety reporting regulations, as set forth in the Code of Feder al Regulations .   
 
9.1 Adverse Event Monitoring 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as 
well as those who will enroll in future studie s using similar agents. Adverse 
events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial  (see 
Section 7 for timepoints) . In addition, certain adverse events must be reported in 
an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring and patient safety and care.  
 
All patients experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, will be followed until:  
• the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse event return to baseline;  
• any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
• there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes observed; or 
• death.  
 
9.2 Definitions  & Descriptions  
 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
Recording of AEs should be done in a concise manner using standard, acceptable 
medical terms. In general, AEs are not procedures or measurements, but should 
reflect the reason for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the abnormal measurement. Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during the study should also be recorded (a preexisting condition that does not worsen is not an AE). Further, a procedure or surgery is not an AE; rather, the event leading to the procedure or surgery is considered an AE. 
If a specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome should 
be recorded as the AE whenever possible.  However, a complete description of the signs, symptoms and investigations which led to the diagnosis should be provided. For example, if clinically significant elevations of liver function tests

 are known to be se condary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not “elevated liver 
function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the abnormal test or 
finding should be recorded as an AE, using appropriate medical terminology (e/g/ thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema, QT prolongation). 
 Severity of AEs  
Note, some hematology studies may choose to grade toxicity using alternatives to the CTCAE v4.03 (e.g., iwCLL criteria). When an alternative is used, please modify this section as needed. If using the CTCAE state: 
All n on-hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The 
CTCAE v4 .03 is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
. 
If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows: 
• Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal 
daily activities.  
• Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.  
• Severe (grade 3):  the event makes the patient unable to perform normal 
daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
• Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event.  
• Fatal (grade 5):  the event caused death.  
 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
All SAEs, regardless of attribution, occurring from time of signed informed consent, through 30 days after the last administration of study drug, must be reported upon discovery or occurrence. 
An SAE is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward medical occurrence 
that: 
• Results in death. 
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
• Is life -threatening.  
The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours.

 • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event. 
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the 
investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a serious adverse event . The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; co nvulsions that may not result in hospitalization; 
development of drug abuse or drug dependency. 
 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subject or Others 
A UPIRSO is a type of SAE that includes events that meet ALL of the following criteria:  
• Is unanticipated  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency 
• Places the research subject or others at a different or greater risk of harm  
• Is deemed to be at least possibly related  to participation in the study.    
 
9.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
 Routine Reporting 
All routine adverse events, such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or definitely not related to study participation, are to be reported on the appropriate eCRF. Routine AEs will be reviewed by the Data and Safety  Monitoring 
Committee (D SMC) accor ding to the study’s phase and risk level, as outlined in

 Determining if Expedited Reporting is Required 
This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol treatment. Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported accordingly. 
1) Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03. 
2) Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03. 3) Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy.   
Attribution categories are as follows:  Definite: AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
 Probable: AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
 Possible: AE may be related to the study treatment.  
 Unlikely: AE not likely to be related to the study treatment.  
 Unrelated: AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
4) Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  
 
Expected events are those that have been previously identifi ed as resulting from 
administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for

 Expedited Reporting of SAEs/Other Events 
 Reporting to the Northwestern University QAM/DS MC 
All SAEs must be reported to the assigned QAM within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. Completion of the NU CRO SAE Form, provided as a separate document, is required.  
 The completed form should assess whether or not the event qualifies as a UPIRSO. The report should also include: 
• Protocol description and number(s) 
• The patient’s identification number 
• A description of the event, severity, treatment, and outcome (if known) 
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics 
• The hospital discharge summary (if available/applicable)  
 
All SAEs will be reported to, and reviewed by, the DS MC at their next meeting.  
 Reporting to the Northwestern University IRB 
The following information pertains to the responsibilities of the lead site (Northwestern University). Additional participating sites should follow their local IRB guidelines for reporting to their local IRBs. 
• Any death of an NU subject  that is unanticipated in nature and at least 
possibly related to study participation will be promptly reported to the NU IRB within 24 hours of notification.  
• Any death of an NU subject that is actively on study treatment (regardless of whether or not the event is possibly related to study treatment)  
• Any death of a non- NU subject  that is unanticipated and at least possibly 
related and any other UPIRSOs  will be reported to the NU IRB within 5 
working days of notification. 
• All other deaths of NU subjects not previously reported, other non- NU 
subject deaths  that were unanticipated and unrelated, and any other SAEs 
that were not previously reported as UPIRSOs will be reported to the NU IRB at the time of annual continuing review.

11 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. T he IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol.  In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles t hat have their origin in the Dec laration 
of Helsinki.   Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB approved consent form.  Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
11.2 Amendments  
The Principal Investigator will formally initiate all amendments to the protocol and/or informed consent. All amendments will be subject to the review and approval of the appropriate local, institutional, and governmental regulatory bodies, as well as by Janssen Scientific Affairs. Amendments will be distributed

11.3 Registration Procedures  
For potential patients for the phase I portion of this study, study teams are asked to inform the QAM of the date and time that the patient will need to be registered (croqualityassurance@northwestern.edu
).   
 BEFORE a patient can be treated on study, please complete and submit the following items to confirm eligibility and receive an identification number:  
• Patient’s signed and dated informed consent form (upload to NOTIS and keep original hard copy in a secure location/study chart) 
• Eligibility checklist (signed and dated by the treating physician – upload 
to NOTIS)  
• Eligibility eCRF (complete in NOTIS)  
• Copy of the pathology report (upload to NOTIS) 
 The QAM will review al l source documentation required to confirm eligibility 
that is readily available in the patient’s electronic medical record (EMR).  Any information that is not available in the EMR must be de -identified and emailed to 
the QAM. Once the QAM confirms the pat ient is eligible, he or she will register 
the patient, assign a subject identification number, provide a cohort assignment, 
and send a confirmation of registration to involved personnel. Registration will 
then be complete and the patient may begin study tr eatment.  
 
11.4 Data Submission 
Once a subject is confirmed and registered to the study, eCRFs should be submitted according to the detailed data submission guidelines (provided in a separate document).  Generally, all data for phase I patients during the time period 
patients are evaluated for Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) must be submitted on a weekly basis.   Generally, for all phase II patients, data are due at the end of every cycle.   
 This is a general template.  Data Submission language can be revised as make sense for each protocol.  A detailed data submission guideline must be included as a separate document for all NU IITs determined to require high or moderate level intensity monitoring.  To develop your data submission guideline, contact croqualityassurance@northwestern.edu
.

A protocol deviation may be considered an instance of Promptly Reportable Non-Compliance (PRNC) if it: 
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s). 
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, 
State laws, or University policies.  
 
11.8 Investigator Obligations 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of Helsinki. The PI is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study patients. The PI must assure that all study site personnel, including sub- investigators and 
other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.  The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all the required data will be collected, entered onto the appropriate eCRFs, and submitted within the study -specific timeframes. Periodically, monitoring visits may be conducted 
and the Principal Investigator will provide access to his/her original records to permit verification of proper entry of data. The study may also be subject to routine audits by the Audit Committee, as outlined in the DSMP.  
 
11.9 Publication Policy  
All potential publications and/or data for potential publications (e.g. manuscripts, abstracts, posters, clinicaltrials.gov releases) must be approved in accordance with the 
policies and processes set forth in the Lurie Cancer Center DSMP. For trials that require high intensity monitoring, the assigned QAM will prepare a preliminary data summary (to be approved by the DS MC) no later than  3 months after the study reaches its primary 
completion date (the date that the final subject is examined or receives an intervention for the purposes of final data collection for the primary endpoint). If the investigator’s wish to obtain DS MC-approved data prior to this point (or prior to the point dictated by study 
design), the PI must send a written request for data to the QAM which includes justification. If the request is approved, data will be provided no later than 4 weeks after this request approval. The data will be presented to the D SMC at their next available 
meeting, and a final, DS MC-approved dataset will be released along  with any D SMC 
decisions regarding publication. The investigators are expected to use only DS MC-
approved data in future publications. The investigators should submit a copy of the manuscript to the biostatistician to confirm that the D SMC-approved data are used 
appropriately.  Once the biostatistician gives final approval, the manuscript may be submitted to external publishers.

  Amendment 8: 1 /3/201 9 
 Hypertension (HTN) that occurs during study treatment must be treated with anti- hypertensive 
drugs prior to any dose reduction.  Recommended management of HTN for subjects receiving 
study drug is presented in Figure 1 (Appendix C). 
Persistent HTN is defined as 2 consecutive elevated blood pressure (BP) measurements  
preferably taken in the clinic and  obtained at least 1 hour apart.  It is recommended that 
24-48 hours should elapse between the decision steps.  For a listing of recommended DHP 
(dihydropyridine) calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, see Appendix C, Recommended Anti- hypertensive 
Medications.   
Note: If a subject  has controlled HTN on an anti- hypertensive regimen at baseline and 
then develops a worsening of HTN requiring more intensive therapy then the previous regimen, this would be considered Grade 3 HTN . 
Hypertension will be considered controlled if the followi ng criteria are met: Diastolic blood 
pressure is reduced to less than 100 mmHg within 2 weeks of the initiation of anti- hypertensive 
treatment, confirmed by two consecutive blood pressure measurements at least 24 hours apart. Diastolic blood pressure does not increase by more than 20 mmHg subsequent to the start of anti-hypertensive treatment.  
If subjects require a delay of >2 weeks for management of hypertension, discontinue protocol therapy. Subjects may have up to 2 drugs for management of hypertension prior to any dose reduction in tivozanib. 24-48 hours should elapse between modifications of antihypertensive therapy.

Section 2.3 (Exploratory Objectives); Section 8 (Statistical Methods); Section 10 (Correlatives/Special Studies) n/a Two additional 
exploratory endpoints were added:  
 The first exploratory endpoint is a retrospective analysis of archival tissue from all patients who have enrolled to measure the expression of proteins that play a role in VEGF signaling and other relevant oncogenic pathways.  The level of expression will be correlated with the best response to treatment (CR, PR, SD, PD).  
 
The second exploratory endpoint is a retrospective analysis of genetic reports from all patients who have enrolled, if available. This analysis will be used to correlate genetic mutation burden with response 
to treatment.  Exploratory objectives have 
been added  to 
identify novel 
molecular markers that can 
predict  response to 
Tivozanib. 
 
Additional statistical and correlative sections have been added to further explain analysis of exploratory endpoints.

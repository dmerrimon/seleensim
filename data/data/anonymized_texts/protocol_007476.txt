Study Title
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Open-label Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and 
Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Pediatric Subjects with Moderate to Severe 
Plaque Psoriasis
Indication
The indication is moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years, 
inclusive) and in children (ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive).
ObjectivesPrimary Objective:
!To select a pediatric dose of apremilast based on the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of apremilast (APR) in adolescents and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
Secondary Objective:
!To evaluate the taste and acceptability of apremilast tablet using a faces Likert Scale.
Exploratory Objective:
!To evaluate the effect of apremilast on psoriasis in adolescents and children as 
measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI).
Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study of apremilast in subjects aged 6 to 17 years,
inclusive, with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study will assess the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of apremilast during the first 2 weeks of treatment.  At least 32 subjects will be enrolled.  Subjects will be divided into 2 age groups (adolescents [ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive] and 
children [ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive]), with at least 16 subjects in each group.  Apremilast 
treatment will start in older and heavier subjects.  Subjects will complete the first 2 weeks of treatment with apremilast for PK analysis and then  continue treatment for 48 weeks in the 
extension period that will explore the safety and efficacy of apremilast. 
This Study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).
Study Population
This study will be conducted in subjects aged 6 t o 17 years, inclusive, with chronic moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis, defined as Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) ≥12, Body Surface 
Area (BSA) ≥10%, and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of ≥ 3 (moderate to severe)
[See Appendix A ], diagnosed at least 6 months prior to Screening.  Subjects whose psoriasis is 
inadequately controlled by or inappropriate for topical psoriasis therapy will be included.  
Previous treatment with one systemic agent will be allowed but subjects treated with more than 
one systemic agent will be excluded.  Subjects must be able to swallow apremilast tablets.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21lerabilierabili tyia

Protocol CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 7 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 2016Length of Study
The study will last for up to a total of 107 weeks which includes screening, treatment (PK 
portion of the study and the extension treatment period), two s hort-term follow-up periods and a 
long-term follow-up period.
Each subject will undergo a screening period of up to 5 weeks, an initial treatment period of 
2 weeks, and an extension treatment period of  48 weeks, that will allow subjects access to 
apremilast treatment if medically appropriate (following the completion of the 2 week PK portion). Regardless of when they stop treatmen t, subjects should com plete the post treatment 
follow-up visits at 4 and at 8 weeks after the last dose.  An additional long-term follow-up should 
be performed 52 weeks after the last dose of apremilast.  All subjects should complete the final follow-up visit at Week 102 or at a timepoint 52 weeks after the last dose of apremilast was 
taken in subjects who have withdrawn at any time prior to Week 50.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is 
required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date.
Study Treatments
Apremilast doses of 10-mg, 20-mg or 30-mg tablets  have been selected to determine the dose 
range in adolescents and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  These pediatric dosages are expected to achieve exposures simila r to those achieved in adult psoriasis and
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) subjects treated with apremilast 30 mg orally twice daily (BID).
A staggered, stepwise approach by age range and weight (starting with older and heavier 
subjects) is considered appropriate for this firs t-time-in-childre n study.  Doses for younger and 
lower body weight subjects will be adjusted base d on safety and PK data from older and heavier 
subjects.  
Subjects will be divided into 2 age groups with at least 16 subjects in each group.  Dosing within 
and between groups will be staggered as described below, based on PK data collected and on a 
minimum of 2 weeks of safety data:
Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive; weight ≥ 35 kg)
!At least 8 subjects will initially be enrolled into Group 1 and will weigh ≥ 35 kg. 
∀Dosing for subjects with a weight ≥ 35 kg to < 70 kg will be a 20 mg BID dose 
regimen (10 mg BID less than the maximum adult dose). 
∀Dosing for subjects with a weight ≥ 70 kg will be a 30 mg BID dose reg imen 
(same as for adults). 
!Dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for the remaining subjects in 
Group 1 will be determined based on the initial 2 week PK and safety assessmentsfrom the first 8 subjects in Group 1 to co mplete this period. These data will be 
reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) to determine if it is 
appropriate to proceed with dosing the balance of Group 1 subjects and to proceed 
with dosing in the Group 2 subjects. In the event of a dose regimen adjustment, some &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21shoulshoul d d

the appropriate dosing adjustment.
!For the remaining subjects in Group 1, the dose strength and/or dose frequency will 
be adjusted for any safety concerns or for unexpected changes in exposure. 
!Group 2 will be open to enrollment once at least 8 subjects from Group 1 have 
completed the first 2 weeks of apremilast dosing, PK data analysis, and safety 
assessments and an evaluation of these data by the DMC has been completed.
Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive; weight ≥ 15 kg)
!At least 8 subjects will initially be enrolled into Group 2 and will weigh ≥ 15 kg. The 
dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for these first 8 subjects will be 
based upon the PK and safety assessments from the first 8 subjects in Group 1.  If PK 
and safety are not affected by age and body  weight, 20 mg BID will be administered 
to Group 2 children.
!Dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for the remaining subjects in 
Group 2 will be determined based on PK and safety assessments from the data collected from the first 8 subjects in each group. These data will be reviewed by anindependent DMC to determine if it is appropriate to proceed with dosing the balance 
of Group 2 subjects. In the event of a dose regimen adjustment after the second PK 
and safety assessment, the first 8 subjects in Group 2 will return to the site for the appropriate dosing adjustment.
!For the remaining subjects in Group 2, the dose (dose strength and/or dose frequency) 
will be based upon the subject’s weight as determined by the PK and safety assessments.  The dose strength and/or dose frequency will be adjusted for any safety concerns or for unexpected changes in exposure.
An independent DMC will review available safe ty and PK data at the following timepoints:
1. After the first 8 subjects in Group 1 have completed the 2 weeks of apremilast dosing, 
PK, and safety assessments.
2. After the first 8 subjects in Group 2 have completed the 2 weeks of apremilast dosing, 
PK, and safety assessments.

Blood samples, with volumes appropriate for th e weight of the child, will be collected at pre-
specified times to determine levels of apremilast in plasma/blood. The following PK parameters 
will be estimated for apremilast using a non-compartmental approach if data permit:
!Maximum observed plasma concentration (C max)
!Time to C max(tmax)
!Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 12 hours postdose 
(AUC 0-12)
!Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last 
quantifiable concentration (AUC 0-t)
!Apparent total plasma clearance when dosed orally (CL/F)
!Apparent total volume of distribution when dosed orally, based on steady-state 
(Vss/F) or the terminal phase (Vz/F)
!Terminal-phase elimination half-life (t 1/2)
The following population PK parameters will be determined as appropriate:
!CL/F
!Apparent total volume of distribution when dosed orally (V/F)
!Absorption rate constant (first-order; Ka)
!Lag (if applicable)

Statistical Methods
No formal sample size calculation is performed. A sample size of at least 16 subjects per group 
has been selected to provide an adequate PK profile and safety assessment in subjects of different ages and body weight ranges.  If needed, dropouts will be replaced to ensure that 
evaluable PK data from at least 32 subjects is collected.
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be based on the pharmacokinetic population, defined as all 
enrolled subjects who take at least one dose of th e investigatio nal product (ie, apremilast) and 
have evaluable pharmacokinetic (PK) data. Phar macokinetic data is considered evaluable if 
there are measurable drug levels of apremilast in plasma from at least 3 time points which extend over a minimal 5-hour period within 12 hours post a dose, eg, predose, 2 and 8 hours post a &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ose e

concentrations and actual blood sampling times from the intensive sampling schedule.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentrations for apremilast will be presented using 
descriptive statistics.  Population PK analyses will be performed using non-linear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM).  Covariate analysis will be performed to identify relevant covariates.
Safety and efficacy analyses will be based on the safety populatio n, defined as all enro lled 
subjects who take at least one dose of apremilast.  Safety endpoints, including adverse events, laboratory data and vital sign measurements, will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) dictionary. Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. However, an analysis of the PK and 2 weeks 
of safety data from the initial 8 adolescent subjects enrolled into Group 1 will be used to model the most appropriate dose for subsequently enrolled subjects.  Similarly, 2 week PK and safety 
data from the first 8 subjects from Group 2 will be used to model the most appropriate dose for 
subsequently enrolled subjects.

1.1. Apremilast
Apremilast (APR) (also called CC -10004), an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase
4 (PDE4), works intracellularly to modulate a network of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.  
Phosphodiesterase 4 is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterase 
(PDE) and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells.  Inhibition of PDE4 elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn downregulates the inflammatory response by modulating the 
expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α), interleukin (IL)-23, and other inflammatory 
cytokines.  Elevation of cAMP also increases anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10.  These pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators have been implicated in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) ( Claveau, 2004 ; Schafer, 2010 ; Hamzaoui, 2011 ).
Apremilast is approved for the treatment of psoriasis and PsA in adults in the United States (US), 
Canada, European Union (EU), Switzerland, Australia and Israel. Apremilast is being developed 
for use in the treatment of other immune-mediated inflammatory conditions such as  
 ulcerative colitis, Behçet’s Disease, .  
1.2. Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder estimated to affect up to 2.5% of the world’spopulation ( Christophers, 2001 ). Plaque-type psoriasis is the most common form of the disease 
in both adults and children ( Fan, 2007; Mallbris, 2005; Morris, 2001 ). The prevalence of 
psoriasis in children in the United States from birth to age 18 is 1%, with an incidence of 40.8 
per 100,000 ( Tollefson, 2010 ). Psoriasis is characterized by thickened, well-demarcated 
erythematous plaques of skin covered with silv ery scales. The nails and, less often, the mucous 
membranes may also be affected ( Weinstein, 2003 ). One-third of patients present with the first 
signs and symptoms of psoriasis by the age of 20 years. ( Tollefson, 2010; Benoit, 2007; 
Raychaudhuri, 2001 ). For mild plaque psoriasis, which comp rises the majority of pediatric cases, 
the disease can be treated with topical therap ies. Phototherapy is not recommended for fair-
skinned or younger children and psoralens a nd long-wave ultraviolet radiation ( PUVA) is not 
recommended for use in pediatric psoriasis patients at all, due to the increased risk of 
malignancies ( Ståhle, 2010 ). Most pediatric patients present with mild, localized psoriasis that is 
treated primarily with topical medications. Systemic medications are typically reserved for more extensive or refractory disease. Management of psoriasis in children can be challenging owing to 
a paucity of data and lack of standardized guidelines specific to the pediatric population. ( Vogel,
2012 ).
Approved therapies for moderate to severe psoriasis in children are very limited.  As a 
consequence, some pediatric patients are treated off-label with the same systemic agents 
prescribed for adults. In children, these treatments are reserved for severe psoriasis due to the risks of hepatic, renal, and neurological t oxicities that often require routine clinical and 
laboratory monitoring, as well as an increased risk of infections and malignancies.  Pediatric 
psoriasis tends to be less severe than that seen in adults and may also be more responsive to treatment than in adults ( Paller, 2008 ); therefore, it is important th at the severity of the disease 
justifies the risks of treatment for the pediatric population. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<ated to aed to a ffeff

To date, no studies with apremilast have been conducted in subjects < 18 years of age.
In healthy adult subjects under fasting condition s, apremilast is rapidly absorbed following oral 
administration.  Apremilast demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics, with area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC) increasing in  a dose-proportional manne r through 50 mg BID or 
80 mg once daily.  Co-administration with food does not affect the PK bioavailability of 
apremilast (CC-10004-CP-022).  Apremilast is pr imarily eliminated as metab olites formed via 
both cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidative  metabolism (and subsequent glucuronidation) 
and non-CYP-mediated hydrolysis, with less than 3% excreted unchanged in urine (CC-10004-
PK-002).  Only 2 minor human apremilast metabolites retain pharmacologic activity, indicating 
that the in vivo pharmacological activity of apremilast is  attributed to the parent compound.  The 
plasma clearance of apremilast is on average about 10 L/hr in healthy subjects (CC-10004-CP-
012), with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 6 to 9 hours.  CYP3A4, CYP1A2, 
and CYP2A6 all participate in apremilast metabolism.  Co-administration with ketoconazole increased mean apremilast area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 
infinity (AUC
0-∞) and maximum plasma concentration of the drug (C max) by approximately 36% 
and 5%, respectively, but did not alter the elimination half-life of apremilast (CC-10004-PK-005).  Co-administration of multiple oral doses of rifampin increased apremilast apparent 
clearance by about 9.6 L/h to 34.5 L/h, which resulted in a decrease in apremilast mean AUC 
(approximately 72% lower) and C
max(approximately 43% lower) relative to that of apremilast 
given alone (CC-10004-CP-025).  Methotrexate (MTX), a commonly prescribed anti-
inflammatory drug, does not affect apremilast PK exposure.  Apremilast does not affect the PK 
exposure of MTX and its metabolite, 7-OH MTX (CC-10004-PK-010).  Hepatic impairment does not affect apremilast exposure (CC-10004-CP-011), and thus no dose adjustment is 
necessary for subjects with hepatic impairment. In the subjects with mild renal impairment, there 
were no clinically meaningful differences in the PK of apremilast relative to the matched healthy group. There were an ~22% higher AUC
0-∞and ~13% lower C max of apremilast noted in the 
moderate renal impairment group relative to  the matched healthy subject group, however, the 
differences noted were not s tatist ically si gnificant. Moreover, when compared to the healthy 
subjects matched to the mild renal impairment group, the mean AUC from moderate renal 
impaired subjects were comparable and the mean C max was 18% lower. Thus, the numerical 
differences noted in the moderate renal impairment group are likely within the between-subject variability of apremilast exposure and are not clinically meaningful ( CC-10004-CP-029) . In 
subjects with severe renal impairment, a single oral dose administration of a 30-mg apremilast 
tablet resulted in an increase in overall mean exposure (AUC
0-∞) by approximately 88% (CC-
10004-CP-019).  Apremilast PK and exposure are comparable across ethnic groups of Caucasian, 
Japanese and Chinese subjects (CC-10004-CP-018).  Analyses showed apremilast exposure is 
also similar among Hispanic Caucasians, non-Hispanic Caucasians, and African Americans.  Apremilast exposure (AUC) in elderly healthy subjects (70.5 ± 4.15 years of age [mean ± 
standard deviation (SD)]) was approximately 13% higher than that in young healthy subjects 
(34.3 ± 7.17 years of age [mean ± SD]; CC-10004-CP-024) although not statistically different.  Young and elderly combined, apremilast AUC exposure was approximately 30% higher in 
females than in males.  &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21on) on)

Protocol CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 20 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 2016The metabolic profile of a single 20-mg oral dose of [14C]-apremilast was characterized in a 
healthy volunteer absorption/distribution /metabolism/excretion (ADME) study.  The mean total 
urinary and fecal radioactive recovery of apremilast (and its metabolites) was 97.1%, with mean 
contributions of 57.9% and 39.2% from urine and feces, respectively (CC-10004-PK-002).
Detailed information regarding the available pha rmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, 
clinical studies, and safety profile of apremilast are available in the Investigator’s Brochure.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, when apremilast is given to subjects whose body 
weights range from 15 kg to < 70 kg, initial dosing regimens should be adjusted based on body 
weight.  As a result, the proposed dosing regimen in this study will be weight-based and a 
staggered, stepwise study design (starting enro llment with older and heavier adolescents) will 
guide dosing of subsequently enrolled sub jects (younger and lower body weight children).
The PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of apremilast in pediatric subjects have not been 
investigated.  Considering the similarity of the disease process between adult and pediatric 
patients, it is appropriate to choose the dose for the pediatric population that will provide overall 
drug exposure similar to that of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada,
and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved adult dose in psoriasis, assuming a similar 
exposure and response relationship in adult and pediatric patients.
1.4. Clinical Efficacy and Safety Data
At the time of protocol finalization, apremilast had been administered to adult subjects ( ≥18 
years of age) at daily doses ranging from 10 to 100 mg/day in completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 
clinical studies, and doses of 20 mg BID (APR 20 BID) to 30 mg BID (APR 30 BID) in ongoing Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies.
A dose ranging study in adult subjects with psoriasis has been performed to determine the 
optimal adult dose of apremilast (Study CC-10004-PSOR-005).  Apremilast dose regimens of 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg BID were tested versus placebo.  Both the 20 mg and 30 mg BID doses 
were significantly better than placebo, with a 29% response in PASI-75 at 20 mg BID, and a 
41% response in PASI-75 for the 30 mg BID dose.  Furthermore, the safety profiles of the 20 mg and 30 mg BID regimens were acceptable and similar.  Based on these findings, apremilast 30 &(/*(1(35235,(7$5milast is givmilast is giv

Confidential and Propri etary 21 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 2016mg BID was determined to be the optimal dose for treatment of psoriasis for the Phase 3 
registration trials.
The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of APR 30 BID were assessed in a total of approximately 
1250 adult subjects with moderate to severe  plaque psoriasis who were candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy in 2 pivotal  Phase 3 studies (Study CC-10004-PSOR-008 and 
Study CC-10004-PSOR-009).  The baseline demographic characteristics of subjects were similar 
across both studies, generally well balanced across the treatment groups, and representative of the typical subject population in psoriasis clin ical studies in adults.  Approximately 55% of the 
subjects had been treated previously with systemic therapy (ie, conventional systemic and/or 
biologics). Approximately 40% of subjects were previously treated with conventional systemic therapies, approximately 30% had prior exposure to biologics, and 17% to 29% had prior 
exposure to TNF blockers.
Apremilast demonstrated a treatment benefit in adult subjects with moderate and severe 
psoriasis, as both studies achieved the primar y endpoint by demonstrating that a significantly
greater proportion of subjects randomized to APR 30 BID achieved a PASI-75 response at Week 
16 compared with placebo. In Study PSOR -008, 33.1% of subjects receiving APR 30 BID 
achieved a PASI-75 response at Week 16 compared with 5.3% of subjects receiving placebo (p < 
0.0001). In Study PSOR-009, 28.8% of subjects achieved a PASI-75 response at Week 16 
compared with 5.8% of sub jects receiving placebo (p < 0.0001).
Clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements were also observed with APR 
30 BID for many other efficacy endpoints in both studies, including the major secondary 
endpoint, sPGA clear (0) or almost clear (1), PASI-50 response, mean change in PASI, BSA, pruritus and skin discomfort/pain compared with placebo.  Clinical response to apremilast 
treatment was rapid, with significant improvement compared to placebo as early as Week 2.  
Maximal responses were generally achieved by Week 16, and sustained during ongoing treatment.  
The overall safety and tolerability profile of APR 30 BID is acceptable for the treatment of 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  The most commonly reported adverse events in the psoriasis Phase 3 program were diarrhea, nausea and upper respiratory tract infection.  The most 
common adverse reactions leading to discontinua tion for subjects taking apremilast were nausea, 
diarrhea, and headache.  The vast majority of subjects in the APR 30 BID group reported these events as mild or moderate in severity.  None  of the most common events were reported as 
serious adverse events (SAEs).  
In 3 Phase 3 pivotal studies in adult subjects with active psoriatic arthritis despite prior treatment

response rates were maintained through Week 52 across all the studies.  At Week 16 improvements in the skin manifestations of psoriasis were seen in the apremilast-treated subjects.  
Among subjects who remained on the apremilast treatment to which they were randomized at 
study start, these improvements were maintained through Week 52.
Overall Safety Profile of Apremilast
The safety profile of apremilast has been well characterized on the basis of data from 4089 
subjects exposed to apremilast for a total of 3541 subject-years, including 1631 subjects exposed for 1 year or more. Apremilast was generally well tolerated, demonstr ating an acceptable safety 
profile with long-term exposure (1 year or more). The most frequently observed adverse 
reactions were gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances , most commonly diarrhea and nausea. The vast
majority of these events were reported as mild or moderate in severity, and led to discontinuation
in a small proportion of subjects. In general, these events were self-l imiti ng, did not require
intervention, and resolved with uninterrupted apremilast treatment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.6. Risks/Benefits of Investigational Product and Safety Population
The safety and tolerability profiles of the apr emilast 20 mg BID and 30 mg BID dose groups are 
both acceptable based on results from the clinical development program for apremilast. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with apremilast treatment were diarrhea, 
nausea, headache (including tension headache), and upper respiratory tract infection, which were 
usually mild or moderate in severity and often resolved while subjects continued to take apremilast. Diarrhea, nausea and headache tended to occur early in treatment. The overall 
discontinuation rate due to AEs was low and was most frequently due to nausea, diarrhea, or 
headache. Treatment with apremilast was associated with observed weight loss without overt clinical consequences. The results of pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in psoriasis and PsA 
demonstrate that the 30 mg BID dose presents a favorable benefit/risk profile in adult subjects &(/*(1(3Benefits oBenefits o

4.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis aged 6 to 17 years, inclusive, intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of 
apremilast with 2 weeks of oral apremilast treatment followed by a 48-week extension of 
apremilast treatment.  Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is defined as Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12, Body Surface Area (BSA) ≥ 10%, and static Physician Global Assessment 
(sPGA) of ≥ 3 (moderate to severe) [See Appendix A ].  The total study duration for each subject 
will last for up to a total of 107 weeks which includes screening, treatment (including the PK portion of the study and the extension treatment period), two s hort-term follow-up periods and a 
long-term follow-up period ( Figure 1 ).
Each subject will undergo a screening period of up to 5 weeks, a treatment period of 2 weeks 
with PK sample collection, and an extension treatment period of 48 weeks, to allow subjects 
access to apremilast treatment if medically appropriate (fol lowing the completion of the 2 week 
PK portion).  Regardless of wh en they stop treatment, subjects should complete two post
treatment follow-up visits at approximately 4 and 8 weeks after the last dose.  
All subjects should complete the final follow- up visit at Week 102 or at a timepoint 52 weeks 
after the last dose of apremilast was taken in s ubjects who have withdraw n at any time prior to 
Week 50.
At least 32 subjects will be enrolled into this study to provide an adequate PK profile and safety 
assessment in subjects of different ages and body weight ranges.  Subjects will be divided into 2 age groups (adolescents [ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive] and children [ages 6 to 11 years, 
inclusive]), with at least 16 subjects in each group. Apremilast treatment will start in older and 
heavier subjects.  
A staggered, stepwise approach by age range and weight (starting with older and heavier 
subjects) is considered appropriate for this firs t-time-in-childre n study.  Doses for younger and 
lower body weight subjects will be adjusted base d on safety and PK data from older and heavier 
subjects.  Dosing within and between groups will be staggered as described below, and in Figure 
2, based on PK data collected and a min imum of 2 weeks of safety data. 
Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive; weight ≥ 35 kg)
!At least 8 subjects will initially be enrolled into Group 1 and will weigh ≥ 35 kg. 
∀Dosing for subjects with a weight ≥ 35 kg to < 70 kg will be administered as a  20 
mg BID dose regimen (10 mg BID less than the adult dose). 
∀Dosing for subjects with a weight ≥ 70 kg will be administered as a 30 mg BID 
dose regimen (same as for adults). 
!Dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for the remaining subjects in 
Group 1 will be determined based on PK and safety assessments from the first 8 
subjects in Group 1 to complete this period. These data will be reviewed by an
independent data monitoring committee (DMC) to determine if it is appropriate to &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21y

!For the remaining subjects in Group 1, the dose strength and/or dose frequency will 
be adjusted for any safety concerns or for unexpected changes in exposure. In the event of a dose regimen adjustment, some or all of the first 8 subjects in Group 1, depending on weight, will return to the site for the appropriate dosing adjustment. 
Group 2 will open to enrollment once at least 8 subjects from Group 1 have 
completed the 2 weeks of apremilast dosing, PK data analysis, and safety assessmentsand an evaluation of these data by the DMC has been completed.
Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive; weight ≥ 15 kg)
!At least 8 subjects will initially be enrolled into Group 2 and will weigh ≥ 15 kg. The 
dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for these first 8 subjects will be 
based upon the PK and safety assessments from the first 8 subjects in Group 1. If PK 
and safety are not affected by age and body  weight, 20 mg BID will be administered 
to Group 2 children.  
!Dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for the remaining subjects in 
Group 2 will be determined based on PK and safety assessments from the datacollected from the first 8 subjects in each group. These data will be reviewed by an independent DMC to determine if it is appropriate to proceed with dosing the balance 
of Group 2 subjects.  
!For the remaining subjects in Group 2, the dose (dose strength and/or dose frequency) 
will be based upon the subject weight as determined by the PK and safety assessments.  The dose strength and/or dose frequency will be adjusted for any safety 
concerns or for unexpected changes in e xposure. In the event of a dose regimen 
adjustment after the second PK and safety assessment, the first 8 subjects in Group 2 will return to the site for the appropriate dosing adjustment.
An independent DMC will review available safe ty and PK data at the following timepoints:
1. After the first 8 subjects in Group 1 have completed the first 2 weeks of apremilast 
dosing, PK, and safety assessments.
2. After the first 8 subjects in Group 2 have completed the first 2 weeks of apremilast 
dosing, PK, and safety assessments.
Treatment administration and schedule are discussed in Section 8.2.
At this time, there are no consistent AEs or laboratory findings that would generally constitute a 
reliable stopping rule for this study.  Subjects will be monitored for AEs, vital signs, and laboratory assessments at each study visit.  A ll AEs, clinically significant changes in laboratory 
measures and clinically meaningful changes in vital signs will be recorded.  Clinically 
meaningful changes that increase the risk to the subject, as assessed by the Investigator orSponsor, may result in discontinuation of the subject from the study.  Subjects who have

4.2. Study Design Rationale
There is a paucity of treatments available for pediatric patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.  Consequently, these subjects are treated off-label with the same systemic agents prescribed for 
adults.  The currently available systemic therapies for psoriasis are associated with significant 
cumulative toxicities and are associated with risks of hepatic, renal and neurological toxicities that often require routine clinical and laboratory monitoring, as well as an increased risk of 
infections and malignancies. Given the chronic nature of psoriasis, there is a need for medication 
that can be dosed chronically with less risk. It is, therefore, important for new medications to demonstrate both efficacy and safety with continuous use.  Apremilast provides a favorable Group 2:

moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic and phototherapy.
Adolescents and children may differ from adults in their ADME of apremilast, hence evaluation 
of the safety and PK properties of apremilast in adolescents and children prior to initiation of an efficacy study in this subject population is warranted.  Although apremilast has only been 
investigated in adult subjects, it is known that there is a general similarity of disease process, as 
reflected in PD parameters, between adult and pediatric populations. Assuming a similar exposure-response relationship in adults compared to adolescents and children, it is appropriate 
to initiate dosing in the pediatric population at a dose of 20 or 30 mg BID, depending on weight, 
that will provide overall drug exposure similar to that associated with the selected optimal adult dose.
In CC-10004-PSOR-008-PK, the concentration versus time profile of apremilast was well 
described by a population PK model.   
 
 
 
 
 A comparable exposure in 
pediatric subjects is expected to achieve a similar clinical response seen in psoriasis adult 
patients following 30 mg BID.
This Phase 2 study will evaluate the clinical sa fety and PK of apremilast.  The proposed dosing 
regimen in this study will be weight-based and a staggered, stepwise study design (starting 
enrollment with older and heavier adolescents) will guide dosing of subsequently enrolled 
subjects (younger and lighter weight children) ( Figure 2 ).  Efficacy of apremilast in the treatment 
of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis will also be explored in this study.
4.3. Study Duration
The study will last for up to a total of 107 w eeks which includes screening, treatment, including 
the PK portion of the study and the extension  treatment period, short-term follow-up and a long-
term follow-up.  
Each subject will undergo a screening period of up to 5 weeks, a treatment period of 2 weeks, 
and an extension treatment period of 48 weeks, to allow subjects access to apremilast treatment if medically appropriate (following the completion of the 2 week PK portion).
Regardless of when they stop treatment, subjects  should complete two post treatment follow-up 
visits at approximately 4 and 8 weeks after the last dose.  
All subjects should complete the final follow- up visit at Week 102 or at a timepoint 52 weeks 
after the last dose of apremilast was taken in subjects who have withdrawn at any time prior to

Confidential and Propri etary 38 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 20166.6. Safety Assessments
6.6.1. Adverse Events
Safety assessments will be performed as outlined in the Table of Events, Section 5.
Details of AE reporting can be found in Section 11.  All AEs, whether reported by subjects 
spontaneously or when elicited by direct questioning, will be monitored and recorded from the 
time the subject signs the ICF until 28 days after the last dose of apremilast. Serious adverse 
events (SAEs) suspected of being related to apremilast and made known to the Investigator at any time will be monitored and recorded.
6.6.2. Contraception Education
There are no adequate and well controlled studies of apremilast in pregnant women.
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must practice abstinence or use one of the 
approved contraceptive options as described in Section 7.2while on investigational product and 
for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the investigational product.
When a female subject of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to become
pregnant changes at the time of study entry or at any time during the study, the Investigator will
educate the subject regarding options, including abstinence, and the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.
More information regarding the effects of a premilast on reproduction in animal and in vitro 
studies can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
6.6.3. Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential
A serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of ≤ 25 mIU/mL will be required for all FCBP at 
Baseline and as confirmation of any positive urine test. Urine pregnancy testing will be 
performed on all FCBP at Screening, Baseline and at the extension treatment period visits and 
the 4 and 8 week post last dose follow-up visits (Early Termination Visit as well if applicable). A urine pregnancy test kit will be provided by the central laboratory. Pregnancy testing should be 
performed if the FCBP has missed a menstrual period or the contraception method has changed.
For the purposes of this study, a female subject is considered of childbearing potential if she is 
≥12 years old or has reached menarche, whichever occurred first.
6.6.4. Complete Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination includes evaluations of general appearance, skin, nasal 
cavities, eyes, ears, lymph nodes, and respiratory, cardiovascular, GI, neurological, and 
musculoskeletal systems will be performed at Screening.
6.6.5. Abbreviated Physical Examination
An abbreviated physical examination includes evaluation of the general appearance, respiratory, 
cardiovascular and GI systems may be performed at any visit after screening at the discretion of 
the investigator, if clinically needed. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21en.en.

Hepatitis testing will be performed at Screening a nd will include hepatitis B surface antigen and 
hepatitis C antibody.
6.6.7. Vital Signs, Height, Weight and Body Mass Index
Vital signs, including temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, and seated blood pressure, will be 
taken during the visits indicated in the Table of Events, (Section 5).  Height, weight and body 
mass index will be measured and recorded at Screen ing and then as indicated in the Table of 
Events, Section 5.
Vital signs will be obtained after the subject has been in the supine position for at least 
5 minutes. Since drinking hot or cold beverages (including water) has a significant impact on 
recorded oral body temperature, no beverages should be ingested within 15 minutes when using 
an oral thermometer.
Investigators are to report any clinically significant abnormal findings as AEs.
6.6.8. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
A central laboratory will be used for this study.  Clinical laboratory evaluations will be 
performed as indicated in the Table of Events, S ection 5. The Principal Investigator (PI) or 
medically-qualified designee will review and assess all clinical laboratory data. The laboratory 
reports should be initialed and dated by the PI or medically-qualified designee, and the clinical or nonclinical significance of any abnormal laboratory results should be indicated. Abnormal 
laboratory results may be repeated to rule out laboratory errors. Any clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory result should be reported as an  AE and should be followed to resolution (ie, 
stabilizes, returns to baseline or becomes clinically insignificant).
Additional clinical safety laboratory evaluations should be performed if judged clinically 
appropriate by the Investigator or by a medically qualified designee, or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety evaluations is 
warranted.
6.6.8.1. Hematology
Hematology laboratory evaluations will incl ude red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
white blood cells (WBCs), absolute and differential and platelet count.
6.6.8.2. Serum Chemistry
Serum chemistry laboratory evaluations will include sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon 
dioxide, calcium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinin e, glucose, albumin, total protein, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin (total and direct), aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransfe rase/serum glutamate pyruvic transaminase 
(ALT/SGPT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphate, and magnesium.

Urinalysis will include specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and hemoglobin/blood. A 
microscopic examination (eg, casts, RBCs, and WBCs) will be performed in the event of a 
positive result.
6.6.8.4. Vaccinations
Apremilast’s effect on vaccinations has not been studied, therefore, a conservative approach will 
be taken and vaccinations will be withheld during the first 14 days of dosing.  Inactivated 
vaccines will be allowed during the extension treatment period, however, live vaccines are not 
allowed during active treatment with apremilast. 
6.6.9. Twelve-lead Electrocardiogram
The timeframes for all 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are indicated in the Table of Events, 
Section 5.
An ECG will be performed after the subject has been supine for approximately 3 minutes. Sites 
are to utilize their own, local ECG machines for the study and the ECG readings will be further 
interpreted by the Investigator by clinically correlating with the subject’s condition.  The Investigator’s clinical interpretation will be r ecorded in the electronic Ca se Report Form (eCRF) 
as: normal; abnormal, not clinically significant; abnormal, clinically significant; indeterminate; 
or not evaluable. Any abnormal findings in the ECG reading should be recorded in the ECG eCRF. “Abnormal, clinically significant” results should be recorded in the Medical History 
eCRF if found predose or in the AE eCRF if found postdose of the investigational product. If a 
subject has an “abnormal, clinically significant” result at Screening, then he/she should be excluded. 
An ECG may be performed outside of the timeframes indicated in the Table of Events if the 
investigator feels that this is warranted based on medical evidence.
6.7. Tablet Taste and Acceptability Testing
The taste and acceptability of apremilast tablet will be assessed using a faces Likert Scale on Day 1, initial dosing.  An example of a faces Likert Scale is illustrated in Section 19,
Appendix C .
6.8. Oral Dose of Apremilast
Apremilast will be administered orally twice daily from Day 1 through the morning of Day 14
for pharmacokinetics assessment.  Evening doses should be  administered approximately 12 hours 
after the morning dose.  The evening dose taken on Day 14 must not be taken until AFTER the 
last PK blood sample is drawn.  
Dosing regimens may vary depending on dose stre ngth/dose frequency determined from the PK 
and safety data collected from the initial 8 subjects in Groups 1 and 2. See Section 8.2for 
additional details concerning treatment administration. 
During the extension phase, apremilast will be administered orally twice daily. Evening doses 
will be administered approximately 12 hours after the morning dose.  &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21not ot

The Investigator(s) or designee(s) will account for all apremilast that is issued to and returned by 
the subject throughout the study.  
6.10. Stool Diary
Diarrhea is the passage of three or more watery/liquid stools per day ( WHO, 2015 ). 
Subjects and their parent/guardian will be supplied with paper diaries that will be filled out d aily 
to record and describe any diarrhea, includi ng duration, frequency, treatment, and associated 
symptoms ( Appendix B ). Subjects and their parent/guardian will complete the Stool Diary every 
day beginning after the first dose of apremilast, up to the 4-week post last dose follow-up visit 
(Visit 11).
6.11. Tanner Staging 
Assessments of sexual maturity (Tanner Staging) will be performed at baseline and the 8 week post last dose follow-up visit (V isit 12).  A de scription of each Tanner stage is provided in 
Appendix D ( WHO, 2015 ).
6.12. Worsening Psoriasis and Rebound Assessments
A worsening of plaque psoriasis, including flare, during treatment will not be collected as an 
adverse event unless it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). Disease activity (worsening 
or improvement in severity) will be collected using PASI. 
Rebound is defined as a severe and sudden worsening of disease that occurs between the time of 
study treatment discontinuation and the 4 and 8 week Follow-up Visits. This exacerbation is 
characterized by a PASI ≥ 125% of baseline or a new generalized pustular, erythrodermic or 
more inflammatory psoriasis after stopping therapy ( Gordon, 2005 ).
6.13. Psychiatric Evaluation
Psoriasis has been associated with an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders, 
including depression and anxiety in pediatric patients ( Kimball, 2012 ). Depression has been 
reported in the apremilast clinical trials. The investigators should advise subjects, their caregivers, and families of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression or 
other mood changes, and if such changes occur, to contact the investigator (Apremilast 
Investigator’s Brochure).
All subjects will complete the Columbia-Suicid e Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) ( Appendix E )
assessment.  This questionnaire is suitable f or assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior in 
clinical and research settings ( Posner, 2011 ).  Any subject, during screening or at baseline, that 
answers ‘Yes’ to any question on the C-SSRS, will be ineligible for study participation and 
should be referred immediately for a psychiatric evaluation.
During the study (post baseline), each subject will complete an addition al C-SSRS que stionnaire 
at each study visit.  Any subject that answe rs ‘Yes’ to any question on the C-SSRS at anyt ime 
during the study will be immediately withdrawn  from study treatment and must be referred 
immediately for a psychiatric ev aluation.  The subject should return for the Observational &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ly y

52 weeks after the last dose.
A copy of the psychiatric evaluation report , if available, s hould be in the subject’s source 
document.
6.14. Clinic Visits
Subjects will be expected to visit the clinic for Screening, at Baseline (which includes Day 1 
dosing and PK), at Day 14 (for AM dosing and PK), and 7 additional visits at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 50, during the extension period and for the Follow-up Visits 4 and 8 weeks after the 
last dose of apremilast is taken (eg, at Weeks 54 & 58). The visit window for the Day 14 Visit is 
± 1 day.  The visit window for th e Week 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 50 vi sits is ± 4 days and for the
follow-up visits is ± 7 days.
All subjects should complete the two initial follow-up visits 4 and 8 weeks after taking their last 
dose of apremilast regardless of when they stop taking apremilast. 
All subjects should complete the final follow- up visit at Week 102 or at a timepoint 52 weeks 
after the last dose of apremilast was taken in subjects who have withdrawn at any time prior to 
Week 50.
6.14.1. Unscheduled Visits
Unscheduled visits may be necessary during the course of the study to capture a subject’s status 
between regularly scheduled visits. Examples include, but are not limited to, a worsening of 
psoriasis symptoms, occurrence of an AE, or follow-up to a previously reported AE.
The following assessments will be performed at these visits:
!Assess vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, and seated blood pressure) and 
weight
!Record concomitant med ications and AEs
!Drug accountability
!PASI
The following assessments may also be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, if 
clinically needed:
!Obtain blood sample and/or urine sample for an y necessary laboratory test indicated in
the Table of Events, Section 5
!Perform abbreviated physical examination
6.15. Blood Collection for Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Blood samples will be collected t hrough an indwelling venous cannula, by direct venipuncture or 
by finger sticks at pre-specified time points for measurement of apremilast in plasma and/or 
blood.  Concentrations of apremilast in plasma or blood will be measured using a validated liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay and dried blood spot (DBS) assay, &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,2124,24

PK samples are provided in Section 19, Appendix F .
Pharmacokinetic bl ood draws will be pe rformed at the following nominal time(s):
Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive): Day 1:  2 hours post morning dose.
Day 14 (last dose of PK treatment period):  Predose (prior to morning dose), 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 
and 12 hours after the morning dose. 
Group 1 Notes: 
!For Group 1 subjects, a DBS will be collected by fingerstick in parallel (each time 
point) to the standard plasma PK sample collection.  Detailed instructions for the collection and processing are provided in Section 19, Appendix F . Plasma 
sampling may be discontinued from the protocol procedure at anytime, per the 
direct instruction of the Sponsor, in the situation that the DBS sample co llection 
method is comparable to the plasma sample collection method.
Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive): 
Day 1: 2 hours post morning dose.
Day 14 (last dose of PK treatment period): Pre dose (prior to morning dose), and 2, 5, and 
12 hours post morning dose. 
Group 2 Notes:
!If the DBS assay using minimal blood volume is verified during Group 1 study 
conduct, the DBS assay may be used in place of the plasma PK sampling for the 
balance of Group 1 and any subject in Group 2.  If the DBS assay is not 
acceptable, DBS will be discontinued from the protocol procedure per the direct instruction of the Sponsor, and thus only the standard plasma PK sampling will be 
used for the duration of the study.
Actual PK blood samp le collection times will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. 
Explanations should be provided in the source documents and eCRF for missed or mishandled 
samples and for samples collected outside the acceptable time window as described in Table 2 .
All enrolled subjects who take at least one dose of apremilast and have evaluable PK data will be 
included in the PK analysis. Pharmacokinetic data is considered evaluable if there are 
measurable drug levels of apremilast in plasma from at least 3 time points which extend over a 
minimal 5-hour period within 12 hours post a dose, eg, predose, 2 and 8 hours post a dose.

The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion
characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on
defined anatomical regions. The PASI is a validated instrument that has become standard inclinical trials for psoriasis.
Psoriasis Area Severity Index scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater
disease severity ( Fredriksson, 1978 ). Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 
(none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower 
limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no 
involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic 
region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to 
yield the PASI score.
Measurements of PASI will be performed at Screening, Baseline and all following visits as 
indicated in the Table of Events (Section 5).

Confidential and Propri etary 49 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 20168. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS
8.1. Description of Investigational Product(s)
Sufficient quantities of apremilast will be supplied by Celgene and should be stored as directed 
on the label.  Apremilast will be supplied in tablets with the following strengths: 10 mg, 20 mg 
and 30 mg for oral administration only.  All dose strengths will be supplied to the sites in bottles
or equivalent.  The excipients contained in the apremilast tablets used in this study are listed in Section 7.3 (exclusion criterion #14). Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional detailed 
information regarding apremilast.
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
On PK days (Day 1 and Day 14), all subjects will be administered the morning dose of apremilast by mouth in the fasted state.  Food and beverages (except water) will be withheld 
from subjects for at least 8 hours prior to the morning dose until at least 2 hours after the morning dose. All apremilast administered while the subject is in the clinic will be administered 
by trained staff with approximately 240 mL of noncarbonated, room temperature water or as 
much as needed to ensure apremilast is swallo wed.  The person responsible for dosing will check 
the subject’s mouth to ensure that the formulation has been swallowed intact. 
For all evening doses and all morning doses administered on non-PK days, apremilast tablets 
will be taken approximately 12 hours apart and without any food restrictions.  Apremilast tablets should always be taken with water as described in the previous paragraph.  Dosing regimens may 
vary depending on dose strength/dose frequency determined from the Group 1 and Group 2 PK 
and safety data. See Section 6.8for additional details concerning oral dosing of apremilast.
The sponsor may provide financial assistan ce for overnight accommodations near the study site 
before and/or on PK blood draw visit days for the sake of subject convenience.
8.2.1. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, applies to protocol-required dosing of apremilast.
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestio n of greater than 100 mg of 
apremilast tablets in any specific dosing period (ie, 24 hours) whether by accident or intentionally. Adverse events associated with  an overdose must be collected on the Adverse 
Events page of the eCRF (see Section 11.1) for all overdosed subjects, but the overdose itself is 
not considered an AE. Other required or optional nonstudy drugs intended for prophylaxis of certain side effects, etc, are excluded from this definition.
Detailed information about any Celgene drug overdose in this study, regardless of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported on the drug exposure eCRF page.
8.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
Prior to dosing, subjects will be identified by their unique screening number assigned by the 
clinical site.  On the morning of Day 1 and prior to receiving any apremilast, subjects who 
continue to be qualified for participation in the study will be enrolled and assigned a unique study number.  All subjects enrolled in this protocol will receive apremilast.  &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21n

The label(s) for apremilast w ill include S ponsor name, address and telephone number, the 
protocol number, apremilast name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of 
apremilast per container, lot number, expiry date (where applicable), medication 
identification/kit number, dosi ng instructions, storage conditions, and required caution 
statements and/or regulatory  statements as applicable. Additional information may be included 
on the label as applicable per local regulations.
8.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal
The Investigator(s) or a qualified designee(s) is/are responsible for taking an inventory of each 
shipment of apremilast received, and comparing it with the accompanying apremilast
accountability form.  The Investigator(s) or qualified designee(s), will verify the accuracy of the 
information on the form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to Celgene, where it will be maintained in the trial master file.
At the study site, all apremilast will be stored in a secure, locked area to prevent unauthorized 
access.  Investigational product must be stored as directed on the bottle label(s).
The Investigator(s) or qualified designee(s) is responsible for the accountability of all apremilast
issued to the site during the course of the study. 
Celgene (or designee) will review with the Inve stigator and relevant site personnel the process 
for apremilast return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus
Celgene (or designee).
8.6. Investigational Product Compliance
All doses administered in the clinic will be administered under direct supervision of trained staff.  The individual(s) responsible for dosing will check the subject’s mouth to ensure that the tablet 
has been swallowed whole (ie, not chewed or crushed).
The study staff will maintain an ongoing record of the dispensing and administration of 
apremilast for each subject via an accountability record or equivalent document that will be 
verified by Celgene’s study monitor. 
For apremilast dispensed to th e subject/guardian for outpatient administration, study personnel 
will review the instructions printed on the pack age with the study subject and/or legal guardian 
prior to dispensing apremilast in tablet form. Investigational product will be dispensed as noted in the Table of Events, Section 5. The subjects will be instructed to return the apremilast
containers, including any unused medication, to the study site at each visit for tablet counts and 
reconciliation.  Subjects will be asked whether they have taken their apremilast as instructed at each study visit.  Any problems with apremilast co mpliance will be reviewed with the subject.  If 
a subject misses 4 or more consecutive days of dosing, Celgene should be contacted to decide 
whether dosing should resume or whether the subject should be terminated from the treatment 
phase of the study.
Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive days of dosing or taking less 
than 75% of the doses between study visi ts) should be discu ssed with Celgene. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21of eaeafch ch

9.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Topical anesthetics will be permitted to prevent a nd control pain and disc omfort associated with 
finger sticks during the DBS sample co llection. Topical anesthetics (such as Eu tectic Mixture of 
Local Anesthetics) should be administered as di rected per the package insert. Prior to the blood 
collection procedure, fingers should be thoroughly wiped clean of the topical medication to avoid 
contamination of the PK blood sample. 
Only inactivated vaccines will be allowe d during the extension  treatment phase.
Furthermore, subjects may take any medication th at is not restricted by the protocol, is not 
expected to interfere with the conduct of the study and will not affect study assessments. Chronic 
medication should be dosed on a stable regimen and continued through the 2-week treatment 
phase.
All medications (prescription and non-prescription), treatments and therapies taken by the 
subject from Screening throughout the 50 weeks of  treatment and the 4 and 8 week follow-up 
periods, including those initiated within 30 days prior to the start of the study, must be recorded on the subject’s source document and on the appropriate page of the eCRF. The name of the 
medication/treatment, dose, unit, frequency, route, indication, the date the medication was started 
and the date the medication was stopped (if not ongoing) must be recorded. The recording of any permitted topical medications taken for psoriasis should also include the area of the body to 
which they are applied.
The following topical therapy will be permitted:
!Low-potency or weak corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone, desonide, alclometasone 
dipropionate) will be allowed as background th erapy for treatment of the face, axillae, 
and groin in accordance with the manufacturers’ suggested usage during the course of the study.

10.1. Overview
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum, and 
sample size) will be provided for quantitative data. Frequency tabulations will be compiled for 
classification of qualitative data.  Graphical displays will be provided where useful to assist in 
the interpretation of results.
10.2. Study Population Definitions
Two study populations w ill be analyzed:
!Safety population: all enrolled subjects who take at least one dose of apremilast w ill 
be included in the sa fety population.  Safety and efficacy analyses w ill be based on 
this population.
!Pharmacokinetic population: all enrolled subjects who take at least one dose of 
apremilast and have evaluable pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be included in the PK analysis. Pharmacokinetic data is considered evaluable if there are measurable drug levels of apremilast in plasma from at least 3 time points which extend over a 
minimal 5-hour period within 12 hours post a dose, eg, predose, 2 and 8 hours post a 
dose.
10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
No formal sample size calculation is performed. A sample size of at least 16 subjects per group 
has been selected to provide an adequate PK profile and safety assessment in subjects of 
different ages and body weight ranges.  If needed, dropouts will be replaced to ensure that evaluable PK data from at least 32 subjects is collected.
10.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subjects’ age, height, and weight as baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Gender, race and other categorical variables will be provided using 
frequency tabulations.  Medical history data w ill be summarized using frequency tabulations by 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and 
preferred term classification system.
10.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allocatio n, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. Protocol 
deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.
10.6. Exploratory Efficacy Analysis
Exploratory efficacy endpoint(s) will be  summarized using descriptive statistics.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21f apremilasapremil

Safety analyses will be performed for all subjects who received at least one dose of apremilast. 
Adverse events will be classified using MedDRA. Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized 
by system organ class, preferred term, severity, a nd relationship to apremilast. Adverse events 
leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment and SAEs will be listed. In the by-subject analysis, a subject having the same event more than once will be counted only once and by 
greatest severity. Laboratory data will be summarized descriptively by visit (n, mean, median, 
SD, minimum, and maximum). Vital sign measurements, by visit, including weight, and concomitant medications and procedures, w ill be su mmarized descriptively. Data from the
C-SSRS assessments and the stool diary will be summarized, respectively.
An independent DMC will review available safety and PK data at the following timepoints:
1. After the first 8 subjects in Group 1 have completed the 2 weeks of apremilast dosing, 
PK, and safety assessments.
2. After the first 8 subjects in Group 2 have completed the 2 weeks of apremilast dosing, 
PK, and safety assessmen ts.
10.7.1. Internal Celgene Safety Monitoring During the Apremilast Program: Role of the 
Safety Management Team
In addition to daily safety monitoring conducted by investigators and individual study personnel, 
cumulative and interval AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuations and laboratory findings will be reviewed internally by a Safety Management Team (SMT) at Celgene. The 
review follows the Council for International Organizations for Medical Sciences, Working 
Group VI recommendations. The SMT is comprised of lead representatives from multiple Celgene functions engaged in the apremilast development program. The scope, conduct, 
processes, and accountabilities of the SMT are specified in an SMT charter.
10.7.2. External Safety Monitoring During Apremilast Program: Role of the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee
Monitoring will also be performed by an independent, external Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) that will assess safety as outlined in the DMC charter (available upon request). The 
DMC is comprised of three independent external trialists and an independent external statistician 
for whom there is no identified conflict of interest. The DMC will meet as outlined in Section 10.7 or ad hoc at the request of the SMT. The DMC scope, conduct, processes, and 
accountabilities are prespecified in its charter. Recommendations of the DMC based on the 
overall benefit/risk evaluation may include pro ceeding with the study per protocol , proceeding 
with the study with modification, or study suspension.
10.8. Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental methods, plasma concentrations and actual blood sampling times from the intensive sampling schedule.  Pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentrations for apremilast will be presented as 
descriptive statistics.  The descriptive statisti cs will include but will not be limited to the 
following: sample size [N], mean, SD, coefficient of variation [CV%] geometric mean, and &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21pointspoints ::

the most appropriate dose for subse quently enrolled subjects (such that the exposure will be 
similar to the exposures in adult subjects administered apremilast 30 mg BID).
Pharmacokinetic data and 2-week safety data from at least 8 Group 1 subjects will be utilized to 
determine the appropriate dosage (dose strength/dose frequency) for subjects enrolled into Group 2.

11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health,
including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 11.3), regardless of
etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically signi ficant adverse change in the frequency or
intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be  considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome
should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms ofthe diagnosis or syndrome.
For this study, reports of overdose of apremilast th at do not have an associated AE(s) should not 
be reported as an AE(s). These reports should be discussed in the study compliance section of clinical study reports. See Section 8.2.1 for the definition and collection of ove rdose.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of 
any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests 
and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent
until 28 days after the last dose of apremilast as well as those SAEs made known to the 
Investigator at any time thereafter that are susp ected of being related to  apremilast. Adverse 
events and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all AEs as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death
!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE)
!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay)
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
!Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Protocol CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 59 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 2016Important medical events are defined as thos e occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
!A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalization 
or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
!Routine treatment or monitoring of the studi ed indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospitalization or prolonged hosp italization for a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study); must 
be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observati on that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
!An elective treatment of or an elective pro cedure for a pre-existing condition, 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to apr emilast, action taken regarding apremilast, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must a ssess the severity / intensity of the event.
Mild
!Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only
!Intervention not indicated
!Activities of daily living (ADLs) minimally or not affected
!No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required
Moderate

!Drug therapy may be required
Severe (nonserious or serious)
!Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain
!Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention
!Interference with ADLs, including inabili ty to perform daily social and functional 
activities (e g, absenteeism and/or bed rest)
!Drug therapy is required
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medicalsignificance (such as severe headache). This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or functioning.
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality 
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of apremilast and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not Suspected: Means a causal relationship of the AE to apremilast
administration is unlikely or remote, or other medications,
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a
sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility t hat the administration
of apremilast caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
apremilast and the AE.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional 
apremilast that has not been manufactured or provide d by Celgene, please provide the name of 
the manufacturer when reporting the event.
11.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ional nal

Confidential and Propri etary 61 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 201611.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with apremilast as a result of an AE or SAE, as 
applicable (eg, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of apremilast, as appropriate) and 
report if concomitant and/or additional tr eatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered (death due to another 
cause) or death (due to the SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of apremilast dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a SAE.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be  recorded as the AE.
If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record thro mbocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study, a female subject is considered of childbearing potential if she is 
≥12 years old or has reached menarche, whichever occurred first.
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (includi ng a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on apremilast, or within 28 daysof the subject’s last dose of apremilast, are considered immediately reportable events.  
Investigational product is to be discontinued immedi ately.  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, 
or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form, or approved equiv alent form.  
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist or another appropriate 
healthcar e professional for further evaluation.
The Investigator or designee w ill monitor the progress of the pregnancy of a female subject until 
completion of the pregnancy, and must notify Celgene Drug Safety, or designee, immediately 
about the outcome of the pregna ncy (either normal or abnormal ou tcome) using the Pregnancy 
Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21er

Confidential and Propri etary 62 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 2016If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any 
of the serious criteria, it must be reported as  an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or 
other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths (ie, occur within 28 days of birth) should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to apremilast should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking apremilast should notify the Invest igator, and the pregnant female partner should 
be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.  
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This instruction pertains to initial SAE report s as well as any follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to apremilast) that occur during the study (from the time the subject signs informed consent to 28 days after the last dose of 
apremilast), or any SAE made known to the Investig ator at anytime thereafter that are suspected 
of being related to apr emilast.  Serious  adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing 
the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary
of hospital records and other relevant documents.  If a subject died and an autopsy has been performed, copies of the autopsy report and d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any foll ow-up data should be de tailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the ethics 
committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up 
information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.
11.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by telephone.

For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to a premilast based on the Investigator’s Brochure.
In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Ar ea, Celgene or its authorized representative will 
report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics Committees concerned, 
SUSARs in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verification and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on 
investigational products for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-
specific requirements.
Celgene or its authorized representative sh all notify the Investigator of the following 
information:
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of apremilast in this study or in other 
studies that is both serious and unexpected (ie, SUSAR);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The Investigator must keep copies of all pe rtinent safety information on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.  (See Section 15.3 for record retention 
information).

Subjects who have psoriasis disease flare duri ng the apremilast treatment periods and require 
systemic conventional therapies, biologics, phototherapy, or prohibited topical therapies (defined 
in Section 9.1Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures) will be discontinued from 
the study and properly treated according to local treatment guidelines. In the case of psoriasis disease flare during the apremilast treatment periods, the reason for discontinuation will be 
disease progression / disease flare.  Subjects will not be withdrawn from the study if the disease 
flare and the need for treatment occur during th e follow-up periods. Every attempt will be made 
to collect all or specific final data on a discontinued subject.
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
investigational product:
!Adverse Event(s)
!Lack of efficacy
!Non-compliance with study drug
!Study terminated by sponsor
!Withdrawal of consent
!Death
!Lost to follow-up
!Pregnancy
!Protocol violation
The reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF and in the source documents.  
The decision to discontinue a subject from treatment remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor.  However, prior to discontinuing a subject, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting 
documents for review and discussion.se e

14.1. Good Clinical Practice
The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study are de signed to ensure that Celgene, its authorized representative, 
and Investigator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsi nki. The study will receive approval from an 
IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in 
accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and inthe local regulations. Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve allInvestigators who in turn will select their staff. 
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions, including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study. Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg,
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source dataverification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the
information provided by Celgene on public registry websites) is considered Celgene confidentialinformation. Only information that is previously disclosed by Celgene on a public registry

Protocol CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 67 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 201614.3. Informed Consent and Subject Assent
Both an age-specific assent (by the study s ubject) and an informed consent form (ICF; by 
subject’s legal guardian) must be signed before any study-related assessments are performed.
Documentation that the s ubject assent and legal guardian informed consent occurred prior to the 
study subject’s entry into the study and of th e assent/informed consent process should be 
recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date.  The original assent and 
informed consent documents signed and dated by the study subject, subject’s legal guardian, and 
by the person facilitating the process, prior to the study  subject’s entry into the study, must be 
maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject’s legal 
guardian.  In addition, if a protocol is amended a nd it impacts on the content of the assent and 
informed consent, the two documents must be revi sed.  Study subjects participating in the study,
and their legal guardians, must repeat the assenting/consenting process with the revised 
assent/consent documents when the amended protocol is implemented.  The revised documents
signed and dated by the study subject, subject’s  legal guardian, and by the person facilitating the 
process, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study 
subject’s legal guardian.  
14.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (w hichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed informed consent document, it is  the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain 
such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.
14.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research Physician/Medical Moni tor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protocol , informed consent document, and any other 
appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the 
documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to 
the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21d

Protocol CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 68 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 2 Fin al: 29 Apr 2016Apremilast can only be supplied to an Investigator by Celgene or its authorized representative 
after documentation on all ethical and legal requirements for starting the study has been received 
by Celgene or its authorized representative. This documentation must also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by the IRB/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document 
should also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all comm unication with the IRB/EC  and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinating Investigator and the IRB /EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the Investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and 
regulatory authorities.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by Celgene and the 
IRB/EC prior to use.
14.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board / Ethics 
Committee
If required by legislation or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC:
!Information on serious or unexpected AEs as soon as possible
!Periodic reports on the progress of the study
!Deviations from the protocol or anything that may involve added risk to subjects.
14.8. Termination of the Study
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this study at any time for reasonable medical or 
administrative reasons. Any premature disc ontinuation will be appropriately documented 
according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc...).
In addition, the Investigator or Celgene has the right to discontinue a single site at any time 
during the study for medical or administrative reasons such as:
!Unsatisfactory enrollment
!GCP noncompliance
!Inaccurate or incomplete data collection
!Falsification of records
!Failure to adhere to the study protocol.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21e e

15.1. Data/Documents
The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the 
study and the distribution of the investigat ional product are complete, accurate, filed and 
retained.  Examples of source documents include: hospital records; clinic and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; subject’s diaries or evaluation checklists; dispensing records; 
recorded data from automated instruments; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as 
being accurate copies; microfiche; x-ray film and re ports; and records kept at the pharmacy, and 
the laboratories, as well as copies of eCRFs or CD-ROM.
15.2. Data Management
Data will be collected via eCRF and entered into the clinical database per Celgene standard operating procedures (SOPs). This data will be electronically verified through use of 
programmed edit checks specified by the clinical team.  Discrepancies in the data will be brought 
to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary.  Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database.  An audit trail within the system will track all 
changes made to the data.
15.3. Record Retention
Essential documents must be retained by the Investigator for a minimum of 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketi ng applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of apremilast. The Investigator must retain these documents for the time period described above or according to local laws or requirements, 
whichever is longer. Essential documents include, but are not limited to, the following:
!Signed informed consent documents for all subjects
!Subject identification code list, screening log (if applicable), and enrollment log
!Record of all communications between the Investigator and the IRB/EC
!Composition of the IRB/EC
!Record of all communications between the Invest igator, Celgene, and their authorized 
representative(s)
!List of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom the

All aspects of the study will be carefully moni tored by Celgene or its authorized representative 
for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and standard 
operating procedures.
16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are review ed with the Investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Investigator meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protocol , eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the Investigat or and his/her staff as  well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be insp ected/reviewed by the Celgene representative in accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan.
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the eCR Fs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require  that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring proce dures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pr actice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/IECs, regulatory  authorities (eg, Food and Drug Administration 
[FDA], European Medicines Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company authorized 
representatives.  The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or 
inspections.  If the Investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact Celgene immediately.

Summary of Changes CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 CC-10004- PPSO-001  Amendment 2 Final:  29 Apr 20161. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
 
1. Revised white blood cell (WBC) levels, platelet count, and hemoglobin for subject 
eligibility (Section 7.2, Inclusion Criterion #13) 
The amendment provides allowance for laboratory v alues that are lower than the lower limit of 
normal (LLN) reference ranges used by  the Central Laboratory for the PPSO-001 
study. The revised eligibility criteria are gender- and age-specific and would allow for up to 
10% lower than the LLN for hemoglobin and platelet count levels, and for up to 20% lower for 
the WBC count, to adjust for the effects in bl ood cells of inflammatory conditions such as 
psoriasis and for certain medications used to treat it, without compromising the safety of subjects 
participating in the study. 
2. Added the excipients of apremilast to screen for potential sensitivity (Section 7.3, 
Exclusion Criterion #14)
The excipients of apremilast are specified and listed in the exclusion criteria to inform subjects 
of all ingredients/contents of the investigational product to properly identify or rule out during screening a potential allergy or intolerance that may arise from any of the ingredients.
3. Added an exclusion criterion for deficiencies in lactose metabolism (Section 7.3, 
Exclusion Criterion #15)
Because the investigational product formulation contains lactose, an exclusion was added for
subjects who may have an allergy to lactose. 
Minor changes,  in this amendment 
include:
!Modified “highly effective” to “effective” in  the Option 1 description of contraception 
methods for females (Section 7.2, Inclusion Criterion #15), which is consistent with thetype of contraceptive described.
!Added a reference to Section 7.3 for the lis t of excipients of apremilast formulation 
(Section 8.1).
Other significant changes in this amendment include: 
1. Extended eligibility to patients previously exposed to biologic therapy (Protocol 
Summary, Section 6.5, Section 7.2. Inclusion Criteria #12 and #13, Section 7.3,Exclusion Criteria #19, Section 9.2)
The amendment will allow inclusion of potential subjects who have been previously exposed to a 
systemic biologic therapy for psor iasis or other indication provided that the last dose was given 
at least 5 terminal half-lives prior to randomization. The greater availability of biologic therapies 
globally and the practice of prescribing them for a number of diseases including plaque psoriasis &(/*(1(3523ive” to “efve” to “ef

Summary of Changes CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 4 CC-10004- PPSO-001  Amendment 2 Final:  29 Apr 2016in children have become more common. Excluding patients who have had treatment with 
biologics has become unrealistic in terms of recruiting patients for the PPSO-001 study. The 
amendment will help improve recruitment while retaining the intent of enrolling a pediatric 
population with active moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Systemic therapy with biologics will be counted in the maximum total number (1) of  systemic therapies for eligibility purposes.  
Inclusion #12 is modified for this reason. Exclusion #19 was added to specify required washout 
periods for previous biologic therapies.
2. Removal of the 24-hour post-Day 14 dosing pharmacokinetics (PK) blood draw time
point (Section 5, Table 1 footnotes, Section 6.15, Table 2)
The amendment will remove the last blood draw (24 hours after the Day 14 dose) that was 
included in the intensive PK assessments for Group 1 subjects.  Inclusion of this last time point 
for the adolescent subjects was deemed, via study  site feedback, to be a major factor in 
dissuading prospective subjects from participati ng in the study because of time away from school 
and activities, as well as parents’ time away from work. Analysis of the intensive PK results can 
be performed without the 24-hour post-dose blood sample.
Other minor changes in this amendment include:
!The PK endpoint for area under the concentration-time curve from last dose to infinity 
(AUC
0-∞) was removed from the Protocol  Summary, Section 3.1, and Section 10.8 
because removal of the 24-hour post-dose blood draw requirement eliminates the data to 
accurately determine terminal elimination phase or lambda, which is used to calculate AUC
0-∞.
!A statement was added in Section 1.4 to show  the percentage of subjects in studies 
PSOR-008 and 009, that had prior exposure to biologic therapy to illustrate that previous exposure to biologics was common and was allowed in adult psoriasis studies.
!A bullet point for “Pregnancy test” was added to the Section 3.1 list of primary 
endpoints. Although it already appear ed in the Protocol Summary S ection, this a ddressed 
the omission.
!A reminder to take the Day 14 dose only after the 12-hour post-dose blood draw was 
added for clarification to Section 5, Table 1 footnotes and Section 6.8.
!Since the 24-hour post-last dose blood draw was removed, text indicating that there 
would be no Day 14 evening dose was removed as well from Section 5, Table 1, Section 6.8, and Section 6.15.
!Additional text was included in Section 6.1 to clarify that the consenting/assenting 
process must be repeated for any subject who fails  screening and returns to be rescreened.
!Text was added to Section 6.15, Group 2 Notes , to clarify that not all 16 subjects in 
Group 1 w ill need to have both the dried bl ood spot (DBS) assay and a venous blood 
draw if the DBS method of blood sample analysis is validated before all Group 1 subjects 
have blood taken using both methods.
!More sites will be added to the study so  an update of the approximate number of sites 
was entered in Section 7.1.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21meme

Added questionnaire : (Table 1 and footnotes, Sections 10.7, 6.13, 7.3, Appendix E1, E2 and H)
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSR S) was added at screening and baseline as 
well as all visits (except Week 102 final follo w up). An exclusion crit erion was added which 
mandates ineligibility if any question is answered YES at screening. A YES answer to any 
question during the study is cause for immediate withdrawal from study medication.
Psychiatric Evaluation Section : (Sections 6.13, 7.3, 10.7, and 18, Appendices E1 and E2)
This section was updated to explain the use of the C-SSRS.
Tanner Staging Assessment : Table 1and footnotes, Sections 6.11and 18, Appendix D
Added in Tanner Staging section (6.11) along with a description of the stages (Appendix D) and 
when to perform the assessments in Table 1.  
Extension Treatment Period : (Protocol Summary, Figure 1, Table 1and footnotes, Sections 4.1 
and 4.3, 4.4, 6.14, 6.6.3, 6.6.8.4, 7.2)
Optional  open label  was deleted from particip ation in the extension treatment period and the 50 
week treatment extension period was changed to  a 48 week treatment exten sion period. Sections
3.3, 4.1, 4.3, Table 1 and footno tes, Secti ons 6.14, and 9.1 were updated to show 50 weeks of 
treatment instead of 52 weeks. The total length of the study (in weeks) was also shortening to 
107 weeks from 109 weeks.
Number of Visits : (Protocol Summary, Section 3.3, Table 1, and Section 6.14)
Two additional visits, at Week 24 and Week 40, were added to comply with the request for more 
frequent safety assessments. Language was updated in Section 6.14 from “5 additional visits” to 
“7 additional visits”. The study days were updated in Table 1 to reflect the addition of the two 
visits.
Follow-up Visits : (Protocol Summary, Section 4.1, Figure 1, Section 4.3, Table 1, Table 1 and 
footnotes, Sections 6.6.3, 6.12, 6.14, 9.1,)&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ns s 6.16.15 and5 an

Summary of Changes CC-10004-PPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 4 CC-10004-PPSO-001 A mendment 1 Final: 17 Aug 2015Short-term follow-up was adjusted to 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the last dose of apremilast. The 
original Week 56 short-term follow-up visit is now Weeks 54 and 58.
Number of Study Subjects : (Protocol Summary and Sections 4.1, 7.1, 10.3)
A change from “approximately 32 subjects”  to “at least 32 subjects” and  “at least 16 subjects in 
each group” instead of  “approximately” was made. Text of “minimum of 24 evaluable subjects” 
was deleted.
Daily Stool Diary : (Sections 6.10, 10.7, 18, Table 1 a nd footnotes, Appendix B)
This was added in a protocol section as well as to the appendix to monitor any diarrhea 
symptoms and treatment.
Frequency of Height Measurement :  (Table 1)
Height is now measured at each visit.
Study Timeline Schematic : (Figure 1)
This was updated to reflect  changes which included length of extension treatment period, 
addition of a post 8 week follow-up, and adjustment to length of study.
The amendment also includes several other minor clarifications and corrections:
!Two additional possible ECG interpretations were added to be in alignment with the new 
CRF structure (Section 6.6.9)
!Psoriasis flare and rebound are now under Section 6 (Procedures) as they are no longer to 
be considered as adverse events (Section 6.12)

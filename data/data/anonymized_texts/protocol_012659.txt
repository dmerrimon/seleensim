Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  • To determine the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of 
INCB0 01158 in subjects treated with 
INCB001158 in combination with 
chemotherapy.  • PK of INCB001158 will be assessed by summarizing 
Cmin, Cmax, tmax, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-τ. 
Overall Study Design:   This is an open -label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and antitumor activity of INCB001158 in combination with 3 different chemotherapy 
regimens .  Phase 1 will consist of dose -escalation using a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design 
and will determine the RP2D of INCB001158 when given in combination with each chemotherapy 
regimen; efficacy will a lso be explored .  Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom 
treatment with one of the chemotherapy regimens is appropriate will be enrolled in Phase 1 .  Phase  2 
will evaluate ORRs using a Simon 2 -stage design to determine whether  the co mbinations have 
sufficient anti tumor activity to warrant further testing in subsequent clinical studies  and will further 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of the RP2D of INCB001158 when given in combination with 
chemotherapy .  Subjects with advanced or met astatic CRC, BTC, OC, GC, and EC will be enrolled in 
the Phase 2 expansion cohorts .

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 1 Dose Escalation  
In Phase 1, a BOIN design will be used to determine the RP2D of the combination of INCB001158 and 
chemotherapy in 21 -day (for gemcitabine/cisplatin) or 28 -day (for mFOLFOX6 or paclitaxel) 
treatment cycles in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.  The RP2D will then be further 
assessed in tumor expansion cohorts in Phase 2.  
Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be assigned to 1 of the treatment group s 
summarized below based on the chemotherapy regimen most appropriate for the subject's tumor type .  
Treatment Group A  INCB001158  mFOLFOX6  
25-150 mg PO BID continuous daily 
dosing  Oxaliplatin 85 mg/ m2 IV on Day 1 and 
Day 15  of a 28 -day cycle  
Leucovorin 400 mg/ m2 IV on Day 1 and 
Day 15  of a 28 -day cycle  
5-Fluorouracil 400 mg/ m2 IV bolus on 
Day 1, then 1200 mg/ m2 per day IV 
infusion over 46 hours  for a total do se of 
2400 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 15  of a 
28-day cycle  
Treatment Group B  INCB001158  Gemcitabine and cisplatin  
25-150 mg PO BID continuous daily 
dosing  Gemcitabine 1000 mg/ m2 IV infusion on 
Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle  
Cisplatin 30 mg/ m2 IV infusion on Days 
1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle  
Treatment Group C  INCB001158  Paclitaxel  
25-150 mg PO BID continuous daily 
dosing  Paclitaxel 80 mg/ m2 IV infusion on 
Days  1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle  
BID = twice daily; IV = intravenous; PO = orally.

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  Dose escalation will begin with starting doses of INCB001158 at least 2 dose levels below the 
maximum tolerated and tested dose from the INCB 01158 -101 study (likely to be 50 mg BID or 75 mg 
BID – see Table below, column A and B, respectively.  
The doses of  INCB001158  to be evaluated and scenarios for dose escalation and de -escalation are 
summarized below:  
INCB001158 Dose Cohort  INCB001158 Dose Levels for Phase 1  
A.  Starting Dose of 50 mg BID  B.  Starting Dose of 75 mg BID  
-1 25 mg BID  50 mg BID  
1 (starting dose)  50 mg BIDa 75 mg BIDb 
2 75 mg BID  100 mg BID  
3 100 mg BID  150 mg BID  
4 150 mg BID  N/A 
BID = twice daily.  
a If INCB001158 50 mg BID is not tolerated within a treatment group, INCB001158 25 mg BID may be evaluated.  
b If INCB001158 75 mg BID is not tolerated within a treatment group, INCB001158 50 mg BID may be evaluated.  
If the starting dose is not 1 of those 2 dose levels, dose escalation will follow the same pattern, and the 
exact dose escalation table will be provided to sites.  The IN CB001158 dose will be escalated using an 
open -label BOIN d esign  in each chemotherapy regimen , and a pharmacologically active dose (PAD) or 
the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) will be determined, or the maximum dose of INCB001158 
(150 mg BID) will be reached .  A PAD o f INCB001158 is defined as a dose that achieves a trough 
(Cmin) plasma concentration of INCB001158 at steady state of ≥  1 μM that is equivalent to the IC 90 for 
arginase 1.  This definition may be modified based on emerging data from the INCB 01158 -101 
first-in-human study, upon agreement between the medical monitor and the study investigators .  The 
MTD is the maximum tolerated or tested dose of INCB001158, such that fewer than 33% of the 
subjects receiving the combination experience a DLT during the  first 28 days on study drug .  After the 
dose escalation  is completed , one of the INCB001158 dose levels that is pharmacologically active and 
tolerable in combination with each chemotherapy regimen (ie , MTD or lower), will be the RP2D.  
Dose interruptions a nd/or modifications may be implemented based on toxicity .  Dose modifications 
should not be made during the DLT observation period without discussion with the medical monitor .  
Intrasubject dose escalation is not permitted.  
Phase 2:  Expansion Cohorts  
To determine whether  the combinations result in adequate ORRs to warrant further testing in 
subsequent clinical studies , a Simon 2 -stage design will be used for each tumor expansion cohort to 
evaluate the ORR of the RP2D of INCB001158 determined in Phase 1  in combination with 
chemotherapy and further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination .  If, at the time of 
completion of enrollment in Stage 1, it is not known whether the target ORR to proceed to Stage 2 will 
be met, then enrollment will b e paused until and unless the ORR to proceed has been met.  
Enrollment in a specific expansion cohort will begin when the RP2D of INCB001158 for the 
corresponding treatment group in Phase 1 has been determined.  
The expansion cohorts will be limited to the f ollowing advanced /metastatic or recurrent tumor types:  
• Cohort A 1:  CRC (INCB001158 + mFOLFOX6)  
• Cohort B1:   BTC (INCB001158 + gemcitabine/cisplatin)  
• Cohort B2:   OC (INCB001158 + gemcitabine/cisplatin)  
• Cohort C1:   GC (INCB001158 + paclitaxel)  
• Cohort C2:   EC (INCB001158 + paclitaxel)  
• Cohort C3:   OC (INCB001158 + paclitaxel)

Days  1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle  
BID = twice daily; IV = intravenous; PO = orally.  
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events will be performed in the expansion cohorts .  If the cumulative 
incidence of ≥ Grade 3 INCB001158 -related AEs or ≥ Grade 3 chemotherapy -related AEs is > 40% 
after 10 subjects are enrolled in a specific expans ion cohort within Phase 2, then further enrollment in 
that cohort will be interrupted until the sponsor  and investigators determine the appropriate course of 
action .  If an expansion cohort is discontinued due to toxicity, a new cohort may be initiated at a 
previously tested lower dose level.

INCB001158, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:    
In Phase 1 dose escalation, INCB001158 will be administrated PO BID with the dose corr esponding to 
cohort assignment.  In Phase 2 expansion cohorts, INCB001158 will be administrated PO BID at the 
RP2D determined in the dose escalation as long as  the subject is deriving benefit and has not met any 
of the Protocol -defined conditions  for treatment withdrawal . 
INCB001158 will be administrated PO BID in 28 - or 21 -day cycles depending on the chemotherapy 
regimens . 
Chemotherapies, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
5-Fluor ouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) will be administe red on Day 1 and 
Day 15 of each 28 -day cycle .  Subjects will receive oxaliplatin 85  mg/m2 IV concurrently with 
leucovorin 400  mg/m2 IV over 2 hours (± 15 minutes), followed by a 5-fluorouraci l 400 mg/ m2 IV 
bolus  (administration time per institutional pract ice), then 1200  mg/m2 per day IV continuous infusion 
over 46  hours for a total dose of 2400 mg/ m2.  Investigators may reduce or discontinue oxaliplatin for 
peripheral neuropathy; if discontinued, investigators h ave the option to discontinue 5 -fluorouracil and 
leucovorin .  Subjects may receive prophylactic granulo cyte-colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) support 
after completion of Cycle 1.  
Gemcitabine and cisplatin will be administe red on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21 -day cycle .  For Phase 1 
dose escalation, subjects with advanced or metastatic disease will receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/ m2 IV 
over 30 minutes (± 5 min) and cisplatin 30 mg/ m2 IV over 30 minutes (± 5 min) on Days 1 and 8 of

VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  Study Schedule/Procedures:  
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits at the clinical site on Day 1 of each cycle.  
Additional study visits may be required during some cycles to monitor for safety,  for efficacy,  
 evaluations.  Study visits are as follows:  
Screening:  Up to 21 days b efore enrollment.  Screening will begin at the time that the subject signs 
the informed consent and will continue until the date that the subject is enrolled in the study (Cycle 1 
Day 1). 
Treatment:  
Cycle 1:  Day 1 and Days 8 and 15 (± 3 days).   
All other  treatment cycles:  Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 (± 3 days).   
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, the only safety data that will be collected will be related to 
SAEs, AESIs , and pregnancy.  
Efficacy assessments:  Every 8 weeks (± 7 days).  
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, no further efficacy assessment s will be required beyond 
Week  96.  Imaging should continue per standard of care after Week 96.  
End of treatment:   + 7 days of discontinuing treatment . 
Safety follow -up:  30 days and 90 days (± 7 days) after end of treatment  (or last dose of study drug if 
the end -of-treatment visit was not performed) .  These  follow -up visits may be completed remotely 
(such as  by televisit ). 
Disease status follow -up:  Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than diseas e 
progression will continue to be assessed for their disease status during the follow -up phase and should 
continue to have tumor assessments every 8 weeks (± 7 days)  until a new cancer therapy is started, 
disease progression, death, or the end of the study . 
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, no further disease status follow -up assessment s will be required 
beyond the last safety follow -up visit.  
 
 
 
 
Estimated Duration of Participation:  
After signing the informed consent form , subject study participatio n, including screening and 
post-treatment follow -up is expected to average approximately 12 to 18 months per individual subject .  
Note that the treatment period will last as long as subjects are deriving benefit, are tolerating the 
regimen , and do not meet any of the withdrawal criteria.  
Estimated Number of Subjects:  
Up to a total of 222 subjects (if starting dose level is 75 mg in Phase 1) or up to a total of 249 (if 
starting dose level is 50 mg in Phase 1) are planned for enrollment.  
• Phase 1 dose escalation – Up to 87 (if starting dose level is 75 mg in Phase 1) or up to 114 (if starting 
dose level is 50 mg in Phase 1) evaluable subjects.  
• Phase 2 tumor expansion (Simon 2 -stage) – Approximately 55 to 135 evaluable subjects.  
Coordinating Principal Investigator:   TBD  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Method:  In Phase 1, the BOIN design will be used to determine the RP2D of 
INCB001158 given in combination with each chemotherapy regimen, in subjects with advanc ed or 
metastatic solid tumors.  Dose escalation and de -escalation will follow the BOIN design algorithm .  In 

Incyte Corporation  Page 13 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 2, the sample size for each tumor type within a treatment grou p will be guided by the Simon 
2-stage design.  
Each Simon 2 -stage design will have a stopping rule to allow early termination of a particular tumor 
type within the given cohort  at the end of Stage  1 if there is insufficient response observed, while 
enrolling enough subjects to predict possi ble target responses worthy of cohort expansion and 
potentially further evaluation in future studies.  
The proposed designs for each tumor type will be used for a ny planned Simon 2 -stage design.  Each 
Simon 2 -stage design is set up to have a 1 -sided Type I error of 0.1 and power of 80% .  The response 
rates for each tumor type will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals .

Primary Analysis:  
The following safety and efficacy analyses will be assessed for all subjects in each treatment 
combination:  
• Phase 1:  Safety/tolerability/DLTs/RP2D, in all patients receiving at least 1 dose of study drug 
(safety population), as assessed by AEs, clinical laboratory assessments (including urine orotic acid), 
physical examination results, and 12 -lead ECG results.  
• Phase 2:  ORR, defined as the percentage of subjects having a CR or PR, as determined by 
investigator assessment of radiographic disease as per RECIST v1.1 will be summarized for by 
expansion cohort.  
Secondary Analyses:  
The following safety and efficacy an alyses will be assessed for all subjects in each treatment 
combination:  
• Phase 2:  Safety/tolerability/DLTs/RP2D, in all patients receiving at least 1 dose of study drug 
(safety population), as assessed by AEs, clinical laboratory assessments (including uri ne orotic acid), 
physical examination results, and 12 -lead ECG results.  
• ORR , defined as the percentage of subjects having a CR or PR, as determined by investigator 
assessment of radiographic d isease as per RECIST  v1.1 (Phase 1 only) . 
• DOR , defined as the ti me from earliest date of CR or PR  until the earliest date of disease progression 
per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, if occurring sooner than progression.  
• DCR , defined as the percentage of subjects having CR, PR, or SD for at least 8 weeks, as deter mined 
by investigator assessment of radiographic disease as per RECIST v1.1.  
• PFS, defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug until the earliest date of disease 
progression  (as determined by investigator assessment of objective radiographic d isease assessments 
per RECIST v1.1 ) or death due to any cause, if occurring sooner than progression.

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  • The PK parameters of C max, tmax, Cmin, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-τ (INCB001158) for first 12 subjects 
enrolled in Phase 2 will be calculated from the blood plasma concentrations of INCB001158 using 
standard noncompartmental (model independent) PK methods.  
Interim Analysis:  
In Phase 1, the BOIN design will be used to determine the RP2D of INCB001158 in combination with 
each chemotherapy regimen.  To avoid assigning too many subjects to an overly toxic dose, we use the 
dose elimination rule when implementing the BOIN design.  When ≥ 3 subjects have been treated, if 
the probability that the estimated toxicity rate that is above the target DLT rate is > 95% at a certain 
dose level, then this dose level and higher dose levels are assumed too toxic and will be eliminated.  
In Phase 2, the Simon 2 -stage design will be applied for each tumor within a given expansion cohort .  
During Stage 1, n1 evaluable subjects treated at the recommended dose and schedule will be enrolled, 
and if r1 or fewer responses are observed, then the cohort wil l be discontinued .

1.1. Background  
1.1.1.  Role of the Immune System in Cancer  
Although the immune system can recognize and kill transformed cells, clinically evident tumors 
have evaded immune destruction through different immune escape mechanisms.  A complex 
network of interacting mechanisms governs the establishment and maintenance of 
cancer -induced immunosu ppression.  Immunosuppression is mediated through production of 
anti-inflammatory mediators, induction of T -cell anergy, and recruitment of immunoregulatory 
cells, such as Tregs and tolerogenic myeloid populations.  The promotion of suppressor cells and 
Tregs by tumors plays a central role in escape from immunosurveillance including induction of 
an immunosuppressive tumor microenviro nment ( Kumar et al 2016 ). 
Targeting the immune system is a proven effective approach for the trea tment of cancer, and 
immunotherapy is now an accepted standard of care in several tumor types.  Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors targeting co -inhibitory receptors such as CTLA -4 and PD -1 provide a critical 
mechanism for restoring host immune response against t he tumor ( Chen and Mellman 2013 ). 
Evasion of tumor cells from immune elimination represents a major obstacle in cancer 
immunotherapy.  Although these agents have antitumor activity in patient subsets when 
administered as monothe rapy, multiple immune inhibitory mechanisms are present concurrently 
within the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that combination therapies may be required for 
optimal therapeutic effect ( Quezada et al 2013 ). 
1.1.2.  Targeting Myel oid-Derived Suppressor Cells and Arginase in Cancer  
Myeloid -derived suppressor cells are immunosuppressive cells that play a critical role in 
maintaining normal homeostasis but under chronic inflammatory conditions can skew the 
environment toward supportin g tumor development and metastasis ( Meirow et al 2015 ).  The 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a key obstacle that has been described to hinder 
cancer immunity ( Gabrilovich 2017 ).  Solid tumors have been shown to have moderate to 
extensive infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells ( Messmer et al 2015 , Solito 
et al 2014 ).  MDSCs and neutrophils are present in multiple  solid tumors and correlate with poor 
outcome ( Gentles et al 2015 ).  MDSCs have been shown to be significantly increased in cancer 
patients of all stages relative to healthy volunteers, with a significant correlation between 
circulating MDSC, metastatic burden, and clinical cancer stage ( Diaz -Montero et al 2009 ).  
Therefore, MDSCs are considered new therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer 
(Wesolowski et al 2013 ).  MDSCs secrete anti -inflammatory cytokines and express 
immunosuppressive metabolic enzymes, such as arginase.  
Arginase catalyzes the hydrolytic conversion of arginine to ornithine and urea.  There are 
2 arginase isoforms, arginase 1  and argina se 2, that catalyze the same chemical reaction but 
differ in terms of their regulation, subcellular localization, and cellular/tissue expression.  
Arginase 1 is a cytosolic enzyme primarily and abundantly found in liver hepatocytes, where it 
plays a crucial role in ammonia detoxification by catalyzing the final step of the urea cycle.  
A separate gene encodes arginase 2 (gene symbol:  ARG2), a mitochondrial enzyme that is more 
widely expressed across cell types.

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  In the immune system, both granulocytic  MDSCs and neutrophils contain the enzyme arginase 1 
within secretory granules.  Upon stimulation by factors within the tumor microenvironment 
(eg, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin -8 [IL -8] and tumor necrosis factor -alpha 
[TNF -α]), arginase is released into the tumor microenvironment via degranulation, resulting in 
substantial local depletion of the amino acid arginine ( Rotondo et al 2009 , Raber et al 2012 ).  
Arginase -mediated argini ne depletion is an effective way to control adaptive immune responses 
as adequate levels of arginine are crucial for T -cell proliferation and function ( Munder 2009 , 
Rodriguez et al 2007 ).  Argi nine itself is a critical factor in the proliferation and activation of 
cytotoxic T cells and natural killer  cells.  Antitumor activity has been reported in mice when 
arginase is knocked out in the myeloid lineage ( Colegio et  al 2014 ). 
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tumor microarrays from multiple histotypes revealed 
that tumor cells themselves generally did not stain positive for arginase 1.  Instead, large 
numbers of infiltrating polymorphonuclea r cells containing arg inase 1 were found across many 
histotypes with the greatest frequency in lung, colorectal, gastric, and bladder cancers 
(Figure  1 [A]).  The positive a rginase 1 IHC staining in tumor microarrays in this study was 
largely confined to polymorphonuclear cells based on morphology.  Analysis of plasma from 
cancer patients across multiple histotypes demonstrated elevated arginase 1 protein levels and 
lower arg inine levels compared with normal healthy control subjects ( Figure  1 [B, C] ).

VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  1.1.3.  Overview of INCB001158  
1.1.3.1.  Activity of the Arginase 1 Inhibitor INCB001158 in Solid Tumors  
INCB001158 (formerly known as CB -1158) is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of 
human recombinant arginase 1 and 2  (IC 50 of 100 and 275 nM, respectively).  
In cell -based assays, INCB001158 reversed the growth suppressive effects of human neutrophils 
on human T -cells when co -cultured ex vivo  with an EC 50 of 162 nM.  Similarly, INCB001158 
reversed inhibition of T -cell gr owth by patient -derived MDSCs with similar potency.  In both 
cases, INCB001158 was able to antagonize the depletion of arginine mediated by neutrophils or 
MDSCs in a dose -dependent fashion.  INCB001158 has no direct growth inhibitory or cytotoxic 
activity on tumor cells or on immune effector cells.  
INCB001158 has single -agent and combination activity in syngeneic tumor models.  Oral BID 
administration of single -agent INCB001158 produced a dose -dependent reduction in the growth 
of subcutaneously implanted LL C (lung) tumors.  The efficacy of INCB001158 in LLC tumors is 
immune -mediated.  When LLC tumors were grown in immuno -compromised severe combined 
immunodeficiency mice, there was no anti tumor activity of INCB001158.  The combination of 
INCB001158 with gemci tabine or paclitaxel in CT26 (colon), 4T1 (breast), LLC (lung) and 
paclitaxel plus anti –PD-L1 in B16 -F10 (melanoma) tumor models resulted in enhanced 
antitumor activity.  INCB001158 combinations with an IDO inhibitor and/or  
anti–PD-L1 also demonstrated ant itumoral activity.  
The safety and tolerability of INCB001158 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors 
is being evaluated in the ongoing first -in-human Phase 1 study, INCB 01158 -101 (formerly 
CX-1158 -101).  Early data from monotherapy dose -escal ation cohorts (data cutoff date:  
24 APR  2017) showed that oral dosing of INCB001158 was well -tolerated at the first 3  doses 
tested (50, 100, and 150 mg BID); the steady -state trough levels of INCB001158 were above the 
IC90 for arginase inhibiti on at all d ose levels, with 90% to 95% inhibition of plasma arginase and 
increases in plasma arginine, and there was preliminary evidence of peripheral immune 
modulation ( Papadopoulos et al 2017 ). 
Refer to  the IB for additional details of the IN CB001158 preclinical experiments and updated 
data from the clinical study INCB 01158 -101. 
1.1.4.  Overview of FOLFOX in Colorectal Cancer  
CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide.  
Patients with advanced or metastatic CRC receive combined chemotherapies, FOLFOX,  and 
FOLFIRI as standard first -line treatment.  There are several different FOLFOX regimens that 
differ in the doses and ways in which the 3 drugs are given, and t he modified regimen 
(mFOLFOX6) utilizes infusional administration of 5 -FU.  The second -line therapy regimen 
usually includes agents that were not used in the first chemotherapy backbone ( Van Cutse m 
et al 2016 ).  Thus, FOLFOX treatment can be used in the second  and third -line setting after 
failure of a 5 -FU– or an irinotecan -based prior line treatment, producing an ORR of 
approximately 10% with a PFS of approximately 5 months  in second line  (Guglielmi et al 2007 ).  
The anti -EGFR bevacizumab is approved in combination with a fluoropyrimidine -based regimen 
and is an option to consider in the second -line treatment, as well as other anti -angiogenic 
compounds, such as aflibercept or ramucirumab.  Studies with i mmune checkpoint inhibitors 
Incyte Corporation  Page 29 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  reported ORRs in the range of 26% to 57% in refractory patients with MSI -H CRC compared to 
0% to 5% in MSS -CRC, indicating the need to improve the ORRs in MSS -CRC patients ( Boland 
and Ma 2017 ). 
1.1.5.  Overview of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin in Biliary Tract Cancer  
BTC is a relatively uncommon cancer in developed countries with approximately 1200 new 
cases in the United Kingdom and 9000 new cases in the United States per year.  Most patients 
present with local ly advanced (nonresectable) or metastatic disease and recurrence is frequent, 
even when surgery is feasible.  The median survival with best supportive care in randomized 
studies is between 2.5 and 4.5 months.  Gemcitabine has been found to exhibit synergis tic effects 
on cytotoxic activity in vitro  and in vivo  when combined with cisplatin.  The combination of 
gemcitabine with cisplatin for the treatment of BTC was initially studied in small observational 
and retrospective studies and then established in the Phase 2 ABC -01 study.  Based on the 
Phase  3 ABC -02 study, the gemcitabine -cisplatin combination therapy has been accepted as 
standard first -line chemotherapy treatment in patients with advanced BTC ( Valle et al 2010 ).  
The medi an OS rate for the combination therapy group was 11.7 months compared with 
8.1 months for gemcitabine alone, and median PFS was 8.0  months compared with 5.0 months, 
respectively.  ORR was also higher in the gemcitabine -cisplatin group, and the combination 
therapy had an acceptable toxicity profile.  The gemcitabine -oxaliplatin regimen used in other 
studies produced a median OS rate of 10 months and median PFS of 4.2 months ( Fiteni 
et al 2014 ).  ORRs of approximately 20% have been reported for gemcitabine -cisplatin as 
first-line treatment for patients with advanced BTC ( Bridgewater et al 2016 ). 
1.1.6.  Overview of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin and Paclitaxel in Ovarian Cancer  
Epithelial OC remains the most let hal gynecologic malignancy, with an overall 5 -year survival 
rate of 45%.  Nearly 80% of patients with advanced stage OC will have tumor progression, or 
more commonly a recurrence.  The international standard for first -line treatment of advanced 
disease is surgery and a chemotherapy combination of a taxane (usually paclitaxel) and a 
platinum agent.  The PFS has remai ned fairly constant at about 18  months.  Platinum -resistant 
disease is defined as patients whose recurrence is documen ted within 6 months of 
platinum -based chemotherapy , and the prognosis is especially disappointing.  Treatment of 
recurrent platinum -resistant ovarian and peritoneal cancers represents a therapeutic challenge, 
and response r ates with single -agent chemotherapy have been in the 10% to  20% range 
(Kumar  et al 2010 ). 
Gemcitabine has been found to be active in women with primary and recurrent OC.  The addition 
of gemcitabine to cisplatin may have synergistic tumoricidal activity among women with 
recurrent OC, a nd response rates were reported in the range of 16% to 70%; median 
progression -free intervals were 4 to 7 months, and response rates were in the range of 20% in 
platinum -resistant tumors ( Eltabbakh et al 2016 ). 
Paclitaxel i s a front -line agent for OC chemotherapy, along with the platinum agents.  Paclitaxel 
has been one of the most promising drugs to enter into clinical studies  in the setting of 
cisplatin -refractory OC.  Responses have been reported in both heavily and minim ally pretreated 
OC patients (20% -37%), but myelotoxicity was found to be a major concern.  The activity of 
paclitaxel in epithelial OC is dose -dependent, and a randomized study ( Rosenberg  et al 2002 ) has 
Incyte Corporation  Page 30 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  shown reduced toxic ity and similar efficacy w ith weekly administration compared with  every 
3 weeks.  Weekly paclitaxel has response r ate of 20% to 25% in platinum -resistant , recurrent , 
OC patients and is associated with a favorable toxicity profile.  In a Phase 3  study compa ring 
weekly paclitaxel 80  mg/m2 to paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks , the ORRs were 27% and 
16%, respect ively ( Osman et  al 2016 ). 
1.1.7.  Overview of Paclitaxel in Gastroesophageal Cancer  
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with the highest incidence in East 
Asia.  Most cases, especially in the United States and Europe, are diagnosed at a late stage after 
becoming metastatic.  Patients with advanced disease have a poor  prognosis, with a median OS 
of 10 to 12 months ( Digklia et al 2016 ).  Treatment options of metastatic disease are mostly 
restricted to cytotoxic chemotherapy, but even these are associated with poor outcomes.  
Although recen t Phase 3 studies showed some benefit from chemotherapy regimens including 
docetaxel, capecitabine, irinotecan, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin (median OS and PFS in of 
approximately 5 months), there is no internationally accepted standard -of-care for second -line 
treatment ( Bilici 2014 ).  Despite the availability of trastuzumab for patients with human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 –positive disease and the approval of the anti -VEGFR2 
monoclonal antibody ramucirumab as a second -line therapy, there still remains a need for 
effective treatment options for advanced gastric cancer.  Ramucirumab in combination with 
paclitaxel in second -line treatment of GC improved median OS (9.6 months vs 7.4 months) and 
PFS (4.4  months vs 2.9 months)  compared with paclitaxel alone ( Wilke et al 2014 ). 
Paclitaxel and irinotecan are considered standard second -line treatments for metastatic GEJ and 
gastric adenocarcinoma patients following disease progression on first -line pla tinum - and 
fluoropyrimidine -containing combination therapies ( Hironaka et al 2013 ).  Median OS was 
9.5 months in subjects  treated with weekly paclitaxel and 8.4 months in the irinotecan group , 
while response rates were 20.9%  and 13.6% , respectively.  Weekly paclitaxel produced a 
response rate of 7.3% in a Phase 3 study in subjects with gastric carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of 
the esophagogastric junction that had  progressed after treatment with a 
fluoropyrimidine/platinum -conta ining regim en (Al-Batran et al 2017 ). 
1.1.8.  Overview of Paclitaxel in Endometrial Cancer  
Endometrial cancer is the only gynecologic malignancy with a rising incidence and mortality 
(Longoria and Eskander  2015 ).  At the time of diagnosis, 67% of women have disease confined 
to the uterus and an associated 5 -year survival rate of 95%, whereas patients with metastatic or 
recurrent disease have a 5 -year survival rate of 16% ( Siegel et al 2016 ).  The standard -of-care in 
first-line treatment of metastatic endometrial carcinoma is paclitaxel with carboplatin or 
cisplatin, with both regimens producing similar ORR (approximately 51%), PFS (median 8  to 
13 months), and OS (median 12 t o 15 months) rates.  Women who progress on first -line 
cytotoxic chemotherapy have largely chemoresistant disease associated with poor prognosis, and 
there is currently no consensus on treatment in the second - and third -line settings 
(Colombo  et al 2016 ).  Studies of cytotoxic therapies used in the second -line setting have 
generally produced RRs of 15% or lower, and only paclitaxel has consistently shown a response 
rate above 20%.  Studies with weekly paclitaxe l as first -line a nd second -line treatment have 
reported anti cancer activity with an acceptable toxicity profile in advanced EC.  Modest ORRs  
ranging from 0 % to 24.5% were reported with targeted agents such as angiogenesis inhibitors,

1.2. Study Rationale  
1.2.1.  Rationale for Combining INCB001158 With Chemotherapy  
While chemotherapy has largely been thought to be immunosuppressive and exert its effec t via 
direct cytotoxicity, there is an emerging body of evidence to suggest that some chemotherapies 
may influence an immune response in tumors via induction of immunogenic cell de ath, 
elimination of immunosuppressive cells, or sensitization of tumor cells  to immune effector cells 
(Apetoh et al 2015 ).  Certain chemotherapeutic agents improve host immune responses and even 
break immune tolerance.  FOLFOX may induce a decrease in granulocytic MDSCs, high levels 
of which are assoc iated with a poor prognosis ( Kanterman et al 2014 , Limagne et al 2016 ).  
Platinum agents have demonstrated immunogenic effects that can lead to immunogenic cell 
death , thereby stimulating the immune system.  Gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide have been 
shown to improve antitumor immunity by depleting Tregs, inhibiting their suppressor function, 
and leading to peripheral T -cell proliferation and natural killer cell activities ( Ghiringhelli 
et al 2007 , Le and Jaffee 2012 , Shevchenko et al 2013 ).  Gemcitabine reduces granulocytic 
MDSCs but not monocytic MDSCs,  and MDSC levels correlate with shorter survival in patients 
with pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( Eriksson et al 201 7, Gabitass et al 2011 ).  Paclitaxel and 
5-fluorouracil have been shown to kill MDSCs and restore antitumor activity of C D8+ T cells in 
experimental models ( Sevko et  al 2013 , Apetoh et al 2011 , Vincent et al 2010 ).  Low dose 
paclitaxel can stimulate tumor -associate d macrophage –mediated cytotoxic immune response 
in vivo ( Park et  al 2013 ).  In summary, some standard chemotherapy agents can impact both the 
tumor and host immune system, which provide strong rationale for their combination with 
selective immunother apeutic interventions ( Bracci et al 2014 , Hato et al 2014 ). 
Given these findings, the combination of different types of chemotherapy with the arginase 
inhibitor INCB001158 is a rational choice, espe cially in patients  with limited or suboptimal 
treatment options.  It is, therefore, expected that arginase inhibitor agents used in combination 
with chemotherapy regimens, such as mFOLFOX6, gemcitabine/cisplatin, and paclitaxel, may 
result in greater immun omodulatory effects in the tumor microenvironment and thereby enhance 
the clinical benefit in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors ( Draghiciu et al 2015 ). 
1.2.2.  Rationale for Study Population  
Subjects with previously  treated advanced solid tumors who have progressed on or were either 
ineligible  or intolerant to standard anti cancer therapy will be enrolled in Phase 1.  
In Phase 2, the tumor expansion cohorts were selected based on preclinical data and elevated 
numbers of arginase -positive cells and MDSC infiltrates in tumor tissues and blood (see 
Section  1.1.2 ).  Therefore , combining the arginase inhibitor INCB 001158 and chemotherapy 
may result in enhanced clinical benefit in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.  
1.2.2.1.  Colorectal Cancer  
Cytotoxic therapies ar e thought to have an impact on the tumor microenvironment.  Oxaliplatin 
induces immunogenic death of colon cancer cells , and MDSCs are inhibited by 5 -fluorouracil, 
Incyte Corporation  Page 32 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  thereby diminishing the immunosuppressive effects on T cells ( Vincent et al 2010 ).  While 
FOLFOX reduces circulating MDSCs, FOLFIRI enhances the suppressive environment 
(Limagne et al 2016 , Kanterman et al 2014 ).  
Elevated levels of circulating or tumor -infiltrating MDSCs have been observed in CRC patients, 
and increased arginase 1 –expressing MDSCs were reported in CRC tumor tissue compared with 
healthy donors ( Toor et al 2016 ).  CRC has a high fr equency of tumor -infiltrating argin ase 1 –
expressing MDSCs ( see Figure  1), therefore , INCB001158 may be able to enhance the reduction 
of MDSCs observed with FOLFOX treatment.  Thus , a FOLFOX plus INCB001158 cohort will 
enroll patients with advanced/metastatic MSS -CRC.  
1.2.2.2.  Biliary Tract Cancer  
Recognition that an activated tumor microenviro nment exists in biliary cancers  suggests that 
approaches to modulating the immune system,  including reversing tumor cell –induced immune 
suppression are relev ant (Goldstein et al 2017 ).  MDSCs freshly isolated from peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells  are increased in patients with pancreatic or bile duct cancer as well as 
cholangiocarcinoma compared with those in healthy donors  and correlate with clinical cancer 
stage ( Xu et al 2016 , Dunne et al 2016 ).  Moreover, serum arginase activity in patients with 
gallbladder cance r is higher with advanced stages of disease.  
Advanced or metastatic BTC patients will be treated with gemcitabine/cisplatin in this study, 
since this chemotherapy combination is the standard -of-care in the first -line setting.  Moreover, 
since gemcitabine d epletes MDSCs and Tregs and improves survival in patients and animal 
models ( Sumida et al 2012 , Shevchenko et al 2013 ), a gemcitabine/cisp latin plus INCB001158 
cohort will enroll patients with  advanced/metastatic BTC.  
1.2.2.3.  Ovarian Cancer  
Immunotherapy is emerging as a promising approach to OC th erapy ( Coukos et  al 2016 ).  
Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes correlate with increased PFS and OS in advanced disease 
patients, wh ereas Treg infiltration negatively impacts survival.  Furthermore, reports indicate that 
VEGF -induced MDSCs inhibit local immunity and contribute to poor prognosis  (Horikawa 
et al 2017 ), and MDSC infiltrates isolated from OC  tumor tissue mediate T -cell immune 
suppression in vitro .  Therefore, immunotherapy approaches to restore antitumor immune 
responses might have the potential to influence prognosis in patients with epithelial OC, 
especially in patients with platinum -resistant disease ( Mantia -Smaldone et al 201 1). 
Arginase activity was higher in epithelial OC  patient plasma compared to healthy donors and 
arginase levels were decreased after chemotherapy in OC patients ( Coosemans et al 201 5).  
Arginase 1 was reported to be involved in the formation of an immunosuppressive 
microenvironment through exosomal arginase 1 release in body fluids including plasma or 
ascites from OC patients, indicatin g that inhibition of arginase 1 activity may be an attractive, 
novel anticancer strategy ( Czystowska et al 2017 ).  Despite optimal upfront surgery and the 
administration of front -line paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy, approximately 70% of patients 
will relapse within  the first 3 years.  The prognosis and probability of response to second -line 
therapy and subsequent lines drops significantly , depending  in great part on the progression -free 
interval after the last dose of the preceding line of chemotherapy .  Furthermore, the category of 
'resistant' patients comprises patients whose disease recurs after one or several lines of treatment.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 33 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  The biological behavior  of the tumo r in these groups may be very variable, with differi ng growth 
rates and distribution of symptoms requiring different approaches to treatment.  Treatment of 
patients with 'platinum -resistant' disease should be focused on quality of life and control of 
symptoms.  Traditionally, this is a poor prognosis popula tion with a short expected OS, usually 
< 12 months.  Four different agents, weekly or 3 -weekly paclitaxel, topotecan, PLD and 
gemcitabine, have been shown to have some activity in Phase 3  studies , with overall response 
rates not higher than 1 5% and a media n PFS of 3 to 4 month s (Luvero et  al 2014 ).  Platinum 
drugs continue to be used in the 'platinum -resistant'  population;  however, as no agent has proven 
to be superior to another, the selection of therapy should be based on toxicity, clinical situation 
of the patient , and convenience of administration.  Accordingly, sequential single -agent therapy 
is the recommended managem ent for this group of patients.  For thos e patients with a later 
relapse (ie,  over 6 month s and especially over 12 months)  platinum -doublet should be the 
treatment of choice , and studies  have included carboplatin compared with the same drug 
combined with p aclitaxel, gemcitabine , or an anthracycline.  Based on the significant unmet 
need, encouraging preclinical data, and favorable safety profile of INCB001158 , there is a robust 
rationale to combine the investigational drug with different chemotherapies witho ut adding 
significant toxicity.  Therefore, a gemcitabine/cisplatin plus INCB001158 expansion cohort (B2) 
and a paclitaxel plus INCB001158 expansion cohort (C3) will enroll patients with recurrent 
platinum -resistant OC.  
1.2.2.4.  Gastroesophageal Cancer  
Immunotherapy approaches in patients with advanced and metastatic gastroesophageal disease 
are encouraging and support the investigation of immune therapies for the treatment of GC.  
Indeed, enhanced CD8+ T-cell infiltration is observed in tumors and perit umoral interfaces in 
resected gastric  cancers ( Thompson et al 2017 ).  MDSCs are elevated in the blood from 
pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancer patients, as well as plasma arginase 1 and Tregs; 
MDSCs are a prognostic f actor for GC, associated with the Th2 cytokine IL -13 (Gabitass 
et al 2011 ) and the proinflammatory protein S100A8/A9.  
In plasma obtained from GC patients, the levels of arginase 1 were higher than in healthy 
volunteers, and the levels of arginine were lower than in healthy volunteers, suggesting high 
arginase 1 expression in the tumor microenvironment ( Figure  1).  Doublet or triplet 
platinum/fluoropyrimidine  combinations are recommended for fit patients with advanced gastric 
cancer .  Second -line chemotherapy with a taxane ( eg, docetaxel,  paclitaxel),  irinotecan, or 
ramucirumab as a single -agent  or in combination with paclit axel is recommended for patients  
who have a n ECOG performance status  of 0 to 1.  In patients of adequate PS, second -line 
treatment is associated with proven improvements in OS and quality of life compared with best 
supportive care, with treatment options i ncluding irinotecan, docetaxel , or paclitaxel, if not used 
before.  A randomized  Phase 3  study  directly comparing weekly paclitaxel with irinotecan has 
demonstrated similar efficacy for both regimens ( Hironaka et al 2013 ).  The anti –VEGFR -2 
monoclonal antibody ramucirumab has shown activity in 2 randomized Phase 3 studies.  As a 
single agent, it is associated with a survival benefit comparable to cytotoxic chemotherapy in the 
second -line setting, whereas ramucirumab in additi on to paclitaxel is associated with a survival 
benefit compared with paclitaxel alone ( Wilke et al 2014 ).  Patients with metastatic esophageal 
cancer can be considered for different options of palliative treatment d epending on the clinical 
situation.  T reatment of advanced esophageal carcinoma is managed mostly according to the 
Incyte Corporation  Page 34 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  recommendations for gastric cancer with taxanes being recommended in firs t-line combinations 
or as monotherapy in second -line settings .  Therefore , based  on the preclin ical evidence, current 
standard -of-care and limited treatment options , a paclitaxel plus INCB001158 cohort will enroll 
patients with advanced/metastatic GC.  
1.2.2.5.  Endometrial Cancer  
With the recognition of the limited anti tumor activity of standar d chemotherapy and of targeted 
therapy in advanced or recurrent EC patients (see Section  1.1.8 ), novel therapeutic approaches 
towards immunomodulati on of the tumor microenvironment are warrant ed (Longoria and 
Eskander  2015 ).  Indeed, the presence of intraepithelial tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is 
a robust predictor of a more favorable outcome.  MDSCs are detect ed in tumor specimens 
(Vanderstraeten et al 2014 ), and increased accumulation of MDSC in tumors is responsible for 
the development of chemotherapy resistance in G -CSF–producing cervical cancer ( Kawano 
et al 2015 ).  MSI -H EC has increased immune cell infiltration compared to MSS tumors, which 
might increase immunogenicity and response to immunotherapy, similarly to CRC  (Pakish 
et al 2017 ).  Therefore , the study will also include a paclitaxel plus INCB001158 cohort , which 
will enroll  patients with advanced/  metastatic EC.  
1.2.3.  Rationale for the Dose and Schedule of INCB001158  
The starting dose of INCB001158 in the Phase 1  dose-escalation portion of the study  will be at 
least 2  dose levels below the highest dose of INCB001158 that is shown to be t olerable as a 
monotherapy in Study INCB 01158 -101 but no lower than 50 mg BID.  
As INCB001158 inhibits arginase a key enzyme in the urea cycle, urinary orotic acid ele vation 
has been closed monitored in Study INCB 01158 -101 as a marker of urea cycle inhibition.  A s of 
the 24 APR 2017 data cut -off, there were no DLTs or dose -limiti ng events at the 50 mg BID 
(n = 8) and 100 mg BID (n = 6) dose levels, and no DLTs but 2  asymptomatic dose -limiting 
event of elevated urinary orotic acid ≥ 5 × ULN at the 150 mg BID (n = 3) dose level.  Given 
that relatively small increases in INCB001158 doses in rats resulted in dramatic increases in 
urinary orotic acid levels (> 1000 -fold) and  toxicity ( refer to th e IB), it was decided to take a 
cautious approach and set the starting dose at least 2 dose levels below the maximum tolerated 
and tested dose from S tudy INCB 01158 -101. 
In addition, dose escalation of INCB001158  in this study may go no higher than the maximum 
tolerated and tested monotherapy dose identified in Study INCB 01158 -101. 
The criteria for the selection of the RP2D of INCB001158 given with each chemotherapy 
regimen is described in Section  4.1.1 . 
1.2.4.  Rationale for Study Endpoints  
1.2.4.1.  Primary Endpoints  
In Phase 1, the primary safety endpoint will assess AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, physical 
examinati on results, and 12 -lead ECG results  to determine the RP2D of INCB001158 in 
combination with each of 3 chemotherapy regimens.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 35 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  In Phase 2, the primary efficacy endpoint will evaluate the ORR of INCB001158 in combination 
with chemotherapy by RECIST v1.1.  Thi s is a standard endpoint for assessing the anti tumor 
activity of immunotherapies.  
1.2.4.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
In Phase 1 and Phase 2, each anti tumor activity endpoint (DCR, DOR, and PFS) will be assessed 
by  RECIST v1.1  
 
 
In Phase 2, the secondary safety endpoint will assess AEs, clini cal laboratory assessments, 
physical examination r esults, and 12 -lead ECG results  at the RP2D of INCB001158 in 
combination with each of 3 chemotherapy regimens.  
The PK of INCB001158 given in combination with chemotherapy will be assesse d using 
standard PK parameters.  
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatment Regimen  
1.3.1.  Risks From INCB001158  
INCB001158 is a potent and selective inhibitor of arginase 1 and arginase 2.  Arginase 1 is 
primarily expressed in gr anulocytic myeloid cell granules, where it is excreted extracellularly 
and depletes extracellular arginine levels, and in liver hepatocytes, where it functions 
intracellularly as part of the urea cycle.  It has  been shown that INCB001158 is approximately 
1000-fold more potent at inhibition of extracellular arginase 1 than intracellular arginase 1 that is 
engaged in the urea cycle, primarily due to poor penetration of INCB001158 across cell 
membranes ( refer to t he IB).  Arginase 2 is pr imarily expressed in the mitochondria of many 
other ti ssues, including the gut and the kidney.  The functions of arginase 2 in these tissues 
include regulation of systemic arginine concentration, regulation of the production of 
downstream products (eg, pro line, polyamines) , and regulation of arginine availability for nitric 
oxide synthesis.  Inhibition of arginase 2 is thought to result in elevations in systemic arginine 

Incyte Corporation  Page 36 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  levels, which may contribute to the therapeutic effect.  Elevated arginine (up to appro ximately 
100-fold above baseline) has been well -tolerated in humans following intravenous 
administration.  A ten-fold elevation in plasma arginine (to a m ean concentration of 822 μM) 
were  associated with no change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure , and a 100 -fold increase in 
arginine was as sociated with mild reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (~9 mmHg 
for each; Mehta et al 1996 , Bode -Böger et al 1998 ). 
The results of the G LP-compliant rat and monkey toxicity studies are described in the 
INCB001158 IB (refer to the IB).  The lo w- and mid -dose levels were we ll-tolerated with no 
adverse findings , and the mid -dose level was  considered the no-observed -adver se-effect level  in 
both species.  INCB001158 exposures at the mid -dose level were >  16-fold above the projected 
human efficacious exposure and were associated with robust pharmacodynamic effects 
(eg, elevated plasma arginine) with no significant toxicities  noted.  
There are no preclinical data available to date on the potential phototoxicity of INCB 001158. 
Therefore, subjects enrolled in this study should  be instructed by the investigator  to minimize 
their exposure to the sun/ultraviolet light for the duration of the study and fo r 2 weeks after the 
last dose of study drug . 
1.3.1.1.  Potential Urea Cycle Toxicity  
As detailed in the INCB001158 IB, high doses of INCB001158 that resulted in significant 
morbidity and mortality in mice, rats, and monkeys achieved exposures over 19 -fold above the 
projected human efficacious exposure.  In the nonclinical animal studies, t he toxicity at the high 
doses was associated with evidence of hepatic urea cycle inhibition , including an elevation in 
liver arginine concentration, an increase in plasma ammonia concentration, a decrease in BUN 
concentration, and an increase in urinary or otic acid levels.  Of particular interest, urinary orotic 
acid was elevated by > 1 000-fold in rats at the high dose following a single dose  administration  
prior to any signs of toxicity.  Smaller elevations in urinary orotic acid were also measured in 
some  animals at the well -tolerated mid -dose level.  Elevations of urinary orotic acid have also 
been observed in cancer patients dosed at the highest tested dos e of 150 mg BID in the 
first-in-human INCB 01158 -101 study, although these patients were asymptomati c without signs 
of clinically significant urea cycle inhibition.  Refer t o the INCB001158 IB  for the latest data and 
the rationale for the thresholds of OA ( see Section  5.4.2 ) to be used in this study.  
Several measures of potential toxicity related to urea cycle inhibition will be evaluated in this 
study (see Table  16 and Table  17).  In particular, urinary orotic acid, plasma (venous) ammonia, 
and BUN will be measured on Day  1 and a t regular intervals in the dose -escalation portion of the 
study (Phase 1 ). 
Orotic acid  - When the urea cycle is disrupted, the urea cycle substrate carbamoyl phosphate 
accumulates and is diverted into the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, producing sub stantial 
quantities of the pyrimidine precursor orotic acid.  The elevated orotic acid is rapidly cleared in 
the urine and is used as a sensitive assay to identify defects in the urea cycle either due to inborn 
errors or toxic or therapeutic inhibition.  
Ammonia  - Urea cycle inhibition can result in large elevations in ammonia, which can lead to 
CNS toxicity.  Inhibition of arginase, the last step in the urea cycle, does not tend to cause 
dramatic elevations in ammonia, but such elevations  are possible and w ill be evaluated , as 
Incyte Corporation  Page 37 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  ammonia is the primary mechanism of acute toxicity associated with urea cycle inhibition.  Since 
plasma ammonia can be quite variable, elevations in plasma ammonia should be confirmed, 
particularly in asymptomatic patients.  
BUN  - Blood  urea nitrogen is a measure of plasma urea and can be reduced in the setting of urea 
cycle inhibition.  Since it is also affected by other factors (eg, protein consumption, fluid 
status/dehydration) , it is not an ideal biomarker of urea cycle function.  Ho wever, clear evidence 
of significant reduction in plasma BUN would be consistent with sustained inhibition of the 
hepatic urea cycle and should be avoided.  
1.3.1.2.  Immune -Related Adverse Events  
It is not known to what extent arginine depletion is operative in n ormal tissues or in non cancer 
inflammatory states.  However, since arginase -mediated depletion of arginine is an 
immunosuppressive mechanism, irAEs may be associated with the restoration of local arginine 
by INCB001158 treatment.  Although preclinical toxicit y studies have not demonstrated any 
evidence of increased inflammation or autoimmunity, these models tend to be poor predictors  of 
the safety profile of immuno -oncology agents in humans .  Experience with other 
immuno -oncology agents that target endogenous immunosuppressive mechanisms has 
demonstrated that irAEs  can affect any organ or tissue  but most frequently occur in the skin 
(rash), gastrointestinal system (diarrhea/colitis), liver (hepatitis), lungs (pneumonitis), endocrine 
system (endocrinopathies due  to inflammation of the pituitary, thyroid , and adrenals), and 
kidneys (nephritis).  
Documentation of the immune -mediated nature of toxicities (eg, through demonstration of 
immune infiltration in biopsy tissue) will be of great value , and an effort should be made in cases 
of severe or prolonged potential irAEs to provide evidence of the role of the immune system.  
Management of irAEs will follow the general approach that  has been used for other 
immuno -oncology agents, including 1) withholding study drug for  events of moderate or worse 
severity (≥  Grade 2) and 2) the use of immunosuppressive corticosteroi ds for more severe irAEs 
(≥ Grade  3) or prolonged irAEs (lasting > 2  weeks with minimal or no improvement , despite 
withholding study drug).  High -dose steroi ds may be used for particularly severe irAEs or irAEs 
that fail to respond to  initial oral steroids within 3 to 4 days.  Nonsteroid al immunosuppressive 
agents may also be employed for steroid -refractory irAEs.  
1.3.1.3.  Alterations in Hemodynamic Status  
Although pre clinical toxicity studies have not identified this as a toxicity signal, reductions in 
blood pressure leading to orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, or syncope are possible due to 
increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in response to the increased avai lability of circulating 
arginine, a key substrate for the NO -producing NO synthase enzymes.  This is considered an 
unlikely toxicity for INCB001158 based on the absence of preclinical evidence of hypotension 
and the tolerability of very high levels of argi nine when administered intravenously to humans, 
including the absence of an effect on blood pressure in individuals with a 10 -fold mean increase 
of plasma arginine (Mehta  et al 1996 , Bode -Böger et al 1998 ).  There has been no preclinical 
evidence of altered hemodynamic status in any preclinical studies of INCB001158.  In order to 
identify modest changes in hemodynamic status, blood pressure and careful assessment of

signs.  
1.3.1.4.  Clinical Experience  
The INCB 01158 -101 first -in-human study is ongoing.  See Section  1.1.3.1  for early data from 
this study and the INCB001158 IB  for more recent data.  Urinary orotic acid will continue to be 
monitored  in all clinical trials to understand the role of food and  extended exposure to 
INCB0011 58 and to combinations of INCB001158 with other molecules.  
1.3.2.  Risks From mFOLFOX6  
Oxaliplatin, a platinum -containing alkylating agent used in combination with infusional 
5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of S tage III colon  cancer in 
patients who have undergone complete  resection of the primary tumor  and treatment of advanced 
CRC . 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 40%) of oxaliplatin are peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nause a, increase in transaminases and ALP, 
diarrhea, emesis, fatigue, and stomatitis.  Serious adverse reactions including anaphylaxis and 
allergic reactions, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicities, and hepatotoxicity can occur.  Anaphylactic 
reactions to oxaliplatin  may occur within minutes of administration.  
In clinical trials of oxaliplatin, the most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and 
treated patients with advanced CRC were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, 
nausea, emesis, and  diarrhea.  Both 5 -fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with 
gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions.  When oxaliplatin is administered in 
combination with 5 -fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased.  Allergic 
sensitizatio n, including anaphylactoid reactions and urticaria, has been reported following the 
administration of both oral and parenteral leucovorin.  
Investigators should advise male patients to consider conservation of sperm before  enrolling in 
the study because of the possibility of irreversible infertility after treatment with mFOLFOX6 . 
1.3.3.  Risks From Gemcitabine/Cisplatin  
Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with structural similarity to cytarabine, which is approved to 
treat breast cancer, NSCLC, OC, and pancreatic cancer either alone or in combination with other 
chemotherapy agents.  
Cisplatin is a platinum -containing alkylating agent and is currently approved to treat ovarian 
germ cell cancer, invasive bladder cancer, OC, and testicular germ cell cancer either alone  or in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents.  
The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is indicated for use in the treatment of BTC , 
bladder cancer, cervical cancer, malignant mesothelioma, NSCLC, and OC. 
Risks associated with use of gemcitabine i nclude myelosuppression, which is the principal DLT.  
Gemcitabine can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anemia.  The most common adverse reactions as a monotherapy are 
Incyte Corporation  Page 39 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  nausea; vomiting; anemia; increased ALT, AST, and ALP; neutropenia; leukopenia; proteinuria; 
fever; hematuria; rash; thrombocytopenia; and dyspnea.  
The following cisplatin side effects are common (occurring in > 30%):  nausea, vomiting, kidney 
toxicity (dose -related and typically reversible), neu tropenia, leukopenia, and anemia.  Less 
common side effects (occurring in 10 %-29%) include the following:  peripheral neuropathy; 
paresthesia; sensory loss; numbness and tingling; difficulty walking (some effects may be 
irreversible); tinnitus; anorexia; d ysgeusia; increased ALT, AST, and ALP; and alopecia.  
Although peripheral neurotoxicity is infrequent, its incidence is increased in patients older than 
65 years and in patients  previously treated with cisplatin.  A relationship was found between the 
gemci tabine dose or cisplatin frequency and the incidence of the most common hematologic 
(ie, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and nonhematologic ( ie, nausea, vomiting) 
toxicities.  
Investigators should advise male patients to consider conservation of sper m before  enrolling in 
the study because of the possibility of irreversible infertility after treatment with gemcitabine and 
cisplatin . 
1.3.4.  Risks From Paclitaxel  
Paclitaxel is a microtubule -stabilizing drug approved for the treatment of OC, breast  cancer , 
NSCLC , pancreatic  cancer,  and cervical cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma  and is also used in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents  for the treatment of gastroesophageal, endometrial, 
prostate, and HNSCC.  
Myelosuppression and neurotoxicity are common side effects  of paclitaxel.  Neutropenia, the 
most important hematologic toxicity, was dose - and schedule -dependent and was generally 
rapidly reversible.  Peripheral neuropathy has been demonstrated to be dependent upon the dose 
administered, the duration of the infus ion, and the schedule of administration.  Nausea/vomiting, 
diarrhea, and mucositis were reported by 52%, 38%, and 31% of all patients, respectively .  In the 
Phase 3 second -line OC study, infectious episodes were reported in 20% and 26% of the patients 
treated with a dose of 135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2 given as 3 -hour infusions, respectively.  
Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension 
requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2% to  4% of 
subjects  receiving paclitaxel in clinical studies .  Fatal reactions have occurred in subjects  despite 
premedication.  Weekly paclitaxel at a dose of 67 mg/m2 was found to have a better safety 
profile and seemed to be as effective as the equivalently dose  administration  schedule of every 
3 weeks in subjects wit h OC (Rosenberg et al 2002 ).  Reduced toxicity (6% hematological, 4% 
neuropathy, 8% fatigue Grade III/IV AEs) was observed in the weekly paclitaxel GOG study 
(GOG 2006 ). 
Investigators should advise male patients to consider conservation of sperm before enrolling in 
the study because of the  possibility of irreversible infertility after treatment with paclitaxel . 
1.3.5.  Risks From  the Combination of INCB001158 and Chemotherapy  
The effects of concomitant INCB001158 with mFOLFOX6, gemcitabine/cisplatin , and 
paclitaxel, are b eing assessed in this Proto col.

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  As described in Sections 1.3.2 , 1.3.3 , and 1.3.4 , the most common AEs associated with these 
medications are neutropenia/ leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy .  
As described in Section  1.3.1 , INCB001158 has been well -tolerated at the first 3 do ses tested 
(50, 100, and 150  mg BID) in the INCB 01158 -101 first -in-human study.  In addition, given its 
mechanism of action of  inhibiting arginase 1, there  is not an expected overlap or interaction 
between these profiles.  Hematology, blood chemistry, and urine parameters will be closely 
monitored in all study subjects.  In addition, all AEs will be monitored to identify occurrences of 
new safety signals or potentiation of any mFOLFOX6 -related,  gemcitabine -related, 
cisplatin -related, and paclitaxel -related side effects . 
1.3.6.  Benefits of the Combination of INCB001158 and Chemotherapy  
As described in Section  1.2.1 , inhibition of arginase 1 using INCB001158 could further deepen 
the responses observed in multiple solid tumors with each of the 3 chemotherapy regimen used 
in the study by providing broader inhibition  of the immunosuppressive environment driven by 
MDSCs, Tregs , and other immune cells and factors.  It is hypothesized that this additional 
benefit will not come at the cost of additional toxicity (see Section  1.3.5 ).

4. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open -label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
antitumor activity  of INCB001158 in combination with 3 different chemotherapy regimens 
(Figure  2).  Phase 1 will consist of dose -escalation using a BOIN des ign (Liu and Yuan  2015 ) 
and will determine the RP2D of INCB001158 when given in combination with each 
chemotherapy regimen; efficacy will also be explored.  Subjects with advanced or metastatic 
solid tumors for whom treatment with one of the chemotherapy regimens is appropriate w ill be 
enrolled in P hase 1. 
Phase 2  will evaluate ORRs using a Simon 2 -stage design to determine whether  the combinations 
have sufficient antitumor activity to warrant further testing in subsequent clinical studies  and will 
further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the RP2D of INCB001158 when given in 
combination with chemotherapy.  Subjects with advanced or metastatic CRC, BTC, OC, GC , and 
EC will be enrolled in the Phase 2  expansion cohorts.  
See Section  4.1.1  for full details of the Phase 1  dose escalation , Section  4.1.2 , for full details of 
Phase 2  tumor expansion, and Section  5.2 for full study drug a dministration information.  
The definition of DLTs  is provided  in Section  5.4.2 .

In Phase 1 , a BOIN design will be used to determine the RP2D of the combination of 
INCB001158 and chemotherapy in 21 -day (for gemcitabine/cisplatin) or 28 -day (for 
mFOLFOX 6 or paclitaxel)  treatment cycles in su bjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.   
The RP2D will then be further assessed in tu mor expansion cohorts in Phase 2 . 
Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be assigned to 1 of the treatment group s 
summarized in Table  2 based on the chemotherapy regimen most appropriate for the subject 's 
tumor type.

active  and tolerable in combination with each chem otherapy regimen ( ie, MTD or lower) will be 
the RP2D.  
Dose interruptions and/or modifications may be implemented based on toxicity.  Dose 
modifications should not be made during the DLT observation period without discussion with 
the medical monitor.   Intrasubject dose escalation is not permitted.  
Dose escalation and de -escalation in Phase 1 will follow the BOIN design algorithm.  Given the 
target DLT rate of 33% for the INCB001158 in combination with chemotherapy, the dose 
escalation and de -escalation rules  are shown in  Table  4.  The BOIN design also includes an 
elimination rule.  When  3 subjects have been treated, if the probability that the estimated 
toxicity rate that is above the target DLT rate is > 95% at a certain dose level, then this dose level 
and higher dose levels are assumed to be too toxic and will be eliminated.  If the l owest dose 
level is eliminated, then the whole dose escalation will be terminated.  Table  4 (in the bottom 
row) provides the elimination rules.  Based on this algorithm, a minimum of 3 evaluable subjects 
and a maximum of 9 evaluable subjects will be enrolled at each tested dose level.  The dose 
escalation will continue, based on the rules in Table  4, until at least 1 of the follow ing occurs:  
• Enrollment of additional subjects in a dose cohort that already has 9 evaluable 
subjects, or  
• Dose escalation to a dose level that has already been eliminated, or  
• Dose escalation above the maximum allowable dose level identified in the 
INCB  01158 -101 study (see Section  1.2.3 ).  
At that point, the dose escalation  will be stopped.

When applying the BOIN design, a maximum of 9 evaluable subjects will be used at each dose 
level for initially identifying the MTD; however, the MTD of INCB001158 for one of the 
chemotherapy combinations may be a dose level below the other MTDs.  After the PADs or 
MTDs are selected for each of the 3 combinations, the cohort may be expanded to 12 (and then

4.1.2.  Phase 2 :  Tumor Expansion Cohorts of INCB001158 + Chemotherapy  
To determine whether  the combinations result in adequate  ORR s to warrant further testing in 
subsequent clinical studie s, a Simon 2 -stage design will be used for each tumor expansion cohort 
to evaluate the ORR of the RP2 D of INCB001158 determined in Phase 1  in combination with 
chemotherapy and further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination.  If, at the time 
of completion of enrollment in Stage  1, it is not known whether the target ORR to proceed to 
Stage 2 will be met, then enrol lment will be paused until and unless the ORR to proceed has 
been met . 
Enrollment in a specific expansion cohort will begin when the RP2D of INCB001158  for the 
corresponding treatment group in Phase 1  has been determined.

At certain prespecified study sit es, mandatory paired pre dose and on -treatment tumor biopsies 
will be collected from subjects (unless it is not considered to be safe or otherwise is not feasible), 
until approximately 5 evaluable paired specimens are collected in each treatment cohort.   
Collection of paired biopsies is optional in subjects subsequently enrolled at those sites and for 
all subjects enrolled at other sites . 
If either cohort completes enrollment , based on the Simon 2 -stage design, before sufficient 
evaluable paired biopsies hav e been collected, then enrollment  may continue at the prespecified, 
investigative sites until approximately 5 evaluable paired specimens have been collected in each 
cohort . 
4.2. Meas ures Taken to Avoid Bias  
This is an open -label study .  Assessment of safety using CTCAE v4.0 3 and efficacy using 
RECIST  v1.1 are objective measurements , and only comparisons to pretreatment conditions will 
be made.

VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  4.3. Number of Subjects  
4.3.1.  Planned Number of Subjects  
Up to  a total of  222 subjects  (if starting dose level is 75 mg in Phase 1 ) or up to a total of 249 (if 
starting dose level is 50 mg in Phase 1 ) are planned for enrollment.  This may vary due to the 
number of subjects  required to determine the target dose.  
• Phase 1  dose escalation – Up to 87 (if starting dose level is 75 mg in Phase 1 ) or up to 
114 (if starting dose level is 50 mg in Phase 1 ) evaluable subjects.  
• Phase 2  tumor expansion (Simon 2 -stage) – Approximately 55 to 135  evaluable 
subjects  
It is planned to have 4  to 5 sites during Phase 1  dose escalation and app roximately 11 to 
16 additional  sites during Phase 2  tumor expansion . 
4.3.2.  Replacement of Subjects  
During dose escalation in Phase 1 , up to 4 subjects per dose cohort will be enrolled at a time, 
with the aim of having at least 3 subjects who are evaluable for DLTs (see Section  5.4.2  for 
definition).   If fewe r than 3 subjects are evaluable, additional subjects will be enrolled until 
3 evaluable subjects are available.  
In the tumor expansion in Phase 2 , enrollment will continue in each expansion cohort until there 
are sufficient subjects who are evaluable for e ach stage of the Simon 2 -Stage design (see 
Section  4.1.2  for definition).    
 
 
4.4. Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation  
After signing the ICF, subject study  participation, including screening and post -treatment 
follow -up, is expected to average approximately 12 to 18 months per individual subject , as long 
as subjects are deriving benefit, tolerating the regimen and do not meet any of the withdrawal 
criteria.  
4.5. Overall Study Duration  
The study begins when the first subject signs the ICF.  The end of the study will occur  when all 
subjects have completed applicable follow -up assessments  or when the sponsor terminates the 
study . 
If there have been ≤ 5 subjects on study for more than 6 months , then a database lock of the 
study may occur to allow the analysis of the study data.   Any remaining subjects may continue to 
receive study treatment  and be seen by the investigator per usual standard of care for t his subject 
population.  In addition, the investigator will be expected to monitor for and report any SAEs, 
AESIs, and pregnancies  per the study assessment s in Section  8.  The remaining subjects are 
considered to be on study until a discontinuation criterion is met and written notification is 
provided to the sponsor .

VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  4.6. Study Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the 
terms specified in the study contract.   The investigator is to notify the institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)  in writing of the study 's completion or early 
termination, send a copy of the notification to the  sponsor or sponsor 's designee , and retain 
1 copy for the site study regulatory file.  
The sponsor may terminate the study electively if , for example,  required by regulatory decision  
or upon review of emerging data .  If the study is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify 
the investigators, the IRBs and IECs, and regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for 
termination of the study . 
5. TREATMENT  
5.1. Treatment Assignment  
5.1.1.  Subject Numbering and Treatment Assignment  
Each subject will be identified in the study by a subject ID number, which is a combination of 
the site ID and subject number.   Site staff should contact the I RT to obtain the subject ID  number 
during screening .  This subject ID number will be maintained throughout the study and will not 
be rea ssigned.  Subjects who fail screening and are repeating the screening process due to a 
change in eligibility status will be assigned a new subject ID number.   For subjects who signed 
an ICF but are not treated, refer to the eCRF Completion Guidelines for i nstructions on which 
eCRFs to complete . 
Site staff will contact the IRT to obtain the initial study drug assignment.   The investigator or 
designee will select the assigned study drug from their stock that correspond s to the number 
provided by the IRT, record the unique identifiers  in the eCRF , and dispense the study drug to 
the subject.   All subsequent dispensing of study drug should follow this process.   Full details will 
be provided in the IRT manual.  
If a subject is mistakenly given a bottle of stu dy drug that is not the bottle assigned by the IRT, 
then the IRT help desk must be notified immediately.  The reason for the misallocation of the 
study drug must be documented by the study site . 
5.1.2.  Randomization and Blinding  
Not applicable , as this is an open -label study.  
5.2. Study Drug  and Other Study  Treatments  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s) or marketed product(s) intended to 
be administered to a study subject according to the Study Protocol.  There are 4 investigational 
study  treatments in this study – INCB001158, mFOLFOX 6, gemcitabine/cisplatin , and 
paclitaxel .  INCB001158 is also referred to as th e study drug in this Protocol.

INCB001158 will be administered PO BID using a tablet (25 mg or 100 mg per tablet ) 
formulation .  Doses will be taken in the morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart.  
INCB001158 will be administered on Days 1 through 28 of each 28 -day cycle (mFOLFOX6 and 
paclitaxel treatment groups) or on Days 1 through  21 of each 2 1-day cycle  (gemcitabine/cisplatin 
treatment group)  and should be taken PO using the number of tablets  directed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.   The starting dose will depend on which phase and cohort  of the study that the subject is 
in.  In Phase 1 , the starting dose will be based on which dose level cohort that the subject is in; in 
Phase  2, the starting dose will be the RP2D identified in Phase 1 .  INCB001158 dose regimens  
will not be adjusted for body weight or surface area.  
INCB001158  will be admi nistered beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1 and continuously thereafter.  On 
days when INCB001158  is administered in the clinic, INCB001158  should be taken before 
beginning  the infusion of the applicable chemotherapy regimen (mFOLFOX6 , 
gemcitabine/cisplatin , or paclitaxel ).  
INCB001158 will be given daily for as long as disease progression has not occurred and criteria 
for treatment discontinuation have not been met .

subject may not otherwise have access to these therapies.  
5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with all study -related treatments  should be emphasized to the subject by t he site 
personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance duri ng the study.   
Compliance with INCB001158 will be calculated by the sponsor based on the drug 
accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the sponsor/designee ( tablet  
counts).   Subjects will be instructed to bring INCB001158 tablets with them to the study visits in 
order for site personnel to conduct tablet counts to assess study drug  accountability.   The drug 
accountability documentation will b e used by the sponsor to calculate treatment compliance.

5.4. Treatment Interruptions and Adjustments  
5.4.1.  Dose Modification s 
Selections and modifications to the study drug regimen are planned for the Phase 1 
dose-escalation cohorts .  Dose interruptions and modifications also may occur for individual 
study subjects.  The identification of DLTs will define the doses used in planned dose cohorts  
(see Section  4.1.1 ).  Dose modifications in the form of reductions, interruption, or 
discontinuation for any of the study treatments  (INCB0 01158 or chemotherapy regimen) may 
also be needed for individual subjec ts in the event of a DLT or AE (related or unrelated to study 
treatment).  Intrasubject dose escalation for any study drug is not permitted.  
5.4.1.1.  INCB001158  
For subjects  in Phase 1 , dose reductions of INCB001158  will be pe rmitted during the first 
28 days only i f a subject  experiences a DLT or a toxicity that may herald a DLT.   If a subject  
experiences a DLT, treatment continuation at a lower dose of INCB001158  will be permitted as 
long as the toxicity has returned to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 28 days .  When I NCB001158 is 
held or discontinued,  chemotherapy  may be continued , at the investigator 's discretion .  Upon 
recovery, subjects  may restart at 1 INCB001158  dose level lower.   Subjects  who do not recover 
within 28 days will not be eligible for resumption of study treatment without approval from the 
medical monitor .  See also  Table  10. 
5.4.2.  Dose -Limiting Toxicity and Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose  in 
Phase 1  
Dose -limiting  toxicity will be defined as the occurrence of any of the toxicities in Table  9 
occurring up to and including Day 28, except those with a clear alternative explanation 
(eg, disease progression) or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated 
clinically significant signs or symptoms based on  investigator determination.   All DLTs will be 
assessed by the investigator using CTCAE v4.03 criteria.   For INCB001158 at the dose level 
assigned, subjects who receive  at least 32 of 42 doses  for 21 -day cycle regimens and at least 
42 of 56 doses for 28-day cycle regimens  (both representing ≥ 75%  of the dose planned) , or 
subjects who have a DLT will be considered evaluable for determining tolerability of the dose.   
Subjects who do not meet these criteria may be replaced to obtain sufficient evaluable subjec ts to 
be able to assess that dose level using the  BOIN design, as outlined in  Table  4. 
Clear evidence of urea cycle inhibition (eg, an increase in fasting urinary orotic acid to 
> 10 × ULN, any OA value of >  40 × ULN, or symptomatic hyperammonemia) would be 
considered a dose -limiting event and will be treated the same as a DLT with regard to the 
dose-escalation rules and definition of the MTD describ ed in Section  4.1.1 .  See the 
INCB0 01158 IB  for an explanation.  
Individual  subject dose reductions for INCB001158 may be made based on events observed at 
any time during treatment; however, for the purposes of dose cohort escalation/ de-escalation, 
Incyte Corporation  Page 62 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  expanding a dose cohort, and determining the MTD of INCB001158 , decisions will be made 
based on events that are observed from the firs t day of study drug  administration through and 
including Day 28.  A lower MTD may subsequently be determined based on relevant toxicities 
that become evident after Day 28. 
Table  9: Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Toxicity  
Nonhematologic  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity EXCEPT:  
− Transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically  significant signs or symptoms.  
− Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea adequately controlled with medical therapy within 48 hours . 
− Changes in cholesterol and triglycerides . 
− An event clearly associated with the underlying disease, disease progression, a concomitant medication, or 
comorbidity . 
− Asymptomatic changes in  lipid profiles . 
− Singular or nonfasting elevations in blood g lucose (ie, blood glucose excursions will be considered toxicities if 
fasting blood glucose is elevated on 2 separate occasions).  
Hematologic  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding.  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia.  
• Any grade f ebrile neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 × 109/L and fever > 101°F/38.5°C) . 
• Grade 4 neutropenia that does not recover to ≤ Grade 2 in ≤ 7 days after interrupting study drug.  
• Grade 4 anemia  not explained by underlying disease or some other concomitant disorder . 
Immune -related toxicity  
• ≥ Grade 2 ocular irAEs will be considered a DLT.  
• Grade 3 irAEs that do not improve to baseline or at least Grade 1 in < 5 days with appropriate care or with 
corticosteroid therapy will be considered a DLT.    
Exception:   Grade 3 rash in the absence of desquamation, with no mucosal involvement, that does not require 
systemic steroids , and that resolves to Grade 1 within 14 days.  
• Grade 4 irAEs will be considered a DLT regardless of duration.   
• ≥ Grade 2 pneumonitis . 
General  
• The inability to receive ≥ 75% of INCB001158 doses during the DLT -evaluation period ( 28 days) due to a 
drug-relate d AE will be considered a DLT.  
• Any other AE that is felt to be treatment -limiting in the medical opinions of the principal investigator and the 
medical monitor may be considered a DLT . 
AE = adverse event; ANC = absolute neutrophil count ; DLT = dose -limiting toxicity; irAE = immune -related adverse event . 
Note:   Transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms based on 
investigat or determination will not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
5.4.3.  Management of Dose -Limiting Toxicities or Other Urgent Situations  
In all cases , investigators may employ any measures or concomitant medications, after 
discussion with the sponsor (whenever possible),  necessary to optimally treat the subject.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 63 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.4.  Follow -Up of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Any DLT should be followed until it resolves to baseline or appears to have stabilized for a 
minimum of 4 weeks , unless the subject  discontinues study treatment, in which case, the subject 
will be followed for 90 days after last dose of study treatment (see  Section  8).  During follow -up, 
subjects should be seen as often as medica lly indicated to assure safety.  
5.4.5.  Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation  
Regular meeting such as tele conferences will be scheduled by the sponsor with study 
investigators in order to review cohort -specific data and overall safety data, to agree on dose 
escalation, adjudicate individual high -grade AEs as potentially dose -limiting, and guide other 
major study decisions.  
5.4.6.  Dose Modifications for Immune -Related Adverse Event s and Adverse Event s 
Related to Urea -Cycle Inhibition  
As describ ed in Section  1.3.1 , INCB001158 has the potential to cause toxicity related to the 
inhibition of arginas e 1 in the hepatic urea cycle.  
Table  10 provides guidance for INCB001158 dose modifications and subject management if 
there is evidence of urea cycle inhibition.  
Dose modification and toxicity management for irAEs associated with INCB001158 should be 
manage d as follows.  
Adverse events (both nonserious and serious) associated with INCB001158 exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.   These irAEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several 
months after the last dose of treatment and may affect more  than 1 body system simultaneously.   
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications.   For 
suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes.   
Additional procedures or tests  such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin biopsy may be included 
as part of the evaluation.   Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue 
INCB001158 and administer corticosteroids . 
Table  10 summarizes the AE dose modification actions for INCB001158.   Of note, w hen 
indicated by Table  10 to mitigate irAEs, the dose of INCB001158 must be reduced using the 
dosing levels outlined in  Table  4.  Once reduced, r e-escalation of INCB001158 is not permitted.

General Instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where INCB001158 has been withheld, INCB001158 can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has been tapered.   
INCB001158 should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or corticosteroids cannot be redu ced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or 
equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
3. For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid.  Other immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if irAEs 
cannot be control led by corticosteroids.  
AE = adverse event; ALT (SGPT) = alanine aminotransferase (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase); AST (SGOT) = aspartate amino transferase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase); CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Eve nts; DKA = diabetic ketoacidosis; IV = intravenous; irAE  = infusion -related adverse events; 
T1DM  = Type 1 diabetes mellitus . 
a Subjects with radiographically documented liver metastases should withhold at >  5 × ULN.  
b For subjects with Grade 3 or 4 immune -related endocrinopathy where withholding of INCB001158 is required, INCB001158 may be resumed when AE resolves to ≤ Grade 2 
and is c ontrolled with hormonal replacement therapy or achieved metabolic control (in case of T1DM).  
c Subjects with Grade 3 rash in the absence of desquamation, with no mucosal involvement, that does no t require systemic steroids, and that resolves to Grade  1 within 14 days do  
not have to hold study medication and may be treated similar as Grade 1 events.  
d If Grade 4 lipase/amylase elevation i s asymptomatic and abdominal imaging suggests no pathology, then study drug administration dosing may continue (with or without dose 
reduction) with medical monitor approval.

Dose modificatio ns for hematologic and nonhematologic AEs related to chemotherapy may be 
managed per institutional guidelines.  In the absence of these, recommendations for dose 
modifications for chemotherapy regimen in the event of hematologic and nonhematologic AEs 
are provided in the Protocol appendices:  
• Appendix  C for subjects who receive mFOLFOX 6  
• Appendix  D for subjects who receive gemcitabine /cisplatin  
• Appendix  E for subjects who rece ive paclitaxel  
It is important to note that some AEs will overlap with potential irAEs.  In these cases, both the 
AE and irAE guidance should be reviewed to determine the most appropriate management of 
study medications.  
5.4.8.  Supportive Care Guidelines for M anageme nt of Hyperammonemia  
Subjects should be monitored for e levated venous plasma ammonia.  Asymptomatic clinically 
significant drug -related elevations in ammonia (eg, a repeatable elevation in ammonia 
> 2 × ULN AND > 2  × baseline) should be managed by interrupting INCB001158 and 
monitoring to resolution.   For symptomatic elevations (ie , significant ammonia elevation 
associated with nausea, vomiting, severe anorexia, mental status changes, seizure, or other 
symptoms associ ated with hyperammonemia), subjects should be admitted for management 
according to the local institutional protocol for hyperammonemia, including 1) sending 
appropriate labs (ammonia [on ice, measured immediately] , plasma amino acid profile, LFTs, 
electrol ytes, bicarb, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and urine orotic acid ), 2) IV hydration with 
dextrose -containing fluids, 3) discontinuation of protein intake, 4) implementing therapy to 
reduce ammonia levels (oral lactulose/lac titol, IV Ammonul®), and 5) identifyi ng and treating 
any potential triggers (eg, discontinue corticosteroids, treat infections, etc).  
5.4.9.  Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by the underlying malignancy will be 
presumed to be related to study treatment  administration and will require that the study treatment  
be permanently discontinued.   Unacceptable toxicity is defined as  follows : 
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study treatment  that, in the 
judgment of t he investigator or the sponsor 's medical monitor, compromises the 
subject 's ability to continue study -specific pr ocedures  or is considered to not be in the 
subject 's best interest.  
• An AE requiri ng more than 2 dose reductions of INCB0 01158 . 
• Persistent AE re quiring a delay of therapy for more than 12 weeks unless a greater 
delay has been approved by the sponsor .

VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Treatment  
5.5.1.  Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment  for the following reasons:  
• The subject becomes pregnant.  
• Consent is withdrawn .  Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time 
without penalty of jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.  
Note:   Consent withdrawn means tha t the subject can no longer be followed and no 
additional data can be collected.  Subjects may choose to discontinue study treatment 
and remain in the study to be followed for progression . 
Note :  As of Protocol A mendment 4, subjects who withdr aw consent will no longer 
be followed for progression  beyond the last safety follow -up visit.  
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject 's health or well -being , in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.  
• Unacceptable toxicity (see Sections  5.4.6  and 5.4.9 ).  Subjects wit h unacceptable 
toxicities must be withdrawn from study treatment but will continue in the follow -up 
period  of the study (see Section  6.4). 
• The subject has an unacceptable toxicity or a toxicity that does not recover in 
6 weeks.   Investigators who wish to continue treatment after a treatment delay of 
4 weeks should consult with  the sponsor 's medical monitor for approval.  
• The study is t erminat ed by the sponsor.  
• The study is t erminat ed by the lo cal health authority , IRB, or IEC. 
A subject  may be discontinued  from study  treatment  as follows : 
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per RECIST v1.1 (see 
Section  7.7.1.2 ).  A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment  
with confirmed radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved 
(see Section  7.7.1.2  and 7.7.1.5 ). 
Note:   For unconfirmed progression , see Section  7.7.1.2 . 
If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility criteria  
(see Section  3), then the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will 
determine whether the subject sho uld be withdrawn from the study . 
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the 
investigator 's opinion , then the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on 
handling the subject.

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  5.5.2.  Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug , the subject will 
be withdrawn from the s tudy, and the end -of-treatment  visit should be conducted.   Reasonable 
efforts should be made to have the subject  return for a follow -up visit.   These visits are described 
in Section  6.  The last date of the last dose of study drug  and the reason for subject withdrawal 
will be recorded  in the eCRF . 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study  treatment:  
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified.  
• The reason(s)  for withdrawal must be documented in the subject 's medical record and 
in the eCRF.  
• The EOT  visit should be performed.  
• The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the eCRF and IRT . 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the fol low-up visit or until 
study drug –related toxicities resolve, return to baseline , or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longe st. 
• Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will continue to 
be followed for disease status as outlin ed in Section  6.4.2 . 
 
 
If the subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of 
follow -up data (safety follow -up or disease asses sment), then no additional data collection 
should occur; however, subjects will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment 
but continuing in  the follow -up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments.  
5.6. Concomitant Medications  
All prior and concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF.   Any 
medication received up to 21 days before the first dose of study treatment and within  90 days 
after the last dose of study treatment, or until the subject begins a new anti cancer therapy, 
whichever occurs first, will be recorded in the eCRF.   Any addition, deletion, or change in the 
dose of these medications will also be recorded.   Concomitant medications administered after 
90 days after the last dose of study treatment shou ld be recorded for  SAEs as defined in 
Section  8.3.  Concomitant treatments/procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical 
condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF.  
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, use of concomitant medications should be monitored for 
subjects to verify that they are not taking any concomitant medication prohibited per protocol; 
however, concomita nt medications no longer need to be collected in the eCRF , except for 
concomitant medications in relation with SAEs or AESIs .

administered at the discretion of the investigator  in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.   All concomitant medication will be recorded on the eCRF including all 
prescription, over -the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.   If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug dosage frequency, route, and date will also 
be included on the eCRF.  
Palliative and supportive care is permitted during the course of the study for underlying medical 
conditions and management of symptoms.   Surgery for tumor control is not permitted during the 
study.   Palliative radiotherapy is permitted to a limited number of lesions if considered medically 
necessary by the treating physician as long as the lesions are NOT a RECIST v1.1 –defined target 
lesion.  Study therapy should be held during the course of palliative radiotherapy and should be 
resumed no earlier than the next scheduled administration of study therapy.   The specifics of the 
radiation treatment, including the location, will be recorded.  
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (eg , allopurinol ) cause an accumulation of orotic acid in the urine, 
which would confound the assessment of safety in these subjects .  Since there is no expected 
toxicity associated with this accumulation, subjects  receiving xanthine oxidase inhibitors may be 
enrolled.   The sponsor  should be informed of any subject  that is receiving a xanthine oxidase 
inhibitor as a concomitant therapy , and the evaluation of urinary orotic acid should not be 
performed , as the result s will be uninterpretable and may incorrectly suggest urea cycle 
inhibition.  
Note:   The use of bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted in this study.  
5.6.2.  Restricted Medications  
Caution should be exercised  when paclitaxel is administered with concomitant medications  that 
are inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 , to avoid excess toxicity due to higher paclitaxel 
exposure.  
Caution should be exercised when cisplatin  is administered with concomitant medications  that 
are nephrotoxic or ototoxic to avoid additive to xicity with cisplatin . 
5.6.3.  Prohibited Medications  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing study.   If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination 
specifically prohibit ed during the study, discontinuation from study therapy may be required.   
The investigator  should discuss any questions regarding this with the medical monitor .  The final 
decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator  and/or the subject 's 
primary physician.   However, the decision to continue the subject on study treatment requires the 
mutual agreement of the investigator , the medical monitor , and the subject.

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
VV-CLIN -000593  CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following  therapi es during the screening and treatment 
of this study:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy not specified in this 
Protocol.  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this Protocol.  
• Investigational agents other than INCB001158  and chemotherapy used  in the study . 
• Oncologic surgery for tumor control.  
• Radiation therapy for disease control.  
Note:   Radiation therapy to symptomatic lesions or to the brain may be allowed at the 
investigator 's discretion, provided the lesions were not previously defined by the site 
as target lesions.  
• Live vaccines within 30 days before  the first dose of study treatment , while 
participating in the study , and until 3 months after the last dos e of any component of 
study treatment . 
− Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:   measles, 
mumps, rubella, chickenpox, yellow fever, nasal seasonal flu, nasal H1N1 flu, 
rabies, Bacillus Calmette -Guérin , and typhoid.  
• Except for erythropoietin or darbepoetin alpha (Aranes p®), use of growth factors 
(G-CSF, GM-CSF, etc ) is not permitted in the first treatment cycle unless the subject  
experiences a hematologic DLT.  
• Concomitant treatment with valproic acid/valproate -containing therapies is not 
permitted , as hyperammonemia is a well -described toxicity of valproi c acid, 
particularly at high exposures, potentially through inhibition of the urea cycle 
(Verrotti et al 2002 , Wadzinski et al 2007 ). 
• Concomitant administration of inducers of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 is prohibited  with 
paclitaxel treatment.  See Appendix  F for a list of inducers and inhibitors of CYP2C8 
and CYP3A4 . 
• Prolonged therapy with systemic glucocorticoids (>  7 days) for any purpose other 
than to modulate symptoms from an AE, SAE, or event of clinica l interest, or for use 
as a pre medication for chemotherapy or in participants with a known history of an IV 
contrast allergy administere d as part of CT radiography.  Brief, limited use of 
systemic corticosteroids (≤  7 days) are permitted where such use is considered 
standard of care (eg, for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  exacerbation).  
− Replacement doses of steroids (for example, p rednisone 5 to 7.5 mg daily) are 
permitted while on study, as is the use of local steroids.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the subject  is enrolled  in the study 
(Cycle  1 Day  1).  Screening may not exceed 21 days.  Assessm ents that are required to 
demonstrate eligibility  may be performed over the course of 1 or more days during the screening 
process . 
Procedures  conducted as part of the subject 's routine clinical management (eg, blood count, 
imaging study) and obtained befor e signing of informed consent may be u sed for screening or 
baseline purposes provided that the procedure meets the Protocol -defined criteria and has been 
performed in the timeframe of the study  (ie, within 21 days of Cycle 1 Day 1) .  All information 
associ ated with eligibility requirements  must be entered into the appropriate eCRF  pages.  
Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility  before  
enrollment  or the administration of study drug .  Tests with results that fail eligibility 
requirements may be repeated once during screening if the investigator believe s the results to be 
Incyte Corporation  Page 86 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  in error.   For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before  
treatment assignment  will be used to determine subject eligibility.   Additionally, a subject  who 
fails screening may repeat the screening process 1 time if the investigator believes  there has  been 
a change in eligibility status (eg , after recovery from an infection).  
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day the subject receives the first dose of study treatment  
(Cycle 1 Day 1) , as assigned in the IRT system,  through the point at which the investigator  
determines the subject will be permanently discontinued from study treatment .  Cycle 1 Day 1  
must be no more than 21 days after the subject has signed the ICF.   Dates for subsequent study 
visits will be determined based on this day and should occur within 3 days ( ±) of the scheduled 
date unless delayed for safety reasons.   At Cycle 1 Day 1, results from screening visit evaluations 
should be reviewed to determine whether  the subject continues to meet the eligibility 
requirements , as specified in the Protocol.  
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits as outlined i n Table  11, Table  12, Table  13, 
and Table  14 (see Table  15 for all subjects as of Protocol A mendment 4 ), and toxicities will be 
monit ored continuously and will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v4.03 criteria . 
6.3. End of Treatment  
When the subject permanently discontinues treatment , as outlined in Section  5.5, the EOT visit 
should be conducted.   If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT evaluations 
will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered  in the EOT visit in the 
eCRF.   The EOT visit may occur up to 7 days after the subject receives  the final dose of study 
treatment.   The subject should be encouraged to return for the safety follow -up visit.   When  the 
subject permanently discontinue s study dru g, the EOT visit should be conducted.   If the EOT  
visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT  evaluations will supersede  those of that 
scheduled visit , and the data should be entered in the EOT  visit in the eCRF .  The subject should 
be encouraged to return for the follow -up visit. 
6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1.  Safety Follow -Up 
The safety follow -up period  is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up 
visit, which should occur  30 days and 90 days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study 
drug if the EOT visit was not performed ).  Adverse events  and SAEs must be reported up until at 
least 90 days after the last dose of study drug , the date of the  second safety  follow -up visit, or 
until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer .  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the follow -up visit s and report 
any AEs that may occur during this period .  If the subject cannot ret urn to the site for the safety 
follow -up visit s, the subject should be contacted by telephone for assessment of AEs and SAEs, 
and this should be documented in the eCRF.  
Adverse events and SAEs before the start of the new anticancer therapy must be reported.   If a 
subject begins a new anticancer therapy before the end of the 30 -day or 90 -day safety follow -up 
Incyte Corporation  Page 87 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  period, the safety follow -up visit should be performed before the new anticancer therapy is 
started.  
 
 
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, data will only be collected for SAEs, AE SIs, and 
pregnancy .   
 
6.4.2.  Disease Status  Follow -Up 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move 
into the disease status follow -up period  and should be assessed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) by 
radiologic imaging to monitor disease status.   Every effort should be made to collect information 
regarding disease status until:  
• The start of new antineoplastic therapy.  
• Disease progression . 
• Death . 
• The end of the study.  
• Withdrawal of consent . 
Information regarding post -treatment anticancer therapy will be collected if it is initiated . 
NOTE:  As of Protocol A mendment 4, disease status follow -up visits for subjects who 
discontinue study treatment for a reason other than disease progression are  no longer required 
beyond the last safety follow -up visit .  The last disease status follow -up data will be recorded in 
the eCRF at the time of the last safety follow -up visit .  The last study visit will be the safety 
follow -up visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.5. End of Study  
Subjects will be considered as having completed the st udy if they meet any of the following 
criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available.  
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained.  
(NOTE:   Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death.)  
• Consent is withdra wn for any further contact related to this study.  
− Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty of 
jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise 
entitled.   Every reasonable effort should b e made to determine the reason a 
subject withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the 
eCRF . 
• The study is terminated by the sponsor . 
• The study is terminated by the local health authority or IRB or IEC . 
6.6. Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled  study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.   Any assessments performed 
at those visits should be recorded in the eCRF.

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASS ESSMENTS AND PROCEDU RES  
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtai ned from the study subject before  conducting any 
study -specific procedures using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC that contains all elements 
required by ICH E6, and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a 
form understan dable to the study subject.   Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and 
administration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by the investigator , 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.   The info rmed consent 
process for each subject must be documented in writing within the  subject source documentation.   
Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in 
order to participate in the study (see Appendix  A). 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology  Procedure  
The IRT will be contacted to obtain a subject identification  number when a subject enters 
screening.   Upon determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be 
contacted to obtain  the treatment  assignment.   Additionally, the IRT will be contacted at each 
regular study visit to update the study drug  supply.  
7.3. Demography and Medical History  
7.3.1.  Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening 
by the investigator or qualified designee and will include date of birth, race, ethnicity, medical 
and surgical history, and current illnesses.   Medical history will include relevant medical or 
surgical treatment within the last 10 years that are considered to be clinically significant by the 
investigator . 
7.3.2.  Disease Characteristics  and Treatment History  
A disease -targeted medical and medication history  will be collected at screening .  In addition, 
disease -relevant biomarker information is required where available (eg, CRC:   MSI status, 
carcinoembryonic antigen  level; gastric cancer:  Epstein Barr virus  status, H. pylor i status, CA 
19-9 level; OC:  BRCA1 and BRCA2 status, CA 125 level ; EC:  MSI status ).  These items will 
be recorded separately and not listed in medical history . 
7.4. Prior  and Concomitant Medication s and Procedures  
Prior  and concomitant  medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.   All concomitant medications and measures  must be recorded in the eCRF , and a ny 
medication received  or procedure performed within  21 days before  enrollment  and up to the end 
of study will be recorded in the eCRF.   The medication record will be maintained  after signing 
the ICF  to document  concomitant medications , including any changes to the dose or regimen.   
Concomitant medications include any prescription, over -the-counter, or natural /herbal 
preparations taken or administered during the study period.   Concomitant treatments  and/or 
procedures  that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition during the study  will also be 
Incyte Corporation  Page 90 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  recorded in the eCRF.   See Section  5.6 for details regarding restricted and prohibited 
medications . 
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, use of concomitant medications should be monitored for 
subjects to verify that they are not taking any concomitant medication prohibited per protocol; 
however, concomitant medications no longer need to be collected in the eCRF , except for 
concomitant medications in relation with SAEs or AESIs . 
7.5. Post-Treatment Anticancer Therapy Status   
The investigator or qualified designee will review all new antineoplastic therapy initiated after 
the last dose of study treatment.   If a subject initiates a n ew anticancer therapy within 30 days 
after the last dose of study treatment, then the 30 -day safety  follow -up visit should occur before 
the first dose of the new anticancer therapy . 
7.6. Safety Assessments  
The chemotherap y agents  used in this study are approved therapies; therefore, the investigator 
should refer to and follow the safety management guidelines  as appropriate within the 
prescribing information for the chemotherap y agents.  
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, safety assessments are only required to be performed as 
per the site standard of care guidelines for the subject 's condition and monitoring .  Only SAEs, 
AESIs, and pregnancy will be collected in the eCRF.  
7.6.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence  of AEs 
throughout the study.   In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions  such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and eCRFs  regardless of t he assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
7.6.2.  Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
Clinically notable abnormalities th at are considered clinically significan t in the judgement of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
7.6.2.1.  Comprehensive Physical  Examination  
The comprehensive physical examination will include height and body weight, and assessment(s)  
of the following organ  or body system s:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; 
cardiovascular  system ; abdomen ( liver, spleen) ; extremities ; and lymph nodes ; as well as  a brief 
neurological exam ination .

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.2.2.  Targeted Physical  Examination  
The targeted physical exa mination will be a symptom -directed evaluation.   The targeted physical 
examination will include body weight and assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as 
indicated by subject symptoms, AE s, or other findings.  
7.6.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse , respiratory rate, and body temperature .  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent , or 
sitting position after 5  minutes of rest.   In addition , orthostatic blood pressure  monitoring  will be 
performed  on the days indicated in Table  11 and Table  13.  Clinically notable abnormalities that 
are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 
7.6.4.  Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semi recumbent  position 
after 5  minutes of rest.  
The 12 -lead ECGs will be interpreted by the investigator at the site  to be used for immediate 
subject management.   The decision to include  or exclude a subject or withdraw a subject from  
the study based on an ECG flagged as "Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the responsibility of 
the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor 's medical monitor, as appropriate.   Clinically 
notable abno rmalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator  
are to be reported as AEs. 
7.6.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
A certified laboratory local to the study site and subject will perform most of the clinical 
laboratory assessments for safety (ie, chemistries, hematology assessments, coagulation panel, 
thyroid panel, lipid panel , and urinalysis).   The investigative site  will enter the laboratory results 
and laboratory normal ranges into the eCRF.   All local laboratory assessments should be 
performed using standard procedures on the days indicated in  Table  12 and Table  14.  Table  16 
lists the specific laboratory analytes required for each test.   Some additional tests (ie,  plasma 
arginase, amino acid panel, including ornithine, plus urinary orotic acid – see Table  17) will be 
conducted by 1 or more central laboratories, on the days indicated in Table  12 and Table  14. 
Additional testing may be required by the sponsor based on emerging safety data.   Additional 
tests may also be performed if clinically i ndicated.  
Screening laboratory assessments must be performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1.   If 
performed more than 7 days before Cycle 1 Day 1, then the tests must be repeated and eligibility 
confirmed before study drug administration on Cycle 1 Day 1.   Laboratory samples collected on 
study Day 1 must be performed before study drug administration.   After Cycle 1, predose 
laboratory procedures can be conducted up to 72 hours before study drug administration (within  
the 3 -day study window), and results shou ld be reviewed by the investigator or qualified 
designee and found to be acceptable before a new cycle of treatment is initiated.  
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, laboratory assessments should be performed in 
accordance with the standard of care of the i nvestigational site for the subject 's condition.  
Laboratory results do not need to be reported in the eCRF, but all laboratory results 
Incyte Corporation  Page 92 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  corresponding with an SAE or an AESI will be reported on the SAE form.   In addition , 
pregnancy testing will continue to be performed for all subject s as per  the schedule of 
assessment s in Table  15. 
7.6.5.1.  Chemist ries 
In addition to the standard serum chemistry analytes ,
 as outlined in Table  16.  
See Table  12 and Table  14 for sampling timepoints and the Laboratory Manual for details of ho w 
to process, store , and ship the samples to the certified central laboratory or laboratories for 
sample analysis.  
7.6.5.2.  Urinalysis  
Standard urinalysis  as outlined in  Table  16, and urinary  orotic acid, which is a marker of urea 
cycle inhibition  that is  a pote ntial side effect of INCB001158 (see Section  1.3.1 ), will be 
assessed ( Table  16).  Subjects must fast at least 8 hours before each clinic  visit and void their 
bladder in the morn ing before  providing the pre dose urine sample at the clinic, as outlined in  
Table  17.

Note:  Additional samples may be collected as clinically indicated.  
7.6.5.3.  Plasma Ammonia  
Plasma ammonia levels are to be tested  durin g screening  (Table  12 and Table  14).  If above the 
ULN, repeat the sample to confirm the value.   If the subject experiences an elevation in urine 
orotic acid (>  10 × ULN fasted or >  40 × ULN of any value) while on study treatm ent or during 
the follow -up period, monitor plasma ammonia levels each time the urine orotic acid is tested, at 
least until orotic acid levels have returned to normal, at the investigator 's and medical monitor 's 
discretion.  
7.6.5.4.  Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregna ncy test will be required for all women of childbearing potential during 
screening .  A urine pregnancy test will be required on Cycle 1 Day 1 (before the first dose of 
study drug) and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle  (Table  12 and Table  14; Table  15 for all subjects 
as of Protocol A mendment 4 ).  A serum pregnan cy test should also be repeated at the 30-day 

Incyte Corporation  Page 93 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  safety follow -up visit.   Pregnancy testing is not required if a subject is going to hospice.   Urine 
pregnancy tests will be conducted as medically indicated, or per  country -specific requirement.   
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed locally.   If a urine pregnancy test is positive, then the 
results should be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  
If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a urine test was positive, then the investigator will 
assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and determine whether it is in the subject 's best 
interest to resume study treatment and continue particip ation in the study.  
7.6.5.5.  CA 125 Monitoring  
CA 125 monitoring will be performed locally for subjects with OC as indicated in Table  12 and 
Table  14.  If available , the most recent measure before  screening will also be recorded . 
7.6.5.6.  Hepatitis and HIV Screening Tests  
Hepatitis and HIV screening assessments will be  performed at the screening visit ( Table  12 and 
Table  14) to rule out hepatitis  and HIV  infection , respectively ; required analytes are shown in  
Table  16.  Generally, hepatitis and HIV tests should b e performed early in the screening process 
due to th e length of time needed to obtain the results.   Additional tests may be performed if 
clinically indicated.  
Note:   HIV testing is not required unless mandated by the local health authority.  
7.6.5.7.  Coagulation  Panel  
A coagulation panel will be performed as indicated in Table  12 and Table  14; required analytes 
for this panel are listed in  Table  16.  The coagulation panel will be analyzed by the site 's local 
laboratory.  
7.7. Efficacy Assessments  
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, no further efficacy assessment will be required beyond 
Week 96.  After Week 96, the radiographic tumor  assessments are only required to be performed 
as per the site standard of care guidelines for the subject 's condition and monitoring.  Subjects 
must be withdrawn from the study if , in the opinion of the investigator, the disease ha s 
progressed and the subject is no longer having clinical benefit from the study treatment.  
7.7.1.  Tumor Imagin g and Assessment of Disease  
Tumor imaging is strongly preferred to be acquired by CT.   For the abdomen and pelvis, MRI 
may be used when CT with iodinated contrast is contraindicated or when local practice mandates 
it.  Magnetic resonance imaging  is the str ongly preferred modality for imaging the brain.   The 
same imaging modality (ideally the same scanner) and the use of contrast should be used in a 
subject  throughout the study to optimize the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and 
new tumor burde n and improve the accuracy of the assessment of response or progression based 
on imaging.  
Subject  eligibility will be determined using local assessment ( investigator  assessment) based on 
RECIST v1.1.  All scheduled images for all study subjects  will be ass essed by the investigator .  
Incyte Corporation  Page 94 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  The sponsor may request that images from scans obtained during the study be sent to a central 
reader for independent image analysis.  
7.7.1.1.  Initial Tumor Imaging  
Initial tumor imaging at screening must be performed within 21 days prior  to the date of 
enrollment .  The site study team must review screening images to confirm the subject  has 
measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  
Tumor imaging performed as part of routine clinical management is acceptable for use as 
screening tumor imaging if  it is of diagnostic quality and performed within 21 days prior to the 
date of enrollment . 
Subjects  with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided that they have stable 
brain metastases, that is , without evidence of progression by imaging (confirmed by MRI or CT 
imaging, whichever was used at prior imaging) for at least 4 weeks before  the first dose of study 
treatment.   Any neurologic symptoms must have returned to baseline, subject s must have no  
evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and subjects must not have used steroids for brain 
metastases for at least 14 days before  initiating study treatment as per investigator assessment.  
This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, as subject s with carcinomatous 
meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability.  Subjects with evidence of cerebral edema 
will also be excluded from participation.   In addition, subjects will be excluded from 
participation  in the study if it has b een < 4  weeks since RT was delivered to the CNS . 
7.7.1.2.  Tumor Imaging During the Study  
The first on study imaging assessment should be performed at  8 weeks ( 56 days ± 7 days) from 
the date of enrollment .  Imaging then continues every 8  weeks ( 56 days ±7 days).   This equates 
to an imaging schedule occurring after Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 , etc.  Imaging timing should 
follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle dosing.   
Imaging should continue to be performed until PD is identified by the inve stigator, the start of 
new anti cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent for imaging, or death, whichever occurs first.    
Partial resp onse and CR should be confirmed by a repeat imaging assessment.   The imaging for 
confirmation of response may be performed no earlier than 4 weeks after the first indication of a 
response, or a t the next scheduled scan (ie, 8 weeks later), whichever is clinically indicated.   
Subject s will then return to the regular imaging schedule, starting with the next scheduled 
imaging time point.   Subject s who receive additional imaging for confirmation do not need to 
undergo the next sche duled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may 
resume at the subseque nt scheduled imaging time point .

Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.7.1.3.  End-of-Treatment and Follow -Up Imaging  
In subject s who discontinue study treatment, tumor imaging should be performed at the time of 
treatment discontinuation (± 4 week window).   If a previous imaging was obtained within 
4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then imaging at treatment discontinuation is not 
mandatory.    
 
 
In subject s who discontinue study treatment without documented disease progression, every 
effort should be made to continue monitoring disease status by tumor imaging using the same 
imaging schedule used while on treatment until  the start of new anti -cancer treatment, disease 
progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.   For 
these subject s, the next imaging would occur at the discontinuation visit.   If previous imaging 
was obtained w ithin 4 weeks before  the date of discontinuation, then imaging at treatment 
discontinuation is not mandatory.   The next imaging would then occur every 8 weeks (± 7 days) 
subsequently.    
 
NOTE:  As of Protocol A mendment 4, follow -up imaging to monitor disease status for subjects 
who discontinue study treatment for a ny of the aforementioned reason s is no longer required 
beyond the last safety  follow -up visit  (see Section 6.4.2 ). 
7.7.1.4.  RECIST v1.1 Assessment of Disease  
RECIST v1.1 will be the primary measure for assessment of tumor response and as a basis for  
Protocol guidelines related to disease status (eg, discontinuation of study therapy).

7.9. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.9.1.  Blood Sample Collection  
Subjects will arrive at  the clinic having fasted at least 8 hours  and having withheld their morning 
dose of INCB001158 .  Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained  at the visits indicated in  
Table  12 and Table  14.  Predose is defined as within 24 hours before administration  of the 
morning dose of  INCB001158 and before administration of chemotherapy (if drugs are 
given on PK assessment days) .  After the predose PK sample is drawn, subjects will take 
INCB001158  and then chemotherapy.  
  The exact date and time of the PK blood draws wi ll be 
recorded in the eCRF along with the date and time of the last dose of study drug  and details of 
the last meal  preceding the blood draw.  Instructions for sample preparation and shipping will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.   Sample collection ti mes and windows for INCB001158  are 
shown in  Table  20 and Table  21.

7.11.1.  Distribution of  Subject Reminder Cards and /or Subject  Diaries  
Subjects will be provided with a reminder card at each visit , containing the following reminders:  
• The date/time of the next visit;  
• Not to take their morning doses of INCB001158 before  visiting the clinic on those 
days, as they will take them after blood draws for safety evaluation have been 
completed ; 
• To fast for at least 8 hours before  the next clinic visit and to void th eir bladder in the 
morn ing before  providing the pre dose urine sample at the clinic, as outlined in 
Table  17.

they take between clinic visits.  
  
 
 

  
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING  
NOTE:  As of  Protocol  Amendment 4, the only safety data that will be collected will be related 
to SAEs, AESIs , and pregnancy.   The safety follow -up visits may be completed remotely (such 
as by televisit ). 
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol,  an adverse  event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether  or not considered drug related , 
that occur s after a subject  provides informed consent .  Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
occurring afte r informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg , hematologic  abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s) . 
8.1.2.  Reporting  
Adverse even ts that begin or worsen after infor med consent should be recorded o n the Adverse 
Events  form  of the eCRF.   Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded o n the Medical History form in  the eCRF.   Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  Adverse 
events (including lab oratory  abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible  rather than  by individual  underlying signs and symptoms.   When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE. 
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE /SAE only if  there are no other 
identifiable AEs /SAEs  associat ed with the disease progression at the time of reporting.   For 
events associated with disease progression , the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.   
When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a 
separate AE.   If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE 
(eg, resulted in hospitalization, a life -threatening event, or death ), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as an SAE(s)  as described in Section  8.3.2 .  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression ), it should be indicated that each event  (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms)  is related to disease progression  on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF . 

Incyte Corporation  Page 104 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  The severity of AEs will be assessed using  CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 5.  If an event is not 
classified by CTCAE, the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to 
estimate the grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death  due to AE  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by non directive questioning of the subject during the 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.   Adverse events  may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.   To the 
extent  possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine:  
• The s everity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to 5). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:   suspected (yes) or not suspected (no) .  Relatedness will be assessed for 
INCB001158 and chemotherapy.  
• The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow -up. 
• The a ction taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown) . 
• The s erious ness, as per serious adverse event (SAE ) definition provided in 
Section  8.3.1 . 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2 ). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.   If an AE is treated with a c oncomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy , this action should be recorded on  Adverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomitant Medications  or Procedures and N on-Drug Therapy form 
in the eCRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it  has resolved  or until i t is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently  if nec essary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug , the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome.  
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change in severity  will be reported as a  separate  AE until the event resolves.   For example, 
Incyte Corporation  Page 105 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade  1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an 
AE, that lasts for 3  days before  worsening  to a Grade  3 severity .  The Grade  1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade  1 AE definition and 
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in severity  from Grade  1 to Grade  3.  The 
Grade  3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event 
changed in intensity from Grade  1 to Grade  3 and a stop date equal to  the day that the event 
either changed severity  again or resolved.  
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, all AESIs  will continue to be reporte d in the eCRF.  
8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful , induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy , or require changes 
in study drug) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the eCRF.   Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg,  "anemia " instead of "low hemoglobin ").  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed unti l they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.   When an abnormal 
laboratory  test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a  previously  reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the lab oratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as AEs.  
A Grade 3 or 4 AE does not automatically indicate a n SAE unless it meets the definition of 
serious , as defined in Section  8.3.1 .  A dose  modification  for the lab oratory  abnormality may be 
required (see Section  5.5) and should not contribute to the designation of a lab oratory test  
abnormality as a n SAE . 
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, laboratory assessments should be performed in 
accordance with the standard of care of the investigational site for the subject 's condition.  
Laboratory results do not need to be reported in the eCRF, but all laboratory results 
corresponding with an SAE or AESI will be reported on the SAE form.  
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1.  Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following  criteria : 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of:  
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.   
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the 
ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission.  
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the 
subject 's general condition.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 106 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions . 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly  or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be  an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require hospitalization but 
may be considered serious  when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject  or may require medica l or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above . 
8.3.2.  Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or 90 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever  is later) must be reported to 
the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise 
specified by the Protocol.   Any SAEs occurring more than 90 days after the last dose of study 
drug should be reported to the sponsor or  its designee only if the investigator suspects a causal 
relationship to the study drug.   
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form  of the eCRF .  
The i nvestigator must assess and record the causal relationship of each SAE to the study 
treatment .  Relatedness will be assessed for INCB001158 and chemotherapy.  
The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English, 
and send the completed and signed form to the spon sor or designee within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the SAE.   The investigator must provide a causality assessment, that is, assess whether 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:   suspected 
(yes) or not suspected (no).   Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form.  
The contact information of the  sponsor 's study -specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.   The original cop y of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SA E Report 
Form was sent.   Follow -up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.   The follow -up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).   Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow -up to 
that event, regardless of when it occurs.  
If the SAE is not documented in the  IB for the study drug  (new occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor 's study drug , the sponsor or its designee  may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporting  to health authorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
Incyte Corporation  Page 107 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.   Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the compete nt authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, all SAEs regardless of causality relationship will continue 
to be reported in the eCRF.  
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Not a pplicable.  
8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug  may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.   When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed  in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug , 
the following procedures should be follow ed in order to ensure subjec t safety : 
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued  immediately  (female subjects only ). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor  or its designee  within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy . 
• A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.  
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy result, then:  
− The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of 
the potential  benefit/risk to the subject, to determine whether it is in the subject 's 
best interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
• The EOT visit evaluations must be performed.  
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected f or regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.   Follow -up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital a bnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications , by following 
until the first well -baby visit.   Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
and reported by the investigator to the sponsor  or its designee .  Pregnancy follow -up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal 
relationship to the sponsor 's study drug  to any pregnancy outcome , as well as  follow -up to the 
first well -baby visit  or the duration specified in local regulations , whichever is later .  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring  during pregnancy must be re corded  on the SAE report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee . 
NOTE :  As of Protocol Amendment 4, pregnanc y will continue to be reported in the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by 
the sponsor  or its designee , are presented in the  IB.  Additional safety information collected 
between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications  (INs) .  Any 
important new safety information should be discussed with the subject du ring the study , as 
necessary .  If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF.  
8.7. Product Complaints  
The sponsor  collects product complaints on study drug s and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studie s in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements.  
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee  will be reported  to the sponsor .  All product com plaints associated with other 
study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer.  
The investigator or his/her  designee is responsible for reporting  a complete description of the 
product complaint via email or other written communicatio n to the sponsor contact  or respective 
manufacturer as noted in the packaging information .  Any AE associated with a product 
complaint should be reported as described in Section  8.1.2  of this Protocol.  
If the i nvestigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication  with the product.

CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Pop ulation s 
The full analysis set includes all subjects enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose o f 
study treatment (INCB001158, mFOLFOX 6, gemcitabine/ cisplatin, or paclitaxel).   This 
population will be used in the analyses of demographic, baseline,  safety, study treatment 
administration, and efficacy data.  
The DLT evaluable population is defined in Section  5.4.2  and includes subjects who recei ve at 
least 32 of 42 doses  for 21 -day cycle regimens and at least 42 of 56 doses for 28 -day cycle 
regimens (both representing ≥ 75% of the dose planned)  of INCB001158 at the level assigned or 
have a DLT.  This population will be used for determining tolera bility of the dose . 
The PK evaluable population includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment 
(INCB001158, mFOLFOX 6, gemcitabine/ cisplatin, or paclitaxel) and had at least 1 post dose PK 
sample collected and analyzed.    
 
 
9.2. Selection of Sample Size   
9.2.1.  Sample Size for Phase 1  
In Phase 1 , the BOIN design will be used to determine the RP2D of INCB001158 when given in 
combination with chemotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.   The 
details of the dose escalation, de -escalation, and elim ination rules according  to the BOIN design 
are provided in Section  4.1.1 . 
9.2.2.  Sample Size for Phase 2  
Phase 2  will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and pharmacologic 
activity of the recommended dose of INCB001158 in combination with chemotherapy.  A Simon 
2-stage design will be run for each tumor type within a given expansion c ohort . 
The sample size for each tumor type within a given expansion cohort  will be guided by the 
Simon 2 -stage design.   The planned Simon 2 -stage designs are summarized in  Table  7.  Each 
Simon 2 -stage design will have a stopping rule to allow early termination of a particular tumor 
type within the given cohort  at the end of Stage 1 if there is insufficient response observed, while 
enrolling enough subjec ts to predict possible target responses worthy of cohort expansion and 
potentially further evaluation in future studies.   The individual Simon 2 -stage designs run for 
each tumor type within each cohort  will have design parameters that are determined by his torical 
response rates.   
In order to determine whether the target response rate ( p1%) is likely, an initial number of 
evaluable subjects ( n1 subjects) will be treated at the RP2D of INCB001158 in combination with 
each chemotherapy (Stage 1).   If there are r1 or fewer responses in the expansion cohort, then it 
will be concluded that the true response rate is unlikely to be ≥ the target rate, and no more 
subjects will be enrolled in that tumor type for that cohort  in Stage 2.   In the cohorts in which 
> r1 responses are observed among the Stage 1 subjects, n2 additional evaluable subjects will be 

Incyte Corporation  Page 110 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  treated in Stage 2 to estimate the response rate.   At the end of Stage 2, if ≤ r subjects have 
responded among the n  evaluable subjects, then the drug will be decl ared nonpromising for that 
cohort.   The detailed calculations for each tumor type –specific cohort are based on a 1 -sided 
Type I error of 0.1 and power of 80%.  
9.3. Level of Significance  
For the primary efficacy endpoints, the 1 -sided Type I error will be contro lled at 0.1 for each 
individual cohort expansion.   Note that this level of significance does not account for the 
multiple expansion cohorts.   For other endpoints, confidence interval s will be reported at a 
95% confidence level . 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
9.4.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Objective response rate, defined as the percentage of subjects enrolled in Phase 2 (plus subjects 
enrolled in Phase 1 who meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for Phase 2) having a CR 
or PR, as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease as per RECIST v1.1 will 
be summarized by expansion cohort . 
9.4.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The following efficacy analyses will be assessed for all subjects in each treatment c ombination:  
• ORR, defined as the percentage of subjects having a CR or PR, as determined by 
investigator assessment of radiographic disease as per RECIST v1.1 (Phase 1 only).  
• DOR, defined as the time from earliest date of CR or PR (as determined by 
investi gator assessment of radiographic disease assessment per RECIST v1.1) until 
the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause, if occurring sooner 
than disease progression.  
• DCR, defined as the percentage of subjects having CR, PR, or SD for  at least 
8 weeks, as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease as per 
RECIST v1.1.  
• PFS, defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug until the earliest date of 
disease progression (as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease 
assessment per RECIST v1.1), or death due to any cause, if occurring sooner than 
progression.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.2.  Safety Analyses  
9.4.2.1.  Adverse Events  
A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsen ing of a pre -existing event after 
first dose of study drug.   Analysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but data listings will include 
all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.   Adverse events will be tabulated 
by the MedDRA preferred  term and system organ class  for all events and AESIs , including 
irAEs .  Severity of AEs will be based on the NCI CTCAE v4.03  using Grades 1 through  5. 
The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be 
considered  to be treatment -related AEs.   If the investigator does not specify the relationship of 
the AE to study drug, then the AE will be considered treatment -related.   The incidence of AEs 
and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated . 
9.4.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal 
ranges for the clinical reference laboratory.   The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory  data will be classified into Grades 1 through 5 using CTCAE v4.03.   The following 
summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postbaseline CTC AE grade (regardless 
of baseline value).   Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed 
postbaseline.  
• Shift tables from  baseline to the worst postbaseline value using  CTC AE grade.  

Incyte Corporation  Page 112 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  • For laboratory parameters where CTC AE grades are not defined, shift tables to the 
worst postbaseline value using the low/normal/high  classifications based on 
laboratory reference ranges.  
9.4.2.3.  Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will  be determined for vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse , respiratory rate, and body temperature) at each assessment time.   Vital sign 
results will be reviewed for clinically notable abnormalities (see  Table  22), and subjects 
exhibiting clinically notable vital sign abnormalities will be listed.   A value will be considered an 
"alert" value if it is outside the established range and shows a > 25% change from baseline.  
Table  22: Criteria for Clinically Notable Vital Sign Abnormalities  
Parameter  High Threshold  Low Threshold

CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.3.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK parameters of C max, tmax, Cmin, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-τ (INCB 001158 ) for first 12 subjects 
enrolled in Phase 2  will be calculated from the blood plasma concentrations of INCB 001158  
using standard noncompartmental (model -independent) PK methods.   Pharmacokinetic 
calculations will be performed, if appropriate, using commercial software such as WinNonlin®.  
Nominal times w ill be used in all cases, except when the difference between the actual time and 
nominal time is greater than 15 minutes for samples collected up to 4 hours after administration 
and greater than 30 minutes for samples collected more than 4 hours after admi nistration; in 
these cases, actual time will be used for PK analysis .  See Appendix  B for a detailed list and 
description of the PK parameters.  
If there is a sufficient amount of plasma concentration data from this study, the data will be 
analyzed by standard population PK met hods using appropriate software (eg, NONMEM).  
9.5. Interim Analys es 
9.5.1.  Interim Analysis for the BOIN Design  
In Phase 1, the BOIN design will be used to determine the RP2D of INCB001158 in combination 
with each chemotherapy regimen.  For the design para meters, let ϕ denote the target DLT rate, 
ϕ1 denote the highest toxicity probability below the MTD so that dose escalation is required, and 
ϕ2 denote the lowest toxicity probability deemed overly toxic so that dose de -escalation is 
required.  We assume that  ϕ1 = 0.6ϕ and ϕ2 = 1.4 ϕ.  Also, to avoid assigning too many subjects to 
an overly toxic dose, we use the dose elimination rule when implemen ting the BOIN design.  If 
pr (pj > ϕ│m j,nj) > 0.95 and nj ≥ 3, then dose levels 𝑗 and higher are eliminated from the study, 
and the study is terminated if the first dose level is eliminated, where  pj represents the toxicity 
rate, ϕ represents the target DLT rate, nj represents the total subjects who have been treated, and  
mj represents the subjects who have experienced toxicity at dose level  j.  Table  4 (in the bottom 
row)  provides the elimination boundaries for the target DLT rate of 33%, respectively.  For 
example, for the target DLT rate 33%, when the number of subjects treated at the current dose 
nj = 4, we will eliminate that d ose and higher doses if 3 or more subjects experience toxicity.  
Based on the algorithm of the BOIN design, a minimum of 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled 
in each dose level with a maximum of 9 evaluable subjects in each dose level.  
9.5.2.  Interim Analysis fo r the Simon 2 -Stage Design  
In Phase 2 , there will be a planned interim analysis for futility in each of the 6 expansion cohorts .  
The Simon 2 -stage design will be applied for each expansion cohort independently .  During 
Stage 1, n1 evaluable subjects treated at the recommended dose and schedule will be enrolled  
(see Table  7), and if r1 or fewer responses are observed, then the coh ort will be discontinued.   As 
discussed in Section  9.2.2 , the Simon 2 -stage designs for each tumor type have design 
parameters determined by histori cal response rates and will have different sample sizes and

changes to the clinical study Protocol, important Protocol deviations, routine updates, 
and safety information in accordance with institutional requirements and local law . 
− The investi gator is responsible for ensuring that the safety report s provided by the 
sponsor are  reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements 
and with the policies and procedures established by the IRB /IEC . 
• Adhering  to the Protocol  as described in this document and agree ing that changes to 
the Protocol  procedures , with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved , first, by the sponsor or its designee and, second , by the 
IRB/IEC.  Each investigator is respons ible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibility  criteria . 
• Retain ing records in accordance with all local, national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in 
an ICH region, or if not approved, 2  years after the termination of the test article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for the sponsor or a regulatory authority to review.  
− The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without 
receiving approval from the sponsor .  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.   If 
the investigator leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the sponsor 
or its designee must be contacted  to arrange alternative record storage options.  
− All eCRF data entered by the site (including audit trail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable re cord retention regulations.

10.1.1.  Identification of the Coordinating Principal Investigator  
A coordinating principal investigator will be appointed by the sponsor before the end of the 
study.  As part of his or her responsibilities, the coordinating principal investigator will review 
the final CSR.  Agreement with the final CSR will be documented by the dated signature of the 
coordinating principal investigator.  
10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Dispos al of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.   
Inventory and accountability records must be mainta ined and readily available for inspection by 
the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.   
The investigator or designee must maintain records that document:  
• Delivery of study drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 117 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Subject use of the study drug including pill or unit counts from each supply 
dispensed.  
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by subjects.  
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the  Protocol.   The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
study drug.   These records should include dates, quantities,  and any available  batch or serial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects.  
Completed accountability records will be archived by the site.   The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used contai ners of study drug 
until verified by  the study monitor  (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).   At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for dest ruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.   If local procedures mandate on -site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow)  maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspect s the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of 
accountability by the investigative site.   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP . 
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system.   All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with 
the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department  at the sponsor or 
its designee .  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed.  
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be 
completed for each subject .  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained 
and documented.   The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF entries , 
and w ill sign and date the designated forms in each subject 's eCRF, verifying that the 
information is true and correct.   The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all 
query responses.  
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation  form  of the eCRF.   
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a tim ely manner in accordance with the 
plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidentiality  of Study Records

CONFIDENTIAL  Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee , if applicable.   Only the subject 
number and subject 's initials (subject 's initials will only be recorded if allowable by local 
regulations) will be recorded in the eCRF , where perm itted; if the subject 's name appears on any 
other document (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be 
supplied to the sponsor or its designee.   Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with loc al data protection laws.   The subjects will be informed that representatives of 
the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical 
records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made  available for 
inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data prot ection 
laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, a ll clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA 
Regulation Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by 
Clinical Investigators (ie, "covered studies ") are required to submit a completed Clinical 
Investigator Financial Disclosure form that sufficiently details any financial interests and 
arrangements that apply.   For the purpose of this regulation, "clinical investigator " is defined as 
any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of 
research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent chi ld of the clinical investigator  or 
subinvestigator .  These requirements apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators 
conducting covered clinical studies.  
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also  
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.   During a covered clinical study, 
any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.   At the conclusion of the  covered clinical study, the 
clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligation s.  In the event that the  clinical 
investigator  is not reminded , they nevertheless  will remain obligated  to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the fin ancial information previously reported , as well as any change s 
in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study . 
10.6. Publication Policy  
By signing the study Protocol , the investigator and his or her instituti on agree that the results of 
the study may be used by the sponsor, Incyte Corporation (Incyte), for the purposes of national 
and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical 
professionals.   Study results will be published in accordance with applicable local and national 
regulations.   If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the investigator 's name, address, 
qualifications, and extent of involvement.   The terms regarding the publication of study results 
are containe d in the agreement signed with the sponsor or its designee .  A signed agreement will 
be retained by the sponsor or its designee . 
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, 
the investigato r agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission.  
This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments.  
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results.  In accor dance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of 
Incyte Corporation  Page 119 of 151 
Protocol INCB 01158 -203 Am 4  Version 4  09 DEC 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.  In this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreem ent. 
Authorship will be determined in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
authorship requirement s. 
10.7. Study and Site Closure  
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any  reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor.  Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The i nvestigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are 
not limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator.  
• Discontinuati on of further study treatment development.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  A. INFORMATION REGARDIN G EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S 
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when use d 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.  
Such methods include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulatio n1 
− oral 
− intravaginal  
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intraute rine hormone -releasing system ( IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomised  partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
For Male Subjects Participating in the Study:  
In addition to the aforementioned contraceptive methods, male subjects must also use a condom 
during intercourse from the time of first dose of study treatment and through at least 6 months 
+ 93 days after las t dose of study treatment.   Males who have had a vasectomy qualify as having 
met the requirement for a highly effective birth control method.  
1 Hormonal  contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method.  
2 Contraception  methods that in the context of this guidance are  considered to have low user dependency.  
3 Vasectomised  partner is a highly effective method of avoiding pregnancy  provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOC BP trial participant and that the vasectomised  partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
4 In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual in tercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.   The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

C.1. Criteria for Start of Cycle (Criteria for Administration on Day 1 of Each Cycle)  
After confirmation that each subject meets criteria for the start of each cycle described in 
Table  C-1, mFOLFOX 6 will be administered.  If any criteria are n ot met, administration of 
therapy will be postponed.  From the second cycle onwards, study treatment will be discontinued 
if therapy has not been initiated by 14 days after the estimated Day 1.  
Table  C-1: Criteria  for Administration of mFOLFOX 6 on Day 1 of Each  Cycle or 
Within  a Cycle  
Parameter  Criterion for Start

Infection  No fever (> 38.0°C or 100.4°F) suspect for infection  
Nonhematologic toxicities  Diarrhea  ≤ No water diarrhea  
Others  < Grade 2 (except for nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue)  
If mFOLFOX 6 is held for any of the reasons noted in Table  C-1, INCB001158 may be continued  
at the discretion of the investigator with the approval of the medical monitor , and the subject will 
be evaluated at least weekly until the toxicity has resolved.  The guidelines shown in Table  C-2 
and Table  C-3 for hematolo gic toxicities  will determine the dose selected for use in the new 
cycle , and the investigator will take tolerability of the most recent dose into account.  
C.2. Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicities  
Table  C-2 provides guidance for dose reductions for the first appearance of the hematologic 
toxicities.  Toxicities must be resolved to Grade 0 or 1 before resuming study treatment.  When 
the dose of 5-fluoroucil ( 5FU) is reduced, the dose of leucovorin will remain the same.

After a second dose reduction, if any hematologic toxicities reoccur (third occurrence) and are 
clearly associated with chemotherapy, then chemotherapy may be discontinued, and 
INCB001158 may be continued at the same dose at the discretion of the investigator and with the 
approval of the medical monitor.  
C.3. Management Guidelines for Nonhematologic Toxicities  
Table  C-4 provides  guidance for dose reductions for the appearance of nonhematologic 
toxicities.  Toxicities must be resolved to Grade 0 or 1 before resuming study treatment.  When 
the dose of 5FU is redu ced, the dose of leucovorin will remain the same.  Some adverse events 
(AEs) will overlap with potential immune -related adverse events ( irAEs ; eg, diarrhea and 
colitis/enteritis).  In these cases, both the AE and irAE guidance should be reviewed to determi ne 
the most appropriate management of dose interruptions and dose reductions of study 
medications.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  D. DOSE MODIFICATIONS F OR GEMCITABINE/CISPL ATIN  
D.1. Criteria for Start of Cycle (Criteria for Administration on Day 1 of Each Cycle)  
A cycle of therapy may begin on a scheduled Day 1 if the following conditions are met:  
• Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L.  
• Platelet count is ≥ 100 × 109/L.  
• Sensory neuropathy has improved to ≤ Grade 2 or returned to baseline.  
• Any other AE that occurred has resolved to ≤ Grade 1 severity or returned to baseline.  
The guidelines shown in Table  D-1 will determine the dose for use in t he new cycle , and the 
investigator will take tolerability of the most recent dose into account.   
If new cycle starting requirements are not met, then regardless of dose modification, gemcitabine 
and/or cisplatin  will be held,  INCB001158 may be continued at the discretion of the investigator 
with the approval of the medical monitor , and the subject will be evaluated at least weekly until 
the toxicity has resolved.  
From the second cycle onwards, study treatment will be discontinued if therapy has not been 
initiated within the 14 days after the scheduled Day 1.  
D.2. Changes to Treatment Regimen During a Cycle for Hematologic Toxicities  
Recommended dose interruptions and modifications of INCB001158 , gemcitabine , and cisplatin  
on Days 1 and 8  of a cycle for hematologic toxicity are shown in Table  D-1.

Day 8  0.5 to < 1.0  OR 50 to < 75  Dose as scheduled  
< 0.5  OR < 50 Delay dose until recovery  
D.2.1. Gemcitabine and Cisplatin  Dose Modifications  
Dose reductions or interruptions of gemcitabine  and cisplatin  on Days 1  and 8 are mandatory in 
the event of hematologic toxicities , as specified in Table  D-1.  However, other interruptions or 
reductions may occur for safety reasons at the discretion of the investigator .  Gemcitabine and 
cisplatin treatment cycles may be delayed or the dose may be reduced for laboratory parameters 
or AEs that  are judged to be related to gemcitabine or cisplatin .  A maximum of 1 dose reduction 
is allowed  for gemcitabine  (25% reduction)  and for cisplatin  (20% ; Table  D-2).  For dose 
reductions for safety, individual drug dose should follow prescribing information for dose 
modifications .  Day 1 of each study cycle will correspond with the first day of chemotherapy 
administration.  Thus, study cycles may become out -of-sync with the originally planned 
schedule.  All assessments will shift to coincide with the revi sed treatment (cycle) schedule.

continued , at the discretion of the investigator and approval of the medical monitor.  
D.3. Other Adverse Drug Reactions in Subjects With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin  
Dose interruptions and modifications for gemcitabine and cisplatin for other adverse drug 
reactions are described in Table  D-3. 
Table  D-3: Dose Modifications  for Gemcitabine and Cisplatin  Adverse Drug Reaction  
 Gemcitabine  Cisplatin  
Febrile neutropenia:  Grade 3 or 4  Withhold until fever resolved and ANC ≥ 1.5 × 109/L; resume at lower 
dose level.  
Peripheral neuropathy:  Grade 3 or 4  No dose reduction.  Withhold until improves to 
≤ Grade  1; resume at next lower dose 
level.  
Cutaneous toxicity:   Grade 2 or 3  Reduce to lower dose level; 
discontinue treatment if toxicity 
persists.  Reduce to lower dose level; 
discontinue treatment if toxicity 
persists.  
Gastrointestinal toxicity:  Grade 3 
mucositis or diarrhea  Withhold until improves to 
≤ Grade  1; resume at lower dose 
level.  Withhold until improves to ≤ Grade 
1; resume at lower dose level.  
Note:  If the subject meets more than 1 of the criteria listed, then dose modifications should always be based on the system 
showing the greatest degree of toxicity.  Dose interruptions and modifications will be made at the discretion of the investigator.  
If the toxicities listed in Table  D-3 persist or reoccur despite 2 dose reductions and are clearly 
associated with chemotherapy, then gemcitabine cisplatin may be discontinued, and 
INCB001158 may be continued at the discretion of the investigator and approval of the medical 
monitor.  If cisplatin must be discontinued for peripheral neuropathy, then gemcitabine and 
INCB001158 may be conti nued at the discretion of the investigator and a pproval of the medical 
monitor.  
D.4. General Management Guidelines for Nonhematologic Toxicities  
Table  D-4 provides guidance for dose reductions for the appearance of nonhematologic 
toxicities.  Toxicities must be resolved to Grade 0 or 1 before resuming study treatment.  Of note, 
some AEs will overlap with potential irAEs (eg, diarrhea and colitis/enteritis).  In these cases, 
both the AE and irAE guidance should be reviewed to determine the most appropriate 
management of dose interruptions and dose r eductions of study medications.

a Hy's law is defined as follows: 1) aminotransferase elevation (ALT or AST) > 3 × ULN; 2) total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without 
initial findings of cholestasis (elev ated serum ALP); 3) no other immediately apparent possible cause of aminotransferase 
elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, liver metastases, pre -existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of o ther drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  Permanently discontinue study therapy at the first 
occurrence of liver enzyme elevations meeting the criteria for Hy 's law.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  E. DOSE  MODIFICATIONS FOR P ACLITAXEL  
E.1. Criteria for Start of Cycle (Criteria for Administration on Day 1 of Each Cycle)  
After confirmation that each subject satisfies criteria for the start of each cycle described in 
Table  E-1, paclitaxel  will be administered.  If any criteria are not met, then administration of 
therapy will be postponed.  From the second cycle onwards, study treatment will be discontinued 
if administration of therapy has not been initiated by 14 days after the estimated Da y 1. 
Table  E-1: Criteria for Administration of Paclitaxel on Day 1  of Each  Cycle  or Within  a 
Cycle  
Parameter  Criterion for Start  
White blood cell  count  ≥ 2.5 × 109/L  
Neutrophil count  ≥ 1.0 × 1 09/L 
Platelet count  ≥ 100 × 109/L  
Renal function  > 30 mL/min AND < 10% change in glomerular filtration rate  
from previous cycle  
Nonhematologic toxicities  Bilirubin  ≤ 1.5 ULN  
ULN = upper limit of normal.  
If paclitaxel is held for any of the reasons noted in Table  E-1, INCB001158 may be continued at 
the discretion of the investigator with the approval of the medical monitor , and the subject will 
be evaluated at least weekly until the toxicity has resolved.  The guidelines shown in Table  E-2 
and Table  E-3 will deter mine the dose selected for use in the new cycle, and the investigator will  
take tolerability of the most recent dose into account.  
E.2. Paclitaxel Dose Modifications  
Table  E-2 provides guidance for dose reductions for the first appearance of the specified 
toxicities.

Hepatic  
impairment  If hepatic function is impaired at baseline (bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN), then treatment should be  
started at reduced dose (70  mg/m2).  `For more severe impairment, treatment  may proceed at 
reduced dose, at consultant 's discretion, and with weekly  monitoring of  LFTs.  
LFT = liver chemistry test; ULN = upper limit of normal.

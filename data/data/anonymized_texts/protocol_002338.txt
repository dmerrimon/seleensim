 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 2 of 41 Study Synopsis Study Title Stimgenics Open-Label, Post Market Study: A Clinical Trial to Study the Effects of Stimgenics Spinal Cord Stimulation (SGX-SCS) programs in treating Intractable Chronic Back Pain  Protocol Number SGEN-2018PM2 Study Device The IntellisTM neurostimulator, a Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) device system manufactured and commercialized by Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN)  Study Purpose The purpose of this investigational study is to study the effects of Stimgenics Spinal Cord Stimulation (SGX-SCS) in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk with lower limb pain, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with the following conditions: failed back surgery syndrome, intractable low back pain and leg pain.  Study Design This is an open-label prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study comparing SGX-SCS programming approach to Standard SCS programming approach.  Subjects meeting study entrance criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two study treatment groups: • Test treatment group with SGX-SCS programming approach  • Control treatment group with Standard SCS programming approach  Data at follow-up visits will be compared between the two treatment groups, and in reference to baseline assessments collected at the beginning of the study.  Study Size Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled at up to 15 clinical sites in the United States in order to include an estimated 125 subjects to the point of randomization and trial phase.    This would allow at least 100 subjects (approximately 50% in each treatment arm) to complete the 3-month endpoint.  Study Duration The expected total duration of this study is approximately 28 months.   Enrollment of subjects is expected to last 12 months.  Subjects that have received the permanent implant will be followed up for approximately 8 months. This consists of Baseline assessments, up to 10 days of trial stimulation, and 6 months of treatment following implantation and activation of the device. All subjects who remain implanted at the time of Study Completion will be offered to return for an additional visit 12-months after device activation.

 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 5 of 41 A.  Purpose A.1.  Study Device The IntellisTM neurostimulator is a commercially available implantable component of a Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) device system manufactured by Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN). The system is indicated for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) as an aid in the management of chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs-including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with conditions, including Failed Back Syndrome (FBS). It is designed to deliver electrical stimulation to the spinal cord using arrays of electrodes (also called leads) placed in the dorsal epidural space.  The study will use commercially available IntellisTM neurostimulator and compatible SCS system components from Medtronic in accordance to the approved FDA indication. Section D of this Investigational Plan provides detailed description of IntellisTM neurostimulator.  A.2.  Purpose of the Investigation The purpose of this investigational study is to study the effects of Stimgenics spinal cord stimulation (SGX-SCS) programs in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk with lower limb pain, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with the following conditions: failed back syndrome, intractable low back pain and leg pain. This study is a post market, open-label, multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial that evaluates the treatment outcomes resulting from SGX-SCS programming approach and Standard SCS programming approach. Both programming approaches will be discussed in section B.1 of this Investigational Plan.  This investigation is not comparing two different Spinal Cord Stimulation systems and their compatible device components.  Both SGX-SCS and Standard SCS programs will utilize an FDA-approved and commercially available SCS system (IntellisTM neurostimulator and compatible SCS components) as is, without any modification using approved parameters under approved labeling for indicated population. Outcomes will be assessed via standardized tests.   A.3.  Study Size Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled at up to 15 clinical sites in the United States in order to include an estimated 125 subjects to the point of randomization and trial phase.  This would allow at least 100 subjects (approximately 50% in each treatment arm) to complete the 3-month endpoint. Sample size estimates are discussed further in section B.5.5 of this Investigational Plan.   A.4.  Duration of the Investigation 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 6 of 41 The expected total duration of this study is approximately 28 months.  Enrollment of subjects is expected to last 12 months. Subjects that have received the permanent implant will be followed up for approximately 8 months. This consists of Baseline assessments, up to 10 days of trial stimulation, and 6 months of treatment following implantation and activation of the device. All subjects who remain implanted at the time of Study Completion will be offered to return for an additional visit 12-months after device activation.  B.  Protocol B.1.  Rationale for Study It is estimated that about 20% percent of the population worldwide is affected by moderate to severe chronic pain1. Chronic pain becomes a burden to the individual as this affects a person’s ability to carry out many daily life activities, such as exercising, walking, driving a car, attending social events, or performing household chores.  In the United States, chronic pain is considered one of the most pervasive and intractable conditions affecting at least one third of the population at an estimated cost of five hundred billion dollars per year, when combining health-related expenditure and the cost-impact on loss of productivity and income2.  Conventional medical management, including medication and physical therapy, is often not adequate for treating chronic pain. Medication therapy based on opioids may also lead to addiction. Extensive use of opioid medications in the United States has led to the declaration of an epidemic crisis3. Furthermore, surgical interventions have also failed to remediate severe cases of neuropathies and intractable back pain for many patients. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a proven therapy that has been in use for about 50 years for various types of chronic pain. SCS is a reversible therapy that allows patients to evaluate the therapy for several days using an external neurostimulator (ENS) prior to receiving an implantable neurostimulator (INS) system4,5,6,7.  Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) utilizes pulsed electric fields that are applied to the dorsal section of the spinal cord via electrode arrays, called leads, implanted in the epidural space.   Standard SCS programming approach utilizes pulsed electric fields oscillating in the 40-250 Hz frequency range although up to 1,200 Hz is approved for use. The electric field stimulates neurons that induce a tingling sensation (paresthesia) that is steered by the clinician and patient to overlay with the targeted pain location by modifying the applied electric field. The concept behind Standard SCS is that the paresthesia induced by the applied oscillating electric field masks pain signals travelling to the brain. Standard SCS programming typically involves giving patients a few program groups, allowing patients to select the program group that suits them best. Each program group contains multiple programs that deliver, for a given pulse rate, different stimulation parameters (e.g. pulse width, amplitude) to same or different electrodes. This approach has been used to create better paresthesia patterns for the given patient’s pain patterns or more tolerable paresthesia depending on patient’s different positions or postures.  Historically, Standard SCS has not had high success for back pain patients due to the challenge of having paresthesia pattern overlap the back-pain region without causing uncomfortable paresthesia. Although different approaches to SCS exist, Standard SCS still remains the most used SCS programming approach in treating chronic back and leg pain.  
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 7 of 41 Stimgenics SCS (SGX-SCS) programming approach relies less on paresthesia pattern and programmed stimulation parameters will be set to levels that span above the perception threshold, yet well below the levels that could cause uncomfortable paresthesia.  SGX-SCS will use only programming parameters that are currently available on the device. In a given program group, SGX-SCS provides programs with two different pulse rates and pulse widths for the goal of better pain relief.  For example, starting parameters may be a combination of a program with 50 Hz pulses with duration of up to 200 microseconds setting and a program with 300 Hz with a pulse duration of up to 200 microseconds.  This programming approach could result in patients experiencing less uncomfortable paresthesia than with the Standard SCS programming approach. This is possible because an SGX-SCS program group contains programs that allow subjects to access amplitudes below ones that could cause uncomfortable paresthesia and make more adjustments to the pulse rate.  Should SGX-SCS programming approach be shown to be as effective as Standard SCS programming approach, SGX-SCS may offer an alternative approach to SCS that will help thousands of chronic pain sufferers make substantial improvement in pain relief, reduction in disabilities, and reduce the likelihood of uncomfortable paresthesia. Stimgenics has completed a multicenter feasibility study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in which SGX-SCS programming approach was evaluated during the required period for trialing SCS therapy. In this acute study 20 subjects were trialed with SGX-SCS and Standard SCS programming approaches.  In terms of back pain relief, SGX-SCS programming approach provided a mean of 68% pain relief and Standard SCS programming approach provided a mean of 43% pain relief, which translates to SGX-SCS achieving 25% greater reduction than Standard SCS.  Notably with SGX-SCS, 80% of subjects experienced 50% or better back pain relief, and 85% of the subjects preferred therapy received through SGX-SCS programming approach.  The safety results were in line with expectations of previous SCS studies and were mostly resolved within a few days with minimal interventions.  There was one serious adverse event, epidural abscess, which although uncommon, is well established as a potential risk in SCS trial and was not related to either programming approach. There were no unanticipated adverse events. For this study, the study design is a post market, open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled multi-center study that will again evaluate SGX-SCS programming and Standard SCS programming for chronic back and leg pain sufferers.  This scientifically sound study will provide more information on effectiveness of SGX-SCS programming approach.  B.2.  Study Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of SGX-SCS in reducing back pain as compared to Standard SCS for the treatment of intractable chronic back pain. The secondary objectives of this study are to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the SGX-SCS when compared to Standard SCS for the treatment of chronic pain of the trunk and limbs.  This study will also include the characterization of the safety of SGX-SCS.  B.3.  Selection of Study Population 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 8 of 41  B.3.1.  Study Population  The intended study population is individuals suffering from chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs associated with a number of conditions, including Failed Back Syndrome (FBS) and are candidates for commercially available SCS device systems.   B.3.2.  Inclusion Criteria In order to participate in the study, a subject must MEET ALL of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Be a candidate for SCS system (trial and implant) per labeled indication (back and leg pain) 2. Has an average back pain intensity ≥ 5.0 cm on the 10.0 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at the time of enrollment with moderate to severe chronic leg pain  3.

 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 of 41 6. Has undergone, within 30 days prior to enrollment, an interventional procedure and/or surgery to treat back and/or leg pain, which is providing significant pain relief  7. Has unresolved major issues of secondary gain (e.g., social, financial, legal), as determined by the investigator 8. Be pregnant (determined by urine testing unless female subject is surgically sterile or post-menopausal. If female, sexually active, and childbearing age, subject must be willing to use a reliable form of birth control.)  B.4.  Treatment Groups Subjects meeting the study entrance criteria will be randomized to one of two study treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: • Test treatment group with SGX-SCS programming approach • Control treatment group with Standard SCS programming approach  B.5.  Study Design  B.5.1.  Overall Design This is a post market, open-label, multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate SGX-SCS in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of the lower back with moderate to severe limb pain.  Data at follow-up visits will be compared between the two treatment groups, and in reference to baseline assessments collected at the beginning of the study.  B.5.2.  Bias Minimization This Investigational Plan and its associated documentation have been designed to minimize potential sources of bias.  Each Investigator’s qualification for meeting the requirements of this investigational plan will be reviewed prior to their participation in this investigation.  Randomization of subjects to one of the two treatment groups will occur after the subject completes Baseline assessments in order to minimize selection bias.  Each therapy, SGX-SCS programs and Standard SCS programs, will be programmed by clinical representatives of Stimgenics and Medtronic respectively, and in accordance with their standard therapy algorithms for optimal pain relief. This will minimize bias related to potential preference by a given clinical representative to a particular SCS therapy.    B.5.3.  Comparison Groups Both groups in the study are active treatment groups. Treatment outcomes from subjects in the SGX-SCS group will be compared to those of the Standard SCS group.    
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 10 of 41 B.5.4.  Blinding Due to the nature of the programs, it is not feasible to blind the subjects, implanting physicians or the clinical site personnel to the SGX-SCS programming and Standard programming SCS group assignments. Each SCS group will be programmed under the direction of physicians with support of clinical representatives of the Test and Control treatments, which may identify the type of treatment to study participants. Also, open communication about sensation of paresthesia and pain relief is important in adjusting program parameters to provide optimal pain relief for subjects. The assessments of device performance are done by the subjects and not by the site personnel so the lack of blinding of site personnel should not affect results as pain is the major assessment and subjects tend to describe pain truthfully since it affects their everyday life dramatically and not be influenced by knowledge of the device programming. Despite the inability to blind the study, past SCS studies indicate that there is no reason to believe that subjects and Investigators/clinical staff will be influenced one way or another by the knowledge that a particular SCS program has been used.  B.5.5.  Sample Size Primary Endpoint Assessment occurs at the follow up visit 3 months after Device Activation.  Based on the primary endpoint requirement, the estimated sample size of this study is at least 100 total subjects (at least 50 subjects in the SGX-SCS group and at least 50 subjects in Standard SCS group) who have passed screening requirements, have been randomized, and have completed the primary endpoint assessment.   The clinical investigational plan requires a screening process for all subjects that provide written informed consent. These subjects will undergo screening to assess eligibility. Subjects may be excluded for various reasons during screening.  Accordingly, in order to include an estimated 125 subjects to the point of randomization and trial phase, approximately 250 subjects may need to be consented and enrolled to account for exclusions prior to randomization.   B.5.5.1 Sample size rationale and statistical power The sample size estimate to determine primary endpoint is based on the primary objective of demonstrating non-inferiority of the test group to the control group.  Established methods were followed in determining the non-inferiority criteria and the related sample size estimate • Test basis:  Farrington-Manning binomial test for non-inferiority • Estimated responder rate of 70% in the test group and 50% in the control group • Significance level, alpha, of 0.05 one-sided • Statistical power = approximately 90% or greater • Non-inferiority margin of 10% • Randomization:  1:1 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 11 of 41 Based on these assumptions, a minimum of 50 randomized and trialed subjects per treatment group (100 total) are required.  B.5.5.2 Overall Sample Size and Enrollment Based on the primary endpoint requirement, a minimum of 50 subjects per treatment group are required (100 total). To account for a combined estimated attrition of 20% for subjects that do not complete the Trial Phase, and subjects that exit study before the 3-month primary endpoint visit, a total of 125 subjects would need to be randomized.    To account for 50% attrition prior to randomization (including subject ineligibility after signing the informed consent and subject dropout), it is estimated that a total of up to 250 subjects would need to be enrolled in the study.  B.5.6.  Study Duration This study is expected to last approximately 28 months.  Enrollment of subjects is expected to last 12 months. Subjects who are expected to complete will commit to it for approximately 8 months. This consists of Baseline assessments, up to 10 days of trial stimulation, and 6 months of treatment following implantation and activation of the device. All subjects who remain implanted at the time of Study Completion will be offered to return for an additional visit 12-months after device activation.   B.5.7.  Interim Administrative Analysis   For the purposes of business decisions and planning purposes (e.g., to provide an update to  third-party investors), an administrative analysis will be performed.  The results of this analysis will not be widely distributed, and access will be limited to those persons with a “need to know”.  Access will be restricted from those involved with the study conduct or management to prevent the introduction of bias.  The administrative analysis will not be used to modify the trial or stop early for potential benefit. As there is no chance of early stopping, the type I error rate is not affected. Limiting changes to the protocol and access to the interim administrative analysis also prevents operational bias due to knowledge of interim results.   B.6.  Enrollment, Assessments, Randomization, and Clinical Procedure 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 of 41 Enrollment of subjects will occur at the clinical sites after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, and when written informed consent from subjects has been obtained.  Prior to enrollment, Investigators and clinical site staff will approach subjects, who have been determined to be candidates for SCS therapy and talk about potential participation in the study.  Following informed consent, the eligibility of subjects to participate in the study will be assessed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in this Investigational Plan.  Various assessments including pain intensity, evaluation of medical history and records, and the Investigator’s clinical judgment will be used in the selection process.   B.6.1.  Summary of Study Protocol Potential study subjects will be identified from a pool of candidates for SCS therapy that are either affiliated with or referred to the clinical sites.  Advertisements of the study may be used for recruitment purposes, upon approval of the patient recruitment materials by the study IRB(s). An informed consent form (ICF) will be given to the potential subject for private evaluation. The Investigator or Study Clinical Staff will be available to respond any questions the potential subject may have during evaluation of the ICF. Potential study subjects willing to participate in the study will visit the study site for providing written consent and for evaluation of eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Once a consented subject is deemed qualified to participate in the study, baseline assessments and randomization will occur followed by scheduling of the trial stimulation phase with the assigned treatment group.  Subjects who complete a successful SCS trial phase will be scheduled to receive a permanent implant of leads and the INS and will undergo 6 months of stimulation delivery with assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months after the activation of the therapy. Baseline assessments will include measures for pain intensity, use of medication, extent of disability, and quality of life. Following completion of the baseline assessment, study subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the SGX-SCS programming group or the Standard SCS programming group.  After randomization, subjects will undergo a Trial Phase lasting up to 10 days to determine subject’s response to assigned treatment group. Temporary or permanent leads and an external neurostimulator (ENS) will be used during the Trial Phase. Subjects will evaluate the assigned treatment group based on pain intensity under optimal parameters. Those who have a "successful Trial Phase" (defined as a 40% or greater pain reduction from Baseline in their back pain) will proceed to permanent implantation of a SCS system to evaluate the assigned treatment group. The implanted INS will be activated within 14 days after surgical procedure and SCS therapy will be delivered for the next 6 months. Activation of the device marks the initial time point for effectiveness evaluation of the study therapies after implantation. Assessments of pain intensity, use of medication and adverse events will be made at 1 month following Device Activation.  At 3 and 6 months after Device Activation, subjects will be assessed for pain intensity, adverse events, extent of disability, use of medication, and quality of life. Patient Global Impression of Change, and subject satisfaction will also be recorded at 3 months after Device Activation. All subjects who remain implanted at the 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 of 41 time of Study Completion will be offered to return for an additional visit 12-months after device activation. Figure 1 summarizes the sequence of study-related assessments, procedures, and activities.  B.6.2.  Consent/Enrollment Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained from subjects before initiation of any study-related activities, including those that assess eligibility.  Following informed consent, subjects will be assigned a unique subject identification number and will be considered to be enrolled in the study.  Eligibility for advancing to the next stage of the study will be evaluated by the site Investigator based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be assessed for pain intensity and disability.   B.6.3.  Entry Criteria Evaluation (0-14 days from Enrollment) The eligibility of subjects who have consented participation will be assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Study subjects must meet all of the study inclusion criteria and none of the study exclusion criteria to be eligible.  Assessments for eligibility include average pain intensity (which will be used as Baseline pain intensity), medication usage, medical records and history, and the Investigator’s clinical judgment.  Subjects with confirmed eligibility will proceed to Baseline assessment, while subjects who do not will be discontinued from the study.    B.6.4.  Baseline Before a subject is randomized, a subject will be requested to fill out standard questionnaires that will assess extent of disability, use of medications, and quality of life.  The medical and surgical history of the subject will be collected. At this visit and subsequent visits, the subject will be assessed for adverse events, medication usage and be reminded to not increase pain medications from baseline through the 3-Month Visit.  Pre-operative assessments will follow the standard of care for SCS therapy and be determined by the site Investigator.   B.6.5.  Randomization Subsequent to completing Baseline assessments, qualifying subjects will be randomly assigned to either one of the two study treatment groups: SGX-SCS programming or Standard SCS programming (active comparator).  Randomization will be stratified by gender and whether the subject has bilateral or unilateral leg pain at Baseline. Randomization will be done at each study site by randomly permuted blocks.  B.6.6.  SCS Trial Phase Subjects will undergo a Trial Phase with the randomly assigned treatment group.  The Trial Phase will last up to 10 days.  Percutaneous leads will be placed in the epidural space at a 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 41 vertebral level based on the subject’s pain condition and pain pattern as described in the Physician Implant Manual. Stimulation will be delivered from an external neurostimulator (ENS).   Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral X-ray imaging will be done following lead implantation at the beginning of the Trial Phase and when significant lead migration is suspected. Stimulation therapy will be as follows for each study arm: • For Standard SCS: stimulation parameters will be trialed according to standard practice as described in the IntellisTM labeling/manuals.   • For SGX-SCS: As with Standard SCS programming, subjects will be given multiple program groups to try. Each SGX-SCS program group will have multiple parameters.  The stimulation parameters will be within the specifications described in the IntellisTM labeling/manuals.  Each SGX-SCS program group has at least two programs with different pulse rate in the 50 to 1,000 Hz range and each having a maximum pulse width of 1 ms. The subject will progress through each of the program groups until satisfactory pain relief has been reached. The subject will be able to adjust the amplitude of the signals as deemed needed to obtain pain relief.  If sufficient pain relief is not achieved with the initial program group, the subject will be instructed to trial another SGX-SCS program group. Adjustments to a program group may be made based on patient feedback following the trialing of a particular program group or set of stimulation parameters. The primary factor for assessing response to a given program group or stimulation parameters is the subject’s self-reported pain relief.  Adjustments to therapy will be attempted until at least 50% self-reported back pain reduction from baseline is achieved or until conclusion of the trial phase (no more than 10 days). Subjects will be assessed for adverse events and medication usage.   B.6.7.  End of Trial Assessment  At the end of the Trial Phase, subjects will be assessed for pain intensity under optimal therapy parameters. Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral X-ray imaging may  be done at the end of the Trial Phase.) The subject will be assessed for adverse events and medication usage. Those who have a "successful Trial Phase" (defined as a 40% or greater pain reduction from Baseline in their back pain) will proceed to permanent implantation of a SCS system to evaluate the assigned therapy, and permanent implantation of the IntellisTM SCS system will be scheduled. A threshold of 40% for the Trial Phase was predetermined as the minimum pain reduction that warrants consideration of a permanent implant and an opportunity to achieve a 50% pain reduction as defined in the Individual Subject Success criterion (see Section B.7.3).)  Data from subjects who did not achieve 40% or greater pain reduction in back and do not receive permanent implantation will be carried forward toward the primary endpoint. These subjects will exit the study after being followed up for two weeks after explant of the leads to assess adverse events.  
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 of 41 B.6.8.  Permanent Device Implant (0-60 days from end of successful Trial Phase) As described in section B.6.7, subjects who underwent a successful trial of the assigned SCS therapy and who agreed to continue into the next stage of the study will proceed to permanent implantation stage.  Permanent percutaneous leads will be placed in the epidural space at a vertebral level based on the subject’s pain condition and pain pattern as described in the IntellisTM Physician Implant Manual. The INS will be implanted by a trained physician according to standard practice and following the Physician Implant Manual for the device.  Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral X-ray imaging will be obtained.  Standard practice of a study site for prophylactic pre-surgery antibiotics and post-surgery pain medications will be followed). Subjects will be assessed for adverse events and medication usage.   B.6.9.  Device Activation (0-14 days following Permanent Implant) Clinical personnel at the site will assess if healing of surgical wounds is sufficiently appropriate to start charging and programming of the INS. The INS will be initially programmed to the group therapy or set of stimulation parameters that provided adequate pain relief during the Trial Phase. Adjustments to therapy may be made based on patient response to a program group or set of stimulation parameters. The subject will be provided with instructions on how to operate the charger and patient remote control at this visit.  Subjects will be assessed for adverse events and medication usage.   B.6.10.  Unscheduled Visits Unscheduled visits may occur at any time during the study for the assessment of possible adverse events, changes in pain medication, and programming adjustments.  Each unscheduled visit will be documented and recorded on an eCRF.  B.6.11.  Telephone Calls Subjects will be contacted by the study coordinator, via a telephone call, before each study visit. The study coordinator will check on the well-being of the subject, remind the subject of the upcoming scheduled visit, remind the subject not to change pain medication usage prior to the scheduled visit, and remind the subject to contact the Investigator/study staff should he/she have any concerns or questions. The telephone calls should be made two to three weeks before the scheduled visit.  B.6.12.  1 Month After Device Activation (± 10 days) Subjects will visit the study site where they will be assessed for pain intensity.  Programming adjustments may be made, as needed. Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral X-ray imaging may be done if significant lead migration is suspected. Subjects will be assessed for adverse events and medication usage.   
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 41 B.6.13.  3 Months After Device Activation (± 15 days) Subjects will visit the study site where they will be assessed for pain intensity, extent of disability, use of medication, quality of life, Patient Global Impression of Change, and subject satisfaction. Paresthesia generated by the stimulator will be assessed. Programming adjustments may be made, as needed. Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral X-ray imaging may be done if significant lead migration is suspected. Subjects will also be assessed for possible adverse events and medication usage.   B.6.14.  6 Months After Device Activation (± 30 days) The follow-up visit 6 Months after Device Activation is the final scheduled study visit. Subjects will visit the study site where they will be assessed for pain, extent of disability, quality of life, Patient Global Impression of Change, and subject satisfaction.  Paresthesia generated by the stimulator will be assessed. Programming adjustments may be made, as needed.  Subjects will also be assessed for possible adverse events and medication usage.   If there are no ongoing study related adverse events, the subject will complete the study at this visit. In situations where there is an ongoing study related adverse event, subjects will be followed until resolution of that adverse event or determination that the subject’s condition is stable, at which point the Study Completion Clinical Research Form (eCRF) should be completed. Beyond Study Completion, all subjects who remain implanted at the time of Study Completion will be offered to return for an additional visit 12-months after device activation. Following the last scheduled study visit, subjects will be followed by the Investigator at regular intervals, as dictated by standard of care at each site, in order to facilitate pain management, stimulation adjustments, possible revisions and/or replacements of neurostimulation components. Any additional non-study related monitoring of the subject will be the responsibility of the subject’s personal physician, as dictated by reasonable medical care.  B.6.15. 12 Months After Device Activation (± 30 days) Subjects will be offered an additional visit at 12 months after device activation. The visit will consist of the same assessments as the 3 and 6 month visits. Subjects will visit the study site where they will be assessed for pain, extent of disability, quality of life, Patient Global Impression of Change, and subject satisfaction.  Paresthesia generated by the stimulator will be assessed. Programming adjustments may be made, as needed.  Subjects will also be assessed for possible adverse events and medication usage.  In situations where there is an ongoing study related adverse event, subjects will be followed until resolution of that adverse event or determination that the subject’s condition is stable.  Beyond the 12 month visit, there will be no additional scheduled follow-up visits in the study.  Following the last scheduled study visit, subjects will be followed by the Investigator at regular intervals, as dictated by standard of care at each site, in order to facilitate pain management, stimulation adjustments, possible revisions and/or replacements of neurostimulation components. Any additional non-study related 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 41 monitoring of the subject will be the responsibility of the subject’s personal physician, as dictated by reasonable medical care.   B.6.16  Other Assessments and Information At any time during the study, if lead migration is suspected, the subject may have additional AP and lateral X-rays taken to confirm the new lead position in order to aid the Investigator in determining a course of action. Paresthesia testing may also be performed to assess lead location and therapy coverage of pain areas. Programming adjustments may be made based on patient feedback following assessment. Additional information on Medication Usage: • The investigator will instruct all subjects to take the Baseline doses of pain medication until the 3-Month Visit.  However, after Device Activation Visit, the Investigator may reduce the dose of pain medication if the subject is benefitting greatly from SCS and not benefitting from Baseline dose pain medication. o Subjects should not fluctuate medication usage nor dosages even if the dose is at or below Baseline doses. The investigator will instruct all subjects to maintain stable dosing of medication for at least two weeks prior to scheduled follow-up visits. • Acetaminophen, NSAIDs or other pain medications (new prescriptions or greater than Baseline doses) may only be taken for an acute condition and for a limited duration. For each type of pain medication, dosing should not exceed the maximum daily dosage recommended by the manufacturer and usage should not continue beyond 5 days. Should acute pain medication usage coincide with a follow-up visit, the visit will be postponed until two weeks after acute pain medication usage has been stopped. • Following trial and permanent implants, the clinical site’s standard practice for prophylactic pre-surgery antibiotics and post-surgery pain medications will be followed. Investigators will instruct subjects not to change usage of any other concomitant pain medications.  B.6.17.  Device Explant At any time during the study, a subject may elect to withdraw from the study and have the SCS device system explanted.  Additionally, an Investigator may elect to explant a device due to an adverse event. The Investigator must follow the appropriate guidelines set forth by the Medtronic for returning the explanted device and/or lead(s) as well as the accessories (charger, patient remote control).  
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 of 41 B.6.18.  Early Subject Withdrawal Although efforts will be made by Investigators and study staff to encourage subjects to remain enrolled in the study, subjects may withdraw early from the study for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: • Failure of SCS Trial Phase • Subject request • Investigator request • Subject lost to follow-up • Subject’s death • Adverse events (e.g., intolerable adverse event occurrence that forces subject to stop participation in the study) If a subject is considering withdrawing from the study due to unsatisfactory effectiveness of the assigned treatment, the Investigator will make attempts to improve therapy during a study visit. When a subject is withdrawn early from the study, a Study Termination eCRF will be completed describing the reason for discontinuation.  Study staff will contact subjects to remind them about their scheduled visits and make sufficient efforts to locate a subject that is not responding to a contact call. If a subject has withdrawn consent for the study, or is lost to follow-up, the completion of this visit is not required.  In situations where study withdrawal is due to an adverse event, subjects will be followed until resolution of the adverse event or determination that the adverse event is not likely to change.  B.6.19.  Study Completion All subjects enrolled in the study are expected to complete all scheduled visits through the follow up visit 6 months after Device Activation.  A Study Completion eCRF should be completed at the end of this visit. If the subject decides to decline the additional 12 month visit and there is an ongoing study related adverse event, subjects will be followed until resolution of that adverse event or determination that the adverse event is not expected to change. Subjects who decide to complete the 12 month visit would also be followed equivalently in cases of ongoing study related adverse events.   B.6.20.  Study Suspension and Termination Subjects will be considered to have completed all study requirements following the completion of the follow up visit 6 Months after Device Activation.  Each clinical site will be considered to have completed study requirements at the end of the required monitored close out visit.  The study will be considered terminated when all of the requirements of this Investigational Plan have been fulfilled, all close out visits have been completed and all Sponsor and Investigator reports have been issued and reported to the IRB. Stimgenics, the Investigators, or the IRB(s) may suspend or terminate the study early at any time.  If the study is suspended or terminated prematurely, all subjects that are still enrolled will be terminated from the study. A Study Completion eCRF will be completed 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 of 41 noting that the study has been terminated.  If there is an ongoing adverse event related to the device or treatment, the subject will be followed until resolution of the adverse event or determination that the adverse event is not likely to change.  Subsequent follow-up of the subjects after study completion will be the responsibility of the subject’s personal physician.   Stimgenics reserves the right to terminate the study but intends only to exercise this right for reasons related to the protection of subjects or valid scientific or business reasons.  Stimgenics will notify Investigators and IRBs in writing in the event of study termination.   Stimgenics reserves the right to stop the enrollment of subjects at any clinical site at any time after the clinical site initiation. Possible reasons for suspending or terminating a clinical site may include, but are not limited to: • Non-compliance by Investigator  • Failure to obtain proper written informed consent • Repeated failure to complete or submit eCRFs in a timely manner • Failure to report SAEs to the Sponsor within 48 hours of knowledge of the event and to reviewing IRB in accordance with its policies • Repeated failure to comply with clearance of queries generated during monitoring of the study • Inactivity  B.7.  Study Endpoints  B.7.1.  Definition of Analysis Populations  • Intent to Treat (ITT): All randomized subjects. • Modified Intent to Treat (mITT): All randomized subjects who complete the Trial Phase. • Per-Protocol (PP):  All subjects who complete the Trial Phase and who complete the study without any major protocol deviations (that would render their data unevaluable).  The primary analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will be performed on the ITT population. Supportive analyses will be performed for the mITT and Per-Protocol population.   B.7.2.  Effectiveness Assessment Definitions • Primary Effectiveness Assessment:  For subjects who have a successful Trial Phase and receive a permanent implant, the Primary Efficacy Assessment occurs at the follow up visit 3 months after Device Activation.  For subjects who do not have a successful Trial Phase, the Primary Efficacy Assessment occurs at the end of the Trial Phase.  • 6-month Secondary Effectiveness Assessment:  For subjects who have a successful Trial Phase and receive a permanent implant, the 6-month Secondary Efficacy 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 of 41 Assessment occurs at the follow up visit 6 months after Device Activation.  For subjects who do not have a successful Trial Phase, the 6-month Secondary Efficacy Assessment occurs at the end of the Trial Phase.   B.7.3.  Primary Endpoint Pain rating on the 10 cm Visual Analog Scale is considered the primary outcome measure.  VAS is the most widely used outcome measure in assessing pain due to its documented reliability and validity, ease in administration, and minimal training requirements for the administrator. • Individual Responder:  A decrease in back pain VAS by at least 50% at 3 months Post-Permanent Device Activation as compared with Baseline.  Overall Study Success:  The percentage of Individual Responders in the test group is shown to be statistically non-inferior to the percentage in the control group.   B.7.4.  Secondary Endpoints The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated:  • Comparison of the percentage of Individual Responders between the test and control groups in a statistical test of superiority • Comparison of change from Baseline in back pain score (VAS) determined at the 3-month visit after device activation, between test and control in a statistical test of non-inferiority.  This is calculated as: Change from Baseline in Back Pain VAS = 3-Month Visit Pain VAS – Baseline Pain VAS. A negative result reflects a decrease in the Pain VAS, while a positive result reflects an increase in Pain VAS.  • Comparison of Back Pain Treatment Success (responder rate), measured as subjects with at least a 50% reduction in Back Pain VAS, evaluated at 6 months after device activation, between test and control  • Comparison of mean change from Baseline in Back Pain VAS, evaluated at 6 months after device activation, between test and control • Comparison of mean change from Baseline in disability as measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), evaluated at 3 months after device activation between test and control • Frequency of treatment emergent adverse events  B.7.5.  Additional Data Collection  These following data will be collected: • Comparison of mean change from Baseline in Back Pain VAS, evaluated at 1-month after device activation, between test and control 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 of 41 • Comparison of mean change from Baseline in Leg Pain VAS, evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months after device activation for subjects with baseline leg pain VAS score ≥ 5 between test and control • Comparison of Leg Pain Treatment Success, measured as at least a 50% reduction in Leg Pain VAS, evaluated at 3 and 6 months after device activation for subjects with baseline leg pain VAS score ≥ 5 between test and control • Subject Satisfaction, evaluated at 3 and 6 months after device activation • Comparison of patient satisfaction between two arms • Patient Global Impression of Change, evaluated at 3 and 6 months after device activation • Comparison of Patient Global Impression of Change between two arms • Comparison of ODI change from baseline at 6 months after device activation between the two arms • Comparison of quality of life (QoL) change (from PROMIS Scale - Global Health) from baseline at 3 and 6 months after device activation between the two arms • Quality of paresthesia at 3 and 6 months, comparison between test and control  • Activity level based on IntellisTM adaptive data log Details on additional data collection for the 12 month visit will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan.   B.8.  Evaluation Criteria  B.8.1.  Effectiveness Results of the tests and standard questionnaires will be recorded in Case Report Forms at Baseline and during follow-up visits.  Changes from Baseline will be calculated and compared between the two groups.   Effectiveness will be measured for each subject using the following tests: • Pain – Visual Analog Scale (VAS, 10 cm) at Baseline, End of Trial Phase, Months 1, 3, and 6  • Disability – Oswestry Disability Questionnaire • Quality of Life – PROMIS Scale v1.2- Global Health • Impression of Change in Quality of Life – Patient Global Impression of Change • Satisfaction with Therapy – Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire • Paresthesia generated by the stimulator 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 of 41 – Paresthesia Questionnaire  Study personnel will be appropriately trained for administration of each test. Details on evaluation criteria for effectiveness for the 12 month visit will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan.    B.8.2.  Definition of Success  The subject’s self-reported pain intensity score based on the 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is considered the outcome measure for the efficacy component of the primary endpoint. VAS is a widely used outcome measure in assessing pain. It is a reliable and valid method, which is easy to administer, and requires minimal training for the test administrator. VAS scores will be collected for both back and leg pain.   Study success will be declared if the non-inferiority test for the primary effectiveness endpoint is statistically significant.  There are no additional pre-specified subject or study-level success criteria for secondary and tertiary endpoints.   B.8.3.  Safety Safety will be assessed by characterizing adverse events at all study visits with descriptive statistics.  B.8.3.1 Definitions An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject associated with the use of the therapy under the study whether or not related to IntellisTM SCS system or the study procedures. An AE is also any event related to any underlying medical condition, present at baseline, which increases in severity or frequency by a clinically meaningful amount during the study as determined by the Investigator.  For all adverse events, the Investigator will provide an assessment of the adverse event, its seriousness, treatment/intervention provided, relationship to the device/procedure, and resolution. As the efficacy measures in this study are back and leg pain, back and leg pain do not need to be reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a serious adverse event. Investigators may, however, report any other pain-related adverse events during the study.   Pre-existing conditions will not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a substantial increase in the severity or frequency of the problem, which has not been attributed to its natural history. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that  
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 of 41 • Leads to death • Leads to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either results in  o a life-threatening illness or injury (life-threatening is defined as at risk of death at the time of the event), or o a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or o in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (in-patient hospitalization is defined as a hospital admission for a period of greater than 24 hours), or  o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, • Leads to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect Those known adverse events related to the device, procedure or therapy are listed in the section C. (Risk Analysis) of this Investigational Plan.  B.8.3.2 Reporting All AEs and SAEs will be assessed and captured from enrollment through the completion of the study on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE-eCRF).  AEs and SAEs will be reported as required by the IRB. However, as would be the common practice when using commercial medical devices, device -related AEs may be reported by the site (per their institutional policy) to the Customer Service or Technical Support of Medtronic as specified in the manufacturer's labeling/manuals. All Adverse Events (see list in section C.1.) reported during the study will document seriousness, treatment/intervention provided, relationship to the device/procedure, and resolution.   This is a post market, open-label study so Data Monitoring Committee will not be used.    B.9.  Data Collection and Analysis  B.9.1.  Data Collection Study data will be collected using a secure Electronic Data Capture system meeting the requirements of 21 CFR part 11. Each data field completed via the EDC system is expected to have a verifiable source document.  The clinical site will enter directly the data on outcome variables as well as adverse events should they occur.  Subject confidentiality will be maintained, and each subject will be identified only by the assigned study subject number.  Subject names will not be published. Data collection is summarized in Table 1.

Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline and outcome data collected during the study.  Continuous variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations, and ranges.  Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency distributions.  B.9.2.1 Primary Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated with a Farrington-Manning binomial test for non-inferiority at the one-sided 0.05 alpha level. H0: The percentage of subjects (P) who achieve a 50% improvement in their back VAS pain score at 3 months in the Test group is inferior to that in the Control group. PTest  ≤  PControl - 10% H1: The percentage of subjects (P) who achieve a 50% improvement in their back VAS pain score at 3 months in the Test group is not inferior to that in the Control group. PTest  >  PControl - 10% A 10% margin has been previously used in a similar study.8 Meeting the statistical threshold for this test based on a 10% margin should produce clinically acceptable results.   B.9.2.2 Secondary Analyses The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated: • If the primary efficacy endpoint in the test group is found to be non-inferior to that in the control group, then a secondary endpoint will evaluate whether the proportion of subjects who achieve a 50% improvement in their back pain VAS score at 3 months in the test group is superior to that in the control group.  A superiority test based on the difference in proportions will be performed based on the following null hypothesis, with a one-sided p-value of 0.05 or less considered evidence of statistical significance. H0: The proportion of subjects (P) who achieve a 50% improvement in their back pain VAS score at 3 months in the Test group is less than or equal to that in the Control group. PTest   ≤  PControl  H1: The proportion of subjects (P) who achieve a 50% improvement in their back pain VAS score at 3 months in the Test group is greater than that in the Control group. PTest  >  PControl    
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 41 • Change in mean VAS will be evaluated with two-sample t-test of non-inferiority in means with a 0.65 cm margin at 3 months. H0: The change (C) in subject’s VAS pain intensity score relative to baseline at the Primary Efficacy Assessment in the Test group is inferior to that of subjects in the Control group (active control). CTest  ≥  CControl - 0.65 cm H1: The change (C) in subject’s VAS pain intensity score relative to baseline at the Primary Efficacy Assessment in the Test group is not inferior to that of subjects in the Control group (active control). CTest  <  CControl - 0.65 cm The non-inferiority margin of 0.65 cm was selected based on a previous study of a similar therapy against traditional SCS.8 In that study, the experimental therapy showed a 4.9 point improvement while traditional SCS showed a 3.6 point improvement for a difference of 1.3 points. Taking 50% of this treatment effect yields the margin of 0.65.   The following secondary endpoints do not have an associated hypothesis, and no significance level will be assigned to statistical tests that may be performed. • Comparison of Back Pain Treatment Success (responder rate), measured as subjects with at least a 50% reduction in Back Pain VAS, evaluated at 6-months after device activation, between test and control: • Comparison of mean change from Baseline in Back Pain VAS, evaluated at 6-months after device activation, between test and control • Comparison of mean change from Baseline in disability as measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), evaluated at 3- months after device activation between test and controlFrequency of treatment emergent adverse events  Data will be summarized in frequency distributions by study group of each adverse event (AE) type and by the percentages of subjects with one or more of each AE type.    B.9.2.3 Additional Data • Efficacy at 1-month: The primary efficacy endpoint will be reassessed at 1-month • Leg pain relief: Efficacy will be assessed for reduction of leg pain VAS score vs baseline evaluated at 1-, 3-, and 6-months after device activation for subjects with baseline leg pain VAS score ≥ 5 between test and control • Responder rate for leg pain: The proportion of subjects that respond to treatment defined as having at least a 50% reduction in leg pain VAS relative

B.9.2.4 Handling of Missing Data  Missing data will be minimized by rigorous follow-up and investigator and site training. Additionally, for subjects who do not have a successful Trial Phase, results from the Trial Phase will be utilized for the primary endpoint as described in Section B.7.2.  Effectiveness Assessment Definitions. Any other data will be imputed via Multiple Imputation. Additionally, sensitivity analyses for missing data will be performed. Unless otherwise specified, all other analyses will be based on the evaluable data with no imputation.   Details on imputation will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan.    C.  Risk Analysis C.1.  Description and Analysis of All Increased Risks to Subjects Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) Risks: SGX-SCS programming approach will be used with commercially available, FDA approved IntellisTM SCS system within approved indications for use. Anticipated potential adverse events resulting from the study are expected to be in line with adverse events already documented for SCS using a Standard programming approach.  There are known risks associated with the use of any SCS system.  Known risks are associated with the implant procedure, the stimulation, the implanted device (not associated with 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 41 stimulation) and external devices such as the charger and remote control. These are typical of commercial SCS systems. Subjects will be informed of these anticipated risks in the study consent process.  Risks of Surgery Implanting a neurostimulation system has risks similar to spinal procedures, including spinal fluid leak (spinal fluid collection under the skin), headaches, swelling, bruising, bleeding, infection, or paralysis.  Subjects on anticoagulation therapy may be at higher risk for problems after surgery such as hematomas that could result in paralysis. Spinal Cord Stimulation Risks The implantation of a spinal cord stimulation system involves risks that are similar to other spinal procedures. In addition to those normally associated with surgery, implantation or use of a neurostimulation system includes, but is not limited to, the following risks: • Allergic or immune system response to the implanted materials • Infection • Lead or neurostimulator erosion through the skin or migration • Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid • Loss of pain relief may return patients to their underlying pain condition • Persistent pain at the neurostimulator site • Placement of the epidural lead is a surgical procedure that may expose patients to risks of epidural hemorrhage (bleeding), hematoma, or paralysis • Radicular chest wall stimulation • Seroma (fluid collection in pocket where stimulator is placed) or hematoma at the neurostimulator site • Change in stimulation, possibly related to cellular changes around the electrode(s), shifts in electrode position, loose electrical connections, lead fractures, which has been described by some patients as uncomfortable stimulation (jolting or shocking sensation) • Over time there could be changes in the level of symptom control. In most cases, the physician can correct these changes without surgery. • Formation of excessive tissue around the lead in the epidural space can result in delayed spinal cord compression and paralysis, requiring surgical intervention. Time to onset can range from weeks to many years after implant. • The safety of this therapy is unknown for pregnancy, unborn fetus, or delivery • Stimulation-dependent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, incontinence or constipation • Stimulation-dependent bladder symptoms such as urinary retention, incontinence or frequency • Unexpected changes in stimulation - Electromagnetic interference, changes in posture, and other activities can cause a perceived increase in stimulation 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 41  System Revision Risk The Intellis AdaptiveStim Neurostimulator may require replacement in 9 years or earlier, regardless of the number of times the neurostimulator is recharged.  It is possible that the system will need to be revised (explanted, replaced, or repositioned) earlier than 9 years.  Possible reasons for revision/explant may include infection, malfunction, and migration of the system components.  The risks associated with system revision are equivalent to the commercially available systems.    Pregnancy Risks Pregnant women are not able to take part in this study.  Female subjects must agree to not become pregnant during the study by using a medically acceptable method of birth control. If a subject becomes pregnant during this study, there may be risks to the unborn child that are not yet known.  Subjects will be advised and encouraged to notify the study doctor immediately if they think they are or have become pregnant.  Subjects that become pregnant during the study will be instructed to turn the neurostimulator “OFF” and will be exited from the study. Radiographic Imaging As part of the study, subjects may  be required to have fluoroscopic or X-ray images taken of their thoracic spine  in addition to the imaging conducted to implant the leads.  This may be beyond what is standard of care.  The risk associated with these additional images has been considered and determined to be minimal since the total radiation dose will be approximately the same as one CT scan of the abdomen.     Study Risk Control Measures  The following will be done to mitigate risks associated with the implanted system: • Investigators who are experienced with spinal cord stimulation implantation techniques will be utilized • Instructions will be given to the study participants to ensure they can properly use the patient programmer and recharger system • Subjects can turn off stimulation at any time during the study with the patient programmer or recharger • Periodic monitoring of the study participants • Written materials that contain precautions, warnings, and contraindications, as well as instructions on the use of the devices will be available and/or provided to the clinicians and subjects  Since the efficacy measure in this study is intensity of pain in the back and legs, pain in these areas does not need to be reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a serious adverse event. However, Investigators may, at their discretion, report any other pain-related adverse events during the study.    C2.  Minimization of Risks 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 of 41 The study will use commercially available IntellisTM SCS system within the approved indications for use. The risks associated with the use of SCS systems have been well characterized and are minimal compared to the side effects associated with most surgical procedures or the use of many medications used to treat chronic pain conditions. Additionally, SCS therapy is reversible since the SCS device may be turned off and the SCS system may be explanted at any time for any reason.   Study Investigators are experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain, have proper surgical and clinical training and will take adequate steps to ensure subject safety throughout the entire study. Investigators and study personnel will receive product training to become familiar with the components of the IntellisTM SCS systems and their functions. They will also receive training on assessment tools and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in the conduct of clinical trials with human participants.  D.  Description of the Device D.1.  Each Important Component, Ingredient, and Property of the Device  D.1.1.  Device System Overview The Intellis™ system is a totally implantable spinal cord stimulation system that is indicated to aid in the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs. The system has been approved by the FDA and is available for commercial use. The Intellis system system consists of a rechargeable implantable neurostimulator (INS) with 16 output channels.  The INS is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket and is capable of stimulating the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord when used with one or two 8-contact percutaneous leads located in the epidural space.  The INS can be controlled by a Patient Programmer and/or a Clinician Programmer.   Before permanent implantation, a trial phase of therapy lasting up to 10 days is required. Components of the system during trial include an External Neurostimulator (ENS) capable of delivering the same stimulation as the INS, and Stimulation Leads. Other components of the system include Clinician Programmer, Communicator, Patient Programmer, Extensions, Charger and charging system, and surgical accessories.  D.1.2.  Device System Details     Only FDA approved, commercially available components will be used for the study.  D.1.2.1  Major Components Implantable Neurostimulator: Intellis neurostimulator (Model 97715, Medtronic, Minneapolis MN) will be used for the study. The INS is a multi-programmable, rechargeable device that delivers stimulation through one or two 8-electrode leads. The stimulation settings are stored in programs. A program is a specific combination of pulse width, rate, and amplitude settings acting on a specific electrode combination (up to 16 electrodes per program).  Each of the 16 electrodes in the leads can be set to be a 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 of 41 cathode, an anode, or to remain off.  The INS is powered by a Li-Ion rechargeable battery.  The INS is capable of stimulating the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord through the electrodes in the leads that are connected to the output terminals of the INS. The electrical pulses used for stimulation are generated using a single current source.  The INS is designed to produce charge-balanced, biphasic rectangular pulses.  The battery is recharged using an external charger that uses transcutaneous RF energy transmission. The INS is capable of communicating with the Charger to control the recharging function.   The INS communicates with the Clinician Programmer and Patient Programmer (also called Patient Remote Controller). Clinician Programmer is used to program the INS and the ENS. The Patient Programmer is used by the subject to control some of the therapy parameters, change therapy programs, and turn stimulation on and off. External Neurostimulator (ENS) for Trial Phase: The Medtronic Model 97725 Wireless External Neurostimulator (ENS) is part of a neurostimulation system used for trial stimulation outside of the operating room. The ENS is powered by two standard alkaline AAA batteries. The ENS is connected to leads implanted in the subject. The subject uses the ENS during the Trial Phase to evaluate the effectiveness of SCS therapy prior to receiving a permanent implant. The ENS also communicates with the Clinician Programmer system and Patient Remote Controller, similar to the INS.  Clinician Programmer System:  The Medtronic Model A710 Intellis™ clinician programmer application resides on a tablet and is intended to be used by healthcare professionals to program the ENS (Model 97725) and IntellisTM INS (Model 97715 and 97716) for pain therapy. The Clinician Programmer requires the use of the Communicator (Model 8880T2) to communicate with the INS.  Patient Programmer: The Patient Programmer (Model 97745), also called Patient Remote Controller, is a handheld unit able to communicate with the INS or ENS.  The Patient Programmer is powered by two standard AA alkaline batteries. The Patient Programmer is used by subjects to select the SCS therapy program to be applied, to turn on or off the INS or ENS, and to change some of therapy parameters such as stimulation amplitude.   Charging System:  The Charging system (Model 97755) is used by the subject to transcutaneously charge the INS battery.  It is a portable device powered by a rechargeable battery and can be held in one hand. The charging system used in this study is a commercially available charging system manufactured by Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN) and fully compatible with the study INS. Stimulation Leads and Lead Extensions:  The study will use commercially available percutaneous eight-electrode leads manufactured by Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN) and compatible with the INS and ENS to be used in this study. The leads are positioned percutaneously in the epidural space of the subject and are used for delivering the stimulation field to the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. The percutaneous leads are intended to be single use. Temporary or permanent percutaneous leads may be used during the Trial Phase of the study. The proximal end of these leads connect directly to the ENS. Permanent leads will be used during the Permanent Phase of the study. These 
 Stimgenics SGEN-2018PM2 Rev 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 41 may be connected to a Lead Extension.  The leads or lead extensions are tunneled subcutaneously to connect to the INS. Commercially available lead extensions (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) compatible with the percutaneous leads and INS may be used in this study.   D.1.2.2.  Surgical Accessories  The surgical accessories that will be used in the study will be commercially available devices. Torque Wrench:  A commercially available Torque Wrench is used to tighten the screws that lock a percutaneous lead into the INS and/or a lead extension. It also tighten the screws that lock the lead extension into the INS when this is used. Lead anchors:  Lead anchors may be used to possibly prevent lead migration and/or lead strain. These are used to anchor the percutaneous leads to the supraspinous ligament or fascia.  Lead anchors used in this study are commercially available (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) and designed to slide freely over the lead length to the required fixation position. Surgical sutures are then tied around the anchor clamping the sleeve in place on the lead.   Insertion Needle:  Percutaneous leads are implanted in the dorsal epidural space using insertion needles.  An insertion needle contains a cannula and stylet that facilitate access to the spinal canal for lead placement.  The insertion needle is a 14G epidural needle with a thin wall and a modified Touhy non-coring tip.  The cannula and stylet are designed to lock together and maintain the orientation of the tip of each component. The hub of the insertion needle has a standard luer fitting. Stylets:  Stylets are used to push and “steer” a percutaneous lead into the desired place within the epidural space.  The distal end of the stylet could be straight or curved.  The implanter is able to use either one in order to comfortably maneuver a percutaneous lead through the epidural space until it reaches the desired implant location. Tunneling Tool:  A Tunneling Tool is used to create a subcutaneous tunnel that directs the percutaneous leads or lead extensions from the midline incision to the leads from the INS implant site.  This is a single use tool.  INS Template:  The INS Template is an aid to be used for the implanter intended for proper sizing of the INS pocket within each subject. INS Port Plug:  An INS Port Plug is used to seal the port of the INS that is not in use when only one percutaneous lead is implanted. Lead Blank:  A Lead Blank is an optional aid made out of flexible stainless steel that has an outer diameter similar in size to the percutaneous lead. A lead blank can be optionally used to clear a path for the introduction of a percutaneous lead into the epidural space.   D.2.  Principle of Operation of the Device

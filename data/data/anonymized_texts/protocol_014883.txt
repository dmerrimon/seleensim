Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 6 of 56  1.0 Introduction and Background  
1.1 Synopsis 
Approximately half of the 1.7 million new cancer diagnoses annually will be treated with ionizing 
radiation therapy (RT).  Improvements in screening and treatment continue to decrease mortality.  As a 
result, long term sequelae of therapy have  become a major concern1-3.  
Thorac
ic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of primary or metastatic lung 
tumors near the chest wall unavoidably delivers high doses of radiation to the surrounding normal ribs 
or vertebrae and can predispose patients to significant chest wall pain (CWP), radiation induced rib 
fractures (RIRF) or even vertebral fractures4-6.  Rates of toxicity have been correlated with dose 
received by the chest wall. On average, around 35% of patients develop grade 3 or higher CWP when greater than 30 cc of chest wall receives 30 Gy  or more
7.   
In cli
nical practice this is a very common scenario and a difficult dosimetric constraint to achieve.  The 
incidence of rib fractures within the first year of treatment has been reported as high as 40%6,8-13.  
Patients can experience severe pain, compromised ventilation, and impaired quality of life. In the elderly, decreased oxygen saturation as a result of compromised ventilation can reduce life expectancy 
14.Radiation related bone injury is not limited to the ribs and SBRT however.  Rather, it is a source or
morbidity at multiple skeletal locations. The five year post -RT pelvic fracture rate is ~30% in women
treated for the most common gynecologic malignancy, endometrial adenocarcinoma15,16.  Likewise,
hazard ratios for RT induced hip and femoral neck fracture indicate significant increased risk at fiveyears post -RT for cervical (1.66), rectal (1.65), and anal (3.16) cancers
17.  Alarmingly, the rate of
incomplete healing is high with RT -induced fractures , which greatly contributes to morbidity18,19.
Therefore, RT -induced bone damage is a persistent and major source of functional impairment, pain,
and mortality in many cancer survivors.
The exact  m
echanisms of RT -induced bone damage are unclear.  Historically, persistent damage to 
osteoblasts was thought to play a role by lowering bone formation and bone mineral density over time20-
23.However, we recently discovered that local RT rapidly increases the number and act ivity of
osteoclasts in rodents 24, and we have shown this burst of osteoclast activity causes substantial early
bone loss22.  This is now well- accepted25-32. By suppressing osteoclast activity during RT using an
antiresorptive bisphosphonate, risedronate, we prevented this rapid bone loss in rodents22.  This is
illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.  Suppressing early osteoclast activity is an appealing therapeuticapproach for preventing RT -induced fractures .  A variety of urinary biomarkers have been linked to
increased osteoclastic activity in osteoporotic  populations, and the most frequently tested marker is
urinary NTX N -telopeptide. 
33.  These biomarkers have been assessed following radiation to the pelvis
with or without bisphosponates and were shown to decrease with the addition of bisphosphonates34.
We hav
e devised a novel 3D mapping approach which utilizes DICOM computed tomography (CT) 
images and allows us to visualize and quantify the changes in bone cortical thickness (C.Th) following 
RT and associate bone changes with RT dose distribution.  (Fig. 3)   Furthermore , we illustrated dose-
dependent cortical thinning to the exact sites of eventual fracture in patients receiving lung SBRT near the chest wall, as well as bone loss to discrete, weight -bearing sub- regions of the femoral neck after RT 
for pelvic cancers
4,35.  In areas of the ribs receiving > 30 Gy approximately 92% of treated patients 
developed significant cortical thinning by 3 months, and 2 patients developed rib fractures by as early as 6 months
33.  Using this mapping technique, we have also illustrated significant and persistent cortical 
thickness changes as early as 2 months post treatment in the treated vertebrae of nonhuman primates receiving  single fraction high dose chest RT (Fig. 4)
36.

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 7 of 56  Clinical relevance  
On review of treatment planning records over the last month in our department, we have treated 18 
patients who would have qualified for inclusion on this study.  This is a reasonable representation of our average SBRT treatment population.  More than 2/3 of our SBRT plans unavoidably exceed 
standardized dosimetry constraints for the ribs/chest wall, and roughly 30- 40% of our patient population 
complains of chest wall pain requiring narcotics/analgesics after SBRT.  Typically this occurs within 3 - 8 
months.   This presents clinicians wit h a difficult decision to either compromise on effective tumor dose 
by reducing the dose per fraction, or accept a higher risk of chest wall toxicity with more intensive fractionations proven to have better local tumor control.    
Conclusions:  
We aim to d etermine if single dose prophylactic suppression of early RT induced osteoclast activity with 
bisphosphonates diminishes or prevents RT induced cortical bone thinning, fracture, and pain.

1.2 Risedronate Back ground Information 
Much of the following detailed information below was obtained from the product monograph from 
Allegran Pharma Co. Markham, Ontario L6G0B5 August 2017, Submission Control 205107.   In some 
instances, this information was directly reproduced from the product monograph.  
Background information on the study agent:  
ACTONEL® (risedronate sodium hemi -pentahydrate) is a commonly used bisphosphonate medication 
that is FDA approved for the indications below.  
oTreatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women
oTreatment of osteoporosis in men, to improve bone mineral density
oTreatment and prevention of glucocorticoid- induced osteoporosis in men and women
oPaget's disease of bone
Clinical studies and use with radiation  
Risedronate has been utilized in multiple large prospective clinical trials and was shown to significantly  
reduce vertebral fracture incidence in patients with low bone mass and vertebral fractures, regardless  
of age, years since menopause or disease severity at baseline.  A North American trial illustrated a 
significant reduction in the 1-year rate of new vertebral fractures by 65% compared to placebo.  
Similarly, a multinational trial also illustrated a 61% reduction in the 1-year rate of new vertebral 
fractures.  
There are no contraindications to concurrent use of risedronate and chest external beam radiation.  Bisphosphonates are not routinely discontinued during SBRT for lung tumors.  There is a known risk of 
jaw osteonecrosis that may occur following  dental surgery or spontaneously with bisphosphonates, 
however this is not a reported finding in the ribs.   Osteoradionecrosis in the jaw is a separate process

vasculature in the mandible.   In the setting of head and neck cancer treatment with radiotherapy, we would discontinue bisphosphonates, however this is not extrapolated to other parts of the body when 
receiving radiotherapy while on bisphosphonates  
Clinic
al studies have been performed with concurrent use of bisphosphonates and radiation therapy in 
the pelvis without excess toxicity.  Choo et al, conducted a randomized trial in patients with prostate cancer receiving placebo or risedronate concurrently  with external beam radiation and androgen 
deprivation therapy
37. They illustrated prevention of bone mineral density (BMD) loss at 2 years and 
significant suppression of bone turnover biomarkers in patients receiving risedronate.  There were no 
excess or unexpected toxicities due to concurrent risedronate and RT.   
Simi
arly, Gierloff et al. illustrated that the addition of zolendronate with radiation in patients with 
metastatic bone disease, prevented early radiation induced bone collagen degradation when compared 
to placebo34.  There was significant reduction in urine excretion markers of degradation including 
hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline.  Again, no excess toxicity was noted with the concurrent 
use of bisphosphonates and radiation.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Drug Interactions:  
No specific drug -drug interaction studies were performed with risedronate sodium film -coated tablets. 
Animal studies have demonstrated that risedronate is highly concentrated in bone and is retained only minimally in soft tissue. No metabolites have been detected systemically or in bone. The binding of 
risedronate to plasma proteins in humans is low (24%), resulting in minimal potential for interference with the binding of other drugs. In an additional animal study, there was also no evidence of hepatic 
microsomal enzyme induction. In summary, risedronate sodium is not systemically metabolized, does 
not induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and has low protein binding. Risedronate sodium is therefore not expected to interact with other drugs based on the effects of  protein binding displacement, enzyme 
induction or metabolism of other drugs. In vitro studies suggest that the amount of EDTA contained in the ACTONEL DR formulation (approximately 1.5 mM) will not significantly affect aqueous solubility of 
antivirals (nelfinavir, lamivudine, emtricitabin) and drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (digoxin, lithium carbonate, potassium chloride). Thus, co- administration with ACTONEL DR is not likely to alter 
their absorption.

s in clinical trials were exposed to a wide variety of commonly used concomitant medications 
(including NSAIDs, H2 -blockers, proton pump inhibitors, antacids, calcium channel blockers, beta-
blockers, thiazides, glucocorticoids, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, cardiac glycosides). While there 
was no apparent evidence of clinically relevant interactions in the clinical trials, such interactions cannot 
be ruled out on the basis on these data.  
Metabolism:  
There is no evidence that risedronate is systemically metabolized.  
Route of elimination:  
Approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in urine within 24 hours, and 85% of an intravenous dose is recovered in the urine over 28 days. The mean renal clearance is 105 mL/min (CV = 34%) and mean total clearance is 122 mL/min (CV = 19%), with the difference primarily reflecting 
non-renal clearance or clearance due to adsorption to bone. The renal clearance is not concentration 
dependent, and there is a linear relationship between renal clearance and creatinine clearance. Unabsorbed drug is eliminated unchanged in feces. Once risedronate is absorbed, the serum 
concentration- time profile is multi- phasic with an initial halflife of about 1.5 hours and a terminal 
exponential half -life of 480 hours. Although the elimination rate of bisphosphonates from human bone is 
unknown, the 480 hour half -life is hypothesized to represent the dissociation of risedronate from the 
surface of bone.  
Special Populations and Conditions  
Pediatrics: Risedronate pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients < 18 years  of age.  
Geriatrics: Bioavailability and disposition are similar in elderly (> 65 years of age) and  
      younger subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary.  
Gender: Bioavailability/disposition following oral administration are similar in men and women. 
2.0 Objectives  
This 
is a double blind randomized controlled study investigating the efficacy of a single dose of 150 mg 
risedronate (a bone anti- resorptive) vs a single dose of placebo given prior to SBRT for peripheral lung 
tumors that are within 2 cm of the chest wall.  Our hypothesis is that the use of a single dose of 150 mg 
risedronate will eliminate or greatly reduce the rapid bone loss that occurs with radiation induced early 
osteoclast recruitment/activation.  
Patients
 will be given either a single dose of 150 mg risedronate or placebo at the time of their 
treatment mapping “simulation” CT scan or within 7 -21 days of the start of SBRT.  Typically, radiation 
treatments begin at 1 – 3 weeks following this mapping scan, as each treatment plan requires detailed 
physics calculations and quality assurance checks . 
All 
CT imaging referenced below is performed as a routine standard of care surveillance and is 
necessary for cancer treatment follow -up.  These chest CT scans  that are  utilized in this research 
protocol would be performed every 3 months regardless of inclusion on this trial.   
2.1 Primary Objective(s) 
2.1.1  The
 primary objective is to assess the percent change in bone mean cortical thickness  
within regions of bone receiving 30 Gy or more  at 3 months  after SBRT.  The % change

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 12 of 56 in mean cortical thickness will be compared between patients who received risedronate 
and those who received placebo.  
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
2.2.1  In 
addition to the primary  objective, we will further analyze the remaining routine follow -
up chest CT scans,  for mean cortical thickness change  in regions of bone that received 
0 – 10 Gy, >10 – 20 Gy, > 20 – 30 Gy, > 30 – 40 Gy, and > 40 Gy at all time points 
including 3 months,  6 months, 9 months, and 12 months.  These scans are standard of 
care and would be performed regardless of inclusion on this trial.  This will allow us to 
determine the potential persistence of effects from SBRT and bisphosphonate use.    
2.2.2  We
 will assess and  compare the incidence and grade (per modified CTCAE v.5) of 
radiation induced chest wall pain within the radiation treatment portal  (within the 50% 
isodose line)  at time of each routine follow up visit (3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 
12 months post SBRT).  The purpose of utilizing a placebo and double- blind  design is 
that chest wall pain is a subjective finding.  Furthermore, it is unclear if chest wall pain from radiation is directly due to bone damage, nerve damage, muscle irritation, or a 
combination of all of these factors.  The u se of placebo will help us reduce the potential 
for bias in pain assessment.  
2.2.3  We
 will assess and compare the incidence of rib and vertebral fractures (as noted on CT 
imaging) that occur within 12 months of irradiation and are within the radiation treatment field.  The radiation treatment field will be defined as within the 50% isodose line.  
2.2.4  The
 urine concentration of an osteoclast -specific biom arker, urinary N -telopeptide (NTX)  
indicating osteoclast  activity will be assessed  prior to SBRT and at each routine follow 
up visit (at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post SBRT).    
2.3 Exploratory Objectives 
2.3.1  We will analyze novel anatomic dosimetric substructures  on already completed radiation 
plans  such as rib neurovascular  bundles.  These anatomical structures will be contoured  
onto the stored planning CT scans and the raystation planning system will allow us to 
calculate the dose that these structures received.  We will assess the relation between 
this calculated dose and development of/grade of chest wall pain during follow -up.   The 
standard structure that is routinely contoured for these cases is a crude rind 
encompassing 2-3 cm  of the entire chest wall.  We are hypothesizing that dose to 
specific substructures in the chest wall may be more useful in the prediction of chest wall pain development.  
2.3.2  If
 funding permits,  we will analyze, and compare between groups, the urine 
concentration of markers of bone turnover activity.  These will all be assessed prior to 
SBRT and at the 6 month follow up visit post SBRT . 
2.3.3  We
 will analyze and compare between groups the urine concentrations of pain-
associated cytokines prior to SBRT and at the 6 month follow up visit post SBRT. Also, if 
funding permits, the urine concentration of pain- related neurotrophic growth factors 
(proNGF, proBDNF, GDNF), and neuropeptides (CGRP and Substance P ) will be 
measured.

terato genic and potentially abortifacient risks.  
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
Men and women of all races and ethnicities who meet the above- described eligibility criteria are 
eligible to participate in this study. The study consent form will also be provided in Spanish for 
Spanish- speaking participants.   
Based on 
WFBCCC population estimates, we may expect approximately  44% of participants to 
be women. Translating this to our sample size estimate of  84 patients, we may enroll 
approximately 42 women. W e may enroll approximately 10- 13% Black or African American 
patients. Based on our catchment area and hospital demographics we do not expect high 
accruals of individuals of Hispanic/ Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native or Asian  ancestry; 
however, no individual will be excluded from the study if they satisfy the above 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Should we not meet or exceed these estimates, the PI will engage 
the Office of Cancer Health Equity to discuss strategies to enhance recruitment in these target 
populations.

A Randomized Clinical Trial of Prophylactic Risedronate for Patients with Peripheral Lung Tumors Treated with SBRT 
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC 99518  
Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 15 of 56 5.0 Study Outcomes and Study Measures  
All CT imaging referenced below is performed as a routine standard of care and necessary for cancer 
treatment follow -up.  These chest CT scans utilized in this research protocol would be performed every 
3 months regardless of inclusion on this trial.  
5.1 Primary Outcome 
5.1.1  Th
e primary outcome measure is the percent change in mean cortical thickness (C.Th) 
of bones receiving 30 Gy or more at 3 months post SBRT , when compared to pre -SBRT 
cortical thickness  
5.2 Secondary Outcomes 
5.2.1  Th
e change in mean C.Th of bones  will be assessed in regions of bone that received 0 
–10 Gy, >10 – 20 Gy, > 20 – 30 Gy, > 30 – 40 Gy, and > 40 Gy at all time points
including 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months.
5.2.2  Ches
t wall pain incidence and grade will be collected  as per modified CTCAE v. 5 within 
the within the 50% isodose line. Appendix K   
5.2.3  Inc
idence of rib and vertebral fractures (as noted on CT imaging) that occur within 12 
months of irradiation and are within the within 50% isodose line.   
5.2.4  The
 urine concentration of an osteoclast -specific biomarker, urinary N- telopeptide (U -
NTX) indicating osteoclastic activity will be assessed prior to SBRT and at each routine 
follow up visit (at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post SBRT).  
5.3 Exploratory Outcomes 
5.3.1  We will contour the neurovascular bundle that runs in the intercostal space for each 
patient  within at least 3 cm of the planning tumor  volume.  We will then utilize stored 
treatment planning information and the raystation planning system  to calculate the  dose 
that this nerve bundle received at the time of treatment.  As patients have already  been 
assessed for development of chest wall pain at each follow  up, we will assess for a dose 
response relationship between the dose to the nerve bundle and the subsequent 
development of and grade of any chest wall pain per the CTCAE v5.   
5.3.2  Ur
ine concentrations ( pg/mL)  of markers of bone turnover activity  such as P1NP 
(procollagen type 1 pro -peptide), sclerostin, OPG (osteoprotegerin), TRAP5B, and 
pentosidine (an advanced glycation end- product (AGE));  will be analyzed  using  
ELISAs .  These markers will be assessed prior to SBRT and at the 6 month follow up 
visit post SBRT ). 
5.3.3  Ur
ine concentrations (pg/mL) of pain- associated cytokines derived from the Isoplexis 
Codeplex Secretome Human Adaptive Immune and Innate Immune Chips which include 
GM-CSF, IL -1β,  IL -7,IL-17A, TNF- α, PDGF -BB, and VEGF will be assessed prior to 
SBRT and at the 6 month follow up visit post SBRT. In addition, other pro -inflammatory 
cytokines may be measured and analyzed on these chips as available. Also, if funding permits, the urine concentration (pg/m L) of pain- related neurotrophic growth factors 
(proNGF, proBDNF, GDNF) and neuropeptides (CGRP and Substance P) will be measured by ELISA.

6.1 Treatment Administration  
Treat
ment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Reported adverse events and potential risks of SBRT and risedronate are described in Section 8. 
REGIMEN DESCRIPTION  
Agent  Dose  Route  Schedule  
Risedronate  150 mg Oral Given once 7 – 21 days prior 
to initiation of SBRT  
Matching Placebo  N/A Oral Given once 7 – 21 days prior 
to initiation of SBRT  
Standard 
of care radiation therapy with SBRT will be given over the course of 3 – 10 fractions to a total 
dose of 50 – 60 Gy at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. Specific dose fractionations 
between 3 – 10 fractions and constraints will be at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and 
may be prescribed every day or every other day.  Respecting the following constraints are encouraged 
but meeting these constraints is not required for inclusion in the study.  In many cases meeting the rib constraint will not be possible.  
Treat
ment planning will be performed utilizing a vac lock or body fix bag and optional abdominal 
compression at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  Planning CT chest may be performed 
with or without contrast at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.   Utilization of motion 
management with 4D cinematic CT or a slow scan is required for determination of the internal target 
volume (ITV).  Clinical treatment volume (CTV) creation is not necessary and is not our standard 
treatment paradigm with SBRT for peripheral lung tumors.  The planning target volume (PTV) is 
generally created as a 0.5 cm expansion from the ITV, however the exact dimensions of this expansion 
are at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.    
The following are e ncouraged but not required dose constraints.

6.2 Ge
neral Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
Patient
s should receive full supportive care , including transfusions of blood and blood products, 
erythropoietin, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc., as clinically  indicated. Anti -inflammatory or narcotic 
analgesics may be offered as needed for chest wall pain, however use of these medications must be 
noted. Medications considered necessary for the patient's well -being may be given at the discretion of 
the investigator, i.e., chronic treatments for concomitant medical conditions, as well as agents required for life -threatening medical problems, etc. The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and dates of treatment 
should be recorded on the flow sheets. 
6.3 Duration 
of Therapy 
The hypothesized bone structural benefit of bisphosphonates with radiation is due to inhibition of early osteoclast activation within as little as 1 week of SBRT.  In our preclinical studies , risedronate was only

WFBCCC 99518  
Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 18 of 56 given just prior to irradiation, and it was not given at all after irradiation was completed.  Osteoclast 
activation only lasted for 1 week post irradiation in rodent models.  In non -human primate models, the 
first follow up scans were performed at 2 months  post irradiation, and these scans indicated maximal 
bone loss had already occurred which was persistent but not worsening on subsequent scans.  For this 
reason, risedronate will be given only once prior to SBRT, at a dose of 150 mg, which is the 
recommended monthly dose in the setting of osteoporosis in post -menopausal females.   
SBRT
 is given over the course of 3 to 10 treatments and generally this is performed over the course of 
1.5 - 2 weeks.  Radiation treatments are given every day or every other day Monday through Friday 
with the exclusion of the weekends or major holidays.  In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, radiation treatments may continue until the planned treatment dose is reached or until 
one of the following criteria applies:  
•Inter
current illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
•Unacceptable adverse event(s)
•Patient decides to withdraw from the study
General 
or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further 
treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
6.4 Duration 
of Follow-up 
Follow -up 
for serious adverse events and mortality after the single dose of 150 mg of risedronate or 
placebo is administered will take place during the routine clinic visits  during radiation treatment. 
Radiation treatments will occur within 1 – 3 weeks of taking the study drug .   The 30 day follow -up 
window that is part of mandatory DSMC -SAE reporting  will be considered 30 days from the end of all 
treatments of radiation.   This visit can be either a phone call or a visit in person to review adverse 
events and may be conducted and documented in the medical record by either research study staff RNs or the treating physician.  A window of +/ - 7 business days is allowed for the 30 day followup 
assessment. 
Specif
ic toxicity related to radiation pneumonitis, radiation fibrosis, and chest wall pain will be collected 
at each followup point as per appendices K – M.   
Patient
s removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  
Patient
s will be followed for a minimum of 3 months for assessment of the primary objective.  
Patient
s will be ideally followed in total for 12 months after completion of radiation therapy  for the 
purposes of this study .    
In the 
event that patients develop progressive disease or a new cancer, requiring additional 
chemotherapy they will be withdrawn from further study directed followup.  In these situations , the 
followup schedules and imaging  become dramatically different from what is directed on this protocol.  
Additionally further systemic chemotherapy  treatments can heavily alter bone density/cortical thickness. 
As such, if patients develop new disease requiring additional systemic chemotherapy  treatment outside 
of their initial SBRT, they will be withdrawn from study for further follow ups/study directed imaging. Any 
data that was collected prior to study withdrawal will still be used in analysis.   Immunotherapy or

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 21 of 56 7.0 Measurement of Effect  
7.1 Cortical Thickness Mapping Approach and Radiation Dose Mapping 
We w
ill utilize our published novel method of cortical thickness mapping as outlined below.   
Ribcage and vertebral cortical thickness mapping will be performed for each patient utilizing the CT 
scan at time of “simulation ” or treatment planning/mapping and routine standard of care follow -up 
imaging at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, which would be performed regardless of inclusion on this study.    
The bony
 anatomy of the thorax will be segmented for each CT scan using automated thresholding 
techniques and manual editing in Mimics (v16.0 Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) for Windows.  Individual 
contours of the entire ribs and vertebral bodies from cervical (C) level C7 through thoracic (T) level T12 
will be constructed in treatment planning software.   
These 
contours will be utilized to construct 3D surfaces containing over 100,000 verti ces throughout the 
bony thorax using Stradwin software (v5.0 Cambridge University, Cambridge, England) for Windows.  
Our uni
que cortical bone mapping algorithm relies on a global cortical density measurement, which is 
factored into a piecewise defined Heaviside step function derived from the convolution of the in- plane 
and out -of-plane point spread functions (PSFs) of each CT scan.  
The g
lobal cortical bone density for each CT scan will be determined by collecting density 
measurements at each vertex.  The CT values along a 12 mm line normal to the cortical surface at 
each of the approximately 50,000 vertices of the 3D rib surfaces will be obtained and applied to the validated Ct.Th estimation model constrained by the cortical density and out -of-plane blur.   
Cortical thickness maps will be constructed using the pre -SBRT planning CT scan and 3 month post -
SBRT follow up CT scan for each treated patient for evaluation of the primary objective.  We will similarly perform this analysis at the 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post SBRT time points for 
evaluation of secondary objectives.  
The r
eceived radiation doses to the surface of the ribcage at each vertex will be obtained in MIM and 
then registered to the corresponding Ct.Th map using iterative closest point  (ICP) registration in 
MATLAB (v2014a, MathWorks, Natick, MA). Each rib will be subdivided into evenly spaced cylindrical subsections (30 subsections per rib) along its centerline using a custom MATLAB algorithm.  
Rib v
ertices from the pre -SBRT CT scans will be spatially aligned with the post -SBRT CT in 3D Slicer 
(v 3.6, http://www.slicer.org) in Windows to define homologous rib subsections on the post -SBRT CT 
scan. A rigid transform consisting of translation and rotation operations will be computed and applied to align the pre - and post - treatment ribcage surfaces. A series of approximately twenty -five points will be 
manually selected on the ribcage surface to derive each transform. An affine transform will then be computed using an iterative closest point  (ICP) algorithm and applied to the transformed ribcage 
surface to account for geometric interscan variation.  The mean dose and Ct.Th for each homologous 
rib region will be calculated from the Ct.Th and dose measurements at all vertices within that region.  
Bone wit
hin the treatment field (within the 50% isodose line) will be segmented into homologous 
regions receiving dose at 10 Gy intervals, of 0 -10 Gy, > 10 – 20Gy, >20 – 30 Gy,  > 30 – 40 Gy,  and 
>40 Gy, and in each region the mean cortical thickness will be calculated.  The % change in corticalthickness will be compared in each region between patients who received risedronate and those who
received placebo.

Patient
s will be assessed at each routine follow up for development and or resolution of any chest wall 
pain/discomfort within the 50% isodose line.   This will be graded per modified CTCAE v.5.   
7.3 Detection of Rib/Vertebral Body fractures 
The i
ncidence of rib and or vertebral fractures within the radiation treatment field within th e 50% 
isodose line will be collected from standard follow -up CT imaging at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post SBRT.  
7.4 Urine Bi
omarkers of Osteoclastic Activity and Bone Turnover 
A sing
le urine sample will be collected at baseline and at each follow up point (3,6,9,12 months).  
Samples will be collected in clinic and immediately transported to the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Willey on 
campus for storage in an minus  80 degrees C freezer designed for lab specimen storage.  Urinary N -
telopeptide (U -NTX) will be measured using ELISA based on an immobilized synthetic peptide with a 
specific sequence of amino acids matching a section of the N telopeptide (NTX)  of type 1 collagen.   
Samples will be destroyed in biohazard waste immediately after analysis is complete.

ical or Clinical Significance:  
Bone reso
rption is a function of osteoclasts.  These cells remove the mineral from bone and break 
down the organic matrix that is primarily comprised of type I collagen.  Collagen is a cross -linked 
fibrous protein that forms the fabric of bone and most other connective tissues. Bone contains three polypeptide chains wound together in a helical structure.  The ends of these chains (known as 
telopeptides) provide the intermolecular cross -linking that gives collagen its strength and resiliency.  As 
these cross -linked domains from bone and other skeletal connective tissues are broken down, the 
pyridinoline cross -linking domains are released and ultimately excreted into the urine in the form of 
small peptides bound to pyridinoline (70%) and free pyridinoline (30%).  One type of peptide- bound 
pyridinoline is the cross -linked N -telopeptide (NTX) which is unique to type I bone collagen.  NTX can 
be used to identify fast losers of bone, to monitor therapy, to measure dose response, or to determine patient compliance with therapeutic prescription(s).

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 23 of 56 A growi
ng body of clinical studies has shown that urinary NTx provides a sensitive marker of human 
bone resorption. Its specificity is based on originating solely from type I collagen, being particularly 
enriched as a cross -linking structure in bone type I  collagen and being produced directly as a 
proteolytic neoepitope by osteoclast activity during bone resorption. Analysis of urine specimens has certain advantages, including ease of collection and reduced biohazard precautions for clinical 
laboratory personnel than with bloodbased specimens. However, the obtained results need to be 
normalized to creatinine.   
Princ
iple of Test Method:  
The N
TX assay is a competitive, enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitative 
measurement of the NTX in human urine. NTX is reported as a normalized ratio to urinary creatinine in order to account for variations in urine flow rate. Therefore NTX and urine creatinine are preferably 
tested from the same aliquot.  
7.5 Evaluable for toxicity:  
All patients will be e valuable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with risedronate, which will 
be given prior to start of SBRT 
8.0 Adverse Events List and Reporting Requirements  
8.1 Adverse Event List for Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) 
Likely risk and side effects  
oFatigue
oRedness of irritation of the skin in the treatment area
oHair loss in the treatment area
oFor tumors near the esophagus, irritation of the esophagus and sore throat/difficulty swallowing
oSome soreness of the ribs with an increased risk of rib fracture
Treatment for such symptoms usually consists of rest, heat, and pain medication.
oDamage to surrounding normal lung and/or collapse of a portion of treated lung
oChanges in the lungs as the tumor shrinks
This includes expected "scarring".
In most patients, no noticeable symptoms will result from this lung damage.
Less likely risk and side effects  
oCough
oDifficulty breathing
Decrease in lung function parameters
Which may result in temporary or permanent need for supplemental oxygen
oIncreased phlegm  production
oFever
oSevere pain or skin damage leading to an open wound
oDamage to the stomach or bowel
This can lead to ulceration or perforation with a risk of infection and death.
oDamage to the spinal cord

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 24 of 56 oDamage to the large blood vessels surrounding the heart
This could cause coughing up of blood and possibly death
oDamage to the heart muscle, which can cause heart attack, heart failure, or death
oDamage to the lining of  the heart, which can cause fluid accumulation around the heart
This may cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and/or irregular or rapid heart beat
o Tumors near vertebrae there is increased risk of vertebral compression fracture
If vertebral fracture is  already present, there is risk of progression of fracture.
oWith any radiation therapy, there may be a very small chance that the radiation could cause a
secondary cancer. The excess cancer risk from the radiation is estimated to be about 3.416%
with at le ast 7 years between the receipt of radiation and the second cancer forming. The
lifetime cancer risk is about 20% assuming several decades of follow -up.
oNo additional scans outside of standard of care will be taken for this study.

dverse Event Characteristics 
•CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in
the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will
be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of
the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the
CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).
•A modified CTCAE 5 chest wall pain grading scale accounting for control with NSAID vsNarcotic , gabapentin, or nerve block  use is included in Appendix K
•We have no mechanistic reason to suspect that concurrent use of risedronate with radiation
will increase pulmonary toxicities and these medications are not contraindicated during
SBRT.  Preliminary review of our own small retrospective database of patients concurrently
receiving SBRT while on bone anti -resorptive therapies has not yielded any excess or un-
expected toxici ty.    However, as there is only limited retrospective data in this setting, we
will plan to assess for excess pulmonary toxicities once 50% of patients have been recruitedand reached the 3 month followup point. If there is > 30% grade 3 or higher pneumonitis, we
will discontinue the study.

8.4 DSM
C SAE Reporting Requirements 
The Dat
a and Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC  
Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix D. DSMC  currently requires that all unexpected 4 and  all 
grade 5 SAEs on these trials be reported to them for review. All WFBCCC C linical Protocol and Data 
Management ( CPDM ) staff members assisting a P rincipal Investigator  in investigating, documenting 
and reporting an SAE qualifying for DSMC  reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of 
the DSMC  as well as the entire committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an 
SAE. 
8.5 WFUHS I
RB AE Reporting Requirements 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others  and adverse events shall be promptly 
reported to the IRB, according to institutional policy. Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the 
funding source, study sponsor, or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, 
biologic or device. Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include psychological, 
economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result of drugs, biological agents, 
devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or 
other interactions with research subjects.  
All 
members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the IRB and other 
applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others.  The Principal 
Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB. The Principal Investigator is also responsible 
for ensuring that all reported unanticipated risks to subjects and others which they receive are reviewed 
to determine whether the report represents a change in the risks and/or benefits to study participants, 
and whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are 
required.  
Any unant
icipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a site where the study has 
been approved by the WFUHS IRB (internal events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
Any unant
icipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site conducting 
the same study that has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (external events) must be reported to the 
WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the event.

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 28 of 56 Double Blind Design 
We will work cooperatively with our IDS pharmacy supplying  each patient either a single tablet of  risedronate 
150 mg or a single tablet of placebo.  We will work directly with IDS pharmacy staff  336-716-3258 , to procure 
identical placebo tablets as well as procedures for un- blinding and drug masking.   As the hospital already has 
an unrelated protocol utilizing 150 mg risedronate vs placebo, many of these procedures are already in place.  
Patients will enroll thou gh CDPM and be randomized through OnCore, but the investigator w ill not have 
knowledge of  the randomization arm  to which any patient has been assigned.  The dispensing pharmacy  will 
provide blinded samples and only the pharmacy will hold keys to un- blindin g.  At the conclusion of the study, 
when all patients have completed 12 months of follow up, the investigators will be unblinded to randomization 
of each patient.   
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
11.1 A
nalysis of Primary Objective 
The percen
t change in  mean cortical thickness  within regions receiving 30 Gy or more will be 
calculated from time of  the treatment planning CT scan to 3 months post SBRT.  This % change 
will be compared between the patients receiving risedronate and those receiving placebo.    
11.2 Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
11.2.1   Percent change in cortical thickness across  all time points 
The percent change in mean cortical thicknesses from baseline will be assessed 
at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post SBRT  separately within 
regions of bone receiving  0 – 10 Gy, >10 – 20 Gy, > 30 – 40 Gy,  and >40Gy .  
These outcomes will be compared using repeated measures analysis of 
variance (ANOVA). 
11.2.
2 Incidence and grade of chest wall pain 
The incidence and grade of chest wall pain occurring inside the 50% isodose line will be collected and reported per modified CTCAE v5.0 (Appendix K) at 3 
months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post SBRT for all patients.  Results 
will be compared between patients receiving placebo or r isedronate.  The 
incidence of G3 or greater chest wall pain will also be correlated with the volume of chest wall receiving at least 30 Gy or greater.  The chest wall contour is 
defined as a 2 cm expansion from lung, from the costovertebral angle to the 
sternum.   
  
11.2.3  Incidence of rib or vertebral fractures 
The incidence of rib or vertebral fractures within the treatment field occurring at 
any time during the entire course of the study (12 months), will be reported and 
compared between patients receiving pl acebo or risedronate.

WFBCCC 99518  
Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 29 of 56 11.2.4  Urinary excretion of N-telopeptide (NTX) 
The concentration of urinary  NTX will be assessed at each time point from 
baseline to the conclusion of the study at 12 months.  Results will be directly 
compared in each group.  
11.3 An
alysis of  Exploratory Objectives 
11.3.1  Rib neurovascular bundles 
We will evaluate the correlation between calculated doses to specific 
substructures in the chest wall and patient -reported pain, stratified by treatment 
group.  
11.3.2  Urinary markers of bone turnover 
We will conduct  repeated measures analyses on urinary markers of bone 
turnover activity (one model per marker) and assess whether there is evidence of 
meaningful group by time interaction in the markers . 
11.3.3  Urinary markers of pain-associated cytokines  
Similar to abo ve, we will conduct repeated measures analyses on urinary makers 
of pain- related biomarkers (cytokines and growth factors) where again we will be 
focused on examining evidence of group by time interaction. 
11.4 Power and Sample Size 
Per analysis of our retrospective human data and preclinical data, we estimate that the mean cortical thickness for both cases and controls pre SBRT will be approximately 1.35 mm.  At 3 
months , in the absence of any treatment,  we estimate approximately 16.7% loss of cortical 
thickn ess to bones  to 1.13 mm (thus resulting in a mean change of 0.22 mm in controls ) within 
the treatment field in regions of bone receiving  ≥ 30 Gy.  Conservatively, if risedronate use limits 
loss of cortical thickness by at least half on a percentage scale  (i.e., expected cortical thickness 
at 3 months in treatment group 8.4% lower, or 1.24 mm , corresponding to an expected mean 
change in treatment group of 0.11 mm), and assuming a standard deviation of delta cortical 
thickness in both treatment and control patients of 0.20 ,4 then with a power of 0.80 and a one-
tailed alpha of 0.05, we anticipate that we will need 42 patients per group to achieve desired 
power to illustrate significantly higher  preservation of cortical thickness at 3 months post SBRT.   
There 
is no human data to accurately estimate how significantly risedronate will limit bone loss 
following SBRT, however in our pre- clinical rodent models, cortical thickness was preserved in 
all mice receiving risedronate and in two mice cortical thickness increased.  We have no 
mechanistic reason to suspect that risedronate would cause increased bone loss and therefore 
are utilizing a one -tailed alpha in our calculations.   
11.5 Estimat
ed Accrual Rate  
On review of treatment planning records for the last 1 month in our department here at the main 
campus of Wake Forest Hospital, we have treated 18 patients who would have qualified for 
inclusion on this study.  This is a reasonable representation of our average treatment 
population.  Conservatively, we estimate accrual of 5 – 10 patients per month.  Roughly 2/3 of 
our SBRT plans unavoidably exceed dosimetric constraints for the ribs/chest wall .

11.7 Interim 
Analysis Plan 
There is no interim analysis of primary or secondary objectives planned for this study.   
Toxicity analysis:  
We have no mechanistic reason to suspect that concurrent use of risedronate with radiation will 
increase pulmonary toxicities, and these medications are not contraindicated during SBRT.  
Preliminary review of our own small retrospective database of patients concurrently receiving 
SBRT while on bone anti -resorptive therapies has not yielded any excess or un -expected 
toxicity.    However, as there is only limited retrospective data in this setting, we will plan to 
assess for excess pulmonary toxicities once 50% of patients have been recruited and reached 
the 3 month followup point. If there is > 30% grade 3 or higher pneumonitis, we will discontinue 
the study.

Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC ) Serious Adverse 
Event  (SAE)  Notification  SOP Date:  02/11/2021  
Mandatory DSMC  SAE Reporting Requirements in WISER  
This document describes reporting requirements of adverse events from WFBCCC 
Investigator Initiated interventional trials to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC ). A trial is considered a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trial if the 
following criteria  are met:  
1)The Principal Investigator (PI) of the trial is a member of a department at the
Wake  Forest University Baptist Medical Center.
2)WFBCCC is considered as the primary contributor to the design, implementationand/or
 monitoring of the trial.
3)The trial is designated as “Interventional” using the Clinical ResearchCategories definitions provided by the NCI in the Data Table 4documentation.(https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/GrantsFunding/DataGuide#dt4
)
There are two distinct types of WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials based 
on where patient enrollment occurs.  These  include:  
1)Local WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials where  all
patients are enrolled from one of the WFBCCC sites. These include the main
outpati
ent Cancer Center clinics (located in Winston -Salem) as well as WFBCCC
affiliate  sites located in Bermuda Run (Davie Medical Center), Clemmons,
Lexington, High Point,  or Wilkesboro.
2)Multi -Center WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials
where  patients are enrolled from other sites in addition to WFBCCC sites.
There are  three  types of trials that are included in this  category:
a.Trials sponsored by the NCI Community Oncology Research Program(NCORP) that are conducted at multiple sites where the PI is a member of a
department  at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.
b.Trials sponsored by Industry that  are conducted at multiple sites and the
PI is a member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist
Medical Center.
c.Trials sponsored by WFBCCC that are conducted at multiple sites and the
PI is a member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist
Medical Center.
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur on any patients

Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC 99518  
Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 39 of 56  enrolled on WFBCCC Investigator Initiated Interventional trials must be entered into the 
WISER  system. The only exception to this requirement is for patients enrolled on NCORP 
trials at  non- WFBCCC sites. AEs and SAEs for NCORP patients enrolled at WFBCCC sites 
must be entered into the WISER system. Once these AEs and SAEs are entered in WISER, 
certain actions must  be taken regarding the reporting of specific Adverse Events to the  
DSMC . 
All Adverse Events that occur during protocol intervention (defined below) and are coded as either 1) unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospitalization > 24 hours 
(regardless of grade) , or grade 5 (death) must be reported to the DSMC  using the using 
the SAE console in  WISER.  
A research nurse or clinical research coordinator when made aware that an adverse  event  
meets one of the above criteria has occurred on a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated  
interventional trial, is responsible for informing a clinical member of the DSMC  by phone 
(or in -person)  about  the adverse event. The nurse/coordinator should contact the treating 
physician prior to calling the DSMC clinical member to obtain all details of  the SAE, as well 
as all associated toxicities to be recorded along with the SAE. In addition, this nurse or 
coordinator is responsible for entering the  adverse  event information into the SAE console 
in WISER.  Once the adverse event has been entered into the SAE console an email 
informing the entire DSMC  will be  generated.  
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any staff member on the study team for  a WFBCCC 
Institutional Interventional trial. Ultimately, the protocol PI has the  primary  responsibility  for AE 
identification,  documentation,  grading  and assignment  of attribution  to the investigational 
agent/intervention. However, when an AE event as described above  is observed, it is the 
responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it  is reported to the  DSMC . 
What is considered during protocol  intervention ? 
During protocol intervention is considered to be the time period while a patient is on  study  
treatment or during the time period within 30 days of last study treatment (even if patient  
begins a new (non -study) treatment during the 30 days). This window of 30 days should be  
the standard window to be used in all protocols unless a specific scientific rationale is 
presented  to suggest that a shorter window can be used to identify  events.  If it is a trial 
sponsored by Industry and the sponsor requires a longer window for monitoring of SAEs, then the longer window of time specified by the sponsor should be followed.  
What is considered as an Unexpected Grade 4  event?  
Any grade 4 even t that was not specifically listed as an expected adverse event in the  
protocol should be considered as unexpected. A grade 4 adverse event can be considered to  
be unexpected if it is an event that would not be expected based on the treatment being  
received  or if it is unexpected based on the health of the patient. In either case, if there is  
any uncertainty about whether a grade 4 adverse event is expected or unexpected it should 
be reported to  DSMC .

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 40 of 56  DSMC  notification responsibilities of the person (e.g., nurse) handling  the reporting/documenting of 
the SAE in  WISER: 
1.Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the
DSMC  according to the schedule as listed below (page if  necessary).
2.Enter  a new SAE  into the SAE  module that is located  in the Subject>> CRA  Console  in
WISER WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. Information can beentered and  saved, but  the DSMC  members will not be notified until a  date  is
entered  into the   DSMC  Notification Date Field. This will ensure that all persons that
need to be made  aware  of the event (i.e., PI, study team members and  DSMC
members) will be  notified; remember to file a copy of the  confirmation.
3.Document that the appropriate person(s) on the DSMC  has been contacted. Indicate
the
 name of the DSMC clinician that was contacted  and the date and time contacted
in the Event Narrative field in the SAE  console  of the particular subject.
4.Document whether or not the protocol should be suspended based on thediscussion  with the DSMC  clinician. This is the major function of the email
notification. Enter  whether the protocol should be suspended in the Event Narrative
Field.
5.Follow up/update the clinical member(s) of DSMC  regarding any new developments
or information  obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 42 of 56  table above on the particular day the SAE is being reported. Allow up to  30 minutes for the 
new DSMC  clinician to respond to a phone call or page before  contac ting the next  member  in 
the table . These times (30 minutes) are a general guideline. Best judgment as a clinical 
research professional should be used giving considerations of the time of day, severity of the 
SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact backup clinicians. If the 
event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate  and 
proceed with submitting the DSMC  notification form. It is important to take reasonable  steps 
and to document that som e type of contact has been initiated to one or more of the  clinical 
members of  DSMC . 
DSMC  CLINICAN  RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the  DSMC  clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events  
as they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and  
the members of DSMC . The review will include but not be limited to the information 
reported; there  may be times when additional information is needed in order for an 
assessment to be  made  and further communi cation directly with the investigator may be 
warranted. DSMC  reserves  the right to disagree with the Investigator's assessment. If DSMC  
does not agree with  the Investigator,  DSMC reserves  the right  to suspend  the trial pending  
further  investigation.  If there  is any immediate danger or harm that could be present for a 
future patient based on the  information  provided  in the DSMC  report  then  an immediate  
suspension  of enrollment should  be considered.  
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS  REPORTS  
If all pertinent information is unavailable with the initial submission, once the additional  
information is available do not submit a new report. Rather, go to the original email that  
was sent to the DSMC  and using that email “reply to all”. Entitle this new email 
“Amendment for (list date of event and patient ID)” this will avoid duplications of the same 
event. List the  additional information being reported. This information needs to be entered 
into WISER as  well. To do this, go to the Subject console and click SAEs on the  left column. 
Click on  the appropriate  SAE number  that needs  updating.  Then  click  Update.  This will allow  
additional     information to be  added.

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 53 of 56  Appendix O – Cortical Thickness Change 
To be completed by the treating physician following completion of all data collection.  
Routine 
CT DICOM images will be stored in PACS imaging system in the electronic medical 
record indefinitely.   Following conclusion of the study, the following information will be assessed 
utilizing  cortical thickness mapping procedures with treatment planning simulation CT images, 
radiation dosimetric plans, and routine follow up CT scans.  The chest wall contour will be 
defined as a 2 cm expansion from the lung parenchyma from the costovertebral angle to the 
sternum . Cortical thickness maps will be created for all CT scans.  For each patient the following 
information will be collected.

Protocol Version Date 02/23/23 Page 55 of 56  Appendix Q – Fracture Incidence  
*Fracture incidence is determined by the treating radiation oncologist utilizing direct ex amination
of the CT images compared side by side with the treatment plan.  The isodose lines can be
easily inspected on the treatment plan utilizing planning software to correlate followup imaging
with the area treated.   If there is any question of the proximity of the fracture to the treated
region, followup images can be fused  together  with the treatment plan images for exact
correlation.   Rib fractures are generally easy to see by direct inspection of the CT images and if
present are also typically commented on in the body of the CT report.    If bone fracture is not
described in the CT report, it can be assessed by the radiation oncologist.

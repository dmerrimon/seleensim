Number of Planned Subject s 
The total number of subjects enrolled in the study will depend upon the number of dose levels of each of the 
components of the study treatment evaluated during Part 1 of the study. In Part 1 of the study, the number of 
subjects to be enrolled in a dose coh ort is 6  DLT evaluable subjects. Therefore, up to approximately 36 evaluable 
subjects may be enrolled in Part 1 if both dose levels of ZW25 are tested in combination with all 3 dose levels of 
palbociclib. In Part 2 of the study, approximately 50 subjects w ill be enrolled. Therefore, a total of up to 
approximately 8 6 subjects may be enrolled across the entire study.  
This study will be conducted in approximately 20 study sites . 
Study Design  
This is a multicenter, Phase 2a, open -label, 2 -part study to investig ate the safety, tolerability, and anti -tumor activity 
of ZW25 in combination with palbociclib (IBRANCE® ), an inhibitor of cyclin -dependent kinases 4 and 6 [CDK4 
and CDK6] plus  fulvestrant (FASLODEX® ), an estrogen receptor antagonist. Premenopausal women and 
perimenopausal  women will also be treated with a luteinizing -hormone releasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogue (also 
known as gonadotropin -releasing hormone analogue) per institutional guidelines.  
For both parts of the study, e ligible subject s are those with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic 
HER2 -positive , HR -positive  breast cancer.  Subject s must have a diagnosis of locally advanced (unresectable) and/or 
metastatic HER2 -positive, HR -positive (ER -positive  and/or P gR-positive ) breast cancer based upon local 
assessment. Eligibility will be determined  based on local (institutional) review of HER2 status, HR status, and 
disease pathology, with subsequent retrospective central review of HER2 status. HER2 expression will be 
determined based on the HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: ASCO/CAP Clinical Practice Guidelines (Wolff  2018 ). 
HR status will be determined based on the ASCO/CAP Guideline Recommendations for Immunohistochemical 
Testing of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors in Breast Cancer (Hammond  2010 ). If the local assessments at a 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 7 of 120 particular site cannot be done with these tests and to these standards, then central assessment will be required before 
a subject  can be enrolled at that site.  
Part 1 of the study will first evaluate the safety and tolerabili ty of ZW25 in combination with palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant and will confirm the recommended doses  of all the drugs in this combination. Then, Part 2 of the study 
will evaluate the anti -tumor activity of the recommended dose  (RD)  level of the combination o f ZW25 with 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant in subject s with HER2 -positive, HR -positive breast cancer . 
The overall study design is presented in Figure 1. Each treatment cy cle of ZW25 combined with palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant is 28 days . Following treatment discontinuation (see Treatment Duration section below), subject s will 
have an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit within 14 days after the last dose of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or  
fulvestrant) and a safety follow -up visit at approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug . Subjects who 
discontinue  all study  treatment on either part of the study for reasons ot her than progressive disease or start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy will continue in follow -up with disease assessments approximately every 8 weeks  
(± 7 days) after the previous scan  until disease progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy . Following 
progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy, disease assessments will be discontinued and subjects will 
enter long -term follow -up for survival status. Data on survival will be collected v ia clinic visits (if feasible) or via 
telephone ca lls every 3 months after the last follow -up visit.  Subjects may be discontinued from the study due to 
death, lost to follow -up, consent withdrawal or study termination by sponsor. Reason for study discontinuation will 
be recorded.

*, Subjects who d iscontinue treatment with all 3 drugs for any reason (except death or withdrawal of consent) on either part of 
the study will have an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit within 14 days after the last dose of study drug and safety follow -up visit at 
approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug .  
**, Subjects who discontinue all study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease or start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy will continue in follow -up with disease assessments approximately every 8 week s after the previous scan until disease 
progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy .

enter long -term follow -up for su rvival status. Data on survival will be collected approximately every 3 months  after the last 
follow -up visit . 
Part 1: Safety Evaluation  
The primary objective of Part 1 is to characterize the safety and tolerability of ZW25 in combination  with palbociclib  
plus fulvestrant and to confirm the recommended doses  for all the drugs in  this combination.  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 8 of 120 On Days 1 and 15, ZW25 will be administered first followed by palbociclib and fulvestrant.  
ZW25 will be administered intravenously (IV) at the initial dose of 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), which is the 
single -agent RD. Palbociclib will be administered orally (PO) with food at 125 mg once daily (QD) for the first 
21 days of each 28-day cycle. Ful vestrant will be administered as an intramuscular (IM) injection at 500  mg Q2W 
for the first 3 doses, then once every 4  weeks (Q4W). A step-down dose level of ZW25 (e.g.,  15 mg/kg Q2W  or 
other dose not lower than 1 5 mg/kg Q2W ) and/or palbociclib (e.g., 100  mg PO and/or 75  mg PO QD) may be 
allowed if recommended by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). Subject s will also receive LHRH analogue 
treatment per institutional guidelines. The DLT -evaluation period will be the initial 28 days of treatment beginning  
Cycle  1 Day  1. 
Initially, up to 6  evaluable subject s will be assessed at the ZW25 monotherapy recommended dose of 20 mg/kg 
Q2W in combination with palbociclib plus fulvestrant. A  DLT  evaluable subject  is defined as one who has received 
75% of the planned  total dose of each component of study treatment (ZW25, palbociclib, and fulvestrant)  over the 
first 28 days of treatment , and was followed for the full DLT evaluation per iod, unless the reason for not receiving 
required doses or not being followed was the occurrence of DLT . If DLT s are observed in 2 subject s, the SMC 
may recommend a  step-down dose  of ZW25  of 15 mg/kg  Q2W  or other dose not lower than 1 5 mg/kg Q2W  for 
evaluat ion in up to 6  additional  DLT  evaluable subject s. Additionally,  the SMC may recommend evaluation of 
step-down  doses  of palbociclib of 100  mg PO QD and/or 75  mg PO QD with or without recommending evaluation 
of a step -down dose of ZW25. There is no step -down dose for fulvestrant at a cohort or study population level; 
however, individual subject s who develop moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class B) while on study 
treatment will have their fulvestrant dose reduced to 250 mg. Intermediate dose levels may also be recommended by 
the SMC. The SMC may recommend step -down doses for 1 or more of the drugs in the combination at any time  
based on the overall safety profile . The SMC may decide if more than 6 subject s may be enrolled in a given dose 
level to better characterize the safety profile for a particular dose level . 
Prior to dosing with ZW25, all subject s must  receive prophylactic treatment for infusion reactions. Additional 
premedications may be recommended for palbociclib, and  fulvestrant per institutional guidelines and/or local 
prescribing information.  
The study wi ll advance to Part 2 based on SMC recommendation. Additional safety experiences in later cycles may 
be considered when confirming the recommended doses of all drugs  in this combination.  
Part 2: Anti -tumor Activity Evaluation  
The primary objective of Part 2  of the study is to evaluate the potential anti -tumor activity of the recommended dose 
level of the combination of ZW25 with palbociclib plus fulvestrant . Enrollment for Part  2 will begin once the RD of 
ZW25 and the other drugs  of the combination therapy h ave been confirmed in Part  1. The treatment and blood 
collection schedules, treatment cycle duration and imaging evaluation intervals are the same as in Part 1.  
Part 2 of the study will evaluate the preliminary anti -tumor activity  using the  modified intent  to treat  (mITT) set. 
The mITT set includes all subjects who receive any amount  of ZW25 with palbociclib and/or fulvestrant who had at 
least one identifiable (target and/or non -target) lesion at baseline and at least one post -baseline disease assessment or 
discontinued all study treatment and are no longer being followed for efficacy . All subjects will be assessed for 
safety and anti -tumor response. The primary efficacy endpoint will be PFS6 (defined as the % of mITT subject s with 
PFS of  24 weeks); secondary efficacy endpoints include ORR, DOR, DCR,  PFS, and OS . Approximately 50 
subjects are  expected to be enrolled  in Part 2.  
If possible, an additional optional tumor biopsy may be obtained at the time of disease progression from an 
accessible site to allow for assessment of changes in HER2 expression as well as the presence of other exploratory 
biomarkers. Biomarkers of response may be evaluated.

Subject s may continue on study treatment until radiographically -confirmed disease progression as defined by 
RECIST version 1.1, clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician decision, 
pregnancy, protocol violation, start of a subsequent anticancer th erapy, or study termination by the sponsor.  
Note: Trastuzumab, alternate CDK4/6 inhibitors, or any other treatment not part of the study regimen will be 
considered subsequent anticancer therapy. Palliative radiotherapy to a non -target bone lesion that is not progressing 
is allowed after the second cycle of treatment and must be administered after the initial response assessment 
obtained per protocol. This will not be considered subsequent anticancer therapy but must not interfere with the 
assessment of tum or target lesions. Treatment with palbociclib should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy . 
Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 10 of 120 Clinical progression is defined as worsening or re -emergence of pre -existing symptoms relating to underlying 
cancers, or emergence of new symptoms that cann ot be attributed to drug toxicities or alternative causes.  Every 
effort should be made to confirm disease progression radiographically.  
If any component(s) of the combination therapy is discontinued due to toxicity deemed related to the component(s), 
subje cts on either part of the study may continue to receive the other component(s) of the study regimen until 
disease progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy. Subjects who discontinue treatment with all 3 drugs 
for any reason (except death or wit hdrawal of consent) on either part of the study will have an end -of-treatment 
(EOT) visit within 14 days after the last dose of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) and safety 
follow -up visit at approximately 30 days after the last dose of st udy drug.  
Safety  Assessments  
Subject s’ safety will be monitored at predetermined time points by recording the type, frequency, and severity of 
AEs graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI  CTCAE) 
version  5.0 (27 November 2017), including adverse event s of special interest  (AESIs) , SAEs and deaths, clinical 
laboratory values (including hematology  and serum chemistry), physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, 
heart rate, respiratory rate, and temp erature), body weight, and ECOG performance status. Cardiac function will be 
monitored via 12 -lead ECG and echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition scan  (MUGA) . AEs will be collected 
from the start of dosing of any study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1  through 3 0 days after last dose of study drug (ZW25, 
palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) . Study protocol -related AEs are to be collected from the time of informed consent. 
All investigators should follow up subject s with SAEs until the event returns to baseline, the e vent stabilizes 
(recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator, or the subject  dies or 
withdraws consent . Treatment -emergent AESIs should continue to be followed until resolution or return to baseline 
and inclu de absolute decreases in LVEF  10 percentage points from baseline , symptomatic heart failure, infusion -
related reactions , and all  Grade 2 events of pneumonitis and/or interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary 
fibrosis . 
Safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study by the SMC, consisting of the study investigators 
and the sponsor responsible medical expert and biostatistician. The committee is tasked with monitoring the safety 
of participants in this stu dy through regular or ad hoc meetings. The roles, responsibilities and functioning of the 
SMC are described in more details in the SMC charter .  
Efficacy Assessments  
In both Parts 1 and 2 of the study, computed tomography (CT) and/or MRI scans will be performed at baseline and 
every 8 weeks during treatment (timed from Cycle 1 Day 1) and will be assessed according to the revised RECIST 
guideline version 1.1. Initial responses should be confirmed , if feasible,  with a repeat scan  4 weeks (+1-week 
window) following initial documentation of objective response. The schedule of response assessments should not be 
adjusted after the confirmatory scan and should maintain the schedule of every 8 weeks timed from Cycle 1 Day 1 . 
Determination of the radiographic res taging modality (CT and/or MRI) will be made at baseline for each subject  by 
the investigator and should be used for all subsequent response assessments.   
Pharmacokinetic (PK)  and Immunogenicity Assessments  
Serum concentrations of ZW25 will be measured as a function of time post -dosing. PK parameters to be estimated 
include the following: 1) for single (first) dose: maximum observed serum concentration (C max,1), time to maximum 
observed serum concentration (t max,1), area under the serum concentration -time c urve from zero to the last measurable  
concentration (AUC 0-t), terminal elimination rate constant (λ z), apparent elimination half -life (t 1/2), area under the 
serum concentration -time curve from zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), serum clearance (CL), volume of dist ribution in the 
terminal elimination phase (Vd), etc.; and 2) for multiple doses: average concentration over dosing interval (C ave), 
maximum observed serum concentration (C max) and minimum observed serum concentration (C min) (trough), 
accumulation index (R Cmin), trough concentration at steady state (C trough, ss), and attainment of steady state. All subject s 
in Part 1 of the study will have PK assessments per the extensive PK schedule. In Part 2, at least 6  subject s will have 
PK assessments per the extensive PK schedule. Further subject s will then be assigned to the sparse PK schedule. A 
subject  may be allowed to opt out of an extensive PK schedule with sponsor approval.  
Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 11 of 120 Anti-drug antibodies  to ZW25 will be measured, including frequency, time of onset, and duration of 
immunogenicity response. Additionally, subject s with demonstrated ADA may be evaluated for possible 
neutralizing antibodies.  
Biomarker Assessments  
Blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected at the specified timepoints for assessment of biomarkers. Biomarkers  
may include but are not limited to ctDNA, ProSigna  (formerly called the PAM50 test) , and HER2 ECD. Biomarkers 
will be investigated as an exploratory endpoint and will no t be used to guide subject  selection for the study.  
Statistical Methods  
Summaries of subject  disposition, demographics, disease characteristics, safety, disease response, and exposure will 
be provided. Safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized using  descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical 
variables. In addition, the PK parameters of ZW25 will be estimated and summarized with descriptive  statistics.  
Sample Size Determination  
No formal sample size calculations were performed for Part 1 of the study. In Part 1, approximately 6 evaluable 
subject s will be enrolled in each dose cohort with up to six ZW25 and palbociclib dose level combination s evaluated;  
therefore, the approximate minimum and maximum sample sizes for Part 1 are 6 and 36 evaluable subject s, respectively.   
Details regarding sample size are presented in Table  1.

a RD established in Part 1  
b Part 1 sample size s are based on the number of DLT evaluable  subjects . Part 2 sample size is based on the approximate 
number of subjects planned for  enrollment.  
Notes: Cohorts 1A through 1F are not necessarily sequential. ZW25 is given IV Q2W. Step -down dose level to 15  mg/kg Q2W 
or another dose level (not lower than 15 mg/kg) of ZW25 may be evaluated if recommended by the SMC and approved by the 
spon sor. Palbociclib is taken PO QD on Days 1 through 21 of each 28 -day cycle. There are no step -down doses for toxicity for 
fulvestrant.  
A patient will be considered DLT evaluable if he or she has received  75% of the planned  total dose of each 
component of study treatment (ZW25, palbociclib, and fulvestrant) over the first 28 days of treatment , and was 
followed for the full DLT evaluation period,  unless the reason for not receiving required doses  or not being followed  
was the occur rence of a DLT.  If the reason for not receiving the required  doses is a DLT, a patient will still be 
considered evaluable. Subject s who are considered non -evaluable may be replaced. The probabilities of observing 
DLTs in a cohort of 6 subject s for Part 1 are summarized in Table 2.

1.1  Breast Cancer  
Breast cancer presents a significant health burden worldwide. Globally, in 2020, over 2 million new  
cases were reported with over 650,000 deaths (GLOBOCAN 20 20). The lifetime incidence rate of 
female invasive breast cancer in the United States (US) is approximately 13% (one in eight women),  
and it is estimated that over 297,790 new cases of invasive  breast cancer will be diagnosed in 
2023 in women. The 5 - and 10 -year relative survival rates for women with invasive breast cancer 
in the US are 90% and 83%, respectively. However, 5 -year relative survival rates drop to 30% 
when metastases are present (American  Cancer  Society  2023). The estimated number of breast 
cancer cases in both sexes and all ages in the E uropean Union (E U) (27 countries) for 2022 is 
355,457  with an estimated mortality of 91,826 cases 
(European  Cancer  Information  System  (ECIS) 20 23). 
1.2  HER2  as a Target in Breast Cancer  
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) is a member of the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family comprising 4  structurally related receptors: HER1 (EGFR), HER2, 
HER3, and HER4. HER receptors are normally activated by binding to specific ligands, resulting 
in a conformational change that allows formation of receptor homodimers and heterodimers. 
Receptor dimerization triggers autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues and activation 
of intracellular signaling pathways (Moasser  2007 ). HER2 is unique among HER family members  
in that it has no known ligand and maintains a dimerization -ready conformation. HER2 is the 
preferred dimerization partner for other HER family m embers. HER2 -containing heterodimers, 
particularly HER2/HER3, deliver the most potent growth signals (Pohlmann  2009 ). 
The oncogenic role of HER2 is best defined  for breast cancers with HER2 gene amplification and  
high levels of HER2 protein expression, which historically have been associated with aggressive 
tumor growth and poor clinical outcomes. However, because HER2 is the preferred dimerization 
partner for al l other HER family receptors and can interact synergistically with other receptor 
tyrosine kinase cell growth pathways (Moasser  2007 ), HER2 -targeted therapy may be important 
even in the absence of gene amplification and/or in the setting of lower levels of expression.  
Approximately 15% of patients with breast cancer have tumors that overexpress th e HER2 protein,  
and these patients can benefit from HER2 -targeted therapies. Approximately half of all HER2 -
positive breast cancers are also hormone receptor (HR) positive (Giordano  2014 ). Identification 
of receptor expression offers options for individualized targeted therapies (Schramm  2015 ). 
1.3 Approved HER2 -Targeted Therapies  
The introduction of HER2 -targeted therapy into the clinic has led to marked improvements in 
disease -free survival, progression -free survival  (PFS) , and overall survival  (OS)  for patients with 
HER2 -high breast canc er (Schramm  2015 ). In the US, there are multiple  approved HER2 -
targeted agents, all of which are in dicated for the treatment of HER2 -high breast cancer. These 
include the antibody -based therapies trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN® ) and pertuzumab 
(PERJETA® ), the antibody -drug conjugate s (ADC s) ado-trastuzumab emtansine  (KADCYLA® ; 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 20 of 120 also referred to as T -DM1)  and fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki (ENHERTU®; also referred to 
as T-DXd ) (ENHERTU®); oral small molecule dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatin ib 
(TYKERB®); the irreversible oral small molecule EGFR/HER2/HER 4 inhibitor neratinib 
(NERLYNX®); and tucatinib  (Tukysa™ ), a kinase inhibitor indicated in combination with 
trastuzumab and capecitabine.  
Despite the gains obtained with current HER2 -directed therapy, an unmet medical need remains 
for patients with all HER2 -expressing cancers, particularly recurrent or metastatic disease that 
has progressed after standard of care therapy. This includes patients with HER2 -overexpressing 
breast cancer  that may have primary or secondary resistance to current HER2 -targeted treatments.  
Resistance may be due to a number of factors including increased heterodimerization with other 
EGFR/ErbB family members as well as heterogeneity in levels of HER2 expression (Rye  2018 ). 
HER2 expression levels can vary within a tumor and/or  be discordant between the site of primary  
and metastatic disease. Increased heterogeneity and/or decreased levels of HER2 expression may 
be particularly imp ortant in development of resistance to T -DM1, which relies on receptor binding  
and internalization for its cytotoxic effect (Barok  2014 ). In addition to a need for new targeted 
HER2 therapy that can overcome resistant disease, there is a need to develop less toxic  treatment 
regimens that may help select patients avoid the use of chemotherapy, particularly in the 
adjuvant setting.  
In summary, despite new therapeutic options, HER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer still 
remains an incurable disease (Barok  2014 ). 
1.4 ZW25  
ZW25 is a novel humanized, bispecific antibody directed against 2 distinct HER2 epitopes, 
extracellular domains 2 and 4 ( ECD 2 and ECD 4), the epitopes bound by pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab , respectively. Therefore, ZW25 combines both pertuzumab - and trastuzum ab-like 
activities in a single antibody. ZW25 has the potential to have greater activity than either 
pertuzumab or trastuzumab in both HER2 overexpressing and HER2 lower expressing tumors. 
The sponsor  is developing ZW25 as a treatment for locally advanced (unresectable) and/or 
metastatic HER2 -expressing cancers.  
Pharmacology studies demonstrate that ZW25 binds HER2 with subnanomolar affinity leading to  
enhanced tumor cell binding and inhibition of  growth factor induced tumor cell growth (likely by 
blocking HER2 heterodimerization with other EGFR/ErbB family members). ZW25 -induced 
cross -linking of HER2 also results in HER2 clustering and likely enhanced receptor internalization  
and downregulation as well as antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ). In vivo studies 
in nude mice demonstrate anti -tumor activity and/or improved host survival against xenografts of 
human breast, head and neck squamous cell (HNSCC), non -small cell lung (NSCLC), pancreatic, 
gastric, and ovarian cancers.  
ZW25 has been evaluated in a comprehensive toxicology program (non -Good Laboratory 
Practice [GLP] and GLP studies) for intravenous (IV) administration in clinical trials. The 
toxicology program was carried out in cynomolgus macaque monkeys  because ZW25 b inds to 
both human and mon key HER2 with similar subnanomolar affinity but does not bind to rodent 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 21 of 120 HER2. Safety pharmacology, including an assessment of its effect on cardiovascular and 
respiratory function , was conducted as part of the GLP toxicology study as outlined in Internatio nal 
Congress on Harmonisation (ICH) S91. ZW25 showed no effect on safety  pharmacology 
parameters. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrate d that ZW25 ha s a similar effect on human 
cardiomyocyte viability as trastuzumab (both alone and in combination with an anthracycline ). 
In non -GLP pharmacokinetic (PK) and GLP TK studies, ZW25 serum exposure increased with 
dose (5 mg/kg through 150 mg/kg  IV) in cynomolgus monkeys. ZW25 wa s mostly distributed to 
the serum compartment and was cleared slowly from the serum. Mean half -life of ZW25 after 
either a single dose or repeat doses ranged from 74.3 to 215 hours (2.73  to 8.95 days) and was 
similar to the reported half -life (3 to 14 days ) of trastuzumab from repeat -dose studies in rhesus 
and cynomolgus monkeys (EMEA  2005 ). Cohorts from all dosing levels of the GLP toxicology 
study of ZW25 were screened for antidrug antibodies ( ADA ). Only 2 of the 292 samples tested 
were  confirmed positive; however, the majority of ZW25 -treated animals had serum 
concentrations that exceeded the specific drug tolerance level of the assay. Thus, ADA may be 
present but undetectable due to high drug concentrations.  
The GLP toxicology study evaluated the toxicity and toxicokinetics ( TK) of weekly ZW25 at 
doses of 5, 50 , and 150 mg/kg for 8 and 13 weeks. ZW25 was well tolerated and no adverse 
effects were observed at weekly doses up to  150 mg/kg IV for up to 13 weeks.  
The nonclinical program supported evaluation of ZW25 as an IV infusion in the clinic. 
Therefore, a first -in-human clinical study was initiated  in Sep tember  2016 . This ongoing , 
multi -part, Phase 1 study (ZWI -ZW25 -101) is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinet ics (PK) , 
immunogenicity, and anti -tumor activity of ZW25 as a single agent and in combination with 
selected chemotherapy agents in subject s with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic 
HER2 -expressing tumors.  
Part 1 of Study  ZWI -ZW25 -101 is usin g a standard 3+3 dose -escalation design to determine the 
maximum -tolerated dose (MTD), optimal biological dose, or recommended dose (RD) of ZW25 
monotherapy administered weekly ( QW), every 2 weeks (Q2W) , or every 3 weeks (Q3W)  in 
subject s with any HER2 -expressing cancer that had progressed after receipt of all therapies 
known to confer clinical benefit. Part 2 of the study is characterizing the safety, tolerability, and 
preliminary anti -tumor activity of ZW25 monotherapy administered at Part 1 RD s in subjec ts 
with selected HER2 -expressing locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic cancers in up 
to 5 disease specific cohorts including HER2 -high breast cancer ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC] 
3+ or IHC 2+/ fluorescent in situ hybridization [ FISH ]+), HER2 -intermediate breast cancer 
(IHC  2+/FISH -negative [FISH -]), HER2 -high gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma ( GEA ), HER2 -
intermediate GEA, and other HER2 -high cancers. One recommended ZW25 monotherapy  dose 
identified for further study was 20 mg/kg Q2W. Part 3 of the st udy is evaluating the safety, 
tolerability , and preliminary anti -tumor activity of ZW25 administered in combination with

A detailed summary of the safety and efficacy results of ZW25 as monotherapy or in 
combination with chemotherapy from Study ZWI -ZW25 -101 is included in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
A Phase 2 study (ZWI -ZW25 -201) of ZW25 plus physician’s choice of first-line combination 
chemotherapy in HER2 -expressing GEA is underway. However, no results are available at this 
time.  
This study (ZWI -ZW25 -202) is a multicenter, Phase 2a, open -label, 2 -part study to investigate 
the safety, tolerability, and anti -tumor a ctivity of ZW25 in combination with palbociclib 
(IBRANCE®), an inhibitor of cyclin -dependent kinases 4 and 6 [CDK4 and CDK6] plus 
fulvestrant (FASLODEX®), an estrogen receptor [ER] antagonist) in subject s with locally 
advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic HER2 -positive , HR -positive  breast cancer that has 
progressed on or been refractory to prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T -DM1.  
The primary objective of Part 1 is to characterize the safety and tolerability of ZW25 at a 
monotherapy RD derived from  Phase 1 Study ZWI -ZW25 -201 (20 mg/kg Q2W) when 
administered with palbociclib (125 mg PO QD for the first 21 days of each 4 -week cycle) plus 
fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly [ IM] Q2W for the first 3 doses, then Q4W  thereafter ) and to 
confirm the RD of ZW25 in combination  with palbociclib plus fulvestrant . Part 2 of the study 
will evaluate the anti -tumor activity of the recommended dose level of the combination of ZW25 
with palbociclib plus fulvestrant in this population ( subject s with HER2 -positive , HR-positive  
breast cance r). 
The clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and all the applicable 
regulatory requirements. A complete summary of the clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the 
investigational product and its study in humans is provide d in the  Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.5 Palbociclib  
Palbociclib is an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK 6. Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of 
signaling pathways which lead to cellular proliferation. In vitro, palbociclib reduced cellular 
proliferation of ER -positive breast cancer cell lines by blocking progression of the cell from G1 
into S phase of the cell cycle. Palbociclib is approved for the treatment of HR -positive, HER2 -
negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant in patients  with 
disease progression following endocrine therapy. The recommended dose of palbociclib is a 125 
mg capsule taken orally (PO) with food once daily (QD) for 21 consecutive days followed by 7  
days off treatment during a 28 -day treatment cycle  . The addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor to 
endocrine therapy has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, with delayed onset of tumor 
progression. The combination of endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor is now included in 
the treatment guidelines for advanced HR -positive breast cancer and is being widely prescribed . 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 23 of 120 1.6 Fulvestrant  
Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist that binds to the ER in a competitive manner with affinity 
comparable to that of estradiol and downregulates the ER protein in human breast cancer cells. 
Fulvestrant is approve d for the treatment of HR -positive, HER2 -negative advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in combination with palbociclib in patients  with disease progression after endocrine 
therapy. The recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg to be administered IM into th e buttocks 
(gluteal area) slowly (1  to 2 minutes per injection) as two 5 -mL injections, one in each buttock, 
on Days 1, 15, and 29 and once monthly thereafter (FASLODEX®). 
1.7 Rationale for Treatment with ZW25, Palbociclib and Fulvestrant in Breast 
Cancer  
In HER2 -positive breast cancer, cyclin D1 and its partner kinase CDK4 are critical drivers of cell 
proliferation. It has been demonstrated that the cyclin D1 -CDK4 pathway can mediate resistance 
to HER2 -targeting therapies in vitro and in vivo and that targ eting resistant tumor cells with 
CDK4/6 inhibitors re -sensitizes them to anti -HER2 therapy and delays tumor recurrence in 
HER2 -driven breast cancers in vivo in patient -derived xenograft tumors (Goel  2016 ). 
CKD4/6 inhibition combined with anti -HER2 therapy is currently being explored in Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 trials in subject s with HER2 -positive /HR-positive  breast cancer (Corona  2017 ), 
(Pernas  2018 ). PATRICIA is an ongoing open -label Phase 2 trial e xploring the safety and 
efficacy of the combination of trastuzumab plus palbociclib ± letrozole in subject s with pre -
treated (2  to 4 prior lines) HER2 -positive  metastatic breast cancer. Preliminary results from 45 
subject s show that palbociclib in combinat ion is safe and may be effective  in HER2 -positive  
breast cancer, especially with HR -positive  disease (Ciruelos  2018 ). 
Developing a single multifunctional antibody with improved capacity and efficiency for binding 
HER2 compared with available HER2 inhibitors and the ability to  activate ADCC, block ligand 
induced heterodimerization of HER2 with other EGFR/ErbB receptors, and down -regulate HER2 
may be the key to creating effective HER2 -targeted therapies for HER2 -expressing tumors. 
Because ZW25 has potential for greater activity than either trastuzumab or pertuzumab, 
combining ZW25 with palbociclib and fulvestrant may offer an advantage over the combinations 
of palbociclib and other anti -HER2 therapy in the other currently  ongoing clinical trials.  
Based upon the activity of ZW25 a s a single agent, as well as the safety profile observed to date, 
ZW25 has the potential to provide clinical benefit to patients with advanced breast cancer. This 
study (ZWI -ZW25 -202) will evaluate the safety and preliminary anti -tumor activity of ZW25 in 
combin ation  with palbociclib plus fulvestrant in the treatment of subject s with advanced 
HER2 -positive /HR-positive  breast cancer that has progressed on or been refractory to prior 
treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T -DM1. Premenopausal women and p erimenopausal  
women will also be treated with a  luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogue 
(also known as gonadotropin -releasing hormone analogue) per institutional guidelines.

ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 24 of 120 1.8 Potential Safety Risk  
ZW25 is being developed as a potential new treatment for patients with locally advanced 
(unresectable) and/or metastatic HER2 -expressing cancers. Potential risks to subject s are based 
upon findings from the preliminary clinical trial data, non -GLP and GLP toxicology studies, and 
toxicities associated with drugs of similar mechanisms of action, including trastuzumab, 
pertuzumab, T -DM1, other HER2 inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies in general.  
For a summary of the clinical and nonclinical ZW25 safety data to date, please refer to the  
Investigator’s Brochure . For additional information regarding detailed safety risks associated  
with palbociclib and fulvestrant, please refer to the country specific  prescribing information.  
In addition to the potential toxicit ies described below, other adverse events ( AEs), including 
life-threatening or fatal events, may occur.  
The safety of palbociclib (125 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) versus placebo plus fulvestrant 
was evaluated in the PALOMA -3 study  (McShane  2018 ). The data described below reflect 
exposure to palbociclib in 345 out of 517 subject s with HR -positive, HER2 -negative advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of palbociclib plus fulvestrant. The median 
duration of treatment for palbociclib plus fulvestrant was 10.8 months. Dose reductions due to an 
AE of any grad e occurred in 36% of subject s receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant. No dose 
reduction was allowed for fulvestrant. Permanent discontinuation associated with an AE occurred  
in 19  (6%)  of 345 subject s receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant and in 6 (3%) of 172 subject s 
receiving pl acebo plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation fo r subject s 
receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant included fatigue (0.6%), infections (0.6%), and 
thrombocytopenia (0.6%). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) of any grade reported in 
subject s in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, 
leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anemia, stomatitis, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting,  
alopecia, rash, decreased appetite, and pyrexia (IBRANCE®). Rare cases of s evere interstitial 
lung disease/non -infectious pneumonitis, including fatal events, ha ve been reported  in subject s 
treated with palbociclib  (Ahsan  2017 ), (Ahsan  2017 ), (IBRANCE ®), and (Levy  2019 ). 
Subject s in the current study ZWI -ZW25 -202 will be monitored for potential pulmonary toxicity 
by routine AE surveillance. Subject s who develop  new or worsening respiratory signs or 
symptoms ( e.g., cough , dyspnea , hypoxia,  or interstitial infiltrate) will have further palbociclib 
dosing immediately  put on  hold and will be urgently evaluated for interstitial lung disease/non -
infectious pneumonitis.  
The oxidative metabolism of palbociclib is primarily mediated by cytochrome P -450 (CYP) . 
Therefore, a num ber of medications and foods, including grapefruit products, may interact with 
palbociclib (McShane  2018 ). Additional information about prohibited concomitant medications 
and drug -drug intera ctions is included in Section  5.3.6  and Section  5.3.7 . 
Recommended dose modifications are p rovided in Section  5.3.3 . 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 25 of 120 1.8.1  Cardiotoxicity  
Although no cardiac toxicities were observed in the GLP toxicology study, oth er HER2 inhibitors  
have been associated with decreases in LVEF , particularly when given in combination with 
anthracyclines. Therefore, only subject s who have baseline normal LVEF  and no history of 
significant cardiac disease will be eligible for treatment with ZW25. Subject s with a lifetime 
cumulative dose of anthracycline >3 60 mg/m2 or who have received anthracycline treatment 
within 90 days of the expected first dose of ZW25 are  not eligible for treatment.  
Subject s in the current study ZWI -ZW25 -202 will be  monitored per protocol for changes in 
cardiac function. Cardiac monitoring will include 12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECG s) and 
echocardiogram/multiple gated acquisition scan (MU GA) for estimation of LVEF . 
1.8.2  Gastrointestinal Toxicity  
Diarrhea has been recognized with other anti -HER2 antibodies. Per the Investigator’s Brochure, 
diarrhea has been commonly observed  when ZW25  is given as monotherapy.     
As noted above, in the palbocic lib plus fulvestrant arm in the PALOMA -3 study, gastrointestinal  
AEs occurring in ≥10% of subject s of any grade included nausea (34%), stomatitis 28%), 
diarrhea (24%), and vomiting (19%). None of these gastrointestinal events were Grade 4 in 
severity ; and, in 1% of subject s, stomatitis and vomiting were recorded as a Grade 3 event 
(IBRANCE®). 
Subject s in the current study ZWI -ZW25 -202 will be monitored for potential gastrointestinal 
toxicity by routine AE surveillance. If gastrointestinal toxicity develops during the study, 
prophylactic or symptomatic treatment may be considered.  
1.8.3  Hematologic Toxicity  
Management of hematologic toxicities includes collection of samples for hematology tests at 
regular intervals per the protocol. Subject s with evidence of hematologic complications should 
receive prompt treatment and supportive care.  
No hematologic effects were observed in toxicology studies for ZW25 . Per the Investigator’s  
Brochure, anemia has been commonly reported when ZW25  is given as monotherapy. 
Neutropenia, the most common any -grade and Grade 3 or higher AE associated with palbociclib, 
is consistent with the drug’s mechanism of action and can be effectively managed wi th dose 
interruption, dose reduction, or dose delay (McShane  2018 ). A Grade ≥3 decrease in neutrophil 
counts was reported in 66% of subject s receiving palbociclib  plus fulvestrant in PALOMA -3. 
The median time to first episode of any grade neutropenia was 15  days and the median duration 
of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 7 days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of subject s 
exposed to palbociclib  across PALOMA -2 (palbociclib plus letrozole ) and PALOMA -3. One 
death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA -2. The most frequently reported 
Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in subject s receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant in PALOMA -3 
in order of descending  frequency were neutropenia and leukopenia (IBRANCE®). 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 26 of 120 In addition, because fulvestrant is administered IM, it should be used with caution in subject s 
with bleeding diathesis,  thrombocytopenia and anticoagulant use.  
1.8.4  Infusion -related Reactions  
While ZW25 is a fully humanized antibody , infusion reactions may occur. Infusion reactions 
consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills and may include nausea, vomiting,  
pain, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, and asthenia. Severe and potentially fatal 
reactions may include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension.  
Infusion reactions may occur during or immediately following the  initial infusion or at a later 
time point. While severe reactions usually occur during or immediate ly after infusion, onset and 
clinical course can be variable.  
Per the Investigator’s Brochure, infusion related reaction has been commonly reported when 
ZW25  is given as monotherapy.   
A description of safety data is presented separately in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
Prophylaxis for and management of ZW25 -related infusion reactions are provided in 
Section  5.2.7.1  and Section  5.2.3.2 , respectively.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a multicenter, Phase 2a, open -label, 2 -part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and 
anti-tumor activity of ZW25 in combination with palbociclib (IBRANCE®), an inhibitor of 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 29 of 120 CDK4 and CDK6 ) plus fulvestrant (FASLODEX®), an ER antagonist). Premenopausal women 
and perimenopausal women will also be treated with  a LHRH analogue (also known as 
gonadotropin -releasing hormone analogue) per institutional guidelines. Eligible subject s include 
those with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic HER2 -positive , HR-positive  breast cancer.  
For both parts of the study,  subject s must have a diagnosis of locally advanced (unresectable) 
and/or metastatic HER2 -positive , HR -positive  (ER-positive  and/or progesterone receptor -
positive [ PgR-positive ]) breast cancer. Eligibility will be determined based on local 
(institutional) review of HER2 status, HR status, and disease pathology, with subsequent 
retrospective central review  for HER2 status . HER2 expression will be determined based on the 
HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of 
American Pathologists (CAP) Clinical Practice Guidelines (Wolff  2018 ). Hormone receptor  
status will be determined based on the ASCO/CAP Guideline Recommendations for 
Immunohistochemical Testing of Estrogen and Progesterone Rec eptors in Breast Cancer 
(Hammond  2010 ). If the  local assessments at a particular site cannot be done with these tests 
and to these standards, then central assessment will be required before a subject  can be enrolled . 
Part 1 of the study will first evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW25 in combin ation with 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant and will confirm the recommended doses  of ZW25 , palbociclib, and 
fulvestrant when given in combination . Then, Part 2 of the study will evaluate the anti -tumor 
activity of the recommended dose level of the combination  of ZW25 with palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant  in subject s with HER2 -positive , HR -positive  breast cancer.  
The overall study design is presented in Figure 2. Each treatment cycle of ZW25 combined with 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant is 28 days . If any component(s) of the combination therapy is 
discontinued due to toxicity deemed related to the compo nent(s), subjects on either part of the 
study may continue to receive the other component(s) of the study regimen until disease 
progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy . (Note: trastuzumab, alternate CDK4/6 
inhibitors, or any other treatment n ot part of the study regimen will be considered subsequent 
anticancer therapy. Palliative radiotherapy to a non -target bone lesion that is not progressing is 
allowed after the second cycle of treatment and must be administered after the initial response 
assessment obtained per protocol. This will not be considered subsequent anticancer therapy but 
must not interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions. Treatment with palbociclib should 
be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy ). Subjects who dis continue treatment with all 3 
drugs for any reason (except death or withdrawal of consent) on either part of the study will have 
an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit within 14 days after the last dose of study drug (ZW25, 
palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) and sa fety follow -up visit at approximately 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug. Subjects who discontinue all study treatment on either part of the study for 
reasons other than progressive disease or start of subsequent anticancer therapy will continue in 
follow -up with disease assessments approximately every 8 weeks  after the previous scan until 
disease progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy . If subjects enter this follow -up 
period before 24 -weeks have elapsed since the start of study treatm ent, a disease assessment 
must be done at 24 -weeks from the start of treatment (not required if ≤ 4 weeks since last disease 
assessment  or if disease progression has already been documented ). Responses that are initially 
observed during this follow -up peri od should be confirmed with disease assessment 4 weeks (+1 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 30 of 120 week) later. Following progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy, disease assessments 
will be discontinued and subjects will enter long -term follow -up for survival status. Data on 
survi val will be collected v ia clinic visits (if feasible) or via telephone calls every 3 months after 
the last follow -up visit.  Subjects may be discontinued from the study due to death, lost to follow -
up, consent withdrawal or study termination by sponsor. Reason for study discontinuation will be 
recorded. The same assessment schedule ( Appendix A) will be used for subject s in both parts of 
the study. All subject s in Part 1 will have blood samples taken per the extensive sampling 
schedule ( Appendix B). In Part 2, at least 6 subject s will have blood samples taken per the 
extensive sampling schedule ( Appendix B) while the remaining subject s will have samples taken 
based on the sparse sampling schedule ( Appendix C).

***, Following progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy, disease assessments will be discontinued and subjects will 
enter long -term follow -up for survival status. Data on survival will be collected approximately every 3 months  after the last 
follow -up visit . 
For all subject s, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans 
will be performed for tumor restaging every 8  weeks timed from Cycle 1 Day 1 during treatment 
and will be assessed according to the revise d RECIST guideline version 1.1 (Eisenhauer  2009 ). 
Initial respo nses should be confirmed , if feasible,  with repeat scans  4 weeks (+1-week window) 
following initial documentation of objective response . The schedule of response assessments 
should not be adjusted after the confirmatory scan and should maintain the schedule of every 8 
weeks timed from Cycle 1 Day 1 . The same imaging modality should be used throughout the 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 31 of 120 study as was used at baseline.  Data on breast cancer serum tumor markers, if monitored, should 
also be collected at the time of disease assessment.  
Subject s’ safety will be monitored at predetermined time points by recording the type, frequency, 
and severity of AEs graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE ) version 5.0 (27 November 2017), including AESIs,  SAEs 
and deaths, clinical laboratory values (including hematology  and serum chemistry ), physical 
examination, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), body weight,  
and ECOG performance status. Cardiac function will be monitored via 12 -lead ECG and 
echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition scan  (MUGA) . AEs will be collected fr om the start 
of dosing of any study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1 time of consent through 30 days after last dose of 
study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) . Study protocol -related AEs are to be 
collected from the time of informed consent.  All investigat ors should follow subject s with SAEs 
until the event returns to baseline, the event stabilizes (recovering/resolving) or is no longer 
considered clinically significant by the investigator, or the subject  dies or withdraws consent . 
Treatment -emergent AESIs should continue  to be followed until resolution or return to baseline 
and include absolute decreases  in LVEF  10 percentage points  from baseline , symptomatic heart 
failure,  infusion -related reactions , and all  Grade 2 event s of pneumonitis and/or interstitial lung 
disease, including pulmonary fibrosis . 
Safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study by the Safety Monitoring 
Committee ( SMC ) (Section  3.1.3 ). 
In both parts of the study, subject s may continue on study treatment until 
radiographically  -confirmed  disease progression as defined by RECIST version 1.1, clinical 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician decision, pregnancy, 
protocol violation, start  of a subsequent anticancer therapy  (Note: trastuzumab, alternate CDK4/6 
inhibitors, or any other treatment not part of the study regimen will be considered subsequent 
anticancer therapy. Palliative radiotherapy to a non -target bone lesion that is not progressing is 
allowed after the second cycle of treatment and must be administered after the initial response 
assessment obtained per protocol. This will not be  considered subsequent anticancer therapy but 
must not interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions. Treatment with palbociclib should 
be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy ) or study termination by the sponsor. Clinical 
progression is defi ned as worsening or re -emergence of pre -existing symptoms relating to 
underlying cancers, or emergence of new symptoms that cannot be attributed to drug toxicities or 
alternative causes.  Every effort should be made to confirm disease progression radiograph ically.  
If any component(s) of the combination therapy is discontinued due to toxicity deemed related to 
the component(s), subjects ZW25  on either part of the study may continue to receive the other 
component(s) of the study regimen until disease progressio n or start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy. Subjects who discontinue treatment with all 3 drugs for any reason (except death or 
withdrawal of consent) on either part of the study will have an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit 
within 14 days after the last dose  of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) and 
safety follow -up visit at approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 32 of 120 3.1.1  Part 1 Safety Evaluation  
The primary objective of Part 1 is to characterize the safety and tolerability of ZW25 in 
combination  with palbociclib plus fulvestrant. In addition, Part 1 will confirm the recommended 
doses  for all the drugs  in this combination.  
ZW25 will be administered IV at the initial dose of 20 mg/kg Q2W, which is a single -agent  RD 
identified in Study ZWI -ZW25 -101. Palbociclib will be administered PO with food at 125 mg 
QD for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. Fulvestrant will be administered as an IM injection 
at 500 mg Q2W for the first 3  doses, then Q4W  thereafter . A step-down dose level of ZW25 
(e.g.,  15 mg/kg [or other dose level not lower than 1 5 mg/kg] Q2W) and/or palbociclib 
(e.g.,  100 mg PO and/or 75 mg PO QD) may be allowed if recommended by the SMC. Subject s 
will also receive LHRH analogue treatment per institutio nal guidelines. The DLT -evaluation 
period will be the initial 28 days of treatment beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
Initially, up to 6 evaluable subject s will be assessed at a ZW25 monotherapy RD of 20 mg/kg 
Q2W in combination with palbociclib plus fulvestrant;  therefore, at least 6 evaluable subject s 
will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study and up to approximately 36 evaluable subject s if all 
step-down doses of ZW25 and palbociclib are evaluated (see Section  9.1 for possible dose 
combinations ). The SMC may decide if more than 6  subject s may be enrolled in a given dose 
level to better characterize the safety profile of a particular dose level . 
Prior to dosing with ZW25, all subject s should receive prophylactic treatment for infusion 
reactions ( Section  5.2.7.1 ). Additional premedications may be given  for palbociclib and 
fulvestrant per institutional standards and/or the local prescribing information.  
The recommended doses  for all drugs in  this combination (ZW25 in combination with  
palbociclib plus fulvestrant ) will be confirmed based on  the evaluation in Section  3.1.2 . 
3.1.2  Dose -Limiting Toxicity Evaluation and Determination of Recommended 
Dose Level (Part 1 only ) 
The DLT -evaluation period will be the first 28 days of treatment.  
The dose level  (evaluated dose of ZW25 plus evaluated dose of palbociclib and fulvestrant) will 
be considered not tolerated if  2 of 6 DLT evaluable subject s experience a DLT. If DLTs are 
observed in  2 subject s, the SMC may recommend a  step-down dose level of 15  mg/kg Q2W or 
other dose not lower than 1 5 mg/kg Q2W for evaluat ion in up to 6  additional DLT evaluable 
subject s. Additionally , the SMC may recommend evaluation of step -down doses of palbociclib 
of 100 mg PO QD and/or 75  mg PO QD  with or without recommending evaluation of a 
step-down dose of ZW25 . There is no step -down dose for fulvestrant at a cohort or study 
population level; however, individual subject s who develop moderate hepatic impairment (Child -
Pugh Class B) while on study treatment  will have their fulvestrant dose reduced to 250 mg. 
Intermediate dose levels of ZW25 and/or palbociclib may also be recommended by the SMC. 
The SMC may recommend step -down doses for 1 or more of the drugs in the combination 
regimen at any time  based on the overall safety profile . The dose of ZW25  is allowed to be 
de-escalated by a maximum of 1 step-down dose as recommended by the SMC. The dose of 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 33 of 120 palbociclib is allowed to be de -escalated by a maximum of 2 step -down doses as recommended 
by the SMC. At a reduced dose level, if 1 or fewer of the 6  subject s experience a DLT, then the 
dose level  may be confirmed  as recommended for Part 2 . When necessary, more than 6 subject s 
may be enrolled in a given dose level to better characterize the safety profile of a particular dose 
level . The study will advance  to Part 2 based on SMC recommendation. The DLT evaluation 
schema is presented in  Figure 3. Additional safety experiences in later cycles may be consi dered 
when confirming the recommended dose level  (ZW25  in combination with palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant ) for Part 2 .

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 34 of 120 A subject  will be considered DLT -evaluable if he/ she has  received ≥ 75% of the planned total 
dose of each component of study treatment (ZW25, palbociclib, and fulvestrant) over the first 
28 days of treatment , and was followed for the full DLT evaluation period,  unless the reason for 
not receiving requir ed doses or not being followed was the occurrence of a DLT . If the reason for 
not receiving required doses  is a DLT, a subject  will still be considered evaluable. To account for 
potential discontinuations prior to being evaluable for DLT (for example, prog ressive disease 
[PD] or subject  preference), enrollment of replacement subject s will be allowed to permit 
assessment of DLTs and recommended dose level for Part 2.  
Dose -limiting toxicities, defined using the (NCI CTCAE ) version 5.0, are events that 1) occur 
following administration of ZW25, palbociclib, and fulvestrant, or any combination of ZW25 
and 1 or more of these drugs; and 2) meet the criteria described below. Events for which there is 
an alternative clinical explanation (e.g., clearly related to an intercurrent illness, disease 
progression, or extraneous causes ) will not be considered DLTs. The relationship of AEs to each 
component of study treatment will be determined by the investigator ; however, the Sponsor 
and/or the SMC may query the relationship assessment s and/or determine that the event was 
related to additional components of the regimen.  
DLT Criteria Non -Hematologic   
Any non -hematologic AE ≥  Grade 3 in severity that is not clearly and incontrovertibly due to 
disease progression or extraneous causes  (e.g., accidental injury or similar event)  is considered a 
DLT, with the following exceptions:  
• Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤  3 days  
• Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting that resolves to  Grade 1 or baseline within 3 days 
with adequate supportive care  
• Grade 3 rash without maximal use of corticosteroids or anti -infectives  
• Infusion reaction ≤  Grade 3 (for management of infusion  reactions, see  Section  5.2.3.2 ) 
Grade 2 or greater events of pneumonitis and/or interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary 
fibrosis  not clearly and incontrovertibly related to disease progression or extraneous causes  is 
considered a DLT.  
Any l aboratory abnormalit y ≥ Grade 4 not clearly and incontrovertibly due to disease 
progression or extraneous causes  is considered a DLT . Any asymptomatic ≥ Grade 3  electrolyte 
abnormality that lasts >  72 hours or any symptomatic ≥ Grade 3  electrolyte abnormality of any 
duration is considered a DLT. Amylase and lipase elevations not associated with symptoms or 
clinical man ifestations of pancreatitis are not considered DLTs.  
Any clinically relevant toxicities not clearly and incontrovertibly due to disease progression or 
extraneous causes  and that do not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 2 weeks may be 
considered a DLT based upon review by the study SMC.  
Greater than a 2 -week delay in the start of Cycle 2 due to unresolved toxicity not clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to disease progression or extraneous causes  will be considered a DLT.  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 36 of 120 • Grade 2 symptomatic heart failure  
The first DLT will result in withholding of the drug until recovery of the ejection fraction to 
prior levels. If subject s remain off ZW25 for more than 4 weeks they will be removed from the 
study. For the management of left ventricular dysfunction, see Section  5.2.3.1 . 
3.1.3  Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)  
Safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study by the SMC, consist ing of the 
study investigators and the sponsor responsible medical expert and biostatistician. The committee  
is tasked with monitoring the safety of participants in this study through regular or ad  hoc 
meetings.  
SMC activities related to evaluation of DLT s, recommending step -down dose levels for ZW25 
and palbociclib, and recommending the doses for all the drugs in this combination to be used in  
Part 2 are described in Section  3.1.2 . 
The SMC activities will be described in and governed by the SMC Guidelines.  
3.1.4  Part 2 Anti -tumor Activity  
The primary objective of Part 2 of the study is to evaluate the potential anti -tumor activity of the 
recommended dose level of the combination of ZW25 with palbociclib plus fulvestrant in 
subject s with a diagnosis of HER2 -positive , HR -positive  breast cancer that is locally advanced 
(unresectable) and/or metastatic.  
Enrollment for Part 2 will b egin once the recommended doses of ZW25 and the other drugs of 
the combination therapy have been confirmed in Part 1. The treatment and blood collection 
schedules, treatment cycle duration and imaging evaluation intervals are the same as in Part 1.  
Part 2 of the study will evaluate the preliminary anti -tumor activity. All subject s will be assessed 
for safety and anti -tumor response. The mITT set includes all subjects who receive any amount  
of ZW25 with palbociclib and/or fulvestrant who had at least one identifiable (target and/or non -
target) lesion at baseline and at least one post -baseline disease assessment or discontinued all 
study treatment and are no longer being followed for efficacy . The primary efficacy endpoint 
will be PFS6 (defined as the % of mITT  subject s with PFS of 24 weeks); secondary efficacy 
endpoints include ORR, DOR, DCR, PFS , and OS . Approximately 50 subjects are expected to be 
enrolled in Part 2. Assuming the observed PFS6 rate is between 40% and 70%, the 
corresponding 95% binomial exact confidence intervals (CI) are summarized in Table  4 below.  
Table  4:  PFS6 Rate and Corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 37 of 120 If possible, an additional optional tumor biopsy may be obtained at the time of disease 
progression from an accessible site to allow for assessment of changes in HER2 expression as 
well as the presence of other exploratory biomarkers. Biomarkers of response may be evaluated.  
3.1.5  Stopping Criteria  
If the SMC recommends that the dose of ZW25 needs to be dropped below 15 mg/kg Q2W; the 
palbociclib dose needs to be reduced below 75 mg; and/or the fulvestrant dose needs to be 
reduced, then the study may be terminated.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason.  
For individual subject s, information on study treatment and study discontinuation is provided in 
Section  4.4. Also, individual subject s may have to discontinue  study treatment in case the dose 
modifications for ZW25 and palbociclib are not sufficient for managing toxicities ( Section  5.2.3  
and Section  5.3.3 ). 
3.2 Discussion and Rationale for Study Design  
Although ZW25 has been evaluated as a single agent in a Phase 1 study and a single agent RD 
(20 mg/kg Q2W) has been confirmed, its tolerability when combined with palbociclib and 
fulvestrant in advanced or metastatic breast cancer has not been evaluated previously.  
Part 1 of the study will first evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW25 in combination with 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant and will confi rm the RD s of all the drugs  in this combination. Then, 
Part 2 of the study will evaluate the anti -tumor activity of ZW25 in combination with palbociclib 
plus fulvestrant (all drugs given at the RDs identified in Part 1) in subject s with HER2 -positive , 
HR-positive  breast cancer.  
In summary, this study will evaluate the safety and preliminary anti -tumor activity of ZW25 
combined with palbociclib plus fulvestrant in the treatment of subject s with advanced 
HER2 -positive, HR -positive  breast cancer that has progr essed on or been refractory to prior 
treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T -DM1. Premenopausal women and perimenopausa l 
women will also be treated with an LHRH analogue (also known as gonadotropin -releasing 
hormone analogue) per institutional guidel ines. 
3.2.1  Method of Assigning Subject s to Treatment Groups  
This is an open -label, non -randomized study. Subject s will be assigned to each cohort sequentially.  
3.2.2  Rationale for Selection of Doses  
To confirm the RD of ZW25 when combined with palbociclib and fulvest rant in subject s with 
breast cancer, Part 1 of the study is designed to address the question of whether the single -agent 
RD of ZW25 is tolerable when combined with palbociclib and fulvestrant . The initial doses to 
be explored will be a ZW25 monotherapy RD (20 mg/kg Q2W) from the Phase 1 study  
ZWI -ZW25 -101 in combination with palbociclib per recommended dose (125 mg PO QD for the 
first 21 days of each 28 -day cycle) in the package insert (IBRANCE®) and fulvestrant per 
recommended dose (500 mg IM Q2W for the first 3 doses, then Q4W thereafter) in the package 
insert (FASLODEX®). A step-down dose level of ZW25 (e.g., 15 mg/kg  or other dose not lower 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 38 of 120 than 1 5 mg/kg  Q2W) and/or palbociclib (e.g., 100 mg PO and/or 75 mg PO QD) may be allowed 
if recommended by the SMC. No step -down dose levels for fulvestrant are allowed;  however, 
individual subject s with moderate hepatic impairment may receive a reduced dose per 
prescribing information. On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, ZW25 will be administered first 
followed by palbociclib and fulvestrant . Prem enopausal women and perimenopausal women will 
also be treated with a LHRH analogue (also known as gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
analogue) per institutional guidelines.  
3.2.3  Blinding  and Randomization  
This is an open -label , non -randomized  study.

A person who can father children is anyone born male who has testes and w ho has not undergone 
surgical sterilization (e.g., vasectomy followed by a clinical test proving that the procedure was 
effective).  
According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, pregnant or breast -feeding subject s cannot be 
included in the study, and adequate contraceptive measures should be taken to prevent female 
subject s of childbearing potential or female partners of male subject s (either of childbearing 
potential) from getting pregnant during study participation and for at least 12  months after th e 
last dose of  study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) . Subject s will be instructed that 
known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study should be confirmed and reported to 
the investigator. If a female subject  is pregnant, the investiga tor will immediately discontinue the 
Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 42 of 120 subject  from the study. Upon discontinuation, only those procedures that would not expose the 
subject  to undue risk will be performed.  
The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring during the study or within 12  months  
following last study treatment administration but confirmed after completion of the study.  
In the event that a female subject  or female partner of a male subject  is found to be pregnant after 
inclusion in the study, the pregnancy will be f ollowed to term with subject /partner consent, and 
the status of mother and child will be reported to the sponsor after delivery  and the status of the 
baby will be followed for a minimum of 6 months after a live birth . 
Details of the pregnancy will be recor ded on the withdrawal page of the case report form (CRF), 
and a Pregnancy Report Form will be completed.  
4.4 Removal of Subject s from Therapy or Assessment  
The sponsor  or their designee must be notified if a subject  is withdrawn from study treatment or 
from the study. The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject ’s medical 
records and CRF.  
4.4.1  Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
If any component(s) of the combination therapy is discontinued due to toxicit y deemed related to 
the component(s), subjects on either part of the study may continue to receive the other 
component(s) of the study regimen until disease progression or start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy  (Note : trastuzumab, alternate CDK4/6 inhibito rs, or any other treatment not part of the 
study regimen will be considered subsequent  anticancer therapy . Palliative radiotherapy to a non -
target bone lesion that is not progressing is allowed after the second cycle of treatment and must 
be administered a fter the initial response assessment obtained per protocol. This will not be 
considered subsequent anticancer therapy but must not interfere with the assessment of tumor 
target lesions. Treatment with palbociclib should be interrupted during palliative rad iotherapy ). 
Subjects who discontinue treatment with all 3 drugs for any reason (except death or withdrawal 
of consent) on either part of the study will have an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit within 14 days 
after the last dose of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib , and/or fulvestrant) and safety follow -up 
visit at approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Study treatment may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
• Adverse event (AE)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Physician de cision (non -AE, non -progressive disease)  
• Pregnancy  
• Progressive disease (either radiographic or clinical progression)  
• Protocol violation  
• Study termination by sponsor  
• Other, non -AE 
Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 43 of 120 Also, if a subject  has not taken ZW25 for more than 4 weeks, he/she will be w ithdrawn from study  
treatment unless approval is obtained from the medical monitor to continue on study treatment.  
Also, if a subject  starts subsequent non -study anticancer therapy, then study treatment will be 
discontinued before the start of the new ther apy 
At a minimum, all efforts should be made for subject s to complete the EOT visit ( Section  6.4) 
and the safety  follow -up visit  (Section  6.5), and efficac y (Section 6.6 ) and survival follow -ups 
(Section 6.7 ). 
4.4.2  Subject  Withdrawal from Study  
Any subject  may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:   
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Study termination by sponsor  
5 TREATMENTS  
5.1  Treatments Administered  
In this study, subject s will be treated with open -label ZW25 in combinatio n with palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant. Although information for palbociclib and fulvestrant are included in this protocol, in 
case of conflict between these instructions and the most recent local prescribing information for 
these approved drugs, Investigator s should follow the most recent local prescribing information.  
5.2 ZW25  
Detailed in formation describing the preparation, administration, and storage of ZW25 is located 
in the Pharmacy Manual. Study drug must be diluted as instructed in the Pharmacy Manual prior 
to administration.  
On Days 1 and 15 (i.e., ZW25 dosing days) of each treatme nt cycle, ZW25 will be administered 
first followed by palbociclib and fulvestrant.  
5.2.1  Description  of ZW25  
ZW25 is a humanized bispecific antibody recognizing 2 non -overlapping epitopes of the ECD of 
the human HER2 antigen. A schematic representation of ZW25 i s shown in Figure 4. The 
IgG1 -like fragment crystallizable  (Fc) region of ZW25 contains complementary mutations in 
each CH3 domain that impart preferential pairing to generate a heterodimeric molecule and 
correspondingly disfavor formation of homodimers. Chain A is otherwise a normal IgG1 heavy 
chain and forms a fragme nt antigen -binding (Fab) arm through pairing with IgG Kappa light 
Chain A ’. Chain A /A’ binds to ECD2 of HER2. Chain B has an IgG1 -like hinge, CH2 and CH3 
domains but contains a single -chain variable fragment (scFv) rather than a Fab arm. Chain B 
binds to E CD4 of HER2. In place of the constant heavy chain 1 ( CH1 ) domain , it has a variable 
light ( VL) domain, an unstructured 20  amino acid linker of glycine and serine residues, followed 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 44 of 120 by a variable heavy ( VH) domain to form an scFv domain. ZW25 is being devel oped as a 
treatment for locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic HER2 -expressing cancers.

Fab = fragment antigen -binding; Fc = fragment crystallizable; IgG1 = immunoglobulin G1; scFv  = single -chain 
variable fragment.  
5.2.2  Dose and Administration  of ZW25  
Dosing for ZW25 will be given as follows:  
● Part 1:   
o 20 mg/kg IV ZW25; dosing Q2W on Days 1 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. Up to 
1 step-down dose level (15 mg/kg Q2W  or other dose  not lower than 1 5 mg/kg Q2W ) 
may be evaluated if recommended by the SMC and approved by the sponsor  
● Part 2:  
o Recommended dose of ZW25 as confirmed in Part 1 for administration in 
combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant  
Dosing is based on the subject ’s actual body weig ht taken at screening visit . Doses must be 
adjusted for subject s who experience a ≥ 10% change in weight from baseline / screening visit on 
dosing day . Subject  weight must be measured on all ZW25 dosing days  as part of the physical 
exam (within a window of 3 days prior to dosing) . Detailed instructions for dose preparation are 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
ZW25 should be administered prior to any component of the combination chemotherapy 
regimen. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for infusion times. Subjects who experience a 
Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion reaction may resume infusion of drug at a reduced infusion rate 
(50% slower than initial rate). All subject s should receive prophylactic treatment for infusion 
reactions prior to ZW25 dosing as outlined in  Section  5.2.7.1 . 
5.2.3  Dose Modifications  of ZW25  
An individual subject  who experience s an event that meets the criteria for DLT (defined in 
Section  3.1.2 ) at any time on study treatment may continue at a s tep-down dose (or an intermediate  
dose level determined by the SMC) once the toxicity has returned to Grade 1 or baseline with 
approval of the medical monitor . If the subject  then experiences another such event at the step -

ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 45 of 120 down dose level, with approval fr om the medical monitor, the dose of ZW25 administered to that 
individual subject  should be reduced  again  but should not go below 10 mg/kg Q2W.  
For Part 2 of the study, dose modifications for ZW25 -associated toxicity are presented in Table  5 
below. Dose decreases or delays for other reasons may be permitted with approval from the 
medical monitor. The reason for dose decrease or delay must be recorded, and the sponsor must 
be notif ied. Up to 2 dose reductions per subject  will be allowed for Q 2W dosing, but the reduced 
dose cannot be lower than 10 mg/kg Q2W.  
There must be a minimum of 10 days ( ±2 days) between doses. Day 15 doses not administered 
within 6 days after Day 15 must be sk ipped.   
Note: Although only 1 step -down dose level (not lower than 15 mg/kg Q2W) of ZW25 is 
allowed in the study at a cohort level, individual subject s may have up to 2 dose reductions as 
long as the reduced dose is not lower than 10 mg/kg Q2W.

If feasible, blood samples for evaluation of PK and/or ADA may be drawn in the event of an 
infusion reaction.  
5.2.3.3  Liver Toxicity  
In the event  of increased liver function tests (LFTs) without explanation such as viral hepatitis, 
preexisting or acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the 
subject  may be discontinued from the study treatment  at the investigator’s discretion . 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized ratio 
(INR)  >1.5 (if INR t esting is applicable/evaluated)  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appearance of symptoms suggestive of liver injury , e.g., 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
These treatment discontinuation recommendations are based on the FDA Gu idance for Industry 
(FDA Guidance for Industry 2009 ). The recomm endations are a basic guide to the investigator 
based on accumulated clinical experience with drugs in development and  are not specific to 
clinical experience with ZW25. See Appendix F for recommended liver safety monitoring and 
assessment criteria in patients with elevations in ALT, AST, or bilirubin.  
5.2.4  Storage and Handling  
Vials and solutions containing ZW25 should be stored at -20°C ( ±5 °C) and protected from light 
until ready for use. Drug must be stored in a controlled location, where access is limited to only 
designated site staff. For details regarding drug preparation and administration reference the 
Pharmacy Manual. Drug accountability procedures are also provided in  the Pharmacy Manual.

stable dose level and frequency, if possible unless prohibited for study entry.  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 49 of 120 5.2.7.1  Required Concomitant Therapy  
All subject s must  receive the following mandatory prophylactic treatment for infusion reactions 
at 30 to 60  minutes before the start of each ZW25 infusion : 
● Acetaminophen orally (650 mg) and diphenhydramine orally (50 mg) or equivalents  
● Corticosteroids (either hydrocortisone 100 mg IV or dexamethasone 10 mg IV)  
If an alternative premedication regimen is thought to be required, the Investigator must seek 
sponsor approval. S ponsor approval is required before implementation . 
For subject s who experience an infusion reaction despite the above premedication, other 
medication as needed per the Investigator or  per institutional standards including H2 blockers 
may be given in addition to the mandatory premedications.  
Premenopausal women and perimenopausal women will also be treated with an LHRH analogue 
(also known as gonadotropin -releasing hormone analogue) per institutional guidelines. 
Note:  Concomitant norethindrone acetate is contraindicated for breast cancer subje cts. 
5.2.7.2  Allowed Concomitant Therapy  
Supportive therapy, including transfusions and bisphosphonates (e.g., Zometa®), is allowed on 
study. Supportive care treatments including supportive growth factors and colony -stimulating 
factors are also allowed.  Palliative  radiotherapy to a non -target bone lesion that is not 
progressing is allowed after the second cycle of treatment and must be administered after the 
initial response assessment obtained per protocol. This will not be considered subsequent 
anticancer therapy  but must not interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions. Treatment 
with palbociclib should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy . Corticosteroid treatment is 
permitted only as follows:  
• Topical, ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and/o r inhalational corticosteroids  
• Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids (i.e., < 15 mg/day)  
• As part of pre -medication for ZW25 and/or chemotherapy components of study treatment  
• For prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune 
conditions (e.g., delayed hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen)  
• For acute medical conditions (higher doses permitted, but not to exceed 4 weeks with 
medical monitor approval)  
All other therapies not specifically listed i n the exclusion criteria or in prohibited therapy are 
allowed.  
5.2.7.3  Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
Subject s may not receive cancer related surgery, radiotherapy  (except as noted in Section  5.2.7.2  
above ), other investigational, or systemic anti -neoplastic therapy during the study. Use of 
alternative supplemental therapies is discouraged  and use of any such product must be recorded.  
Ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors (see also Section  5.3.6 ) are 
prohibited during the study.

ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 50 of 120 5.3  Palbociclib Plus Fulvestrant  
5.3.1  Description s of Palbociclib and Fulvestrant  
Palboci clib is an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK 6. Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist.  
The combination of p albociclib  plus fulvestrant  is approved for the treatment of HR -positive, 
HER2 -negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in women with disease progression 
following endocrine therapy.  
5.3.2  Dose and Administration  of Palbociclib and Fulvestrant  
The recommended dose of palbociclib is a 125 mg capsule taken orally with food once daily 
(QD) for 21 consecutive days (Days 1 through 21) followed by 7 days off treatment (Days 22 
through 28) in a 28 -day cycle.  
The recommended dose of fulvestrant is a 500 mg IM injection into the buttocks (two 5 -mL 
injections, one per buttock, with each injection being administered over 1 to 2 minutes) Q2W for 
3 doses and Q4W thereafter. In  a 28-day cycle, this means fulvestrant injections on Cycle 1 
Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, and then Day 1 of all subsequent cycles.  
5.3.3  Dose Modifications  for Palbociclib and Fulvestrant  
For palbociclib, the recommended dose and reduced dose levels for individual subject s (not to be 
confused with step -down dose levels for subject  cohorts) are shown in Table 8. 
Table 8: Dose Reduction Levels for Toxicities Associated with Palbociclib  
Dose Level  Dose (mg/day on Days 1 -21 of a 28 -day cycle)  
Recommended starting dose  125 
First dose reduction  100 
Second dose reduction  75 
If dose reduction below 75 mg/day is required, then discontinue palbociclib.  
 
Subject s should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. 
Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic e xams 
and in whom infectious, neoplastic, and other causes  have been excluded by means of 
appropriate investigations. If new or worsening respiratory symptoms develop or there are other 
reasons to suspect ILD or pneumonitis, palbociclib dosing should be held while the subject  
undergoes urgent evaluation. In all subject s diagnosed with  Grade 2 pneumonitis and/or 
interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis , palbociclib should be permanently 
discontinued and the subject  taken off of study treatment.  
For specific instructions on how to manage  other  non-hematologic  and hematologic  toxicities 
associated with palbociclib, including dose reductions and dose delays, refer to the local 
prescribing information.  On resumption of dosing after a dose delay, e very attempt should be 
made to sync hronize  palbo ciclib and fulvestrant with Day 1 of the subsequent cycle.  
The fulvestrant dose should be halved (250 mg injections) for subject s with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh class B). Fulvestrant has not been studied in subject s with severe 
hepatic impairm ent (Child -Pugh class C).  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 51 of 120 For fulvestrant, there are no reduced dose levels for toxicity. If fulvestrant is not tolerated at the 
recommended dose (or the modified dose for subject s with moderate hepatic impairment), it 
should be discontinued.  
5.3.4  Warnings, Pre cautions, and Contraindications for Palbociclib and 
Fulvestrant  
5.3.4.1  Palbociclib  
Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to start of palbociclib therapy and at the 
beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinica lly indicated.  For 
subject s who experience Grade 3 neutropenia, consider repeating CBC  monitoring one week later.  
Embryo -fetal toxicity: Palbociclib can cause fetal harm. Advise subject s of potential risk to a 
fetus and to use effective contraception.  
5.3.4.2  Fulvestrant  
Risk of bleeding: Use with caution in subject s with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or 
anticoagulant use.  
Increased exposure in subject s with hepatic impairment: Use a 250 mg dose for subject s with 
moderate hepatic impairment.  
Injection site reaction: Use caution when administering fulvestrant at the dorsogluteal injection 
site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve.  
Embryo -fetal toxicity: Fulvestrant can cause fetal harm. Advi se female subject s of childbearing 
potential of the p otential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception.  
Immunoassay measurement of serum estradiol: Fulvestrant can interfere with estradiol 
measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels.  
Fulvestrant is contraindicated in subject s with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its 
components. Hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria and angioedema, have been reported.  
5.3.5  Storage , Handling , Packaging, Labeling, and Preparation  for Palbociclib 
and Fulvestrant  
For inf ormation on the storage, handling, packaging, labeling, and preparation of palbociclib and 
fulvestrant, refer to the local prescribing information.  
5.3.6  Concomitant Therapy  and Palbociclib and Fulvestrant  
Premedications and supportive medications for palbociclib and fulvestrant should be 
administered per institutional standards as long as they are consistent with local prescribing 
information and not contraindicated by this study protocol.  
Premenopausal women and perimenopausal women will also be treat ed with an LHRH analogue 
(also known as gonadotropin -releasing hormone analogue) per institutional guidelines. 
Note:  Concomitant norethindrone acetate is contraindicated for breast cancer subject s. 
Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 52 of 120 While taking palbociclib, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin,  
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and voriconazole) and strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(e.g., phenytoin, rifam pin, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, and St John’s Wort) . Also, a void 
grapefruit or grapefruit juice during palbociclib treatment. If coadministration of palbociclib with 
a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of palbociclib to 75 mg . 
5.3.7  Drug Interactions  of Palbociclib and Fulvestrant  
Palbociclib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. 
In vivo, palbociclib is a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A.  The dose of sensitive CYP3A4 
substrates with narrow therape utic indices may need to be reduced when given concurrently with 
palbociclib.  
There are no known drug -drug interactions for fulvestrant. Although fulvestrant is metabolized 
by CYP3A4 in vitro, in drug interaction studies co-administration with ketoconazole  (strong 
inhibitor) and rifampin (strong inducer) did not alter the PK of fulvestrant.  
5.4 Duration of Study Treatment  
In both parts of the study, subject s may continue on study treatment until radiographically -
confirmed disease progression as defined by RECIST version 1.1, clinical disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician decision, pregnancy, protocol violation, 
start of a subsequent anticancer therapy, or study termination by the sponsor.  
Note: Trastuzumab, alternate CDK4/6 inhibitors, or any other treatment not part of the study 
regimen will be considered subsequent anticancer therapy. Palliative radiotherapy to a non -target 
bone lesion that is not progressing is allowed after the second cycle of treatment and must be 
administered after the initial response assessment obtained per protocol. This will not be 
considered subsequent anticancer therapy but must not interfere wi th the assessment of tumor 
target lesions. Treatment with palbociclib should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy . 
If any component(s) of the combination therapy is discontinued due to toxicity deemed related to 
the component(s), subjects on either part of the study may continue to receive the other 
component(s) of the study regimen until disease progression or start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy. Subjects who discontinue treatment with all 3 drugs for any reason (except death or 
withdrawal  of consent) on either part of the study will have an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit 
within 14 days after the last dose of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) and 
safety follow -up visit at approximately 30 days after the last dose of study dru g. 
5.5 Management of Adverse Reactions  
Management of infusion reactions and other toxicities related to or associated with ZW25 is 
described in Section  5.2.3.2 . Required premedications as prophylaxis for ZW25 infusion 
reactions are described in Section  5.2.7.1 . 
Management of toxicities related to palbociclib and/or fulvestrant is described in Section  5.3.3 . 
Initial management of adverse reactions should align with treatment measures recommended for 
the study drug that is most likely responsible for the observed toxicity. For hematological 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 53 of 120 toxicit ies (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), infections, and stomatitis palbociclib 
dose modifications as recommended in local prescribing information should be implemented. 
Initial management of diarrhea should utilize treatment measures listed for ZW 25 in Table  5 
(Section  5.2.3 ). For toxicities that are not common to eithe r palbociclib or ZW25 treatment 
measures recommended for ZW25, the experimental agent, should  be applied  first. All study 
treatments should be permanently discontinued in any subject  diagnosed with  Grade 2 
pneumonitis and/or interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis . 
5.6 Treatment Compliance  
ZW25 administration will be performed by study site staff and documented in source documents 
and the CRF.  
Compliance with the palbociclib regimen will  be assessed by counting dispensed and returned 
capsules. Results will be recorded in source documents and the CRF.  
Administration of fulvestrant will be performed by study site staff and documented in source 
documents and the CRF.  
6 STUDY ACTIVITIES  
6.1 Schedul e of Events  
Any study protocol -related AE (see Section  7.7.1.1 ) as well as any concomitant medications 
given for treatment of the AE, should be recorded from the time of informed consent. Otherwise, 
AEs and concomitant medications will be recorded from D ay 1 (predose) start of dosing of any 
study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1 through the  safety reporting period (see Section  7.7.1.3 ). A 
schedule of events is provided in Appendix A. Where applicable, the assessments shall follow

ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 62 of 120 6.7 Survival Follow -Up (Every 3 Months)  
Following progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy, disease assessments will be 
discontinued , and subjects will enter long -term follow -up for survival status. Data on survival 
will be collected via clinic visits (if feasible) or via telephone calls every 3 months after the last 
follow -up visit . . Subjects may be discontinued from the study due to death, lost to follow -up, 
consent withdrawal or study termination by sponsor. Reason for study discontinu ation will be 
recorded.  
7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
A schedule of events is provided in Appendix A. Extensive and sparse PK sampling schedules 
are provided in Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively.  
7.1 Scree ning/Baseline Assessments  
Only subject s who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Section  4 will be 
enrolled in this study.  
Subject  medical history includes a thorough review of significant past medical history, current 
conditions, any treatment for prior malignancies and response to prior treatment, and any current  
medications.  
For both parts o f the study, subject s must have a diagnosis of locally advanced (unresectable) 
and/or metastatic HER2 -positive,  HR-positive  (ER-positive  and/or PgR-positive ) breast cancer. 
Eligibility will be determined based on local (institutional) review of HER2 status , HR status, 
and disease pathology, with subsequent retrospective central review  of HER2 status . HER2 
expression will be determined based on the HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: ASCO/  CAP 
Clinical Practice Guidelines (Wolff  2018 ). Hormone receptor  status will be determined based on 
the ASCO/CAP Guideline Recommendations for Immunohistochemical Testing of Estrogen and 
Progesterone Receptors in Breast Cancer (Hammond  2010 ). If the local assessments at a 
particular site cannot be done with these tests and to these standards, then central assessment will 
be required before a subject  can be enrolled.  A new formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) 
tumor sample (preferred) or archived tumor tissue (most recent  sample available) must be 
available for the retrospective central laboratory review  of HER2 status . 
Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and HIV will be performed at 
screening if indicated in the opinion of the treating investi gator. For female subject s of 
childbearing  potential, screening for pregnancy will be performed at screening. These tests will 
be done using the blood samples taken for clinical chemistry. A urine pregnancy test is also 
acceptable.  
7.2 Response/Efficacy Assess ments  
Tumor response will be evaluated based on CT and/or MRI scans (using the same methodology 
[decided by the investigator at baseline] for each scan of the same subject  throughout the study ) 
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus additional areas of kno wn or suspected tumor involvement 
(e.g., brain [MRI] and/or bone scintigraphy with targeted assessment by X -ray, CT scan with 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 63 of 120 bone windows, or MRI to confirm findings as needed).  Data on breast cancer serum tumor 
markers, if monitored, should also be collected at the time of disease assessment.  
● Bone scan (scintigraphy): For subject s with new lesions identified by post -baseline bone 
scintigraphy, targeted assessment by X ray, CT scan with bone windows, or MRI will be 
performed to confirm findings.  
● Brain  scan (MRI): After screening, brain scans will be required per protocol only for 
subject s with findings on the screening brain scan; for subject s without findings on the 
screening brain scan, subsequent brain scans will be done per institutional standard o f care.  
The radiological assessment(s) will be performed at the visits according to the description 
provided in the assessment schedule ( Appendix A). 
Object ive responses and tumor progression will be evaluated by the investigator using revised 
RECIST version 1.1 ( Appendix D) (Eisenhauer  2009 ). Initial responses should be confirmed , if 
feasible,  with a repeat scan 4  weeks (+1-week window) following initial documentation of 
objective response . 
Scans from subject s will be collected and may undergo centralized review at the discretion of the 
sponsor. The investigator assessment will be used for all treatment -related decisions.  
Subject s’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification. Copies of tumor images 
must be made available for review by the sponsor (or its designee), upon request.  
7.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Venous blood samples for measurement of serum concentrations of ZW25 will be drawn at 
selected time points specified in the PK assessment schedule s. The actual date and time (24 -h 
clock time) of each sampling will be recorded in the subject ’s source docume nt at the site.  The 
sampling window for each time point is presented in Appendix B (extensive sampling) and 
Appendix C (sparse sampling) . Deviations from planned sampling windows will be assessed 
before database lock for the impact on PK and may be excluded from time point summaries of 
PK concentration s. Actual time will be used for derivation of PK parameters . 
Complete instructions for sample collection, processing, handling, and shipment will be provided 
in the Laboratory Manual.  
If a subject  experiences an AE that results in an unscheduled visit or m eets SAE criteria, a blood 
sample for the measurement of serum concentrations of ZW25 should be collected if less than 
24 hours have elapsed since the last dose of ZW25 , if possible. The sample will be recorded as 
unscheduled time point and may be also use d in PK parameters derivation using actual time. An 
additional sample may also be drawn in the event of an infusion reaction.  
All Part 1  subject s and at least six Part 2 subject s will be assigned to the extensive PK schedule. 
Further subject s will be then be assigned to the sparse PK schedule.  
7.4 Biomarker Studies  
The new formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumor sample (preferred) or archived tumor 
tissue (most recent sample available) used for screening will also be used for a ProSigna  
assessment at screening.  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 64 of 120 If possible and additional consent is provided, an optional tumor biopsy may be obtained at the 
time of disease progression from an accessible site to assess changes in HER2 expression as well 
as the presence of other exploratory biomarkers. A ProSigna  assessment will be done for this 
sample as well.  
Blood samples will be taken at selected time points specified in the assessment schedule 
(Appendix A) for assessment of biomarkers including, but not limited to, ctDNA and HER2 ECD.  
7.5 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples to test for antibodies to ZW25 will be obtained at selected time points specified in 
the assessment schedule ( Appendix A). Blood samples for ADAs will be taken before the start of 
the ZW25 infusion. All ADA blood sample collection time points during the first 2 treatment  
cycles coincide with a pre -dose PK sample time point. If a subject  terminates early from the clinical  
trial, all efforts will be made to collect blood samples to test for antibodies to ZW25 unless  consent 
has been withdrawn. Additional samples may be drawn in the event of an infusion reaction.  
The immunogenicity testing will be performed in 3 steps as follows: screening assay (Tier 1), 
confirmation assay (Tier 2), and titration (Tier 3). Only samples positive in the screening assay 
will be tested in co nfirmation and further titrated to determine the titer of ADA.  
For any samples that are confirmed positive for anti -ZW25 antibody, there may be additional 
testing done to characterize domain specificity and possibly the anti -ZW25 antibody potential for 
neutralizing activity on ZW25.  
Additional sample handling, processing, storage, labeling, and shipping instructions will be 
provided to the site in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.6 Biospecimen Repository  
No genomic testing of germ -line DNA will performed in this study.  
7.7 Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the course of this study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including AESIs , SAEs, recording of concomitant medication, and 
measurements of protocol -specified physical examination findi ngs, laboratory tests , and other 
assessments (ECOG PS, vital signs, ECGs, and echocardiogram/MUGA) . 
Safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study by the SMC, consisting of the 
study investigators and the sponsor responsible medical expert  and biostatistician. The 
committee is tasked with monitoring the safety of participants in this study through regular or ad 
hoc meetings. The roles, responsibilities and functioning of the SMC are described in more detail 
in the SMC charter.

ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 65 of 120 7.7.1  Adverse Event s 
7.7.1.1  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A3 guideline and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.324, an AE is 
any untoward medical o ccurrence in a subject  or clinical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
The following information should be considered when determining whether or not to rec ord a test  
result, medical condition, or other incident on the Adverse Events or the Medical History  and Pre-
existing Conditions CRF s: 
● From the time of informed consent to immediately before the first dose of any study drug 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 , only study protocol -related AEs should be recorded. A protocol -
related AE is defined as an untoward medical event occurring as a result of a protocol 
mandated procedure.  
● All medical conditions present or ongoing predose on Cycle 1 Day 1  should be recorde d 
on the Medical History  and Pre-existing  Conditions CRF page . 
● All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be recorded from Cycle 1 Day 1  
(during and post -dose) through the end of the safety reporting period (see Section  7.7.1.3 ). 
Complications that occur in association with any procedure (e.g., biopsy) should be 
recorded as AEs whether or not the procedure was protocol mandated.  
● Changes in medical conditions and AEs, including changes in severity, frequency, or 
character, during the safety reporting period should be recorded.  
● In general, an abnormal laboratory value should not  be recorded as an AE unless it is 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms, requires an intervention, results in a SAE, or 
results in study termination or interruption/discontinuation of study treatment.  When 
recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition 
rather than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia” rather than 
“low hemoglobin”).  
Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria:  
Fatal:  AE resulted in death

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 66 of 120 Life threatening:  The AEs placed the subject  at immediate risk of death. This classification does  
not apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
Hospitalization:  The AE resulted in hospitalization or prolonged an existing inpatient 
hospitalization. Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures 
or treatments planned before the signing of informed consent in the study or 
routine check -ups are not SAEs by this criterion. Admission to a palliative 
unit or hospice care facility is not considered to be a hospitalization. 
Hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations for scheduled therapy of the 
underlying cancer or study target disease need not be captured as SAEs.  
Disablin g/ 
incapacitating:  An AE that resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the subject ’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Congenital 
anomaly or 
birth  defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject  exposed to the molecule 
or study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.  
Medically 
significant:  The AE did not meet any of the above criteria but could have jeopardized the 
subject  and might have required medical or surgical intervention  to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above or involves suspected transmission via a 
medicinal product of an infectious agent.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse event  severity should be graded using the (NCI CTCAE ), version 5.0. These criteria are 
provided in the study manual.  
Adverse event  severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the sponsor for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAEs, above).  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 67 of 120 Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to each of the study drugs  (ZW25, palbociclib , and/or fulvestrant)  
should be evaluated by the investigator using the following criteria:  
Related:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
AE, such as:  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be 
strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the 
population exposed to the drug (e .g., tendon rupture)  
There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship based on facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship 
cannot be ruled out.  
Unrelated:  Another cause o f the AE is more plausible (e.g., due to underlying disease 
or occurs commonly in the study population), or a temporal sequence 
cannot be established with the onset of the AE and administration of the 
study treatment, or a causal relationship is considered  biologically 
implausible  
Note: The Sponsor and/or the SMC may query the relationship assessments and/or determine 
that the event was related to additional components of the regimen.  
7.7.1.2  Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Investigator and s tudy personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during subject  
questioning, discovered during physical examination, laboratory testing and/or other means by 
recording them on the CRF and/or SAE form, as appropriate.  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
An open -ended or non -directed method of questioning should be used at each study visit to elicit 
the reporting of AEs. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The following information should be recorded on the Adverse Events and Medical History and 
Pre-existing Conditions CRF s: 
• Description including onset and resolution dates  
• Whether it met SAE criteria  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study treatment or other causality  
• Outcome  
Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 68 of 120 Diagnosis vs. Signs or Symptoms  
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual symptoms.  
Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each component sign and/or 
symptom is a medically confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by standard medical 
textbooks. If any aspect  of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, 
report the individual symptom as a separate AE. 
Recording Serious Adverse Events  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the CRF and an SAE form.  
The following should be considered w hen recording SAEs:  
● Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be recorded 
and reported on both an SAE form and CRF.  
● For hospitalizations, surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the surgical 
or diagnost ic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself. The 
procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in response to the 
illness.  
Progression of the Underlying Cancer  
Do not use the term ‘disease progression’ a lone when reporting AEs, including SAEs, because it 
is too nonspecific. Symptoms of disease progression that meet the criteria for an SAE must be 
reported. When possible, report the specific disease (clinical) manifestation of the progression 
(e.g., ‘malig nant pleural effusion’, ‘spinal bone metastases’, ‘lymphadenopathy’, ‘brain 
metastases’). Otherwise, it is acceptable to report the specific disease (e.g., non-small cell lung 
cancer ) as an SAE.  
Pregnancy  
Notification to Drug Safety: Complete a Pregnancy R eport Form for all pregnancies that occur 
from the time of first dose of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) until 12 months 
after the last dose of study drug including any pregnancies that occur in the partner of a male 
study subject . Only report pregnancies that occur in a male subject ’s partner if the estimated date 
of conception is after the male subject ’s first study drug dose. Email to the sponsor’s Drug Safety 
Department within 24 hours of becoming aware of a pregnancy. All pregnancies  will be 
monitored for the full duration; all perinatal and neonatal outcomes should be reported. Infants 
should be followed for a minimum of 6 months . 
Collection of data on the CRF: All pregnancies (as described above) that occur within 30 days of 
the las t dose of  study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) will also be recorded on the 
Adverse Events CRF.  
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should be reported as an SAE. 
Congenital anomalies or birth defects, as defined by the ‘serious’ criterion above (see definitions 
Section  7.7.1.1 ) should be reported as SAEs.  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 69 of 120 7.7.1.3  Reporting Periods for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The safety reporting period for all AEs and SAEs is from start of dosi ng of any study drug on 
Cycle 1 Day 1  to 30 days after last dose of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) . 
However, all study protocol -related AEs are to be recorded from the time of informed consent. 
All SAEs that occur after the safety repor ting period and are considered study treatment -related 
in the opinion of the investigator should also be reported to the sponsor.  
SAEs will be followed until significant changes return to baseline, the event stabilizes 
(recovering/resolving) or is no longe r considered clinically significant by the investigator, or the 
subject  dies or withdraws consent. All non -serious AEs will be followed through the safety 
reporting period. Certain non -serious AEs of interest may be followed until resolution  or return 
to baseline.  
Potential Hy's Law cases ( Appendix F) should be reported as  SAEs (even before all other  
possible causes of liver injury have been excluded).  
7.7.1.4  Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting  
Within 24 hours of observing or learnin g of an SAE, investigators are to report the event to the 
sponsor, regardless of the relationship of the event to the study treatment regimen.  
For initial SAE reports, available case details are to be recorded on an SAE form. At a minimum, 
the following sh ould be included:  
• Subject  number  
• Date of event onset  
• Description of the event  
• Study treatment, if known  
The completed SAE form is to be emailed to the sponsor’s representative  within 24  hours (see 
email specified on the SAE report form).  
Relevant follow -up information is to be submitted to the sponsor as soon as it becomes available.  
7.7.1.5  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
Investigators are required to report all SAEs, including anticipated SAEs, to the sponsor (see 
Section  7.7.1.4 ). 
The sponsor will report all SAEs to regulatory authorities as required per local regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
7.7.2  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest  inclu de absolute decreases in LVEF  10 percentage points 
from baseline , symptomatic heart failure, infusion -related reactions , and all  Grade 2 events of 
pneumonitis and/or interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis . 
Adverse events of special int erest  should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs when 
appropriate. When an event does not meet the criteria for an SAE, a form for AESIs should be 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 70 of 120 completed and submitted to the sponsor or sponsor safety representative. AESIs should continue 
to be foll owed until resolution or return to baseline.  
7.7.3  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Samples for clinical laboratory tests will be obtained at selected time points specified in the 
assessment schedule ( Appendix A) 
Clinical laboratory analyses may be performed at local laboratories. Any abnormalities in any of 
the laboratory parameters will be judged in relation to the reference ranges from the laboratory  
and to the clinical relevance assessed by the investigator.  
The following parameters will be determined: hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count 
(total and differential), RBC count, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular 
hemoglob in (MCH), and MCH concentration. Coagulation parameters such as PT, INR, and 
PTT/ aPTT  will also be required at specified time points ; also, additional coagulation tests may 
be done per institutional standards for subject s taking fulvestrant.  
The following  parameters will be measured: creatinine, urea (or blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), 
AST, ALT, ALP , lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, sodium, 
potassium, chloride, glucose, uric acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.  
Urine will be  screened for pH, glucose, ketones, blood, protein, and microscopy (if indicated).  
For female subject s of childbearing potential, screening for pregnancy will be performed at 
screening and at predetermined time points during the study. These tests will be done using the 
blood samples taken for clinical chemistry. A urine pregnancy test is also acceptable.  
7.7.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs measures include heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature. Vital 
signs will be recorded at selected time poin ts specified in the assessment schedule ( Appendix A) 
and done in a standardized manner (i.e., after the subject  has rested in the sitting position for 
5 minutes). Postdose assessments should be done within approximately 30  minutes of the end of 
the ZW25 infusion.  
7.7.5  Physical Examination  
Physical examinations should include assessments of the following body parts/systems: 
abdomen, extremities, head, heart, lungs,  neck, and neurological. Height will be measured only 
at screening. Weight will be measured as part of all physical examinations . 
7.7.6  ECOG Performance Status  
ECOG PS will be assessed at selected time points specified in the assessment schedule 
(Appendix A). The ECOG PS scores are described in Appendix E. 
7.7.7  Electrocardiogram

(Appendix A). The ECG will be re corded after at least a 10 -minute rest. The date and an overall 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 71 of 120 interpretation of the ECG will be recorded in the CRF. The interpretation of the ECG will be 
assessed as normal or abnormal, and if abnormal as clinically significant or not. If the ECG is 
considered abnormal and clinically significant, the abnormality must be recorded in the CRF. At 
least the following parameters should be assessed: heart rate, PR interval, QRS complex, and QTcF.  
7.7.8  Echocardiogram/MUGA  
Echocardiograms or MUGAs are recorded at sel ected time points specified in the assessment 
schedule ( Appendix A). Echocardiograms or MUGAs will be recorded locally and will be 
assessed for an estimate  of the ejection fraction. The same method must be used throughout the 
study. Management of left ventricular dysfunction is described in  Section  5.2.3.1  
7.8 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The efficacy planned for this study are widely used and generally recognized as reliable, 
accurate, and relevant to the disease condition.  
The safety measures that will be used in this tri al are considered standard procedures for 
evaluating the potential adverse effects of study medications.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments  are also common in clinical studies to help characterize dose -
exposure -response relationships.  
Immunogenicity is commonly a ssessed for biologics; therefore, standard tests will be performed 
to detect the possible presence of specific antibodies to ZW25 . 
8 DATA QUALITY CONTROL  AND QUALITY ASSURAN CE  
8.1 Audit and Inspection  
Study centers and study documentation may be subject to Qual ity Assurance audits during the 
course of the study by the sponsor or its nominated representative. In addition, inspections may 
be conducted by regulatory authorities or the Institutional Review Board (IRB)  / Independent 
Ethics Committee ( IEC) at their discretion.  
The investigator must permit the IRB/IEC, the sponsor’s auditors, and representatives from 
regulatory authorities to have direct access to all study -related documents and pertinent hospital 
or medical records for confirmation of data contained within the CRFs. Subject  confidentiality 
will be protected at all times.  
8.2 Monitoring  
Data for each subject  will be recorded on a CRF. Data collection must be completed for each 
subject  who signs an ICF and undergoes any screening assessment.  
In ac cordance with GCP and ICH guidelines, the study monitor will carry out source document 
verification at regular intervals to ensure that the data collected in the CRF are accurate and 
reliable. The frequency of monitoring visits will be as described in the Monitoring Plan but may 
be modified by  the rate of subject  recruitment.  
A clinical monitoring plan will detail the tasks to be completed at each monitoring visit. This 
will at least include the following:  

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland, Limited  - Confidential  Page 72 of 120 ● Site monitoring procedures including review of the ICF, source document review, source 
data verification, and review of CRF data  
● AE and SAE reporting  
● Investigational product receipt, ordering, preparation and administration, storage, 
documentation, accountability, dosing compliance, and return/destruction  
The monitoring visits also provide the sponsor with the opportunity to ensure the investigator’s 
obligations and all applicable ICH or health authority regulation requirements are being fulfilled.  
The investigator must permit the monitor direct access to a ll study -related documents and 
pertinent hospital or medical records for confirmation of data contained within the CRFs. Subject  
confidentiality will be protected at all times.  
8.3 Data Management and Coding  
Study centers will enter data directly into an electronic data capture system by completing the 
CRF via a secure internet connection. Data entered into the eCRF must be verifiable against 
source documents at the study center. Data to be recorded directly on the eCRF will be 
identified. Any changes to t he data entered into the electronic data capture system will be 
recorded in the audit trail and will be FDA 21 CFR  Part 115 compliant and/or other region -
specific electronic records regulatory requir ements.  
Medical coding will use Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) for 
concomitant diseases and AEs and WHO Drug Dictionary for medications.  
Missing or inconsistent data will be queried in the electronic data base to the investigator for  
clarification. Subsequent modifications to the database will be documented.  
8.4 Drug Accountability  
Each site will verify their inventory of study drug supplies throughout the study, and that study 
drug is received intact and in the correct amounts. The monit or may check the study supplies at 
each study center at any time during the study.  
The study monitor will ensure that the site has correctly documented the amount of the study 
drug received, dispensed, and returned on the dispensing log. A full drug accoun tability log will 
be maintained at the study center at all times. All discrepancies must be accounted for and 
documented.

number  of subjects planned for enrollment.  
Notes: Cohorts 1A through 1F are not necessarily sequential. ZW25 is given IV Q2W. Step -down dose level to 15  mg/kg Q2W 
or another dose level (not lower than 15 mg/kg) of ZW25 may be ev aluated if recommended by the SMC and approved by the 
sponsor.  palbociclib  is taken PO QD on Days 1 through 21 of each 28 -day cycle. There are no step -down doses for toxicity for 
fulvestrant.

dose of each component of study treatment (ZW25, palbociclib, and fulvestrant) over the first 
28 days of treatment , and was followed for the full DLT evaluation period,  unless the reason for 
not receiving required doses  or not being followed  was the occurrence of a DLT . Subject s who 
are considered not evaluable  for DLT  may be replaced. The probabilities of observing DLTs in a 
cohort of 6 subject s for Part 1 are summarized in  Table 10.

premenopausal women and perimenopausal women per institutional guidelines  
e After screening, all subsequent radiographic scans for disease assessments may be done within a ±7 -day time window and based on 8 -week interval s timed from Cycle 1 
Day 1. Initial responses should be confirmed , if feasible,  with a repeat scan 4 weeks (+1 -week window) following initial documentation of objective response.  The schedule of 
response assessments should not be adjusted after the confirm atory scan and should maintain the schedule of every 8 weeks timed from Cycle 1 Day 1 . Data on breast cancer 
serum tumor marker s, if monitored,  should  also be collected  at the time  of disease assessment . Screening bone scintigraphy should be done at the same time as screening 
disease assessment. For subject s with new lesions identified by post -baseline bone scintigraphy, targeted assessment by Xray, CT scan with bone windows, or MRI will be 
performed to co nfirm findings. After screening, brain scans will be required per protocol only for subject s with findings on the screening brain scan; for subject s without 
findings on the screening brain scan, subsequent brain scans will be done per institutional standar d of care.  
f May be done within 3 days before study drug administration; tests do not need to be repeated if done within the prior 3 days.  Notes: Height will be measured only at screening. 
Weight will be measured as part of all physical examinations. Additio nal coagulation tests may be done per institutional standards for subject s taking fulvestrant.

o Cycle 4 and every eve n-numbered cycle thereafter.  
p Optional biopsy at disease progression if subject  provides additional consent.  
q After screening, an echocardiogram/MUGA should be done at Cycle 3 Day 1 ( 7-day time window ; approximately 8 weeks after Cycle 1 Day 1), then all subsequent scans 
should be done every 12  weeks thereafter (Day 1 of Cycle 6, 9, 12, etc.) within a ±7 -day time window. An echocardiogram/MUGA is not required at EOT if  3 months since 
the previous scan . 
r Should take place as soon as possible after a subject  permanently stops all study treatment and definitely within 14 days after the last dose of study drug (ZW25, palbociclib, 
and/or fulvestrant).  
s The scans for these  assessments do not have to be perform ed at EOT if  4 weeks since the previous scans. If the scans were not done at the EOT visit or within the 4 weeks prior 
to the safety follow -up visit, these  assessments should be performed at the time of the safety follow -up visit .  
t AESIs should continue to be followed until resolution or return to baseline. Note: From the time of consent to immediately be fore the first dose of any study drug on Cycle 1 
Day 1, only study protocol -related AEs should be recorded. A protocol -related AE i s defined as an untoward medical event occurring as a result of a protocol mandated 
procedure.  
u Not required if  2 weeks since last sample.  
v Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than progressive disease or start of subsequent anticancer therapy will continue in follow -up with disease assessments 
approximately every 8 weeks  (± 7 days) after the previous scan  until disease progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy. If subjects enter this follow -up period before 
24-weeks have ela psed since the start of study treatment, a disease assessment must be done at 24 -weeks from the start of treatment (not required if ≤ 4 weeks since last disease 
assessment or if disease progression has already been documented). Responses that are initially  observed during this follow -up period should be confirmed with disease 
assessment 4 weeks (+1 week) later. Following progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy, disease assessments will  be discontinued, and subjects will enter long -
term follow -up for survival status. Data on survival will be collected via clinic visits (if feasible) or via telephone calls every 3 mon ths (±  7 days) after the last follow -up visit. 
Subjects may be discontinued from the study due to death, lost to follow -up, consent  withdrawal or study termination by sponsor.  
w Only if a subject had an ongoing anti -ZW25 ADA present at the safety follow -up visit. These will be discontinued after the resolution of ADA.

ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland , Limited  - Confidential  Page 91 of 120 APPENDIX D: RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TU MORS  
MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, subject s should be re -evaluated for response every 8  weeks. In  
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4  weeks 
following initial documentation of objective response.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) (Eisenhauer  2009 ). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in 
the RECIST version  1.1 criteria.  
Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x -ray, as >10 mm 
with CT scan, or ≥10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node  
must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and at follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial  
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
“Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurabili ty described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5  lesions in 
total, representative of  all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 

Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland , Limited  - Confidential  Page 92 of 120 circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reprod ucibly should be selected. 
Previously irradiated lesions should not be chosen as target lesions unless there has been 
evidence of progression since radiotherapy treatment was given. A sum of the diameters (longest 
for non -nodal lesions, short axis for noda l lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only 
the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further c haracterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesio ns and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All m easurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being fol lowed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and  surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
Magnetic resonance imaging is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).  
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappeara nce of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseli ne sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as ref erence the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
Study ZWI -ZW25 -202 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  
ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland , Limited  - Confidential  Page 93 of 120 smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new l esions is also 
considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
subject  to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease  (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or  unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or principal investigator).  
Evaluation of Best Overall Resp onse  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The subject ’s be st response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

not advised.  
Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stabl e disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death,

ZW25  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ireland , Limited  - Confidential  Page 97 of 120 APPENDIX F: LIVER SAFETY MONITOR ING AND ASSESSMENT  
The following recommendations are from the F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for 
Industry titled “Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation” issued July 2009  
(FDA Guidance for Industry 2009 ). 
Drug-induced hepatocellular in jury sufficient to cause hyperbilirubinemia  is associated with  a high 
rate of poor outcomes  (from 10 to 50% mortality or transplant)  (Zimmerman 1999 ). The potential 
for drug -induced liver injury can be  indicated by the following  2 observations  (also known as Hy’s 
Law):  
1. Increase in transaminase levels of > 3x ULN , with concurrent  increase bilirubin of 
>2x ULN  
2. No evidence of intra - or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated ALP) or 
Gilbert’s syndrome  (Temple 2006 ) 
Subjects with normal  baseline LFTs should undergo detailed testing for liver enzymes (including at 
least ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin [TBL ]) to confirm any  increase of serum ALT and/or AST 
>3x ULN OR bilirubin >2 × ULN. Subjects with elevated baseline LFTs ( i.e., those with liver 
metastases or Gilbert’s Syndrome) should undergo detailed testing to confirm any elevati on of AST 
and/or ALT >2x baseline.  Testing should be repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test 
results.  Symptoms suggestive  of liver injury (e.g., right upper quadrant pain or tenderness and/or 
eosinophilia >5%)  should also be assessed.   
Confirm ed abnormalities in liver function tests should be thoroughly characterized by obtaining 
appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history, physical examination and laboratory 
tests. Treatment discontinuation recommendations related to hepatic s afety are described in 
Section 5.2.3. Recommended monitoring  for subjects with confirmed hepatic abnormalities  
include s: 
• Repeat liver function  tests 2 to 3 times weekly. Frequency of testing can decrease to once 
a week or less if abnormalities stabilize  and/ or a  diagnosis has been made and does not 
require more frequent monitoring,  or the trial drug has been discontinued and the subject 
is asymptomatic.  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
• Obtain a history of concom itant drug use (including nonprescription medications and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets.  
• Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; 
NASH; h ypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin).  
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.

The efficacy follow -up will include the f ollowing assessments:  
● Disease assessment per RECIST 1.1 (CT/MRI scans, and breast cancer serum tumor markers [if being 
monitored]  
● Bone scan (scintigraphy): For subjects with new lesions identified by post -baseline bone scintigraphy, 
targeted assessment by X ray, CT scan with bone windows, or MRI will be performed to confirm 
findings.  
● Brain scan (MRI): After screening, brain scans will be required per protocol only for subjects with 
findings on the screening brain scan; for subjects without findings on the s creening brain scan, 
subsequent brain scans will be done per institutional standard of care.  
● ADA sample (only if a subject had an ongoing anti -ZW25 ADA present at safety follow -up visit):

subjects will enter long -term follow -up for survival status. Data on survival will be collected via clinic visits (if 
feasible) or via telephone calls every 3 months (± 7 days) after the last follow -up visit. Subjects may be 
discontinued fro m the study due to death, lost to follow -up, consent withdrawal or study termination by sponsor.

Synopsis , 
Section 3.1.4 ,

The total number of patients subjects  enrolled in the study will depend upon the number of dose levels of each of 
the components of the study treatment evaluated during Part 1 of the study ; if Part 2 is initiated; and whether 
each of the 2 stages in Part 2 are fully enrolled. In Part 1 of the study, the number of patients subjects  to be 
enrolled in a dose cohort is 6  DLT  evaluable patients subjects . Therefore, up to approximately 36 evaluable  
patients subjects  may be enrolled in Part 1 if both dose levels of ZW25 are tested in combination with all 3 dose 
levels of palbociclib. In Part 2 of the study, 15 efficacy evaluable patients (inclusive of efficacy evaluable Part 1 
patients at the dose lev el used in Part 2) will be enrolled in Stage 1 (N1) and 31  additional efficacy evaluable 
patients may be enrolled in Stage 2 (N2). Therefore, a total of 46  efficacy evaluable patients approximately 50 
subjects will be enrolled. Therefore, a total of up to a pproximately 86 subjects  may be enrolled across the entire 
study.  Clarification

 Section(s)  Change  Rationale  
In the event of increased liver function tests (LFTs) without explanation such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the patient may be discontinued from 
the study treatm ent at the investigator’s discretion. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized ratio (INR)  >1.5 (if 
INR testing is applicable/evaluated)  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appearance of symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
These treatment discontinuation recommendations are based on the FDA Guidance for Industry (FDA Guidance 
for Industry 2009 ). The recommendations are a basic guide to the investigator based on accumulated clinical 
experience with drugs in development and are not specific to clinical experience with ZW25. See Appendix F for 
recommended liver safety monitoring and assessment criteria in patients with elevations in ALT, AST, or 
bilirubin.

ADA samples (only if a subject had an ongoing anti -ZW25 ADA present at the safety follow -up visit). These 
will be discontinued after the resolution of ADA.  To allow monitoring for 
ZW25 ADA  after 
treatment discontinuation 
in case  the subject had  
ZW25 ADA present at the

Section 7.7.1.2  The language has been revised as follows:  
 
Diagnosis vs. Signs or Symptoms  
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual symptoms. Grouping of 
symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each component sign and/or symptom is a medically 
confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by standard medical textbooks. If any aspect of a sign or 
symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate AE.  
Important exceptions for this study are adverse reactions associated with the infusion of study drug. For infusion 
reactions, do not use the NCI -CTCAE terms of “cytokine release syndrome,” “acute infusion reaction,” or 
“allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.”  Instead, record each sign or symptom as an individual AE. If multiple 
signs or symptoms occur with a given infusio n-related event, each sign or symptom should be recorded 
separately with its level of severity.  
 To correctly reflect the 
procedure for reporting 
IRRs as AEs. Similar to 
other AEs, IRRs should be 
reported as diagnoses and 
not individual symptoms.  
Section 9.2 Updated the definition s of analysis  sets in the study  Clarification  
Section 9.3.1  Added the timing of primary efficacy analysis and clarified the timing of the final analyses  
The final analyses will be conducted after all patients have either completed all study visits per protocol or 
discontinued the study.  
The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted after all subjects in Part 2 have either reached a progression -
free survival time of at least 6 months or are considered to have a progressio n-free survival event (disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1, clinical progression or death) prior to 6 months, or are permanently censored for 
progression -free survival prior to 6 months. The final efficacy analyses will be conducted after all subjects have  
completed their treatment and the follow -up period or following study termination by the sponsor.  Clarification  
Section 9.3.5  All efficacy analyses will be conducted on the  mITT set and may be conducted on the measurable disease 
analysis sets unless otherwise specified. Efficacy for Part 1 of the study will be summarized descriptively by 
dose cohort. For Part 2 of the study, mITT subject s treated at the RD in Part 1 will be included in the analyses of 
efficacy.  Updated for consistency

Section 9.3.9.3  The frequency of AEs will be summarized by preferred term and SOC using counts and percentages. Multiple 
occurrences of the same AE within a patient subject  will be summarized only once at the most severe grade level 
for the time frame under consideration. For summaries by severity, only the worst grade for an AE will be 
counted for a particular patient subject . AEs occurring more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug (ZW25, 
palbociclib, and/or fulvestrant) will be excluded from summaries but included in data listings.

Evaluable for toxicity:  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with 
ZW25.  
Evaluable for objective response:  Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have 
received at least 1  cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
response. These patients will have their response c lassified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: 
Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of Cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions present at basel ine that are evaluable but do 
not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least 1  cycle of therapy, and have had their 
disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target disease. The response assessment is based on the

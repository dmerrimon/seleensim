2.0 BACKGROUND
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), was recently 
recognized as a distinct disease entity.  The term MCL was proposed in 1992 to unify previously 
defined subtypes of NHL, such as diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, 
intermediate differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, centrocytic lymphoma, and diffuse small 
cleaved cell lymphoma, into a single disease entity 1.  According to the International Lymphoma 
Study Group (ILSG), MCL represents 6% of all NHLs 2.  MCL is derived from a subset of naive 
pre-germinal center cells, andmay present with two cytological variants:  typical (lymphocytic) or 
blastic3-4.  In addition, there are three possible patterns of involvement:  mantle-zone, nodular or 
diffuse 4.  It has been suggested that the treatment response and survival of the diffuse and nodular 
patterns are worse than those involving the mantle cell zone.  Majlis et al reported 3-year survival 
rates for mantle-zone, nodular, and diffuse type of 100%, 50%, and 55% respectively 5.  The 
monoclonal B-cells express CD19, CD20, CD22, HLA-DR, CD5, surface IgM and, in most cases, 
surface IgD.  They are negative for CD23 and CD10 (CALLA) antigens 6.
The characteristic cytogenetic abnormality in MCL is the t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation.  Band 
11q23 includes the BCL-1 locus, which is the site of the PRAD1 (CCND1) gene encoding for cyclin 
D1.  This rearrangement results in translocation of the BCL-1 locus to the immunoglobulin heavy 
chain gene enhancer region located at 14q32, causing cyclin D1 over-expression.  Cyclin D1 
interacts with cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 to facilitate the progression of cell through G1 into 
S phase of proliferation 7.If Response is at least

Page 9 of 45MCL is one of the worst types of NHL since it incorporates some of the undesirable features of both 
low-grade and high-grade lymphomas, namely incurability and rapid course respectively 7.  Most of 
the patients present with advanced stage, high international prognostic index (IPI), and extranodal 
involvement.  The incidence of Stage III and IV varies between 75 to 90% of the patients 2, 4, 6-8.  In 
addition, there is a high incidence of extranodal involvement, the most common sites being bone 
marrow (61-79%), spleen (31-60%), liver (13-30%), peripheral blood (12-30%), and gastrointestinal 
tract (18-20%) 6-9.  Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in about 4% of the patients 
and is associated with poor prognosis 10.
The long-term survival for patients with MCL is generally poor, with only about 27% of the patients 
surviving 5 years after diagnosis and 11% of the patients being disease-free after 5 years.  In 
addition, the ILSG found no 5-year survivors with IPI index 4/5, placing MCL among the 
lymphomas with worse overall prognosis 2.  Despite response rates of 50% to 70% to different 
regimens, all patients eventually develop disease progression after chemotherapy, with the mean 
survival around 3 years 11. 
Several studies using combination chemotherapy with or without anthracyclines (CHOP or COP) 
showed responses between 56% and 90%, with CR rates ranging from 9% to 58%.  However, 
relapse-free survival was relatively short with average of 15 to 20 months.  Median survival in most 
studies ranged from 28 to 52 months 12.  Therapy with fludarabine alone or in combination with 
other chemotherapeutic agents has been tested in small trials.  In a recent study, Cohen et al obtained 
response rates of 66% (30% CR) in a study involving 30 patients treated with fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide.  The overall survival for patients receiving this combination as first line therapy 
has not been reached at 43 months, although failure- free survival was 28 months 13.  In another 
study involving 29 patients, Zinzani et al achieved a 63% overall response (28% CR) using 
fludarabine alone or in combination with idarubicin14.  Rituximab has also been tested in MCL.  
Igarashi et al treated 21 patients with refractory or relapsed MCL, achieving a 31% response rate 
(no CR observed) 15.  Howard et al obtained a 96% response rate (48%n CR) in 25 patients with 
MCL, using a combination of CHOP and rituximab.  25 patients were evaluated for molecular 
remission, which was seen in 9 of them.  However, the achievement of CR or molecular remission 
did not translate into a prolonged progression-free survival, which was 16.6 months 16.  Khouri et 
al, treated patients with Hyper-CVAD, an aggressive regimen alternating cycles of 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone and high-dose methotrexate and 
cytarabine.  This regimen induced a 93% response rate with 38% CR.  This therapy was followed 
by stem cell transplantation and 93% of previously untreated patients were alive at 3 years post-
transplant, 73% of them disease-free 19. 
Although encouraging results have been reported for stem cell transplant (SCT), its role in the 
treatment of patients with MCL remains unknown.  Overall 3-year survival for MCL patients 
previously treated ranges between 24% to 59%, with one study, performed by Milpied et al, 
reporting 80% overall survival at 4 years 20- 22.  Event-free survival (EFS) or progression-free 
survival (PFS) at three years however, ranges between 17% to 48%19, 22.  Stewart et al, reported a 
23% overall survival for SCT in MCL patients in first remission.  EFS/PFS however, was only 8% 
23.  There have been few small studies on the use of allogeneic SCT in MCL.  The reported overall 
survival is 55% to 62% at 2 years 24-25.

Page 10  of 45Due to unsatisfactory results obtained with both conventional chemotherapy and SCT, it has become 
clear that new high-dose intense chemotherapeutic regimens are needed to improve the survival 
rates for patients with MCL.  Similar intensity protocols have been used for treatment of Burkitt’s 
lymphoma.  Magrath treated patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma using the CODOX-M protocol, 
which consisted of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone, vincristine, high-dose 
methotrexate and intrathecal methotrexate, alternating with IVAC (ifosfamide, etoposide, high-dose 
cytarabine and intrathecal methotrexate).  This regimen resulted in excellent disease control and was 
relatively well tolerated in both children and adults 17.  Mead et al used this same regimen in 52 
patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma.  All patients developed grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and 64% of 
the patients developed grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia.  The only other significant side effect was 
mucositis, observed in about 40% of the cases 18. 
 We have therefore developed a similar intense protocol combining most of the agents that 
demonstrated activity in MCL in an attempt to provide a better disease control with improved 
response rates and overall survival.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been 
reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of 
patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis 
of hepatitis was approximately 4 months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one 
month after the last dose.
Patients achieving a complete remission to induction therapy will receive maintenance therapy with 
Rituximab for 3 years that was recently shown to prolong progression free survival in other subtypes 
of lymphoma.  
In an initial phase II study of R-MACLO-IVAM 22 patients were enrolled. 21 completed therapy 
and all achieved complete remission and one patient died of sepsis on day 14.  Seventeen patients 
remain alive and relapse-free with a median follow up of 33 months. Although the results are very 
promising, we did observe some toxicity, including grade 2 elevation of creatinine post methotrexate 
and intolerability of thalidomide in many patients. The proposed study comes to address these 
toxicities while trying to preserve regimen efficacy.

7.0 Agent Formulation and Procurement
7.1 Rituximab (Rituxan)
Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody that targets the CD20 antigen present during 
most phases of B cell development.
7.1.1 Drug preparation:  Rituximab is present in 100 and 500 mg single-use vials 
formulated in 25 nM sodium citrate. It should be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride 
or 5% dextrose to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL.
7.1.2 Administration:  This agent is given only by IV route. 
Infusion should be started at an initial rate of 50 mg/hour and, if no toxicity is 
observed during one hour, it should be escalated by increments of 50 mg/hour 
every 30 minutes to a maximum infusion rate of 300 mg/hour.  Patient should be 
monitored for infusion-related events, which usually occur 30 to 120 minutes 
after the start of the first infusion.  Infusion should be stopped immediately in the 
presence of signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.  Patients should then be 
treated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, and IV fluids.  In 
most cases, infusion can be restarted at 50% of the dose once symptoms have 
completely resolved.

There is also a risk of serious virus infections occurring after discontinuation of rituximab. 
The following serious viral infections new, reactivated or exacerbated have been 
identified: JC virus (progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy, PML), 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile 
virus and hepatitis C. In some cases the viral infections occurred up to one year following 
discontinuation of rituximab and have resulted in death.
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were 
observed in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma.
Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are at an increased risk for cardiovascular events 
compared to the general population. 3 cardiovascular deaths occurred in studies where 
patients with RA were treated with rituximab.

8.2 Response Criteria
8.2.1 CR requires the following:
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence 
of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before 
therapy, and normalization of those biochemical abnormalities (e.g. LDH) 
definitely assignable to NHL.
2. All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size.  
Previously involved nodes that were between 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their greatest 
transverse diameter before treatment must have decreased to < 1 cm in their 
greatest transverse diameter after treatment, or by >75% in the sum of the 
products of the greatest diameters (SPD) may be used to confirm CR.
3. The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis if a CT 
scan, must have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical exam.  
However, no normal size can be specified because of the difficulties in accurately 
evaluating splenic and hepatic sizes.  
4. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate 
must be cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on the same site. 
8.2.2 CR/unconfirmed (CR (u)) requires the following: 
1. Residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter 
that has regressed by more than 75% in the SPD.  Individual nodes that were 
previously confluent must have regressed by more than 75% in their SPD 
compared with the size of the original mass.

Page 30  of 452. Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggregates without 
cytologic or architectural atypia). 
8.2.3 PR requires the following:
1. > 50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.
2. No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3. Splenic or hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD.
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs 
is considered assessable and not measurable disease.
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for the determination of a PR because it 
is assessable and not measurable disease.
6. No new sites of disease.
8.2.4 Stable disease (SD) is defined as less than a PR but not a progressive disease
8.2.5 Relapsed disease (CR or CR (u)) requires the following:
1. Appearance of any new lesion or increase by > 50% in the size of previously 
involved sites.
2. > 50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node greater 
than 1 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of more than one node.
8.2.6 Progressive disease (PR or non-responders) requires the following:
1. > 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal 
node for PRs or non-responders.
2. Appearance of any new lesion during the end of therapy.
8.3 Duration of overall response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met 
for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.

Upon finishing therapy, patients will be followed at 6 month (+/- 30 days) intervals to 
document the progression-free interval.
9.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
9.1 Adverse Event (AE) Definitions
Adverse events (AE’s) will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0 in Appendix II.
9.1.1 A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical 
occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important 
medical events.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should 
also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
9.1.2 Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent.
9.1.3 An adverse event is considered unexpected when either the type of event or the 
severity of the event is not listed in: the current NCI Agent-Specific Adverse 
Event List; the investigator's brochure, drug package insert or the drug 
information section of this protocol.
9.1.4 The definition of related is that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse experience

medical treatment or procedure.  Attribution categories:
•Definite – The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent(s).
•Probable – The adverse event is likely related to the investigational 
agent(s).
•Possible – The adverse event may be related to the investigational 
agent(s).
•Unlikely – The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational 
agent(s).
•Unrelated – The adverse event is clearly NOT related  to the 
investigational agent(s).
9.1.6 Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained 
instead from a commercial source.
9.2 Purpose
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during a trial (please follow directions for routine reporting 
provided in the Data Reporting Section.  Additionally, certain adverse events must be 
reported in an expedited manner for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care.  
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.
9.2.1 Determination of Reporting Requirements 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the 
patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics 
of the adverse event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study 
therapy (attribution), and the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse 
event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization was associated with the event.
9.2.2 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner:
Step 1: Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 
(CTC) Version 3.0.
The CTC provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each 
adverse event listed. A copy of the CTC can be downloaded from the 
CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Additionally, if assistance is 
needed, the NCI has an Index to the CTC that provides help for

should have access to a copy of the CTC.
Step 2: Grade the event using the NCI CTC.
Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy 
(investigational or commercial).
Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, 
Probable, and Definite.
Step 4: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. 
Step 5: Review Table 9.3.1 to determine if there are any protocol-specific 
requirements for reporting of specific adverse events that require 
special monitoring.

10.0 DATA REPORTING
10.1 Records to be Kept
Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be provided for each subject.  Subjects must not be 
identified by name on any study documents.  Subjects will be identified by a Patient 
Identification Number upon registration.  
All data on the CRF must be legibly recorded in black ink or typed.  A correction should 
be made by striking through the incorrect entry with a single line and entering the correct 
information adjacent to it.  The correction must be initialed and dated by the investigator 
or designated qualified individual.  Any requested information that is not obtained as 
specified in the protocol should have an explanation noted on the CRF as to why the 
required information was not obtained.
11.0 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION OF THERAPY 
After enrollment, the patient will be permanently withdrawn from study treatment for any of the 
following reasons:
11.1 Patients developing a life-threatening infection who are in the chemotherapy portion of 
the protocol will have chemotherapy interrupted until the infectious process has cleared.  
The subject will be withdrawn from study treatment only if chemotherapy has been held 
for more than six weeks.
11.2 Chemotherapy delays for more than six weeks, for any reason.
11.3 Severe toxicities as previously outlined. (Refer to section 9.1)
11.4 Progressive lymphoma at any time while on study.
11.5 Voluntary withdrawal.
11.6 The investigator has the right to remove subjects from study for clinical reasons, which he 
or she believes to be life-threatening or resulting in significant morbidity to the subject.

Page 35  of 4512.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION
Since we expect all patients to experience complete or partial response to the therapy, we will use 
progression-free survival (PFS) as our primary endpoint to measure efficacy.  PFS is defined as the 
time from start of treatment to the earliest one of the following events: relapse (in patients who 
achieve complete response), disease progression (in patients with partial response or stable disease), 
or death.  (See section 7 for criteria for response, relapse, and disease progression.)   All patients 
who meet eligibility criteria and receive initial treatment will be evaluable for toxicity, progression, 
and survival; patients who complete at least cycles 1 and 2 of study treatment will be evaluable for 
response.
Study size and duration. Study size is limited by the availability of eligible patients, which we 
estimate to be about 4 patients per year.  We plan to enroll a total of approximately 28 patients in 
order to base our main analyses on at least 22 (79%) evaluable patients.  Consequently, our study 
will entail an enrollment period of approximately 6 years and a minimum follow up of two years 
beyond the last patient is enrolled.  The estimated total study duration for this trial will be 8 years.
Study precision.  It is expected that study treatment will extend the median time to disease 
progression to 24 months as compared with the current standard of approximately 18 months in this 
patient population.  Assuming an exponential distribution for time to disease progression, the 
anticipated effect of study treatment is equivalent to an (absolute) increase of 9% in the proportion 
of patients alive and progression-free at 18-months from a current rate of 50% to 59% on study.
Assuming no losses to follow-up and 22 evaluable patients, our estimate of the 18-month 
progression-free survival rate using the Kaplan-Meier method [26] will have a standard error of no 
more than11% [27]. 
The following table illustrates the precision of our study for several possible outcomes.

Page 36  of 45disease progression for at least 18 months from the start of treatment.  If this is the case, then 
our estimate of the 18-month progression free survival rate will be 60% and we will report a 
(two-sided) 95% confidence interval estimate of 39.5 to 80.5%.  
Statistical analysis: Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we will estimate both progression-free and 
overall survival rates at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals.  Medians, if attained, will be reported similarly.  The amount of patient follow-up will be 
characterized descriptively by the range and median for patients who experience the event 
(progression or death) and those who do not (censored observations). 
In addition to the analysis of progression-free and overall survival, patients will be classified by 
response to treatment according to the criteria in Section 7.  We will estimate the complete response 
(CR) rate with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the exact binomial method [28]; the 
relapse rate following CR will be estimated by the method of cumulative incidence.  A detailed 
tabulation will be given of the time to response and the duration of response for each response type.  
Since our study is small, only a very strong association could be detected between response status 
(complete versus partial) and either progression-free or overall survival.  We will use the log-rank 
test to explore this association. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for patient demographic variables (age, sex, and race) and for 
disease characteristics at baseline, including performance status.
Interim monitoring: The Research Team will continuously monitor study accruals, toxicities, and 
response to treatment.  The UM/Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will monitor this protocol according to the Cancer Center’s DSM 
Plan.  In its oversight capacity, the DSMC bears responsibility for suspending or terminating this 
study. DSMC oversight of the conduct of this trial includes ongoing review of accrual and adverse 
event data, and periodic review of response. The DSMC also reviews reports from internal audits of 
protocol compliance and data integrity conducted by the University of Miami, Office of Research 
Compliance Assessment. 
The guidelines appearing in this section are offered for DSMC consideration in its review of 
accumulating study data. These guidelines were developed using Bayesian methods, which can be 
applied at any stage of enrollment without advance specification of the number of interim analyses 
to be performed, or the number of evaluable patients at the time such assessments are made [29, 
30].Under the Bayesian method, we assign a prior probability (level of belief at the start of the trial) 
to a range of possible values for the endpoint being monitored.  As data on study patients become 
available, this probability distribution is revised and the resulting posterior probability becomes the 
basis for recommending either early termination or continuation of the study.
Safety: Early stopping due to toxicity
Since we expect that most patients will experience grade 4 toxicity, trial safety will be monitored 
on the basis of treatment-related mortality. We suggest that DSMC consider stopping the study early 
if there is evidence that treatment-related mortality exceeds a rate of 10%. More specifically, DSMC 
will have evidence in favor of early termination if the posterior probability is 80% or higher that the

Posterior probabilities used to derive the preceding table are calculated under a prior beta 
distribution with parameters 1 = 0.2 and 2 = 1.8, which corresponds to an expected rate of 10% 
based on prior information roughly equivalent to having studied 2 patients. Furthermore, this prior 
distribution assigns a small a priori chance (27%) to the possibility that the true rate of treatment-
related mortality is 10% or greater. 
Lack of efficacy: 
We do not propose early stopping guidelines for lack of efficacy, since this is a small study and the 
primary endpoint, PFS, requires substantial follow up. Thus, interim estimates of PFS prior to 
completion of study enrollment would be imprecise and would not provide a good basis for 
considering early termination. We note further that we expect nearly all patients to achieve complete 
response and this will be monitored closely by the study team for any unexpected findings.

SYNOPSIS:  
 
Primary objective:  
 To determine the clinical  benefit  rate (c omplete response, partial response, and stable 
disease at ≥ 4 months  using WHO criteria) of everolimus  in combination with 
bevacizumab for pa tients with chemotherapy  refractory sporadi c or neurofibromatosis 
type 1 (NF1) associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)  
 To evaluate the toxicity and safety of everolimus in combination with bevacizumab in 
individuals with MPNST  
 
Secondary  objectives:  
 To evaluate the spectrum of germline NF1 mutations in individuals with NF1 
associated MPNSTs  
 To explore the relationship between response to everolimus  in combination with 
bevacizumab and the presence of NF1 mutations or NF1 inactivation in MP NST 
tumor samples  
 To explore  differences in the response rate to everolimus in combination with 
bevacizumab in individuals with sporadic and NF1 associated MPNST  
 To assess preliminary correlations of radiographic response and progression with 
changes in pharmacodynamic parameters including S6K1 ( p70 S6 kinase 1 ), eIF4E, 
eIF2 alpha VEGF, VEGFR, Akt phosphorylation, and markers of cell metabolism in 
peripheral blood specimens  
 To evaluate the utility of three -dimensional MRI (3D -MRI) analysis in comparison to 
1-dimensional and 2 -dimensional measureme nts to more sensitively monitor response 
to everolimus  in combination with bevacizumab  
 
Hypothesis and rationale:  
The NF1 tumor suppressor regulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway 
activation, which app ears to be critical for the progression o f MPNSTs. The mTOR 
inhibitor sirolimus halts progression of MPNSTs for prolonged time periods in a murine 
genetically engineered NF1 MPNST model  and in a NF1 and sporadic mouse MPNST 
xenograft model. Angiogenesis co ntributes to the progression of MPNST, an d in the 
transgenic mouse model MPNSTs become ultimately resistant to treatment with 
rapamycin. The development of resistance is associated with re -vascularization and 
upregulation of vascular endothelial growth fac tor (VEGF). Preliminary preclinical data 
in the transgenic NF1 MPNST mouse model demonstrate prolonged survival for mice 
treated with rapamycin plus sunitinib, which in part, mediates anti -tumor activity by 
inhibition of angiogenesis, compared to mice trea ted with rapamycin or sunitinib alone 
(unpublished data K. Cichowski). These findings provide the rationale for our proposed 
phase 2 trial of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus  in combination with the angiogenesis 
inhibitor bevacizumab.  This trial will determ ine the activity of everolimus in 
combinat ion with bevacizumab in refractory MPNST and allow validation of the 
genetically engineered MPNST mouse model by preliminarily evaluating pathways

associated with response and disease progression. In addition, this trial will serve as a 
model for future co mbination trials of targeted agents for MPNST.  
 
Trial design:  
This is a two -stage phase 2 clinical trial with the objective to assess activity of the mTOR 
inhibitor everolimus in combination with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab in 
patients with spor adic and NF1 associated MPNSTs refractory after ≥ 1 prior cytotoxic 
chemotherapy regimen. The diagnosis of NF1 will be made based on clinical criteria. The 
primary endpoint is clinical benefit rate (PR, CR or stable disease at ≥ 4 months). All 
patients mee ting the eligibility criteria who have si gned a consent form and have begun 
treatment will be evaluable for response. Everolimus will be administered at a dose of 10 
mg po once daily on a continuous dosing schedule (28 days = 1 cycle). Bevacizumab will 
be administered IV at a dose of 10 mg/kg/dose every 14 days.  
 
Initially enrollment will be limited to patients ≥ 18 years old. Patients will be regularly 
monitored for everolimus and bevacizumab toxicity and response. Success will be 
defined as PR, CR, and S D at ≥ 4 months using WHO response criteria. A two -stage 
design will be used, and a clinical benefit rate of ≥  25% will be defined as success ruling 
out a <  5% clinical benefit rate.  
 
Numbers of subjects:  
Fifteen patients will be enrolled on the first stage, with no further accrual if no successes 
(PR, C R, and SD at ≥ 4 months) are observed within the first 15 patients. If at least one 
success is observed, accrual will continue until a total of 25 evaluable patients have been 
enrolled. If at least four successes are observed in the 25 patients everolimus in 
combination with bevacizumab will be considered active in that it would be consistent 
with a 25% success rate.  
 
Target population:  
Individuals  ≥ 18 years of age with adequate organ function and unresectable or metastatic 
MPNST who experienced progressi on after ≥ one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen 
will be eligible. Patients have to be able to swallow tablets. The protocol will be amended 
to allow enrollment of pediatric patients as soon as an ongoing pediatric phase I trial of 
everolimus and bevaci zumab has determined the pediatric phase II dose.  
 
Length of study:  
Patients will be able to remain on treatment for a maximum of 2 years as long as they do 
not experience progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. It is expected that 10 -15 
patients per  year will be enrolled, and enrollment is expected to complete within 
approximately 1 to 2 years depending on the number of responses observed in the initial 
stage.  
 
Study drugs:  
 Everolimus as 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg tablets  
 Bevacizumab: Supplied in vial s containing 400 mg bevacizumab

Dosing and administration:  
 Everolimus will be administered once daily at a dose of 10 mg on a continuous 
dosing schedule (1 cycle = 28 days)  
 Bevacizumab will be administered every 14 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV (1 
treatmen t cycle =28 days)  
 
Efficacy evaluations:  
Response evaluations (WHO) with appropriate imaging studies (MRI/CT) will be 
performed before the begin ning of every other treatment cycle ( 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).  
 
Safety:  
History and physical examination including vital signs will be regularly performed during 
treatment with everolimus and bevacizumab. Laboratory studies will include CBC with 
differential, fasting glucose and lipid panel, and a comprehensive chemistry panel .  
 
Molecular analysis:  
 Frozen tumor samples, if available, will be evaluated for NF1 mutation/inactivation.  
 Blood samples will be obtained for NF1 genotyping in patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of NF1 . 
 
Pharmacodynamics:  
Peripheral blood samples will be  collected prior to and s erially during treatment with 
everolimus for S6K1 (p70 S6 kinase 1), eIF4E, eIF2 alpha, VEGF, VEGFR, Akt 
phosphorylation, and markers of cell metabolism.  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
An evaluable patient will be classified a responder (s uccess) for the primary endpoint if 
the patient achieves a PR, CR or  stable disease at ≥ 4 months. The target clinical benefit 
rate will be 25%, and a clinical benefit rate <  5% will be considered uninteresting. Using 
a two -stage phase 2 design with 5.0% a s the value for a one -sided alpha, the first stage 
will require 15 p atients, with no further accrual if 0 of 15 respond. If > 1/15 patients 
respond accrual will continue until a total of 25 patients have been enrolled. If > 4/25 
patients respond, everolimus with addition of bevacizumab will be considered active in 
that it would be consistent with a 25% clinical benefit rate. Assuming the number of 
successes is binomially distributed, this design has a one sided alpha of 5.0% and a power 
of 90% for detecting a true success probability of at least 25% versus the null hypothes is 
success rate of 5% or less.

2. BACKGROUND : 
 
2.1 Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), (also called ne urogenic 
sarcomas, malignant schwannomas, neurofibrosarcomas) are soft tissue sarcomas, 
which  show nerve sheath differentiation and are associated with a high risk of 
local recurrence and hematogenous metastasis1. They account for 10% of all soft 
tissue sarcomas, and half of these malignancies arise in patients with 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)2.  
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant, progressive genetic 
disorder with an incidence of 1:3000 (>  80,000 persons affected in The United 
States).  Neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product, contains a domain with significant 
homology to ras GTPase -activating proteins (GAP)3. The ras proteins are integral 
in cell signaling pathways, and activation of ras leads to cell proliferation.  GAPs 
catalyze the hydrolysis of ras-GTP (th e active form of ras) to ras-GDP and lead 
to ras inactivation.  Patients with NF1 have decreased levels of neurofibromin,

which is associated with an activated ras-GTP status. Lack of functional 
neurofibromin can lead to dysregulated ras and tumorigenesis.  NF1 is 
characterized by diverse, progressive cutaneous, neurological, skeletal and 
neoplastic manifestations.  Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of developing 
tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system including plexiform 
neurofibromas (27 %) optic gliomas (15 -20%), pheochromocytomas (1%), and 
MPNSTs (5%)4,5.  
 
MPNSTs occur in about 2 -5% of patients with NF1 compared with an incidence 
of 0.001% in the general population1,6. However, in a large population based 
longitudinal study the lifetime risk of developing a MPNST in NF1 was 8 -13%4. 
In pat ients with NF1, the majority of MPNSTs arise in a previously clinically 
detectable plexiform neurofibroma, but they may develop in absence of 
preexisting tumors6-8. Early diagnosis of MPNSTs is cr ucial, as only complete 
surgical resection has been shown to be curative. However, the diagnosis of 
MPNSTs in patients with NF1 is difficult to establish, because clinical indicators 
of malignancy (mass and pain) may also be features of benign plexiform 
neurofibromas. Contr ast enhanced MRI9, and new imaging modalities like 
18FDG -PET10 are being evaluated for their potential to differentiate benign 
plexiform neurofibromas from MPNSTs.  The most frequent sites of metastasis of 
MPNSTs are lung, l iver, brain, soft tissue , bone, regional lymph nodes, and 
retroperitoneum6. 
 
Staging of MPNST:  As other soft tissue sarcomas (STS), MPNSTs are most 
commonly staged using the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging 
system11. In this system, four tumor grades are designated: Well differentiated 
(G1),  moderately differentiated  (G2), poorly differentiated (G3), and 
undifferentiated (G4). Poor prognostic factors for MPNST include: Tumor size > 
5 cm, deep location, high grade (G3, G4), presence of distant metastases at time 
of diagnosis, and radiation ind uced MPNST. In addition, b ased on a postoperative 
nomogram for the 12 -year sarcoma  specific death, the presence of MPNSTs 
carries the highest risk for sarcoma specific death compared to other histologic 
types of STS12.  
 
Epidemiology and outcome:  The epidemiology and outcome of NF1 associated 
MPNSTs may be different from sporadic MPNSTs, in that several studies report a 
younger age at diagnosis and worse prognosis for NF1 associated MPNSTs4,13. 
Reasons for the potentially worse outcome of NF1 associated MPNSTs are 
unknown.   Two studies indicate that NF1 associated MPNSTs may develop  more 
frequently as central, non -extremity lesions, which could impact on outcome, as 
central lesions are less amenable to surgery6,14. A recently published large 
retrospectiv e review of 126 individuals with MPNST treated on Italian and 
German studies between 1975 and 1998 described that response to chemotherapy 
was lower in NF1 -associated MPNSTs (3 of 17 individuals responded, =  17.6%), 
compared to sporadic MPNSTs (26 of 47 re sponded =  55.3%). Details regarding

the chemotherapy agents used were not provided13. Similarly, in a more recent 
study Ferrari et al reported described a 5 -year overall survival of 11 % for 27 
children with NF1 associated MPNST compared to 48 % for 44 patients with 
sporadic MPNST2. However, it is not clear that NF1 -related MPNSTs have a 
worse prognosis when adjusted for the known prognostic features. A recen tly 
published study, for example, describes excellent s urvival in MPNSTs with no 
difference between sporadic and NF1 associated tumors15. Potential reasons for 
the favorable survival compared to other reports  are not discussed in this 
manuscript, but 70% of the MPNSTs described were extremity lesions compared 
to 30% in central location.  Recently completed gene expression profiling of NF1 -
associated ( n=25) and sporadic (n=17) MPNSTs did not identify a molecula r 
signature that could reliably distinguish between both groups16. 
 
Molecular biology of MPNSTs:  Surgical specimens and cell lines from patients 
with MPNSTs and NF1 demonstrate complete inactivation of NF1 and high levels 
of ras activit y17-19. Benign ple xiform neurofibromas a lso demonstrate complete 
inactivation of NF1 with evidence suggesting that the Schwann cells represent the 
neoplastic element20-22, therefore additional genetic alterations and abnormalities 
of other biochemical pathways likely contribute to progression to malignancy. 
Immunohistochemical analysis and molecular studies have implicated p53, 
EGFR, p16, and p27 as potential contributors to malignant transformation in 
peripheral nerve  sheath tumors.  Gene expression profiling of human MPNSTs 
showed expression of EGFR in 16 of 42 (38%) of human16. Further highlighting 
the unique pathogenesis of this tumor type, both NF1 deletions and homozygous 
p16 deletions appear to be relatively restricted to MPNSTs in comparison to other 
spindle cell sar comas with overlapping morphologic features22. In addition, 
microarray analysis of MPNSTs recently identified topoisomerase II  (TOP2A) 
as the most overexpressed gene in MPNSTs compared  to benign neurofibromas, 
and TOP2A expressing tumors were associated with poor cancer specific survival 
and presence of metastasis23.  
 
Treatment of adult soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and MPNSTs:  Treatment of 
MPNST follows the treatment of other adult soft tissue sarcomas. Only complete  
surgical resection has been shown to be curative, and it remains the cornerstone of 
therapy11,24. The goal of surgery is to resect the MPNST with wide negative 
margins. However, the local recurrence rate of MPNST is high, and ranges from 
32-65%25. Radiotherapy is used in situations where the sarcoma is not amenable 
to surgical resection, but, when used as primary treatment, large  doses are needed 
and the control rate is only 30 -60%. Clinical trials have demonstrated that 
external beam radiation or brachytherapy in addition to limb sparing surgery 
improve local control in patients with soft tissue sarcoma s26,27. Adjuvant 
radiotherapy is thus recommended to improve local control for intermediate to 
high grade lesions > 5 cm after a marginal excision1,26,28.

The role of chem otherapy for MPNSTs has not been defined to date. Only 
doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and ifosfamide were consistently associated with 
response rates of 20% or more in  adults with soft tissue sarcomas and the 
combination of ifosfamide and doxorubicin has produ ced response rates as high 
as 46%29. However, adjuvant doxorubicin -based chemotherapy did not 
demonst rate statistically significant improvement in overall survival 29.  In 
patients with advanced, met astatic soft tissue sarcomas doxorubicin and 
ifosfamide have the highest activity.  The overall response rate for single agent 
doxorubicin was 19% (range 16 -27%), and for ifosfamide response rates of 36% 
and 28% have been reported29,30.  
 
Responses to chemotherapy have been described in children and a dults with 
MPNSTs31-33, but the response rate of MPNSTs to chemotherapy is unknown. 
They are thought to have intermediate chem osensitivity, less responsive than 
synovial sarcoma, but more responsive than refractory diseases such as alveolar 
soft part sarcoma34.  
 
A recent retrospective review of individuals with MPNSTs described les s 
response to chemotherapy for individuals with NF1 associated MPNSTs 
compared to sporadic MPNSTs13. 
 
Currently a Department of Defense sponsored, SARC coordinated, phase 2 
clinical trial is ongoing with  the primary obje ctive to prospectively determine the 
response rate of high grade unresectable chemotherapy naïve MPNST to standard 
chemotherapy agents (doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and etoposide) used to treat 
pediatric and adult patients. As the response to chemotherapy may differ between 
sporadic and NF1 associated tumors, this trial stratifies for the presence of 
sporadic versus NF1 associated MPNST.  Depending on its outcome this trial may 
serve in the future as a model for the addition of targeted therapi es for MPNST. In 
addition Children’s Oncology Group study ARST0332 (Risk -based treatment for 
non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) in patients under 30 years 
of age, PI Sheri Spunt) is ongoing, and enrolls patients with newly diagnosed NF1 
and sporadic MPNST. T reatment on this protocol includes, depending on the 
treatment arm, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy with doxorubicin and 
ifosfamide. This study will thus also provide additional information regarding 
treatment and outcome of sporadic and NF1 associate d MPNST.  
 
With increasing knowledge of the molecular biology of MPNST there is a strong 
rationale for the development of targeted treatment approaches for MPNST35.  A 
recently completed trial of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib for individuals with 
refractory MPNST based on EGFR expression in MPNSTs demonstrated lack of 
activity with 19/20 evaluable patients developing pr ogressive disease  at the time 
of the first response evaluation after completion of 2 treatment cycles36. This trial 
demonstrated the feasibility of conducting histology specific pha se 2 trials for 
MPNSTs. Similarly sorafenib, a raf kinase and RTK inhibitor, recently completed

evaluation in several sarcoma strata including refractory and metastatic 
MPNSTsma37. Sixteen patients with MPNST were enrolled. No partial or 
complete responses were observed, and progression free survival (PFS) was 1.7 
months (range, 1.3 to infinity), overal l survival was 4.9 months (range 3 months 
to infinity), and the Kaplan -Meier estimates for percent PFS at 3 and 6 months 
were 25% and  8%, respectively.  In another recently reported phase II trial of 
dasatinib (SARC009), which included a refractory MPNST s tratum, none of 12 
evaluable patients had a PR or CR, or stable disease at 4 months, and the median 
time to progression was 35 days38. Finally, in a phase II trial of imatinib for 
refractory sarcomas , including an MPNST stratum, of 6 patients with MPNST, 
who received imatinib, 4 had progressive disease at 2 months, 1 was  removed 
from the trial for toxicity early, and one withdrew from the study early39.  These  
studies highlight the need for the development of more effective targeted 
treatments for MPNST and provide justification for inclusion of stable disease  at 
4 months as a criterion for success.  
 
Recently, NF1was identified as a regulator of the mTOR pathwa y, and based on 
the data described in Section 2.3, we are proposing a phase 2 trial of the mTOR 
inhibitor everolimus in combination with the angiogenesis  inhibitor bevacizumab 
for refractory MPNST.  
 
2.2 Study agents: everolimus (Afinitor®/Votubia® ) and bevacizumab 
(Avastin®)  
Everolimus  is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin. Everolimus has been in 
clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant i n solid organ 
transplantation and has obtained marketing authorization (Certican ®) for 
prophylaxis of r ejection in renal and cardiac transplantation in a number of 
countries, including the majority of the European Union.  Everolimus has been in 
development for patients with various malignancies since 2002.  Everolimus was 
first approved under the trade Afinitor® for patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) and is now  approved in the EU and several other countries, as 
well as by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA granted 
accelerated approval in November 2010 for patients with subepen dymal giant cell 
astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) who require 
therapeutic intervention but are not candidates for curative surgical resection.  
Approval in patients with SEGA was based on a Phase II open label study in 
which 75% of patients experienced reductions of ≥ 30%, and 32.1% experienced 
reductions of ≥ 50%.  Range of time on study was reported as 4.7 to 47.1 months.  
It is noteworthy in the TSC setting in patients with angiomyolipoma (AML) that 
an international multicentre  Phase III placebo controlled study demonstrated a 
41.8% AML response rate among everolimus treated patients versus a 0% 
response rate among the placebo treated patients (p  < 0.0001).  Median time to 
angiomyolipmoma progression was 11.4 months in the place bo arm and was not 
reached in the everolimus arm, leading to regulatory approval in patients with 
AML.  Everolimus was later approved in 2011 for patients with advanced

neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (pNET) based on the results of a 
randomized, doub le-blind, multi -centre phase III study that showed a statistically 
significant clinical benefit over placebo with a median PFS of 11.0 months vs 4.6 
months, resulting in a 65% risk reduction in PFS.   
 
Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agen t based on its potential to 
act: 
 
 Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation  
 Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via  
potent inhibition of tumor cell HIF -1 activity, VEGF productio n and VEGF -
induced proliferation of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the 
maintenance of solid tumor growth is well established, and the mTOR 
pathway has been implicated in the regulation of tumor production of 
proangiogenic factors as well as  modulation of VEGFR signaling in 
endothelial cells.  
 
At weekly and daily schedules and at various doses explored, everolimus is 
generally well tolerated.  The most frequent adverse events (incidence ≥ 10% and 
suspected to be related to treatment by the investigator) were infections, 
stomatitis, pyrexia, acneiform dermatitis, diarrhea, acne, cough, 
hypertriglyceridemia, and decreased white blood cell count.   The only grade 3 
adverse reactions were infe ctions (single cases of sinusitis, pneumonia, tooth 
infection, and viral bronchitis), and single cases of stomatitis and decreased white 
blood cell count.  No Grade 4 adverse events were reported.  
 
mTOR pathway and mechanism of action  
At a cellular and m olecular level everolimus acts as a signal transduction 
inhibitor. Everolimus selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of 
rapamycin), a key and a highly conservative serine -threonine kinase, which is 
present in all cells and is a central regulator of p rotein synthesis and ultimately 
cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and cell survival. mTOR is the only 
currently known target of everolimus40.  
 
mTOR is downstream of  PI3K/AKT pathway, a pathway known to be 
dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers (e.g. through loss/mutation of 
the PTEN negative regulator; through PI3K mutation/amplification; through 
AKT/PKB overexpression/overactivation; through modulation of TSC1/TSC2 
tumor suppressors). In addition, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is 
frequently a characteristic of worsening prognosis through increased 
aggressiveness, resistance to treatment and progression.  
The main known functions of mTOR include th e following40,41: 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  21 
 mTOR functions as a sensor of m itogens, growth factors and energy and 
nutrient levels, facilitating cell -cycle progression from G1 to S phase in 
appropriate growth conditions.  
 The PI3K -mTOR pathway  itself is frequently activated in many human 
cancers, and oncogenic transformation may se nsitize tumor cells to mTOR 
inhibitors.  
 Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins (4E -
BP1) and activating the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i .e., p70S6K1), mTOR 
regulates translation of important massages, including those encoding the 
HIF-1 proteins, c -myc, ornithine decarboxylase, and cyclin D1, as well as 
ribosomal proteins themselves.  
 The activation of mTOR pathway leads to the increased pr oduction of pro -
angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF) in tumors and to tumor, endothelial and 
smooth muscle cell growth and proliferation.  
 The regulation of mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive 
regulators, such as AKT that phosphorylate and inactivate  negative regulators 
such as the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC1/TSC2).  
 
mTOR is repres ented by two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein 
signaling complexes, mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1, rapamycin sensitive) and 
mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2, rapamycin insensitive).  
 
mTORC1 is mainly activated via the PI3 kinase pathway through AKT (also 
known as PKB, protein kinase B) and the tuberous sclerosis complex 
(TSC1/TSC2)41. Activated AKT phosphorylates TSC2, which lead to the  
dissociation of TSC1/TSC2 complex, thus inhibitin g the ability of TSC2 to act as 
a GTPase activating protein.  This allows Rheb, a small G -protein, to remain in a 
GTP bound state and to activate mTORC1. AKT can also activate mTORC1 by 
PRAS40 phosphorylation, thereby relieving the PRAS40 -mediated inhibiti on of 
mTORC142.  
 
mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) is activated through a currently unknown 
mechanism, possibly by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling42.  It has been 
suggested that mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates a different pool of AKT  
that is not upstream of mTORC1. PHLPP phosphatase  plays a role of a negative 
regulator. mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive and is required for the organization 
of the actin cytoskeleton43. 
 
mTORC1 -mediated signaling is subject to modulation by the macrocyclic lactone 
rapamycin and its derivatives, such as everolimus.  Once these agents bind to the 
12 kDa cytosolic FK506 -binding protein immunophilin FKBP12, the resulting 
rapamycin -FKBP12 complexes bind to a specific site near the catalytic domain of 
mTORC1 and inhibit phosphorylation of mTOR substrates. As a consequence, 
downstream signaling events involved in regulation of the G1 to S -phase

transition are inhibited. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the 
immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin as well as its putative antineoplastic 
activity44. As many cancers are characterized by dysregulation of G1 transit (for 
example, overexpression of cyclin or cyclin -dependent kinases) , inhibition of 
mTOR becomes an intriguing target for inducing cytostasis41. 
 
Preclinical studies   
Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that everolimus is a potent inhibitor 
of the proliferation of a broad range of human tumor cell lines in-vitro with IC50s 
ranging from sub/low  nM to μM concentrations, concentrations capable of being 
reached in patients at the doses used in clinical trials.   
 
Everolimus was shown to have activity in human tumor cell lines originating from 
lung, breast, prostate, colon, kidney, melanoma and glioblastoma. Everolimus was 
also shown to have activity in human pancreatic neuroendocrine cells, w here 
induction of apoptosis was reported45, as well as in acute myeloid leukemia cell46, 
adult T -cell leukemia cells47, diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells48, pancreatic 
tumor cells49, ovarian cancer cells50 and hepatocellular carcinoma cells51.  
 
As a single agent, everolimus inhibited proliferation in three mantle  cell 
lymphoma cell lines (Jeko1, SP49 and NCEB1) a pproximately 40 –65% compared 
to control cells. This was associated with G1 cell -cycle arrest and reduced 
phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream target, 4E -BP152.  
 
In a clonogenic assay using cells derived from 81 patien t-derived tumor 
xenografts never cultured in vitro  (11 human tumor types with 3 to 24 tumors 
each: bladder, colon, gastric, NSCLC [adeno, squamous epithelium and large 
cell], SCLC, breast, ovary, pancreatic, renal, melanoma, and 
pleuramesothelioma), everol imus inhibited colony formation in a concentration -
dependent manner. In addition, normal hematopoetic stem cells were insensitive 
to everolimus, with an IC50 about 15 fold higher than the tumor lines.  
 
Everolimus also inhibits the proliferation of human u mbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECS), with partic ular potency against VEGF -induced proliferation. 
The inhibition of endothelial proliferation and antiangiogenic activity of 
everolimus was confirmed in vivo , as everolimus selectively inhibited VEGF -
depe ndent angiogenic response.  Mice with primary and metastatic tumors treated 
with everolimus showed a significant reduction in blood vessel density when 
compared to controls at well tolerated doses. Additionally, activity in a VEGF -
impregnated s.c. implant model of angiogenesis and reduced vascularity (vessel 
density) of everolimus -treated tumors (murine melanoma) provided evidence of in 
vivo effects of angiogenesis.  
 
Everolimus also  inhibits tumor growth  in-vivo in xenografted, syngeneic and 
orthotopic animal models, residing longer in tumor tissue than in plasma and

demonstrating high tumor penetration in a rat pancreatic tumor model. These 
effects occurred within the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg p.o. daily. Ty pically, the 
antitumor activity of everolimus monotherapy was that of reduction of tumor 
growth rates rather than producing regressions or stable disease.  
 
Everolimus, administered p.o., was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth and well 
tolerated in:  
 s.c. mo use xenograft model, established from a variety of tumor cell lines of 
diverse histotypes (NSCLC, pan creatic, colon, melanoma, epidermoid), 
including a Pgp170 overexpressing multi -drug resistant tumor line  
 in a series of low -passage tumor xenografts estab lished directly from human 
tumor material, maintained only in vivo  and considered highly predictive o f 
therapeutic outcome in patients. These included breast (5 lines), colorectal (9 
lines), gastric (3 lines), lung (22 lines including adenocarcinomas, epid ermoid 
cell, large cell and small cell histotypes), melanoma (6 lines), ovarian (4 
lines), pancreatic  (3 lines) and renal (6 lines)  
 in two syngeneic models (CA20948 rat pancreatic, B16/Bl6 mouse orthotopic 
melanoma)  
Taken together, these data indicate the broad antiproliferative potential of 
everolimus.  
 
It is not clear which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells 
to everolimus. Molecular analysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to 
everolimus in vitro correlates with the degree of phosphorylation (activation) of 
the AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 ribosomal protein. PTEN sta tus alone 
may not be predictive of everolimus relative in vitro sensitivity,  however in some 
cases (i.e., GBM) there is also a correlation with PTEN status.   
 
In preclinical models, the administration of everolimus is associated with 
reduction of protein phosphorylation in target proteins downstream of mTOR, 
notably phosphorylate d S6 (pS6) and p4E -BP1, and occasionally with an increase 
in phosphorylation AKT (pAKT).   
 
Preclinical safety  
In safety pharmacology studies, everolimus was devoid of relevant effe cts on vital 
functions including the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous  systems. 
Everolimus had no influence on QT interval prolongation. Furthermore, 
everolimus showed no antigenic potential. Although everolimus passes the blood -
brain barrier, there  was no indication of relevant changes in the behavior of 
rodents, even after single oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg or after repeated 
administration at up to 40 mg/kg/day. Based on these findings, the potential of 
everolimus to affect vital functions in patie nts is considered to be low.   
 
Everolimus is considered to have no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity potential.

All significant adverse events observed in preclinical toxicology studies with 
everolimus in mice, rats, monkeys and minipigs were consistent wi th its 
anticipated pharmacologic action as an antiproliferative and immunosuppressant 
and at least in part reversible after a 2  or 4-week recovery period with the 
exception of the changes in male reproductive organs, most notably testes. Ocular 
effects (le nticular disorders) observed in rats were not observed in any other 
species and are considered to be a species -specific disorder.

Clinical experience  
Everolimus Pharmacokinetics: everolimus is rapidly absorbed wi th a median 
Tmax of 1-2 hours. The bioavailability of the drug is believed to be 11% or greater. 
The AUC 0-τ is dose -proportional over the dose range between 5 to 70 mg in the 
weekly regimen and 5 and 10 mg in the daily regimen. C max is dose -proportional 
between 5 and 10 mg for both the weekly and daily regimens. At doses of 20 
mg/week and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose -proportional. The 
coefficient of variation between patients is approximately 50%.  
 
Trough levels (24 hour post -dose) corre late well with AUC 0-τ at steady -state 
during daily administration.   
 
In whole blood, at a daily dose of 1 0 mg, about 20% of everolimus is confined in 
plasma with 26% being unbound. The remaining 80% is sequestered in blood 
cells.   
 
Everolimus is extensively metabolized in the liver and eliminated in the bile. 
Major metabolites are inactive. Elimination half -life is approximately 30 hours. 
The clearance of everolimus is approximately halved in patients with mild -
moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A or B), while renal impairment 
has little or no impact on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus.   
 
Age, w eight and gender in the adult population do not affect the pharmacokinetics 
of everolimus to a clinically relevant extent. The clearance of ev erolimus is 
reduced in children.  
 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics are not notably different between Caucasian and  
Japanese subjects, whereas in Black patients population pharmacokinetic studies 
have shown an average 20% higher clearance.  
 
A high -fat meal altered the absorption of everolimus with 1.3 hour delay in T max, 
a 60% reduction in C max and a 16% reduction in A UC.  
 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and a substrate and a moderate inhibitor of 
the multi -drug efflux pump P -glycoprotein (P -gP, MDR1, ABCB1). Hence, its

metabolism is sensitive to drugs which modify these enzymes (substrates, 
inducers, or inhibitor s of these enzymes).  Competitive inhibition could occur 
when everolimus is combined with drugs which are also CYP3A4 or P -
glycoprotein substr ates.  
 
Appendix II lists examples of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibitors and inducers.  
 
Please refer to section 3.2.14 for  more information on the concomitant use of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers and other medications.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling based on inhibition of the 
biomarker p70S6 kinase 1 [S6K1]54 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
suggests that 5 -10 mg daily should be an adequate dose to produce a high -degree 
of sustained target inhibition55.  Furthermore, molecular pharmacodynamic 
(MPD) studies, using immunocytochemistry (IHC) in biopsied tumor tissue, 
assessed the degree of inhibition and its duration for pS6, p4E -BP1 and pAKT 
expression with the daily and  weekly dosing. There was high inhibition of the 
downstream markers S6K1 and 4E -BP1 at 5 mg/day, which was complete at 10 
mg/day, while preliminary results suggest increase in pAKT expression with 
maximal effect at 10 mg daily56.

Clinical studies with everolimus   
Everolimus has been investigated as a component of multi -drug 
immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation since 1996 and was approved 
for the indication of prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving an 
allogeneic renal or cardiac transplant on 8 Jul 2003 by the European Union under 
the trade name of Certican ®. The most frequent adverse drug reactions in this 
context are highly specific to the transplant context.  However, certain events are 
generalizable, most notably myelosuppression, skin disorders and increases in 
blood lipid levels.  
Everolimus (everolimus) was approved by th e FDA in March 2009 for the 
treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma for patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.  It was also 
approved as previously noted in 2010 for patients with SEGA wi th TC who 
require therapeutic intervention but are not candidates for curative surgical 
resection and in 2011 for patients with pNET.  It is also FDA approved for lung 
neuroendocrine  tumors and Waldenström’s  macroglobulinemia/ 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

Everolimus  has been in development for patients with cancer since 2002. 
Everolimus 5  mg and 10  mg tablets were recently approved under the trade name 
Afinitor ® for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in the US, EU and 
several other countries a nd is undergoing registration in other regions worldwide.  
Phase I dose escalating studies, exploratory Phase I/II studies with everolimus as 
single agent or in combination with other anti -cancer agents, Phase II/III studies 
of everolimus in indications, and Phas e III double -blind studies are contributing to 
the extensive database.  Approximately 18,730 patients have  been treated with 
everolimus as of 30 -September 2011:  
• 9,528 patients in Novartis -sponsored clinical trials  
• 2,559 patients in the single pat ients use IND program  
• 6,638 patients in investigator -sponsored studies  
• In addition, healthy volunteer subjects and hepatically impaired non -oncology 
subjects have participated in the clinical pharmacology studies  
 
As of 23 Nov 2011, there are a total  of 8 Phase III  trials ongoing in the indications 
mRCC (1), advanced GEP -NET (3), breast cancer (1), DLBCL (1) and, 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (1).  
 
Recent approvals of everolimus were based upon a Phase III, international, 
multicenter randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study [C2240] in 
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) whose disease had 
progressed despite prior treatment with VEGFR -TKI (vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. Progression -free survival (PF S) 
assessed via a blinded, independent central review, was the primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints included safety, objective tumor response  
 
In the pivotal, Phase III study, which included patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma, the mo st common adverse reactions (incidence ≥  10%) were 
stomatitis, rash, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, mucosal 
inflammation, vomiting, pneumonitis, cough, peripheral edema, infections, dry 
skin, epistaxis, pruritus, and dyspnea. The most common gra de 3-4 adverse 
reactions (incidence ≥  2%) were infections, stomatitis, fatigue, and pneumonitis. 
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including 
everolimus and some of these cases have been severe and on rare occasions, fat al 
outcomes have been observed. Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and 
may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral or protozoan infections, 
including infections with opportunistic pathogens.  Localized and systemic 
infections, including pn eumon ia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal 
infections, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis and viral infections including 
reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients taking

everolimus.  Some of these infections have been s evere  (e.g. leading to respiratory 
or hepatic failure) and occasionally have had a fatal outcome.  
The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence ≥  50%) were anemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and 
increased creatinine. The most common grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities 
(incidence ≥  3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, 
and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), 
infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure ( 0.4%) were observed on the everolimus 
arm. The rates of treatment -emergent adverse reactions resulting in permanent 
discontinuation were 7% and 0% for the everolimus and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively.  
Overall, safety data available from completed , controlled and uncontrolled studies 
are consistent with the aforementioned findings of the Phase III trial. Everolimus 
is generally well tolerated at weekly and daily dose schedules. The safety profile 
is characterized by manageable adverse events (AEs).  These AEs are generally 
reversible and non -cumulative.  
For more information on known undesirable effects of everolimus refer to Section 
8.1.6.  
 
A phase 1 study of everolimus in pediatric patients with refractory cancers was 
recently performed, and determ ined a dose of 5 mg/m2/dose once daily on a 
continuous dosing schedule as the recommended phase 2 dose57. Of 26 patients 
enrolled, 18 were assessable for toxicity, and the toxicity profile was similar to 
that in adult s. Dose -limiting toxicities at the 6.5 mg/m2 dose level were mucositis 
(n=1), di arrhea (n=1), and LALT elevation (n=1). The pharmacokinetics of 
everolimus in children were similar to those in adults. For more information on 
known undesirable effects of eve rolimus refer to Section 8.1.6.  
 
Impaired renal function is not expected to inf luence everolimus pharmacokinetics 
based on the fact that ≤ t percent of radioactivity was excreted in urine in the mass 
balance study in maintenance renal transplant patients CP Study.  According to 
the IB, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients wit h renal impair ment.  
Further detailed information regardi ng everolimus clinical development, safety 
and efficacy is provided in the Investigator Brochure53. 
 
Bevacizumab (rhuMAb) is a recombinant humanized anti -VEGF monoclonal 
antibody composed of human IgG1 framework regions and antigen -binding 
complementarily -determining regions from a murine monoclonal antibody 
(muMAb VEGF A.4.6.1) which blocks the binding of human VEGF to its 
receptors. Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence, including most of the 
antibody framework, is derived from human IgG 1, and ~7% of the sequence is 
derived from the murine antibody.

Bevacizumab has been approved by the FDA as first line therapy in combination 
with chemotherapy for treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer or 
unresectable, loc ally advanced, recurrent or metastatic, non -squamous non -small 
cell lung cancer because of improved overall survival in the patients receiving 
combination therapy as compared to receiving chemotherapy alone. These lines 
of evidence demonstrate that bevaciz umab is clinically effective when combined 
with chemotherap y.  
 
Preclinical studies:  In cynomolgus monkeys, twice weekly IV treatments with 
bevacizumab (doses of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg) for 4, 13 or 26 weeks were well 
tolerated, with no overt signs of acute to xicity58.  Animals with open growth 
plates showed physeal dysplasia as well as focal to diffuse  chondroid necrosis and 
linear fissuring of the cartilaginous growth plate. Females treated with 10 -
50mg/kg twice weekly had decreased ovarian and uterine weights, which were 
associated with absence of corpora lutea. These findings were expected, 
consideri ng the known role of VEGF in formation of the corpora lutea and of the 
growing bone59.  A further study using a similar treatment regimen, in the 
recovery period the physeal dysplasia and ovarian and uterine changes induced by 
rhuMAb VEGF were partially reversible. No antibodies against bevacizumab 
were detected.  
 
Clinic al studies in adults:  Two phase -1 studies have been performed. Study 
AVF0737g was a dose escalation trial of single and multiple intravenous (IV) 
administration of rhuMAb in patients with advanced malignancies. Five dose 
levels were evaluated (0.1, 0.3, 1. 0, 3.0, and 10mg/kg). rhuMAb VEGF was 
administered as a 90 -minute infusion on days 0, 28, 35 and 4260. Study 
AVF0761g evaluated multiple doses of rhuMAb VEGF 3 mg/kg weekly for up to 
8 weeks in combination with one of three cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (5 -
fluorouracil/leucovorin, carboplatin/paclitaxel, or doxo rubicin) in subjects with 
advanced solid malignancies61. rhuMAb VEGF was administered as eight weekly 
doses of 3mg/kg.  
 
In both studies, rhuMAb VEGF appeared to be well tolerated. In study 
AVF0737g, 3 of 25 patients treated experienced tumor -related hemorrhagic 
events, possibly related to the administration of rhuMAb VEGF. In two cases the 
event was considered serious: an i ntracranial hemorrhage (at an occult cerebral 
metastasis) in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding at the tumor 
site in a 38 -year-old woman with a slowly progressing sarcoma of the thigh. No 
patient in AVF0761g reported serious bleeding. No dose limiting toxicity was 
reached in either study. No antibodies to rhuMAb VEGF were detected after 
therapy in either study. Three subjects from each study subsequently enrolled in 
the extension study.  
 
Pharmacokinetics:  In study AVF0737g, the pharmacokinetics of rhuMAb VEGF 
appeared to be linear for doses  1mg/ kg with a half -life of approximately 15

days. Comparable pharmacokinetic data was seen in study AVF0761g. Co -
administration of rhuMAb and cytotoxic chemotherapy d id not appear to result in 
a change in the systemic concentration of the cytotoxic agents.

Response rates were 17%, 40% (p=. 03) and 24% (p= .23), respectively.  A 
prolonged time to di sease progression was seen in patients treated with rhuMAb 
VEGF 5mg/kg in combination with chemotherapy (9.0 months p=.005) compared 
with those who received rhuMAb VEGF 10mg/kg (7.2 months p= .217) , or 
chemotherapy alone (5.2  months)62.  
The anti -VEGF antibody Bevacizumab (rhuMAb) was evaluated as a single agent 
in several malignancies including  CRPC61. In a Phase 2 trial 15 patients with 
CRPC were treated with 10 mg/kg every 14 days. Results of the study showed 
that though the drug was tolerated well, there were no sign ificant objective 
responses.  
Toxicities : The following are the important toxicities. The detailed inform ation 
can be seen in Section 8.2.8 .  
 Infusion -Related  Reaction s: Infusion reactions with bevacizumab were 
uncommon (<  3%) and rarely severe (0.2%).  Infusion reactions may 
include rash, urticaria, fever, rigors, hypertension, hypotension, wheezing, 
or hy poxia. Currently, there is no adequate information on the safety of 
retreatment with bevacizumab in patients who have experienced severe 
infusion -related reactions.  
 
 Hemorrhage:  Life threatening hemorrhage was seen in a Phase 1 trial 
(AVF0737g) in the fo rm of an intracranial hemorrhage (at a cerebral 
metastasis) in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and in the Phase 2 
study (AVF0757g) in the form o f massive hemoptysis or hematemesis. 
There were 6 life -threatening hemorrhages among 66 patients receivi ng 
rhuMAb VEGF -treated patients of which four of these events were fatal. 
An analysis of possible risk factors for life -threatening bleeding identified 
squamous cell histology as a risk factor (4 of 6 bleeds occurred in patients 
with squamous cell histolog y whereas only 13 of 66 rhuMAb VEGF -
treated patients had squamous histology). A number of investigations were 
performed on two of the patients with pulm onary hemorrhage and in eight 
patients in AVF0780g receiving rhuMAb VEGF including platelet count, 
proth rombin time, activated prothrombin time, fibrinogen, bleeding time, 
euglobulin clot lysis, d -dimer, alpha2 -antiplasmin, PFA -100 (a platelet 
function ass ay) and these were all within normal range (Novotny,W. 
Genentech Inc . personal communication).  
 
Overall, grade 3 and 4 bleeding events were observed in 4.0% of 1 ,132 
patients treated with bevacizumab in a pooled database from eight phase 1, 
II, and III clinical trials in multiple tumor types (bevacizumab Investigator 
Brochure, October 2005).  The hemorrhagi c events that have been 
observed in bevacizumab clinical st udies were predominantly tumor -
associated hemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage.  
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  31 
Mucocutaneus hemorrhage : Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage has b een seen in 20% -40% of patients treated 
with bevacizumab. Th ese were most commonly NCI -CTC Grade 1 
epistaxis that lasted less than 5 minutes, resolved without medical 
intervention and did not require any changes in bevacizumab treatment 
regimen.  There hav e also been less common events of minor 
mucocutaneous hemorr hage in other locations, such as gingival bleeding 
and vaginal bleeding.  
Tumor -associated hemorrhage :  Major or massive pulmonary 
hemorrhage/hemoptysis has been observed primarily in patients wit h 
NSCLC.  In a phase 2 study in NSCLC, 6 cases of life-threatening (4 fatal) 
hemoptysis were reported among 66 patients treated with bevacizumab 
and chemotherapy63; squamous cell histology was identified as t he ris k 
factor. In the phas e III trial in non -squamous NSCLC (E4599), the rate of 
Grade ≥ 3 pulmonary hemorrhage was <1% in the control arm 
(carboplatin/paclitaxel) versus 2.3% in the chemotherapy plus 
bevacizumab arm (10/427 patients, including 7 deaths) . 
Gastrointestinal hemorrhages , including rectal bleeding and melaena have 
been reported in patients with colorectal cancer, and have been assessed as 
tumor -associated hemorrhages. In the pivotal phase 3 trial in advanced 
colorectal cancer, the rate of GI h emorrhage (all grades) was 24% in the 
IFL/bevacizumab arm compared to 6% in the IFL arm; grade 3 -4 
hemorrhage was 3.1% for IFL/bevacizumab and 2.5% for IFL.   
Serious tumor associated bleedings have also been observed in patients 
with pancreatic cancer, ga stric cancer, CNS metastase s, hepatoma, or 
varices treated with bevacizumab.  
 
 Thrombosis:  Both venous and arterial thromboembolic (TE) events, 
ranging in severity from catheter -associated phlebitis to fatal, have been 
reported in patients treated with bevacizumab in the colorectal  cancer 
trials and, to a lesser extent, in patients treated with bevacizumab in 
NSCLC and breast cancer trials.  
The risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) is increased with 
bevacizumab therapy; such events included cerebral infarction, transient 
ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction (MI) and other peripheral or 
visceral arterial thrombosis. A pooled analysis of five randomized studies 
showed a two -fold increase in these events (3.8% vs. 1.7%). ATE led to a 
fatal outcome in 0.8% patients with bevacizumab (vs. 0.5% without 
bevacizumab). The rate of cerebrovascular accidents (including TIA) was 
2.3% vs. 0.5%, and the rates of MI 1.7% vs. 0.7%. Certain baseline 
characteristics, such as age and prior arterial ischem ic events, appear to 
confer additional risk64.  In patients > 65 years treated with bevacizumab 
and chemotherapy, the rate of ATE was approximately 8.5%.

Aspirin is a standard therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of 
arterial thromboemb olic events in patients at high risk of such events, and 
the use of aspirin ≤ 325 mg daily was allowed in the five randomized 
studies discussed above. Use of aspirin was assessed routinely as a 
baseline or concomitant medication in these trials, though saf ety analyses 
specifically regarding aspirin use were not preplanned. Due to the 
relatively small numbers of aspirin users and arterial thromboembolic 
events, retrospective analyses of the ability of aspirin to affect the risk of 
such events were inconclusi ve. However, similarly retrospective analyses 
suggested that the use of up to 325 mg of aspirin daily does not increase 
the risk of grade 1 -2 or grade 3 -4 bleeding events. Further analyses of the 
effects of concomitant use of bevacizumab and aspirin in col orectal and 
other tumor types are ongoing.  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis :  In the Phase III pivotal trial 
in metastatic CRC, there was a slightly higher rate of venous 
thromboembolis m (VTE) in patients treated with  
chemotherapy  + bevacizumab compared with chemotherapy alone (19% 
vs. 16%).  The incidence of NCI -CTC Grade ≥  3 VTEs in one NSCLC 
trial (E4599) was higher in the bevacizumab -containing arm compared to 
the chemotherapy control arm (5.6% vs. 3.2%).  
In clini cal trials across all indications, the overall incidence of VTEs 
ranged from 2.8% to 17.3% in the bevacizumab -containing arms 
compared to 3.2% to 15.6% in the chemotherapy control arms. The use of 
bevacizumab with chemotherapy does not substantially increase the risk of 
VTE compared with chemotherapy alone.  However, patients with mCRC 
who receive bevacizumab and experienced VTE may be at higher risk for 
recurrence of VTE.  
 
 Hypertension: Hypertension is common in patients treated with 
bevacizumab. The  incid ence of hyp ertension (all grade) is 20 -30% across 
trials, with a mean increase of +5.5mmHg to +8.4mmHg for sys tolic 
pressure, or +4 .1mmHg to +5.4mmHg for diastolic pressure. Incidence of 
grade 3 (hypertension requiring initiation of, or increase in,  hypert ensive 
medications) ranges from 7.8 to 17.9%. Grade 4  hypertension 
(hypertensive crisis) occurred in up to 0.5 % of bevacizumab -treated 
patients.  
Hypertension associated with bevacizumab can generally be controlled 
with routine oral drugs while bevacizumab is continued.  However, 
incidents of hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy, including  reversible 
posterior l eukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS , see below), or 
cardiovascular sequelae have been rarely reported.  Blood pressure (BP) 
should be closely monito red during bevacizumab therapy and the goal of 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  33 
BP control should be consistent  with standard medical practice65.  
Bevacizumab therapy should be suspended in the event of uncontrolled 
hypertension.  
 Gastrointestinal Perforation:  GI perforations and/or fistula were rare but 
occurred at an increased rate in bevacizumab -containing therapies. Th e 
majority of such events required surgical intervention and some were 
associated with a fatal outcome. In the pivotal phase III trial in CRC 
(AVF2107), the incidence of bowel perforation was 2% in patients 
receiving IFL/bevacizumab and 4% in patients rece iving 5 -
FU/bevacizumab compared to 0.3% in patients receiving IFL alone. GI 
perforation has also been reported in non -CRC tumors (e.g. 
gastric/esophageal, pancreatic and ovarian cancers) or nonmalignant  
conditions such as diverticulitis and gastric ulcer.  GI perforation should 
be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on bevacizumab 
therapy presenting with abdominal pai n or rectal/abdominal abscess.  
 Fistula:  Fistula formations, including events resulting in death, have been 
observed in patients  receiving bevacizumab in clinical studies and post -
marketing reports. Fistulae in the GI tract are common (1 -10% incidence) 
in patients with certain metastatic tumors such as colorectal cancer or 
cervical, but uncommon (0.1 -1%) or rare (0.01 -0.1%) in othe r indications. 
In addition, fistulae that involve areas other than the GI tract have also 
been observed (e.g. tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, urogenital, 
biliary). Events were reported at various time points during treatment, 
ranging from 1  week to > 1 year following initiation of bevacizumab, with 
most events occurring within the first 6  months of therapy.  
 Wound Healing Complications :  Bevacizumab delays wound healing in 
rabbits, and it may also compromise or delay wound healing in patients. 
Bowel anastomotic dehiscence and skin  wound dehiscence have been 
reported in clinical trials with bevacizumab.   
The appropriate interval b etween surgery and initiation of bevacizumab 
required to avoid the risk of impaired wound healing has not been 
determined.  Across metastatic CRC trials, at least 28 days must have 
elapsed following major surgery before bevacizumab could be initiated; 
data suggested initiation of bevacizumab 29 -60 days following surgery did 
not appear to increase the risk of wound healing comp lications compared 
to those treated with chemotherapy alone.   
The optimal interval between termination of bevacizumab and subsequent 
elective surgery has not been determined. In the pivotal study in CRC, 
among patients who underwent major surgery while on  study therapy, 
there was an increased rate of significant post -operative bleeding or 
wound healing complications in the IFL + bevaci zumab arms vs. IFL 
alone -10% (4/40) vs. 0% (0/25) -66. 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015

Decisions on the timing of elective surgery should take into consideration 
the half -life of bevacizumab (average 21 days, range 11 -50 days).  
If patients receiving treatment with bevacizumab require elective major 
surgery, it is recommended that bev acizumab be held for 4 –8 weeks prior 
to the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing a major surgical procedure 
should not begin/restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that procedure (in 
the case of high -risk procedures such as liver resection, thoracotomy , or 
neurosurgery, it is recommended that chemotherapy be restarted no earlier 
than 6 weeks and bevacizumab no earlier than 8 weeks after surgery).  
 
 Proteinuria: Proteinuria has been seen in all bevacizumab studies to date, 
ranging in severity from mild asymptomatic increase in urine protein 
(incidence of about 38%) to rare instances of either grade 3 proteinuria  (> 
3.5gm/24 hour urine) (3%) or nephrotic syndrome  (1.4%). Pathologic 
findings on renal biopsies in two patients showed proliferative 
glomerulon ephritis. The risk of proteinuria may be higher in  patients with 
advanced RCC or  history of hypertension . There is also evidence from 
dose-finding trials that the rate of  proteinuria may be dose related. 
Proteinuria will be monitored by urine protein level  using urine analysis 
dipstick , or the urine may be sent to the institution’s lab for processing . 
 Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):  The risk of left ventricular dysfunction 
may be increased in patients with prior or concurrent anthracycline 
treatment. In phase III trials in metastatic breast cancer (AVF 2119g) in 
which all patients had received prior anthracyclines, CHF or 
cardiomyopat hy were reported in 3% in the bevacizumab + capecitabine 
arm compared to 1% in the capecitabine -only arm67. In a phase III trial of 
patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer (E2100), the 
incidence of LVEF decrease (defined as NCICTC Grade 3 or 4) in the 
paclitaxel  + bevacizumab arm was 0.3% versus 0% for the paclitaxel alone 
arm.  
In phase II  study of 48 patients with refractory acute myelogenous 
leukemia treated with cytarabine, mitoxantron e, and bevacizumab, 5 cases 
of cardiac dysfunction (CHF or decreases to <  40% in left ventricular 
ejection fraction, including AML trial) were reported.  All but one of these 
subjects had significant prior exposure to anthracyclines as well.  
Two additiona l studies investigated concurrent administration of 
anthracyclines and bevacizumab. In 21  patients with inflammatory breast 
cancer treated with neoadjuvant  docetaxel, doxorubicin (cumulative doses 
at 240 mg/m2), and bevacizumab, no patients developed clini cally 
apparent CHF; however, patients had asymptomatic decreases in LVEF to 
< 40% (78).  In a small phase II study in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, 
2/17 patients treated with bevacizumab and high -dose doxorubicin (75 
mg/m2) developed CHF (one  Grade 3  event after a cumulative doxorubicin

dose of 591  mg/m2, one Grade  4 event after a cumulative doxorubicin 
dose of 420  mg/m2); an additional 4  patients had a symptomatic decreases 
in LVEF68. 
Patients receiving anthracyclines or with prior exposure to anthracyclines 
should have a baseline MUGA or ECHO with a normal ejection fraction.   
 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), Posterior 
Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES),  or similar 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome :  RPLS/PRES are clinical syndromes 
related to vasogenic edema of the white matter and have rarely reported in 
association with bevacizumab therapy   (< 1%).  Clinical presentations 
may include altered mental status,  seizure, visual disturbance or cortical 
blindness, with or without associated hypertension. MRI sca ns are 
required for diagnosis. Typical findings are vasogenic edema (enhanced 
intensity in T2 and FLAIR sequences on non -contrast MRI) 
predominantly in the white matter of the posterior parietal and occipital 
lobes, and less frequently, in the anterior dis tributions and the gray matter.  
RPLS/PRES is potentially reversible, but timely correction of the 
underlying causes, including control of BP and interruptio n of the 
offending drug, is important in order to prevent irreversible tissue damage.  
The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously 
experiencing RPLS is not known69.   
 Neutropenia :  In the phase III trial with IFL +/ - bevacizumab in colorectal 
cancer, grade  3-4 neutropenia was 21% with  bevacizumab + IFL vs. 14% 
with IFL (grade 4 neutropenia was 3% vs. 2%).  Increased rates of severe 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with severe neutropenia 
(including some fatalities) have been observed in patient s treated with 
some myelotoxic chemotherapy regimens plus bevacizumab.  In a phase 
III in NSCLC, carboplatin and paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm was 
associated with increased rate of grade 4 neutropenia (27% vs. 17%), 
febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs. 1.8%), and infection with neutropenia (4.4%  
vs. 2.0%) with three fatal cases70. 
 Fertility and Pregnancy : Clinical data are lacking regarding the 
immediate or long -term effect of bevacizumab on fertility a nd pregnancy. 
However, bevacizumab is known to be t eratogenic and detrimental to fetal 
development in animal models. In addition, bevacizumab may alter corpus 
luteum development and endometrial proliferation, thereby having a 
negative effect on fertility. As an IgG1, it may also be secreted in human 
milk. Therefore, fertile men and women on bevacizumab studies must use 
adequate contraceptive measures and women should avoid breast feeding. 
The duration of such precautions after discontinuation of bevacizumab  
should take into consideration the half -life of t he agent (average 21 days, 
ranging from 11 to 50 days).

 Immunogenicity : As a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for 
immunogenicity with bevacizumab. With the currently available assay 
with limited se nsitivity, high titer human anti -bevacizumab antib odies 
have not been detected in approximately 500 patients treated with 
bevacizumab.    
Reference sho uld be made to the product labeling of bevacizumab. Specific 
caution and clinical alertness should be exe rcised for patients receiving the agent.  
 
Clinical Studies in Children: A phase 1 trial of bevacizumab as single agent has 
been completed for children with refractory solid tumors.  In this study, doses 
from 5 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks were well tolerated71.  Eighteen of 21 
children completed ≥ 1 treatment cycle (median cycle #3, range 1 -16 cycles). 
Interestingly, the typical adve rse events seen in adults ; hypertension, proteinuria, 
arterial thromboembolic events, hemorrhage, congestive heart failure (CHF), 
gastrointestinal perforations, wound healing complications, reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome and fistula form ation , were not seen in children.  
Bony toxicity was not observed, but cumulative toxicity could not be evaluated 
given the fairly  short treatment duration with bevacizumab. Based on these 
results, phase 2 studies at doses similar to adults were recommende d. 
 
Combination studies of everolimus and bevacizumab:  Multiple clinical trials 
combining  everolimus with bevacizumab are ongoing in adults 
(clinicaltrials.gov).  In these studies everolimus is typically administered at a dose 
of 10 mg po/day on a continuo us doing schedule, and bevacizumab is 
administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV every 14 days or 15 mg/kg IV every 21 
days.  
 
On a phase II trial of bevacizumab (10 mg IV every 2 weeks) and everolimus (10 
mg orally once daily)  in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma  80 patients 
were enrolled (50 untreated, 30 previously treated). Bevacizumab/ everolimus  
showed activity in both gr oups. The median PFS in previously untreated and 
previously treated patients were 9.1 and 7.1 months, respectively. ORR (30% and 
23%). The combination was well -tolerated by most patients, with a toxicity 
profile as expected based on the known toxicities of  both agents. Grade -3/4 
proteinuria was more frequent than expected (25%) and led to treatment  
discontinuation in 6 patients (unpublished, information provided by Novartis).  
 
In another p hase II trial of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Q 21 days + everolimus  10 mg 
daily for patients with metastatic melanoma, 57 patients enrolled received a 
median of 4 cycles (range: 1 -14+). Seven patients (13%) had major responses, 30 
patients (53%)  had objective decrease in the size of measurable lesions. The 
median PFS and OS w ere 4 months and 8.6 months, respectively.  The regimen 
was well tolerated, and 43% were alive afte r 12 months follow -up (unpublished 
data, information provided by Novartis).

One pediatric phase 1 trial combining bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every 14 days 
with everolimus 4 mg/m2/dose (starting dose level 1) and 5 mg/m2/dose (dose 
level 2) once daily po on a continuous dosing schedule is ongoing. The 
recommended phase 2 dose on this trial has not been determined yet (personal 
communication Lisa McGregor, study PI).  Therefore pediatric patients will not 
be initially elig ible for trial participation.  
 
2.3 Rationale  
Role of Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  in cell proliferation:   
Mammalian Target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase which is 
regulated by the phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway.  
Evidence suggests mTOR acts as a master switc h of numerous cellular processes, 
including cellular catabolism and anabolism, cell motility, angiogenesis, and cell 
growth72. mTOR integrates two of the most important signals involved in the 
regulation of cell growth:  growth factors and nutrients. Growth factors, such as 
insulin and insulin -like growth factor, and nutrients, such as amino acids and 
glucose, enhance mTOR function.  mTOR controls translation in part by 
regulating ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryote initiation factor 4E binding 
protein (4E -BP1), but may also regulate ribosomal b iogenesis through 
nucleophosmin (NPM)73. Phosphorylation of the S6 protein by S6K selectively 
increases the ribosomal biogenesis, 4E -BP1 acts as a translation repressor by 
binding and inhibiting the eukaryotic translation initi ation factor 4E (eIF4E).  
 
mTOR and cancer:    Preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy of sirolimus  
analogs and parent compound in multiple tumor types.  In the NCI 60 tumor cell 
line panel, mTOR inhibitors demonstrated growth inhibitory activity against a 
broad spectrum of tumors including leukemia, brain, renal, breast and 
melanoma72,73 with an average IC50 of 8. 2 nM.  Subsequent xenograft studies 
have confirmed the cytostatic properties of the mTOR inhibitors. S ingle agent 
mTOR inhibition has resulted in objecti ve radiographic responses to a variety of 
mTOR inhibitors in patients with low -grade astrocytomas74, glioblastoma  
multiforme75, renal cell carcinoma76, mantle cell lymphoma44, breast cancer77 and 
sarcomas78. Patients with T uberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) also exhibit similar 
deregulation of mTOR/S6K signaling.  A recent clinical series has demonstrated 
clinical responses to single agent sirolimus in subependymal giant cell 
astrocytomas and a low grade glioma in 5 pediatric p atients with TSC74.  In 
addition, a recent North Central Cancer Treatment Group pha se 2 trial of the 
sirolimus ester temsirolimus (CCI -779) in 65 adult patients with recurrent 
glioblastoma multiforme revealed radiographic improvement in 36% of the 
temsirolimus -treated patients, and was associated with significantly longer time to 
progression75. The most common grade 3 or higher toxicities encountered were 
hypercholesterolemia (13% of patients), hypertriglyceridemia (11%) a nd 
hyperglycemia (8%).  Chan and colleagues treated 109 patients with relapsed, 
progressive advanced -stage breast cancer in a randomized trial with temsirolimus 
(CCI -779) at either 75 mg or 250 mg weekly by vein77.  He found that 9% of 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  38 
patients had a response (all PR); while these responses were divided equally 
between the low and high dose of CCI -779, toxicity was less common in the 
lower dose.  The most common clinically important grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
were mucositis (9%), leucopenia (7%), hyperglycemia (7%), somnolence (6%), 
thromb ocytopenia (5%), and depression (5%).  Others have treated patients with 
advanced refractory renal cell carcinoma with single agent CCI -779 and rep orted 
objective response and minor response rates of 7% and 26%, respectively76. 
Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in this group of 111 patients included hyperglycemia 
(17%), hypophosphatemia (13%), anemia (9%), and hypertriglyceridemia (6%).  
MTOR inhibitors such as CCI -779, sirolimus, and everolimus have proven safe at 
a range of doses.  
 
Available mTOR Inhibitors: Sirolimus and three analogs, CCI -779 
(temsirolimus), everolimus (everolimus), and AP23573, have bee n developed for 
human use.  Among these, only sirolimus, everolimus, and temsirolimus are 
currently FDA approved.  Sirol imus is approved for prevention of kidney allograft 
rejection in adults and children at least 13 years old.  In this patient population,  
the typical starting dose is 2 mg once daily with a single loading dose of 6 mg.  
Sirolimus is also approved for use in drug-eluting stents to reduce the incidence of 
re-stenosis following coronary artery angioplasty79.  Temsirolimus (Wyeth) is an 
ester of sirolimus and is available for intr avenous infusion. Temsirolimus was 
approved by the FDA for adults with advanced renal cell cancer on May 30, 2007 
using a weekly intravenous schedule.  Everolimus  (Afinitor®/Votubia®)  
(Novartis) is an orally available hydroxyethyl derivative of sirolimus, and is 
currently FDA approved for advanced RCC, advanced PNET, lung 
neuroendocrine tumor, SEGA with TS in an individua te who is not a candidate for 
curative surgical resection and in Wa ldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.  Additionally, in adults  three 
Phase 3 trials are ongoing, four Phase 2  trials  (alone or in combination with other 
agents),  and in a limited number of pediatric trials.  Finally AP23573 (Ariad 
Pharm aceuticals) is an analog of sirolimus currently in Phase 2 trials in adults.   
At this time, it is unclear whether one compound will have an advantage over the 
others in a particular tumor type.  
 
mTOR and NF1:  The NF1 gene encodes a protein, termed neurofi bromin, which 
functions partly as a Ras -GTPase activating protein (RasGAP). Accordingly, 
neurofibromin loss in tumor cells leads to Ras hyperactivation. Signaling 
intermediates d ownstream of Ras are hyperactivated as a result of NF1 gene 
inactivation and these specific proteins are  critical for transmitting the Ras growth 
signal and for the development of neoplasia in patients with NF1. One of these 
downstream proteins is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecule.  
Recent stu dies have demonstrated that the NF1 tumor suppressor  regulates mTOR 
pathway activation. MTOR was found to be activated in both NF1 deficient 
primary human and mouse cells as well as in human and genetically -enginee red 
Nf1 mouse tumor models. This aberrant activation was dependent on Ras and PI3

kinase/AKT signaling80,81. In this regard, Nf1 loss in mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts81 and primary mouse astrocytes80 was shown to result in Ras - and 
PI3K -dependent mTOR pathway activation, which could be inhibited with  
sirolimus. Moreover, Nf1-/- astrocytes are highly sensitive to sirolimus treatments 
that have no effect on normal astrocyte growth. In addition, the increased 
proliferation associated with loss of neurofibromin expression in human MPNST 
cell lines was dramatically reduced by treatment with sirolimus. Using a genetic 
mouse model of NF1 -deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
(MPNST) development, sirolimus completely inhibited the growth of these 
tumors in vivo82. In addition, sirolimus treatment of optic gliomas developing in a 
genetically -engineered Nf1 mouse model  resulted in attenuated mTOR signaling  
in vivo83 as well as tumor growth in vivo .  While tumors ra pidly ceased to 
proliferate, there was no evidence of apoptosis or senescence, and sirolimus had 
no early effect on microvasculature in either preclinical model. Simil arly, the 
mTOR inhibitor everolimus decreased growth in five MPNST cell lines, and 
preven ted growth of subcutaneously implanted MPNST in mice82.  
 
Details describing studies performed by Dr. Karen Cichowski’s group81,84 in a 
transgenic mouse model are described below:  
In this model mice carrying compound mutations in the Nf1 and p53 tumor 
suppressors on the same c hromosome (referred to as NP cis animals) develop 
aggressive MPNSTs that are histologically indistinguishable from human 
MPNSTs. Tumors grow with consistent and rapid kinetics, and on average mice 
only survive 10.7 days after the tumor is detect ed. Importa ntly, lesions develop as 
a result of somatic loss of the wild -type Nf1 and p53 alleles, and therefore are also 
genetically similar to human MPNST. This model was used to test the 
requirement for mTOR in tumorigenesis in vivo  and assess the therapeutic util ity 
of rapamycin. Animals with palpable tumors (approximately 300 mm3) were 
injected I.P. with 5 mg/kg rapamycin per day. Control NP cis mice died on 
average in 12.2 days, and tumors grew 9.7 -fold. In contrast, rapamycin potently 
suppressed MPNST growth, r esulting in only a .04 fold increase in size, and 
allowed the animals to survive. In no case did a rapamycin -treated animal die, but 
rather animals were sacrificed for interim analysis. Thus, rapamycin has potent 
cytostatic effects on these highly aggressi ve malignancies. Inhibition of S6 
phosphorylation was observed in tumor and non -tumor tissue, demonstrating that 
rapamcyin was effectively suppressing the mTOR pathway in vivo .  Moreover 
rapamycin mediated its anti -tumor effects within 24 hours by potently  suppressing 
proliferation, as assessed by BrDU incorporation in control and rapamycin treated 
tumors. Consistent with in vitro  observations, apoptotic and senescent cells were 
not detected.  As such, tumor growth was dependent on continued exposure to 
rapamycin, as tumors re -exhibited S6 phosphorylation and resumed growing at a 
rate comparable to control treated tumors following rapamycin removal. These 
data demonstrate that these aggressive tumors could  be completely contained by 
an mTOR inhibitor. mTOR i nhibition through treatment with everolimus also 
provided benefit in a mouse xenograft model of sporadic and NF1 associated82.

mTOR Inhibition and AKT  activation:  Several investigators have recently 
reported a negative feedback loop between mTOR and Akt in cancer cell lines85. 
Since Akt activation is associated with signaling down cell survival pathways, the 
effect of mTOR inhibition may be attenuated. However, in two indepen dent NF1 -
associated preclinical mouse tumor models treated with sirolimus (optic glioma 
and malignant peripheral nerve sheath models), no evidence was found for 
changes in Akt activation following rapamycin treatment81,83,84. 
 
These findings described above identif y the NF1 tumor suppressor as a negative 
regulator of mTOR,  and demonstrate that sirolimus  blocks the growth of several 
NF1-deficient cells and tumor cell types in vitro  and in vivo . The combination of 
cell culture and preclinical mouse modeling data provides a strong rationale for 
the use of sirolimus in treating human NF1 -associated tumors.  
 
However, ultimately MPNSTs become resistant to treatment with rapamycin in 
this model, which is associated with re -vascularization and upregulation of 
VEGF. Preliminary preclinical data in the transgenic NF1 MPNST mouse model 
demonstrate prolonged survival for mice treated with rapamycin plus sunitinib, 
which in part, mediates anti -tumor activity by inhibition of angio genesis, 
compared to mice treated with rapamycin or sunitinib alone (unpublished data K. 
Cichowski). Other studies demonstrate a role of angiogenesis in progression of 
MPNST. Angiogenesis has also been implied in the progression of MPNST. Ras 
mutations can  upregulate VEGF expression86,87 and vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are also highly expressed 
in neurofibromas from patients with NF1 at the mRNA and protein level88. 
Furthermore, VEGF expression and tumor vasculariza tion significantly increased 
in MPNSTs89. Use of a specific small molecular inhibitor of VEGF -receptor 2 
(VEGFR2) in a mouse explant model of neurogenic sarcomas showed a reduction 
in tumor growth due to decreased tumor angiogenesis with subsequent reduction 
in tumor cell proliferation  and an increase in apoptosis89.  
 
Based on these preclinical studies we are proposing a phase 2 clinical trial of 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (everolimus) in combination with 
bevacizumab in NF 1 related and sporadic MPNST. The primary goal of this 
trial will be to evaluate the activity of everolimus in refractory MPNST, and 
as such this trial will serve to validate the transgenic NF1 MPNST mouse 
model. The intent is that this trial will serve as  platform for future studies 
combining targeted agents or standard chemotherapy agents with mTOR 
inhibition based on emerging additional findings from studies in preclinical 
models.  
2.4  Study Design  
This is a two -stage phase 2  clinical trial with the obje ctive to assess activity of the 
mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the angiogenesis inhib itor

Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  41 
bevacizumab in patients with sporadic and NF1 associated MPNSTs refractory 
after ≥  1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. Novartis will provide everol imus 
and Genentech will provide bevacizumab for the trial.  
 
The primary endpoint is clinical benefit rate (PR, CR or stable disease at ≥ 4 
months). The diagnosis of NF 1 will be based on clinical criteria.  
 
Most MPNSTs occur in adults, but MPNSTs in adolescents and children have 
been described and treatment approaches are similar for adults and children with 
MPNST. Initially enrollment will be limited to patients ≥ 18 y ears old, as the 
phase 2 dose for the co mbination of everolimus and bevacizumab in children has 
not been defined yet. A pediatric phase 1 trial of everolimus and bevacizumab is 
ongoing . Everolimus will be administered at the recommended phase 2 dose.  
Bevacizumab will also be administered at FDA  approved doses. Eve rolimus will 
be administered orally once daily as tablets at a dose of 10 mg on a continuous 
dosing schedule. Bevacizumab will be administered IV at a dose of 10 
mg/kg/dose every 14 days. One treatment cycle will be defined as 28 days.  
 
Patients will be r egularly monitored for everolimus and bevacizumab toxicity and 
response.  Dose modifications and interruptions will be performed as outlined in 
Section 6. Specific guidelines for grading and management of hypertension are 
described in S ection 6.  
 
Patients will receive PCP prophylaxis while on everolimus; for example 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as per institutional guidelines, or inhaled 
pentamidine.  
 
Clinical benefit rate (success) will be defined as PR, CR, and SD at ≥ 4 months 
(WHO response criteria). A two -stage design will be used, and a clinical benefit 
rate of ≥  25% will be defined as success ruling out a ≤  5% clinical benefit rate. 
Initially 15 patients will be enrolled. If ≥ 1 of 15 patients respond, enrollment 
continues to 25 evaluable patients. If ≥  4 of 25 evaluable patients respond ; 
everolimus  in combination with bevacizumab will be considered active and 
worthy for further exploration. Patients ≥ 18 years old who are able to swallow 
tablets and have adequate organ function and unresectable or m etastatic MPNST 
which progressed after ≥ one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen will be 
eligible. Patients will be able to remain on treatment for as long as they do not 
experience progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity  up to a  maximum of 2 
years . It is expected that 15 -25 patients per year will be enrolled, and enrollment 
is expected to complete within approximately 1-2 years depending on the activity 
of everolimus and bevacizumab observed during the initial stage. Response 
evaluations (WHO) with appropriate imaging studies (MRI/CT) will be 
performed before every other treatment cycle (3, 5, 7, 9, etc). .  History and 
physical examination including vital signs will be performed  after cycles 1, 2, 3 
and at the time of each evaluat ion. Laboratory studies will include CBC with

differential, fasting glucose and lipids, comprehensive chemistry panel. Based on 
the preclinical studies in transgenic and subcutaneous murine MPNST models we 
expect to observe predominantly a cytostatic effec t. Therefore response will be 
defined as PR, CR, and SD at ≥ 4  months using WHO response criteria. MPNSTs 
are very aggressive tumors . In a recently completed phase 2 trial with the EGFR 
inhibitor erlotinib the median progression free survival was 2 months with 19 of 
20 evaluable patients demonstrating progression at the time of the first disease 
evaluation on treatment36. A subsequent phase 2 trial of sorafenib for different 
refracto ry sarco ma strata identified MPNST as the sarcoma type with the worst 
PFS (1.7 months) and overall survival (4.9 months) among the sarcomas 
evaluated37. We therefore believe that disease stability at ≥  4 months indicates 
potential activity of the evaluated treatment.  
 
 
2.5 Correlative  studies  
Correlative studies will not be mandatory, and patients will be able to participate 
in the trial without agreeing to participate in any or all of the following studies.  
 
 To evaluate t he spectrum of germline NF1 mutations in individuals with NF1 
associated MPNSTs: Comprehensive NF1 mutation analysis has become 
available within the past few years and allows identification of an NF1 
mutation in 95% of non -founder patients with >  2 neurofibromas or 1 
plexiform and fulfilling the NIH clinical diagnostic  criteria in a CLIA -
certified laboratory90. This allows for meaningful analysis of phenotype and 
genotype correlations.  Total NF1 gene deletion has been described to result in 
a greater risk for development of an MPNST91. This finding, if confirmed, 
would have implications for genetic counseling. In addition, obtaining the 
spectrum of germline NF1 mutations in individuals wi th NF1 and MPNST  
and comparing it with the spectrum of germline NF1 mutations in a cohort of 
adult patients without externally visible plexiform neurofibromas will enhance 
our knowledge. Genotyping will only be performed after genetic counseling 
including the potential risks of genotyping and after obtaining written 
informed consent.  
 To explore the relationship between response to everolimus in combination 
with bevacizumab and presence of NF1 mutations or NF1 inactivation in 
MPNST tumor samples.  
 To explore  the response rate to everolimus  in combination with bevacizumab 
in individuals with sporadic and NF1 associ ated MPNST. While NF1 
inactivation has been described in sporadic and NF1 associated MPNST92, 
retrospective studies  describe worse survival in individuals with NF1 
associated compared to sporadic MPNST4,13, and two studies describes worse 
response to chemotherapy in NF1 associated versus sporadic MPNST2,13. This 
analysis will only be performed in exploratory fashion and not b e powered for 
a statistical comparison.

 To assess preliminary correlations of radiographic response and progression 
with changes in pharmacodynamic parameters including S6K1 (p70  S6 kinase 
1), eIF4E, eIF2 alpha, VEGF, VEGFR, Akt phosphorylation, and marke rs of 
cell metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cel ls collected prior to and 
serially during treatment with everolimus  and bevacizumab: Markers of 
angiogenesis and downstream targets of mTOR will be analyzed to evaluate 
the effect of everolimus  and bevacizumab on response and resistance. These 
evaluations can be performed in blood, and will thus be serially performed 
during treatment with everolimus  at the same time as response evaluations.  
 To more sensitively monitor response to everolimus  and bevacizumab by 
using three -dimensional MRI (3D -MRI) analysis of MPNSTs compared to 
conventional two -dimensional MRI (2 -D MRI) and one -dimensional MRI (1 -
D MRI) data analysis: Volumetric MRI analysis has become the standard 
method to evaluate the growth ra te of plexiform neurofibromas on clinical 
trials93,94. This method may have utility for MPNSTs, which are typically 
large and have a complex shape. Volumetric MRI analysis will therefore be 
performed as a secondary objective and compared t o standard response 
evaluation with 1 D- and 2D - measurements. MRI studies performed for 
response evaluation will be used for volumetric analysis, and no MRI 
sequence other than STIR MRI (Short T1 inversion recovery), which is 
commonly used in the evaluation of sarcomas and does not require co ntrast 
administration, will be required.

Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion – a 
UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24 -hour urine protein of 1 gm.  UPC 
ratio is calculated using one of the following formulas:  
-- [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] – if both protein and creatinine are reported  in 
mg/dL  
-- [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine] – if urine creatinine is reported in 
mmol/L

being treated on this study.  
3.1.14  Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed ex clusively 
to determine eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written 
informed consent from all patients. This can be accomplished through an IRB -
approved institutional screening protocol or the study -specific protocol.  
Documentation  of the informed consent for screening will be maintained in the 
patient’s research chart. Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical 
indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for baseline 
values even if the studies wer e done before informed consent was obtained.

3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Subjects of both genders and from all racial and ethnic groups are eligible for this 
trial if they meet the criteria. To date,  there is no information that suggests 
differences in absorption, metabolism, or disposition or disease response among 
racial or ethnic groups or between the genders, indicating that results of the trial 
will be applicable to all groups. Efforts will be ma de to extend the accrual to a 
representative population, but in a phase 2 trial which will accrue a limited 
number of patients, a  balance must be struck between patient safety 
considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potential ly 
toxic or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender, 
racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other. If differences in 
outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are noted, accrual may 
be expand ed or additional studies may be performed to investigate those 
differences more fully.  
 
 
4. REGISTRATION PROCEDU RES  
 
4.1 General guidelines  
 
After obtaining Informed Consent, e ligible patients will be enrolled on this trial. 
Subjects will be registered by local sites through an electronic database, and will 
be issued a subject unique identifying numbers for eligibl e participants. An

primary and secondary endpoints, as well as safety da ta, will be captured in the 
eCRFs.  
 
4.2 Patient registration  
 
The SARC016 study uses a web based data  entry system for data submission. All 
subject registrations and Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be submitted 
electronically via the study web site. All subj ects must be registered  on the study 
website prior to start of treatment.   Data Managers and other authorized users will 
be provided with a unique user identification number and password to access the 
site.  All study case report forms may be accessed onli ne through the study 
website . In case there are problems accessing the website, ple ase contact the 
SARC office directly at: Phone: 734 -930-7600, Fax: 734 -930-7557.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent administration  
 
Everolimus  will be provided by Novartis.  Everolimus is formulated as tablets for 
oral administration of 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg strength .  Tablets are blister -
packed under aluminum foil in units, which should be opened only at the time of 
administration as drug is both hygroscopic and light -sensit ive. 
 
The study drug everolimus will be self -administered. The investigator will 
instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol.  
Everolimus will be administered orally as a once daily dose of 10 mg.  
 
Patients will be inst ructed to take everolimus, at the same time each day, 
preferably in the morning. Everolimus should be taken by the patient consistently 
with or without food , and remain  as consistent as possible throughout the study, 
and in particular, during those periods  when samples are being taken for 
pharmacodynamic analyses (see Section 2.5 and Operations Manual).  
 
If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose.  All 
dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes during the 
study will be recorded in a patient diary (see Appendix III ). Medication labels will

comply with US legal requirements and be printed in English. They will supply 
no information about the patient. The storage conditions for study drug will be 
described  on the medication label.  
 
Bevacizumab  will be provided by Genentech. The bevacizumab dose will be 
placed in to a 100 ml  infusion bag . Administration will be as an intravenous 
infusion over 30 -90 minutes , or it will be administered per the treating 
institution’s standard  policy .  Bevacizumab will be administered every 14 days 
(on days 1 and 15),  +/- 2 days.  Everolimus should be given at the sam e time each 
day, and is not dependent on the time the Bevacizumab is given.  Exception: hold 
everolimus dose until after r esearch labs are obtained (see Appendix 10 .4 - 
Schedule of Evaluation s).  The initial bevacizumab dose will be delivered as an 
IV infusion over 90  10 minutes. If the first infusion is tolerated without 
infusion -associated adverse events  (fevers and/or chills), the second infusion 
maybe delivered over 60  10 minutes.   If the 60 minute infusion is well tolerated, 
all subsequent infusion s maybe delivered over 30  10 minutes.  If a patient 
experiences an infusion -associated adverse event, subsequent infusions will be 
given over the shortest period that was well tolerated. The patient may be pre -
medicated for the next bevacizumab infusion.  
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Patients must be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over -
the-counter products) during the trial without prior consultation with the 
investigator.  All medications taken at the time of screening should be recorded. If 
concomitant therapy must be added or changed, th e reason and name of the 
drug/therapy should be recorded.  
In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapies deemed necessary for 
the care of the patient are allowed, including drugs given prophylactically (e.g. 
antiemetics), with the following ex ceptions:  
 No other investigational therapy should be given to patients  
 No chronic treatment with systemic steroids or another 
immunosuppressive agent (for example, cyclosporine) with the exception 
of patients with endocrine deficiencies who are allowed to received 
physiologic or stress doses of steroids if necessary.  Patients w ill be 
allowed to receive steroids for the treatment of pneumonitis.  
 The CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers and enzyme inducing 
anticonvulsants listed in Appendix II are prohibited on this trial. Other 
drugs or substances known to be inhibitors or inducers of the isoenzyme 
CYP3A (listed in Appendix II) should be avoided, if possible, and if 
unavoidable, only be used with caution, in association with everolimus as 
these can alter metabolism. If patient requires co -administration of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors  (see Appendix III ), reduce 
the dose of everolimus to half the currently used dose. Additional dose 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  51 
reductions to every other day may be required to manage toxicities. If the 
inhibitor is discontinued the everolimus dose should be returned to  the 
dose used prior to initiation of the moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor.  
 Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines 
during the study period. Close contact with those who have received 
attenuated live vaccines should be avoided d uring treatment with 
everolimus. Examples of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, 
measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella and 
TY21a typhoid vaccines.  
 
5.2.1  Concomitant Cancer and other Therapy  
 
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
immunotherapy, or biologic the rapy may NOT be administered.  
The administration of biphosponates is permitted at investigator discretion. The 
risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with bevacizumab and 
bisph osphonates should be considered (Section 8.2.8).  
The medication history including complementary and alternative medications 
should be reviewed at the initial screening visit and at the time of subsequent 
visits. Patients will be instructed to consult a mem ber of the study team prior to 
introduction of new medications.   No other investigational therapy should be 
given to patients.  
Oral contraceptives in preclinical and clinical data have shown everolimus to have 
CYP3A4 inhibitory activity rather than induction activity, indu ction of 
metabolism of contraceptive hormones by everolimus is unlikely. Consequently, 
administration of everolimus should not reduce the efficacy of oral 
contraceptives.  
 
5.2.2  Supportive Care  
 
 Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics (EXCEPT systemic 
steroids), fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to be used as 
necessary.  Platelets should be transfused for thrombocytopenia following 
institutional guidelines.  All blo od products will be  administered following 
institutional guid elines to prevent graft -versus -host disease.   Corticosteroids 
are permissible as premedication for blood product transfusions, or as 
treatment for an acute allergic reaction.  
 
 Patients must take some form of PCP prophylaxis while on everolimus .  
For example : trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as per institutional guidelines, or 
inhaled pentamidine.  
 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  52 
 Good oral hygiene and mouth care are encouraged, as mucositis is one of the 
toxicities of everolimus.  
 
 Growth Factors that support platelet or white cell number or f unction can only 
be administered for culture proven bacteremia, clinical sepsis, or invasive 
fungal infection with neutropenia. ASCO guidelines and regulatory authority 
labeling  for providing growth factor support are recommended.  
 
 Vaccinations: Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus , 
should not be administered live vaccines. In addition, the response to vaccines 
(non-live) administered while the patient is immunosuppressed can be 
variable, and clinicians should check titers following for response if a non -live 
vaccine must be administered during this time.  
 
Patients with positive hepatitis screen (See Appendix V):  
 It is highly recommended that patients posi tive for HBV -DNA or HBsAg are 
treated prophylactically with an antiviral for 1 -2 weeks prior to receiving 
study drug .  
 The antiviral treatment should continue throughout the entire study period and 
for at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  
 Patients on antiviral prophylaxis treatment or positive HBV antibodie s should 
be tested for HBV -DNA according to study visit schedule.  
 
5.3 Duration of therapy  
Treatment may continue for a maximum of 2 years until one of the following 
criteria applies:  
 Disease progression  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s), including significant irreversible grade 4 
toxicity attributed to everolimus or bevacizumab  
 Greater than 3 weeks have elapsed since th e last dose of everolimus or greater 
than 8 weeks since the last dose of bevacizumab  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 Patient is lost to follow -up 
 Death

5.4 Duration of follow up  
Patients will be followed until 30 days after the last dose of everolimus and 
bevacizumab or longer  if patient removed from treatment with everolimus or 
bevacizumab  for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adver se event to < grade 1 using the CTCAE v  4 as detailed in 
Section 7.1.2.  
 
5.5 Criteria for removal from study  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the cr iteria listed in Section 5.3 
applies and patients have been followed as detailed in section 5.4 .  The reason for 
study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the 
Case Report Form.  
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 
Dosing changes for everolimus  related toxicities are described in Section 6.1, and 
for bevacizumab rela ted toxicities in Section 6.2. If toxicity cannot be clearly 
attributed to either bevacizumab alone or to everolimus  alone, the toxicity will be 
attribut ed to both agents, and modifications made accordingly. Should a patient 
require permanent discontinuati on of either everolimus  or bevacizumab, this 
patient can continue on study receiving the agent, which is tolerated for as long no 
other off treatment cri teria are met.  The study PIs should be contacted to discuss 
questions regarding toxicity attribution an d to dis cuss patients who may meet 
criteria to continue treatment with either everolimus or bevacizumab alone.   
 
6.1 Interruption or discontinuation of t reatment with everolimus  
For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, 
dose adjustments are permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug. If the 
patient misses a dose of everolimus, they may still take it up to 6 h ours after the 
time they would normally take it.  If more than 6 hours have elapsed, the patient 
should skip the dose for that day.  The next day, they should take everolimus at 
the usual time.  The patient should NOT take 2 doses to make up for the one th at 
they missed. If administration of everolimus must be interrupted because of 
unacceptable toxicity, drug dosing will be interrupted or modified according to 
rules described in tables 1, 2, and 3 below: Toxicity will be assessed using the 
NIH-NCI Common T erminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv4.pdf ).

Non-hematological toxicity   
≥ Grade 2  
(except pneumonitis – refer to Table 3)  
 
Any grade 2 non -hematologic toxicity attributable 
to everolimus that persists for ≥ 7 days or is 
considered sufficiently medically significant or 
sufficiently intolerable by patients that it requires 
treatment interruption.  
 
Any Grade 3possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to everolimus,  except the following:  
 grade 3 nausea or vomiting of less than 3 
days duration;  
 grade 3 transaminase elevation that returns

 grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities  
 
Grade 4 possibly, probably or definitely attributable 
to everolimus * If the toxicity is tolerable to the patient, maintain the 
same dose. If the toxicity is intolerable to patient, 
interrupt everolimus  until recovery to grade ≤  1. 
Then reintroduce everolimus  at same dose.  If event 
returns to grade 2, then interrupt everoli mus until 
recovery to grade ≤  1. Then reintroduce everolimus  
at the  next lower dose level  (see Table 1 above) . 
 
 
Interrupt everolimus  until recovery to grade ≤  1.

Discontinue everolimus  
*Grade 3  or 4 hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia) should be managed using 
medical therapies (see Section 6.1.2)  
 
6.1.1   Management  of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers  
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to everolimus should be treated using 
local supportive care. Please note that investigators in earlier trials have described 
the oral toxicities associated with everolimus as mouth ulcers, rather than 
mucositis or  stomatitis. If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a 
more general inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse event as 
such. Please follow the par adigm below for treatment of stomatitis/oral 
mucositis/mouth ulcers:  
1. For mild toxici ty (Grade 1), use conservative measures such as non-alcoholic 
mouth wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until 
resolution.  
2. For more severe toxicity (Grade 2 in which case patients have pain but are 
able to maintain adequate oral aliment ation, or Grade 3 in which case patients 
cannot maintain adequate oral alimentation), the suggested treatments are 
topical analgesic mouth treatments (i.e., local anesthetics such as benzocaine, 
butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or ph enol) with or 
without topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% 
(Kenalog in Orabase® ). For intolerable grade ≥ 2 stomatitis/oral 
mucositis/mouth ulcers, everolimus will be held, and restarted with a dose 
reduction by 1 dose level after  recovery from toxicity to grade 1 or less.   If the 
patient is off drug for greater than or equal to 3 weeks for everolimus and 
greater than or equal to 8 weeks for bevacizumab, they will be permanently 
removed from treatment . 
3. Agents containing hydrogen pe roxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend 
to worsen mouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid these agents.  
4. Antifungal agents must be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In 
particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluc onazole, 
itraconazole, etc.) should be avoided in all patients due to their strong 
inhibition of everolimus metabolism, thereby leading to higher everolimus 
exposures. Therefore, topical antifungal agents are preferred if an infection is 
diagnosed. Similar ly, antiviral agents such as acyclovir should be avoided 
unless a viral infection is diagnosed.  
Note: Stomatitis/oral m ucositis should be appropriately graded using the 
functional grading given on the NCI -CTC for adverse events, version 4.0.

6.1.2  Management  of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia  
Treatment of hyperlipidemia should take into account the pre -treatment status and 
dietary habits.  Blood tests to monitor hyperlipidemia must be taken in the fasting 
state. Grade 2 hypercholesterolemia (> 300  - 400 mg/dL or 7.75 – 10.34 mmol/L) 
or Grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia (>  300 – 500 mg/dl, or > 3.42 – 5.7 mmol/L)  
should be treated with a 3 -hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase 
inhibitor (e.g., atorvastatin, pravastatin) or appropriate lipid -loweri ng medication, 
in addition to diet. Patients should be monitored clinically and through serum 
biochemistry for the  development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse events as 
required in the product label/data sheets for HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors. 
Note: C oncomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is 
associated with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity 
manifested by rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels 
and myoglobinuria, acute re nal failure and sometimes death. The risk versus 
benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual  patients based on

hypercholesterolemia (> 500 mg/dl [12.92 mmol/L], hold everolimus until 
cholesterol is 500 < mg/dl [12.92 mmol/L.   If triglycerides > 700  - 1,000 , and 
HDL is low, c onsider fibrate or niacin. For triglycerides > 10x  ULN, hold 
everolimus while instituting fibrate or niacin therapy  until triglycerides are < 10x 
ULN.  
 
Grade 3 hyperglycemia has been observed in patients receiving everolimus  
therapy. In many cases the affe cted patients had an abnormal fasting glucose at 
baseline. Based on this finding, it is suggested that optimal gluc ose control should 
be achieved before starting a patient on everolimus and should be monitored 
during everolimus  therapy.  
 
6.1.3  Management  of non -infectious pneumonitis  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of 
non-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) have also been 
described in patients taking everolimus. Some of these have been severe and on 
rare occasions, a  fatal outcome was observed.  
A diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with non -specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, 
pleural effusion, cough or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other 
non-medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. 
Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory 
symptoms.  
Patients who develop radiological changes sugges tive of non -infectious 
pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue everolimus therapy 
without dose alteration.   Dose modifications and retreatment are described in 
Table 3 below.

In addition to the toxicities listed above, bevacizumab will be discontinued 
if it is likely related to a persistent (  3 weeks) NCI -CTCAE version 4 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse event or any other significant adverse event that 
compromises the subjec ts’ ability to participate in the study.  
Any toxicity associated or possibly associated with bevacizumab treatment 
should be managed according to standard medical practice.   
Discontinuation of bevacizumab will have no immediate therapeutic effect. 
Bevaci zumab has a terminal half -life of 21 days;  therefore, its

discontinuation results in slow elimination over several months. There is no 
available antidote for bevacizumab.  
If bevacizumab is held or discontinued due to toxicity, patients should 
continue the  rest of the regimen provided that patient s have no toxicities that 
require dose interruption or dose modification of other agents of the 
regimen.   
Patients should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to, during, and after 
each infusion. If severe bevacizumab -related toxicity, such as viscer al 
perforation, aortic dissection, or nephritic syndrome, occurs at any time 
during the study, treatment with bevacizumab should be discontinued.  
Bevacizumab will be withheld or discontinued for its related toxici ties, but 
not dose -reduced.  
 
Ovarian Fail ure/Irregular Menstruation:  
Ovarian failure, defined as amenorrhea lasting 3 or more months with 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) elevation (≥  30 mIU/mL), has recently 
been shown to be associated with the use of bevacizumab in patients with 
various solid  tumor receiving bevaciumab in combination with cytotoxic 
chemotherapies.  Specifically, the inc idence of ovarian failure was increased 
in patients receiving adjuvant bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX compared to 
mFOLFOX al one (34% vs. 2%).   After discontinuation o f bevacizumab, 
resumption of menses and an FSH level <  30 mIU/mL was demonstrated in 
22% (7/32) of these women.    
The CTCAE grading of irregular menstruation is : 
 grade 1: intermittent menses with skipped menses for  no more than 1 -3 
months,  
 grade 2: intermittent menses with skipped menses for more than 4 -6 
months , and,  
 grade 3: persistent amenorrhea for more than 6 months.   
All patients enrolled on this study of childbearing potential are notified of 
the risk asso ciated with bevacizumab and the fact  that the long term effects 
of bevacizumab exposure on fertility are unknown.  If patients develop > 
grade 2 irregular menstruation that is > possible in its attribution to 
bevacizumab, they are permitted to stay on drug despite this adverse event 
as long as the local investi gator and study PI have confirmed with the patient 
the potential short and long term risks to fertility by continuing bevacizumab 
and that the patient wishes to stay on study drug despite these risks.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST  AND REPORTING REQUIREMEN TS  
 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  63 
For this study, all grade 3 and 4 clinical adverse events which occur after enrollment and 
up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication must be recorded in the appropriate 
case report form (CRF ).  Grade 1 and 2 adverse events judged to be clinically significant 
(for example grade ≥1 mucositis, hypertension, pneumonitis) by the treating physician 
should also be recorded in the appropriate CRF.  Guidelines for the reporting of 
laboratory abnormali ties are d escribed in section 7.6.  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), as defined below, should be reported in an expedited 
fashion as per section 7.8.  All SAEs should be reported at the participating sites 
according to their institutional guidelines.  
 
7.1  Definition  of Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the inves tigational 
product.  Pre -existing conditions which worsen during a study are to be reported 
as AEs.  
 
7.2  CTCAE term (AE description)  
 
The descriptions found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE  reporting.  A copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
 
7.3  Drug -Adverse Event relationship  
 
The causality relationship of study drug to the adverse event will be assessed by 
the investigator as either:  Definite, P robable, P ossible, Unlikely, or Unrelated  .  
Attributions can be revised, when further information becomes available.   
Definitions of relationship to study medication are as follows : 
 
Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelat ed – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
 
Additionally, adverse events should be categorized as expected  or unexpected 
based on the Clinical Investigator Brochure or package insert.   
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  64 
The following criteria should be considered in order  to assess the relationship as  
Yes:   
- Reasonable temporal association with drug administration  
- Known response pattern to suspected drug  
- Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose  
- Reappears  on rechallenge  
 
The following criteria should be considered in order to assess the relationship as  
No: 
- It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug 
- It may readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of thera py administered to the 
subject  
- It does not follow a known pattern of response to the suspected drug  
- It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered  
 
7.4  Definition of Serious Adverse Ev ents (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that occurs at any dose and fulfils at 
least one of the following criteria:  
- is fatal; (results in death; NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event)  
- is life -threatening ; (NOTE: the term "life -threatenin g" refers to an event in 
which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had 
it been more severe)  
- required in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of  existing  hospitalization;  
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
- is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the 
outcomes listed above.  
 
Please note : 
 
- Related  Serious Adverse Events MUST  be collected and reported regardless of 
the time elapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has 
been closed.  
- Unrelated  Serious Adverse Events must be collected and reported after study  
enrollment and fo r up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication.  
 
7.5   Progression of Underlying Malignancy and Hospitalization  
 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  65 
Progression of underlying malignancy is not reported  as an adverse event if it is 
clearly consistent with the suspected progression o f the underlying cancer.   
Hospitalization due solely  to th e progression of underlying malignancy should 
NOT be reported as a serious adverse event.   
If there is any uncertainty about an adverse event being due only to the disease 
under study, it should be reported as an AE or SAE.  
 
7.6 Guidelines for Reporting of Laboratory Abnormalities as AEs /SAEs  
 
Any treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory result, which is clinically 
significant, i.e., meeting one or more of the following conditions, should be 
recorded as a single diagnosis on the adverse event page in the CRF:  
- Accompanied by clinical symptoms  
- Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption 
or permanent discontinuation  
- Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g.  addition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment)  
Please note:  any abnormal laboratory result fulfilling the criteria for a serious 
adverse event (SAE) should be reported as such, in a ddition to being recorded as 
an adverse event in the CRF.  
 
7.7 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All serious adverse events should be submitted to SARC within 1 working day 
from the participating sites as detailed below. SARC is responsible to report the 
events within 1 working day  to the trial PI, Novartis, and Genentech.  All SAEs 
should be reported at the participating sites according to their institutional 
guidelines.  
 
The site investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each 
specific study drug . If only limited information is initially available, follow -up 
reports are required and should be forwarded to SARC.  SAEs must be reported on 
the MedWatch Form 3500A along with the completed Fax Coversheet and faxed 
to SARC. (See Operat ions Manual for SAE Fax coversheet). The original SAE 
Form must be kept on file at the study site.  
 
Complications or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow -up to 
the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the foll ow-up 
information.

7.8  Pregnancy  
 
Females must be instructed to stop taking the study medication and immediately 
inform the investigator if pregnancy occurs after enrollment to the study. 
Pregnancies occurring up to 120 days after the completion of th e study medication 
must also be reported to SARC.  SARC should report all pregnancies within 24 
hours of receipt of notification to Novartis.  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported. The 
pregnancy should be followed up to de termine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications.  
 
7.9 Follow -up of AEs   
 
After the discontinuation of therapy with everolimus  and/or bevacizumab, 
continu e to follow up AEs as follows:  
 
Related AEs:   Follow until one of the following occurs:  
- Resolved or improved to baseline  
- Relationship is reassessed as unrelated  
- Death  
- Start of new anti -cancer regimen  
- Investigator confirms that no further improvement can be expected  
- Clinical or safety data will no longer be collected, or final database closure  
 
Unrelated severe or life threatening AEs:   Follow until one of the following 
occurs:  
- Resolved or improved to b aseline  
- Severity improved to grade 2  
-  Death  
-  Start of new anti -cancer regimen  
 
-  Investigator confirms that no further improvement can be expected  
-  Clinical or safety data will no longer be collected, or final database closure  
 
Grade 2 AEs judged to be clinically significant:   Follow as clinically indicated.  
The final outcome of each adverse event must be recorded on the CRF.

Clinically:  The drug substance, everolimus , contains 15 asymmetric carbon 
atoms and 4 s ubstituted double bonds. The configuration of the asymmetric 
carbon atoms and the double bonds are guaranteed by the microbial origin of 
rapamycin, the starting material of the synthesis, and by the X -ray analysis 
performed on crystalline everolimus. The c onfiguration at carbon 40 is not 
changed by the chemical derivatization that converts rapamycin into everolimus.

Warnings and Precautions:  
 Non-infectious Pneumonitis  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including 
everolimus. Cases of non -infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung 
disease) have also bee n described  in patients taking everolimus.  Some of these 
have been severe and on rare occasions, f atal outcomes have been observed.  
A diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with  non-specific respiratory signs a nd symptoms  such as hypoxia, 
pleural effusion, cough or  dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other 
non-medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations.  
Patients should be advised to report  promptly any new or worsening respirato ry 
symptoms.  
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non -infectious 
pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue everolimus therapy 
without dose alteration.  If symptoms are moderate, consideration should be given 
to interruption of  therapy until symptoms  improve.  The use of corticosteroids 
may be indicated. Everolimus may be reintroduced at 5 mg daily.  
For cases where symptoms of non -infectious pneumonitis are severe, everolimus 
therapy should be discontinued and the use  of corticosteroids may be indicated 
until clinical symptoms resolve.  Therapy with everolimus may be re -initiated at a 
reduced dose of 5 mg  daily depending on the individual clinical circumstances.   
Pneumonitis has also been reported at a reduced dose of everolimus.  
 Infections  
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to  
bacterial, fungal, viral or protozoan infections, including infections with 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  73 
opportunistic pathogens. Localiz ed and systemic infections, including pneumonia, 
other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or 
candidiasis and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have 
been described in patients taking everolimu s95,96. Some of these infections have 
been severe (e.g. leading to respirator y or hepatic failure) and occasionally have 
had a fatal outcome.  
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with 
everolimus . Treat  pre-existing infections prior to starting treatment with 
everolimus . While taking everolimus , be vigilant for symptoms and signs of 
infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute  appropriate treatment 
promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of everolimus . If a 
diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discon tinue everolimus  
and treat  with appropriate antifungal therapy.  
Patients with positive results of HBV -DNA and/or HBsAg at screening should 
begin a  prophylaxis treatment for 1 -2 week prior to beginning everolimus therapy. 
Patients should  have HBV -DNA monitored frequently throughout the course of 
everolimus therapy for s igns of hepatitis reactivation.  
 If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue 
everolimus and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy.  
 Hypersensitivity reactions   
Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but  not limited to, 
anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the 
airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) have been observed 
with eve rolimus.  
 Oral ulceration  
Mouth ulcers, stomatitis and oral mucositis have been seen in patients treated with 
everolimus. In such cases topical treatments are recommended, but alcohol - or 
peroxide  containing  mouthwashes should be avoided as they may exacerbate the 
condition. Antifungal  agents should not be used unless fungal infe ction has been 
diagnosed.  
 Renal Failure Events  
Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with fatal outcome, 
occurred in patients treated with everolimus. Monitor renal function of patients 
particularly in situations where patients have additional risk factors that may 
further impair renal function.    
Laboratory tests and monitoring  
 Renal Function  
Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria, usually mild, have been reported 
in clinical trials. Monitoring of renal function, including me asurement of blood 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  74 
urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein or serum creatinine, is recommended prior 
to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter.  
 Blood glucose  
Hyperglycemia has been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of fasting serum 
glucose is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically 
thereafter. Optimal glycemic control should be achieved before starting a patient 
on everolimus .  
 Hem atologic parameters  
Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelets and neutrophils have been reported 
in clinical trials. Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the 
start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter.  
 Hepatic Impairment  
Everolimus exposure was increased in patients with mild (Child -Pugh A), 
moderate (Child -Pugh B), and severe (Child -Pugh C) hepatic impairment.   
Everolimus is not recommended for use in postmenopausal women with hormone 
receptor positive advance d breast c ancer, or in patients with advanced 
neuroendocrine tumors of gastrointestinal, lung, or pancreatic origin or advanced 
renal cell carcinoma with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh C) unless the 
potential benefit outweighs the risk.  Everolimus is not recommended in patients 
with SEGA with severe hepatic impairment, (Child -Pugh class  C). 
 Vaccinations  
The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live 
vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus.  Examples of live 
vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, 
yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.

Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein e xcretion – 
a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24 -hour urine protein of 1 gm.  UPC 
ratio is calculated using on e of the following formula s: 
- [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] – if both protein and creatinine are reported in 
mg/dL  
- [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine] – if urine creatinine is reported in 
mmol/L

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
11.1 Antitumor effect – solid tumor  
 
11.1.1  Definitions   
Evaluable for toxicity:   Patients who have received at least one dose of study drug 
will be considered evaluable for toxicity from the time of their fir st dose of 
everolimus and bevacizumab until the last evaluation on trial.  
 
Evaluable for objective response:   
 
Measurable disease:   Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least two dimensions (longest diameter > 20 mm with 
conventional techniques or >10 mm using spiral CT scan). All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 
Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter < 20  mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm using 
spiral CT scan), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by 
CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
 
Any patient who is enrolled an d receives at least one dose of everolimus and 
bevacizumab will be considered evaluable for response provided: (1) the patient 
demonstrates progressive disease or death while on protocol therapy; (2) the 
patient is observed on protocol therapy for at least  one cycle and the tumor is not 
removed surgically prior to the time complete response or partial response is 
confirmed; or (3) the patient demonstrates a complete or partial response or stable 
disease as confirmed according to protocol criteria.  Patients  who electively 
terminate therapy before receiving all bevacizumab doses and ≥ 70% of the 
required everolimus doses during the first treatment cycle and do not expire 
within 28 days from start of treatment will be replaced.  
 
11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
Measurable, bidimensional:     Malignant disease measurable in two dimensions by 
ruler with surface area determined by multiplying the longest d iameter by the 
greatest perpendicular diameter.   
 
Index Lesions:  Index lesions should be selected on the basis of their measurability 
in two dimensions and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (by 
imaging techniques  CT or MRI).  A sum of the product(s) of the longest diameter 
(LD) and greatest perpendicular diameter of all index lesions will be calc ulated

and reported as the baseline sum.   The baseline sum will be used as a reference 
by which to characterize the objective tumor response . 
 
Non-index Lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the i ndex lesions should be identified as non -
index lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurement of these 
lesions is not required , but the presence or absence of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up. 
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Meas urable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler.  
All baseline evaluations should be performe d as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatm ent. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline a nd during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when 
both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI:   These techniques should be performed with cuts of 5 
mm or less in slice thickness contiguously.  This applies to tumors of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and ne ck tumors and those of extremities may require 
specific protocols.  
 
11.1.4  WHO Response Criteria  
WHO response criteria will be used for thi s trial for several reasons:  
1) MPNSTs are typically complex non spherical tumors, and 2 -dimensional 
measurements may thus better reflect changes in tumor size than 1 -dimensional 
measurements (RECIST).  
2) The phase 2 trial of erlotinib, which will be used as a historical control for 
determination of time to progression, used WHO criteria. In order to allow for the 
closest comparison, this trial will therefore use WHO response criteria.  
 
11.1.4.1  Evaluation of Index Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappeara nce of all known disease, determined by 
two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart.  
 
Partial Response (PR) :  A > 50% decrease in the total tumor load of the lesions 
that have been measured to determine the effect of therapy not less than four  
weeks apart. The observations must be consecutive.  
 
Bidimensionally measurable:  single lesion, > 50% decre ase in tumor area 
(multiplication of longest diameter by the greatest perpendicular diameter);

multiple lesions, a 50% decrease in the sum of the pro ducts of the 
perpendicular diameters of the multiple lesions.  
 
In addition there can be no appearance of new lesions or progression of any 
lesion.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  A 50% decrease in total tumor area cannot be established 
nor has a 25% increase in the size of one or more measurable lesions been 
demonstrated.  
 
Progressive Disease ( PD):   A > 25% increase in the area of one or more 
measurable lesions or the appearance of new lesions.   
 
 
11.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Index Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Complete disappearance of all known disease for at 
least four weeks.  
Partial Respo nse (PR) : Estimated decrease in tumor area of > 50% for at least four 
weeks.  
Stable Disease (SD) : No significant change for at least four weeks.  This 
includes stable disease, estimated decrease of < 50%, and lesions with estimated 
increase of < 25%.  
Progressive D isease (PD) :  Appearance of any new lesions not previously 
identified or an estimated increase of > 25% in existent lesions.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -index” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in s uch circumstances, and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the Principal 
Investigator.

11.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, best response scan).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.   
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until  the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of objective 
progression or  death.

12.4  Human Subjects Protection  
 
12.4.1  Rationale for Subject Selection  
 
Subjects of both genders and from all racial and ethnic groups are eligible for this 
trial if they meet the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 3.1. No groups are 
being  excluded from participation in the trial.  Approximately 50% of MPNSTs 
develop in individuals with NF1, and we expect that approximately 50% of 
individuals enrolled will have NF1 associated MPNST, and 50% will have a 
sporadic MPNST.  
 
12.4.2  Participation of Children  
 
The treatment approach to MPNST is similar for children and adults. However, 
enrollment will be limited to patients ≥ 18 years old. . 
 
12.4.3  Evaluation of the Benefits and Risks/Discomforts  
 
The primary risk to patients participating i n this research study is from toxicity of 
the combination of everolimus and bevacizumab, the FDA approved agents used 
to treat the refractory MPNST. The primary objective of this phase 2 trial is to 
assess the clinical response rate in patients with refrac tory MPNST. Patients will 
thus be treated with therapeutic intent and response to the therapy will be closely 
monitored.  Treatment options for these patients are very limited, as all patients 
will have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is consi dered first line 
treatment by many oncologists for unresectable high -grade MPNSTs.   The 
potential benefits from this therapy are disease stabilization, tumor shrinkage, and 
a reduction in symptoms caused by the cancer.  Therefore, this greater than 
minimal  risk protocol presents the potential for direct benefit to individual 
subjects . 
 
The medical, hospital, and research records associated with this study are 
considered confidential . Members of the treating team and designated research 
study assistants will  have access to the records as required to administer treatment 
and comply with the protocol. Neither the name nor other identifying information 
for an individual will be used in t he report or publication concerning this study. 
Patient records may be inspe cted by auditing agencies including the NCI the FDA 
to satisfy regulatory requirements , and Novartis, and Genentech.

12.4.4  Risks/Benefits Analysis  
 
The protocol provides for detailed and careful monitoring of all patients to assess 
for toxicity and response to treatment. Patients will be treated with therapeutic 
intent and response to the therapy will be closely monitored. The potential benefit 
from this therapy is disease stabilization,  tumor shrinkage, and decrease tumor 
related symptoms. Therefore, this proto col involves greater than minimal risk to 
subjects, but presents the potential for direct benefit to individual subjects. For 
patients who cannot provide informed consent by themse lves, but have a durable 
power of attorney (DPA) this legal representative w ill be able to provide informed 
consent for this study.    
 
12.4.5  Consent and Assent Process and Documentation  
 
The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the procedures and 
treatments involved and their attendant risks and discomforts and  benefits, and 
potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the patient. The PI or 
an associate investigator on the trial will obtain consent from the patient or legal 
representative.  The PI or associate investigator will meet with the p atient to 
discuss the protocol treatment and alternative options in detail. It will be stated 
clearly that participation in the research study is voluntary and that participants 
can withdraw from the study without losing benefits they would otherwise be 
entitled to. The patient and family members will be encouraged to ask questions, 
and additional meetings to discuss the treatment options will be arranged as 
necessary.  
 
12.4.6  Handling of  Research Samples  
 
This study is sponsored and  coordinated by SARC.   Laborat ory correlative studies 
are not mandatory and will be conducted as outlined in section 9.  A detailed 
operations manual will be provide to each participating site, which will outline 
sample labeling, collection and processing.  Once analyzed for studies ou tlined in 
this protocol any remaining samples will be stored at the site performing the 
analyses or at the SARC designated specimen bank until the study is complete, 
and the manuscript describing the study has been accepted for publication. The 
study will remain open and status reported to the IRB until all samples have been 
analyzed, reported , banked  or destroyed. Unintentional loss or destruction of any 
samples will be reported to the IRB as part of  annual continuing reviews.   Any 
use of these samples for purposes not described in Section 9 will require 
prospective IRB review and approval. Tumor spec imens will be sent to a SARC 
identified expert and will be delineated in the Operat ions Manual.  Should tumor 
sample be left after completion of research studies described in the protocol, 
prospective approval from the appropriate IRB will be obtained prio r to 
performing additional studies.

12.4.7  Handling of Patient Data  
 
All patient data wi ll be captured and maintained in a study specific database with 
password protected access. Data is entered using an assigned study subject 
identification number.  
 
The data provided to those reviewing the results, for example the  study statistician 
will in clude the subject identification numbers, but will not include patient 
identifiable data.  
 
The research samples obtained on this study will only be sent using the s tudy 
subject identification number which can only be linked to the patient at a given 
instit ution by the treating physician.  
 
All documentation that contains personal health information that may include 
patient identifiable information will be maintained a t the site to preserve patient 
confidentiality.  
 
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
13.1 Prim ary objectives  
The primary endpoint of the study is the clinical benefit rate (complete response, 
partial response , and stable d isease at ≥ 4 months ) of patients with progressive 
high-grade, unresectable or metastatic MPNSTs  treated on study.  
 
A recently completed trial of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib for individuals with 
refractory MPNST demonstrated a median time to progression of 48 days and 
progressiv e disease at the time of the first response evaluation after completion of 
2 treatment cycles in 19/20 evaluable patients36,97. Three other smaller studies had 
showed simil ar results (see section 2.1). We therefore believe that stable disease 
at ≥ 4 months on treatment with everolimus alone and in combination with 
bevacizum ab can be considered as potentially beneficial and worthy of further 
exploration. An evaluable patien t will be classified a success  for the primary 
endpoint if the patient achieves a PR, CR or stable disease at ≥ 4 months.  
 
The target success rate will be  25%, and a success  rate <  5% will be considered 
uninteresting. Using a  two-stage Simon Minmax phase II design98 the first stage 
will require 15 patients, with no  further  accrual if no successes are observed 
within the first 15 patients. If at least one success is observed  accrual w ill 
continue until a tota l of 25  evaluable patients have been enroll ed. If at least four 
successes are observed in the 25  patients everolimus with addition of 
bevacizumab will be considered active in that it would be consistent with a 25% 
success  rate. Assuming the number of succe sses is binomially distributed, this 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  101 
study has an alpha of 5% and a power of 90% for detecting a true success 
probability of at least 25% versus the null hypothesis success rate of 5% or less. 
Patients will be able to remain on treatment for as long as the y do not experience 
progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. It is expected that 15 -25 patients per 
year will be enrolled, thus enrollment is expected t o complete within one to two 
years depending on the initial number of responses observed.   
 
All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and 
have begun treatment will be evaluable for response.  
 
Patients will be able to remain on treatment for as long as they do not experience 
progressive disease or unacceptable toxici ty.  
 
Toxicity data will be presented by severity. The incidence of toxicities will be 
estimated using the binomial proportion and its 95% confidence interval.  The 
incidence of infection related deaths will be estimated using the binomial 
proportion and i ts 95% confidence interval.   
 
13.2 Secondary objectives  
 
Summary statistics will be used to describe the study p opulation (such as ranges, 
medians of ages, gender, baseline performance characteristics).  
 
Analysis of secondary endpoints will be predominan tly descriptive using 
primarily non -parametric analyses and will be interpreted as being exploratory 
and hypothes is generating. Results will be summarized with scatterplots and 
correlation coefficients.  
 
Pharmacod ynamic parameters including p70 S6 kinase 1 activity in PBMCs and 
proangiogenic factors in blood samples will be measured pre -treatment and at 
time of resp onse evaluations during subsequent courses. Changes in these 
parameters will be correlated with radiographic response using the logistic 
regres sion model.  
 
Comprehensive NF1 mutation analysis and detailed phenotyping including 
quantification of tumor rela ted and non -tumor related NF1 manifestations will be 
performed . Genotyping will be performed in a CLIA approved laboratory. Results 
from genotyping in our cohort of patients with MPNST will be compared to the 
spectrum of >3000 mutations as identified in a large cohort of unrelated patients.  
 
The mutations will be sub divided in 3 main classes:  
1. Nonsense, out -of frame splice mutations, frameshift mutations: these mutations 
are all generally accepted to lead to a premature stop codon. This results in the 
formation of unstable transcripts that will become degraded by the nonsense -
mediated RNA decay. Hence, these types of mutations can be considered as 
 
 
Confidential    9 July 2015  
 
Copyright© SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration)  102 
mutations leading to haplo -insufficiency.  
2. Missense mutations and in -frame splice mutations may fall under a  different 
category of mutations that may either present hypomorphic  alleles due to some 
residual neurofibromin function or present gain-of-function  alleles due to the 
activation or specific inhibition of a particular domain. These mutations will be 
subdivided according to the known and putative ( in silico  predicted) protein 
domains they are residing in. A distinction will be made between missense 
mutations residing in at least 6 regions: all exons prior to the Cystein -Serine -Rich -
Domain (CSRD), the CSRD, t he Tubulin -binding domain, the Gap -Related -
Domain, the Sec -14 domain, and the Syndecan binding region.  
3. Finally, mutations deleting the NF1 gene as well as all genes residing in the 
most common 1.5 Mb deletion versus only a portion of the flanking genes.  Using 
a Multiple Ligation Probe Assay (MLPA) and c ustom designed Agilent oligo 
CGH -array the extent of the deletion in all subjects will be established and 
compared with the severity of the phenotype.  
 
It will be tested whether an association between the typ e of NF1 mutation and 
NF1 manifestation and comp lications related to NF1 exists. The common clinical 
abnormalities will be coded as: Lisch nodules (present/ absent), number of CAL 
macules (0, 1 –5, 6-100, >  100), axillary freckling (present/absent; 
unilatera l/bilateral), number of cutaneous and dermal ne urofibromas (0, 2 -6, > 6-
100, 101 –500, >  500), plexiform neurofibromas (0, 1 or >  2 plexiform 
neurofibromas residing in different parts of the body), optic glioma 
(present/absent; symptomatic/asymptomatic), inter nal or spinal neurofibromas 
(present/ absent  and numerically); skeletal abnormalities including tibial 
dysplasia, pseudarthrosis, sphenoid wing dysplasia, dysplastic vertebrae, osseous 
cysts and scoliosis   (present/absent); other neoplasms including brains tem glioma, 
pheochromocytoma, rhabdomyosarco ma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumor, JMML, hypothalamic glioma (present/absent); cardiovascular disease 
(present/absent); developmental delay and learning disabilities (present/absent); 
NF-Noonan phenotyp e (present/absent); Watson syndrome phenotype 
(present/absent).  
 
Logistic regression analysis will be used to calculate significance, relative risks 
(RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes. Linear regression 
analysis will be used for con tinuous outcomes. Covariate informat ion such as 
gender, type of constitutional NF1 mutation and age at examination (as a 
continuous variable) to name a few will be considered for inclusion in the models. 
The mutation covariate is coded as several binary va riables (indicators of 
missense, in -frame and out -of frame splicing, and non -sense mutations). Age at 
examination will be included as a covariate because the penetrance of many NF1 
disease features changes with age. Adjustments for multiple testing will be

Volumetric MRI: An aut omated method of volumetric analysis of plexiform 
neurofibromas in NF1 was recently developed, and is in use in clinical trials. This 
method is reproducible and allows detection of smaller changes in tumor size than 
conventional response criteria (WHO)94. Simila r to plexiform neurofibromas, 
MPNSTs have a complex shape (non spherical), and RECIST (1 -dimensional)99 
or WHO (2 -dimensional)100 criteria may have limited applicability . Volumetric 
MRI tumor analysis will be applied to MPNSTs as a tool for response assessment. 
Response evaluation using volumetric measurements will be compared to 
standard 2 -dimensional response measurements (WHO criteria), and to 1 -
dimensional measurements (RECIST criteria). Spearman rank correlation will be 
used to describe the association.

Study treatment instructions  
Study treatment will be given in 28 day cycles.  
Everolimus  
 Your dose of everolimus  is _____________  
 You will take everolimus once per day, every day of each 28  day c ycle.  
 Take each dose at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. You should 
take the everolimus either in a fasting state (no food one hour before or two hours 
after meals) or with a light fat -free meal.  If you choose one method over the other 
you should use that method every  day you take everolimus.  
 If you miss a dose, you may still  take it up to 6 hours after the time you would 
normally take it. If more than 6 hours have elapsed, you should skip the dose for that 
day.  The next day, you should take the everolimus at the usual time.  Do not take 2 
doses to make up for the missed dose . 
 If you vomit your dose of everolimus, do not take that dose again. Mark the vomited 
dose in this diary. Take the next day’s dose as scheduled.  
 It is important that your dietary habits remain as consistent as possible throughout the 
study around the time you take everolimus. You should avoid grapefruit, Seville 
oranges, or star fruit and the juices of these fruits, and St.  John’s Wort while you are 
taking everolimus, as these items may change how your body handles everolimus.  
 It is important that you maint ain good oral hygiene (mouth care) while you are taking 
everolimus to help prevent inflammation of the mouth tissues.  
 You should not receive live vaccines or have close contact with those who have 
received them while you are taking everolimus.  
 Bring any unused everolimus, and this diary to each clinic visit. The study staff will 
make sure you have an adequate supply of everolimus to take home at the end of 
each clinic visit.  SARC016 Participant Study Drug Diary

APPENDIX V: HEPATITIS SCREENING/MONITORING /TREATMENT  
Reactivation  of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer re ceiving 
chemotherapy. Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation have also been seen in this setting 
with everolimus. Use of antivirals during anti -cancer therapy has be en shown to reduce the 
risk of H epatitis B virus reactivation and associated morbidity and mortality.  A detailed 
assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done for all patients at 
screening, with testing per formed prior to the first dose of everolimus.  
 
Testing for hepatitis B viral load and serologic markers: HBV -DNA, HBsAg, HBs Ab, and 
HBc Ab  and HCV RNA PCR are required at screening for all patient s in the following risk 
categories:  
o All patients who curr ently live in (or have lived in) Asia, Africa, Central and South 
America, Eastern Europe, Spain, Portugal, an d Greece.   
o Patients with any of the following risk factors:  
 know n or suspected past hepatitis B infection,  
 blood transfusion (s) prior to 1990,  
 current or prior IV drug users,  
 current or prior dialysis,  
 household contact with  hepatitis B infected patient(s ),  
 current or prior high-risk sexual activity,  
 body piercing or tattoos,  
 mother known to have hepatitis B 
 history  suggestive of hepatitis B infection, e.g., dark urine, jaundice, right upper 
quadrant pain.  
 
Management of Hepatitis reactivation  
In cancer patients with hepatitis B, whether carriers or in chronic state, use of antivirals 
during anticancer therapy has be en shown to reduce the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
reactivation and associated HBV morbidity and mortality.  
Monitoring and prophylactic treatment for hepatitis B reactivation  
The tables below provide details of monitoring and prophylactic therapy accor ding to the 
baseline results of viral load and serologic markers testing.

Antiviral prophylaxis therapy should continue for at least 4 weeks afte r last dose of study drug.     
For patients who have already received study drug prior to the approval of the amendment, 
the same process should be followed at the patient's next visit. The first HBV -DNA result 
would be regarded as baseline.

If resolution occurs within ≤ 28 days  study drug should be re -started at one 
dose lower, if available. If the patient is already receiving the lowest dose of 
study drug according to the protocol, the patient sho uld restart at the same 
dose after resolution. Both antiviral therapies should continue at least 4 
weeks after last dose of study drug.  
If resolution occurs > 28 days  Patients should discontinue study drug  but 
continue both antiviral therapies at least 4 weeks after last dose of study 
drug.

reactivation is defined as:  
New appearance of measurable

after last dose of study drug.  
If resolution occurs > 28 days  Patients should discontinue study drug but 
continue antiviral therapy at least 4 weeks after last dose of study drug.  
* All reactivations of hepatitis B are to be recorded as grade 3 (CTCAE v 3.0 Metabolic Laboratory/ Other: 
Viral Re -activation) , unless considered life threatening by the investigator; in which case they should be 
recorded as grade 4 (CTCAE v 3.0 Metabolic Laboratory/Other: Viral Re -activation) . Date of viral reactivation 
is the date on which both  DNA an d ALT criteria were met (e.g. for a patient who was HBV -DNA positive on 
01-JAN-10 and whose ALT reached ≥ 5 × ULN on 01 -APR -10, the date of viral reactivation is 01 -APR -10). 
 
Monitoring for hepatitis C  
The following two categories of patients should be monitored every 4 weeks for HCV 
reactivation:  
 Patients with detectable HCV RNA -PCR test at baseline.  
 Patients known to have a history of HCV infection, despite a negative viral load test at 
baseline (including those that were treated and are considered ‘cu red’)  
For definition of hepatitis C reactivation and the management guidelines, see the table below 
with guidelines for management of hepatitis C.

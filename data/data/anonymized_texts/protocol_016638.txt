Protocol Amendment 2 Final
12-NOV -2019 3Protocol A mendment 1 Rationale
Amendment number: Amendment 1
Rationale/background for changes:
The protocol has been amended following the comments received from the Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research . The following changes were implement ed:
Objectives: The protocol has been modified to include pregnancies irrespective of
low or high -risk status (to reflect the current use of the vaccine) .A primary
objective has been added to rule out a two-fold increase in the incidence of four
pre-specified maternal and infant adverse events. A secondary  objective has been
added to explore differences in eight other pre -specified maternal and infant
adverse events.
Endpoints:
The list of endpoints has been reviewed in view of their medical and scientific
significance . Prioritization of endpoints was also based on the 2014
collaboration between the Brighton Collaboration Foundation and the World
Health Organization (WHO) toaddress gaps in the safet y assessment of
vaccines 
during pregnancy (1). The following endpoints were removed:
Gestational diabetes, premature uterine contractions, macrosomia, fetal
distress, placenta previa, and delivery  methods. The following endpoints were
added: S mall for gestational age(SGA) , preterm delivery , neonatal d eath,
maternal death, and p reterm pre -labor rupture of membranes (PPROM
).
Spontaneous abortion with or without congenital anomaly  (CA) and
therapeutic abortion with or without CAoccur ,bydefinition ,before 2 0weeks
of gestation (2). Therefore, these events will not be part of the mai n anal ysis
on the safet y of Boostrix administered after the 27th week of gestation.
However, the incidence of these events will be collected for subjects who
received Boostrix prior to the 27th week of gestation and described in the
study  report.
Endpoints have been classified as either primary  or secondary .
Risk factors : additional factors defining a pregnancy  as “high- risk” ha vebeen
added.
Case definitions: P re- specified maternal and infant adverse events reflect the data
captured b y ICD-9 and ICD- 10 coding according to the clinical practice of
obstetrics.
Further details on the statistical methods have been added for each endpoint.

Protocol Amendment 2 Final
12-NOV -2019 4Protocol Amendment 2 Rationale
Amendment number:  Amendment 2
Rationale/background for changes:
The protocol has been amended to modify the secondary endpoint of “post -
partum hemorrhage (PPH)” to “transfusion during delivery hospitalization” as 
a proxy for severe PPH. We originally planned to identify PPH from automated 
diagnosis codes (ICD -9 and ICD -10) and then perform chart review to confirm 
the event. However, in October 2017 (ACOG Practice Bulletin PPH 2017), the 
threshold for estimated blood loss (EBL) for PPH diagnosis changed, affecting 
the comparison between the historical (~2012- 2013) and th e Boostrix exposed 
(2018 -2019) cohorts. The potential for using EBL as an objective measure is 
limited by differential missingness of EBL data between these two cohorts as well 
as inconsistency in EBL measurements. We propose to use transfusion during 
delivery hospitalization as an indicator of severe blood loss and as a proxy for 
severe PPH. Transfusion can be captured by procedure codes, and transfusion 
data are stable across the study period. Transfusion is a relevant endpoint 
because hemorrhage that lea ds to blood transfusion is the leading cause of severe 
maternal morbidity in the United States (ACOG Practice Bulletin PPH 2017).
The following changes have been implemented .
Secondary objectives; Data collection Figure 1; Statistical methods Tables 6 and
7 -"Post -partum hemorrhage" was changed to "Transfusion during delivery
hospitalization."
Case definitions; Data collection and management -Transfusion during delivery
hospitalization is captured by procedure codes and will not be chart reviewed.
Data collection Figure 1; Statistical methods Table 7 - Transfusion will be
identified among pregnant women with delivery hospitalizations.
Analysis of primary and secondary objectives; Statistical methods Table 7 
-The
statistical method for analyzing transfus ion will be an adjusted Poisson
regression model. Robust variance estimation is not planned since the incidence
is expected to be <2%.

Detailed Title An observational, retrospective cohort database study  to 
assess the safety  of Boostrix (U.S.formulation) , a reduced 
tetanus ,
diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine ( Tdap ),
following routine immunization of pregnant women in the 
United States.
Rationale for the 
studyTo describe the safet y of Boostrix administered during 
pregnancy  by conducting a post -marketing stud y that will 
provide safet y information to the public and healthcare 
providers. This will be one of the largest cohorts of pregnant 
women vaccinated with Boostrix in the U.S. Through 
partnership 
between Ka iser Permanente Southern California 
(KPSC) and the sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), we will 
provide information about the safet y of maternal vaccination 
with Boostrix and maternal and infant adverse events in a 
community  setting.
Primary  endpoints were differentiated from secondary  
endpoints to allow evaluating the safet y ofmaternal 
vaccination with sufficient statistical power on the primary  
endpoints and to allow for hypothesis generation/signal 
detection on secondary  endpoints.
Primary  endpoints were selected based on their medical 
relevance , also considering the background incidence or 
prevalence of these endpoints .
Description of the 
databaseVaccination and medical event data will be extracted directl y 
from the electronic healthrecord (
EHR, Health Connect), 
which is the legal record of all medical care received within 
the 
KPSC health care system. Records of vaccinations and 
medical events can onl y be entered b y medical staff .
Primary Objective To rule out a two- fold increase (non-inferiorit ytesting) in the 
incidence of
each of the following maternal and infant adverse 
events :
Preeclampsia and/or eclampsia
Intra -uterine infections such as chorioamnionitis and
endometritis
Small for gestational age (SGA)
Preterm delivery
among women who were vaccinated with Boostrix on or after 
the 1stday of the 27thweek of gestation as compared to the

pregnancy .
Secondary 
Objective s
(amended 12
November 2019)1.
To explore the difference (superiorit ytesting) in the 
incidence rate of other maternal and infant adverse 
events, namel y:
Transfusion during delivery hospitalization (as a proxy 
for severe post -partum hemorrhage)
Poor fetal growth
Stillbirth/fetal death with or without congenital anomalies
Neonatal death (within 28 day s of birth)
Maternal death (while pregnant or within 42 day s of end 
of pregnancy ) 
Placental abruption
Preterm pre -labor rupture of membranes (PPROM)
Congenital anomalies (CA) at birth and through 6 months 
of age
between women who were vaccinated with Boostrix on or 
after the 1stday of the 27thweek of gestation and a 
historical cohort of pregnant women ( approximately  
January  1, 2012 to December 31, 2013) who were 
unvaccinated with an y Tdap vaccine throughout their 
pregnancy .
2.To describe the incidence of maternal and infant adverse 
events described above, as well as the incidence of 
spontaneous and therapeutic abor tionswith or without 
congenital anomalies , among pregnant women vaccinated 
with Boostrix before the 27thweek of gestation
. 
Study design Type of study : Observational retrospective database study
Type of design: Matched cohort study
End of study : The date the database anal ysis is 
completed.
Primary  completion date: The date of final collection of
data for all outcomes
Study  population: pregnant women with prenatal care and 
continuous membership (allowing up to a 31 -day gap) at 
KPSC between the 1stday of the 27thweek of pregnancy  
and the index (vaccination) date

the 1stday of the 27thweek of pregnancy ; and who 
were not vaccinated with any other Tdap v accine at 
any other time during 
the pregnancy  in scope of this 
study .
Unexposed: Women matched to the exposed cohort, 
pregnant sometime durin g the approximate estimated 
period between 1/1/2012 -12/31/2013 who did not 
receive an y Tdap vaccine during the pregnancy  in 
scope of this study .
Of note, women vaccinated with Boostrix before the 27th
week of gestation, with membership at the date of vaccination, 
and who were not vaccinated with an y other Tdap vaccine at 
any other time during the pregnancy  in scope of this study  will 
be part of a descriptive analy sis (secondary  objective).
General stud y aspects: Subject -level data will be 
collected for pregnant women and their infants through 
the EHR. For each individual pregnant woman, follow up 
will begin on the date they received the Boostrix vaccine, 
or the index date for the unvaccinated cohort, an d will 
end on the date of disenrollment or the end of pregnancy , 
whichever came first. Infants born in KPSC hospitals 
from unvaccinated and vaccinated mothers will be 
followed for 6 months.
Number of subjects Approximately  15,000 pregnant women vaccinated with 
Boostrix over a period of approximately  one year. 
Unexposed pregnant women will be matched 1:1 to the 
exposed group and will be identified from a historical cohort. 
We aim to have a total sample size of approximately  30,000 
pregnant women.

12-NOV -2019 181. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Whooping cough, also referred to as pertussis, is a highl y contagious respiratory disease 
primarily  caused b y the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is most severe in 
unvaccinated or incompletely  vaccinated infants, who may  develop apnea, seizures
secondary  to hy poxia, pulmonary  hypertension, pneumonia ,otitis media , and death (3).
Cyclical increases in pertussis incidence continue to be described every  3 to 5 y ears in 
most developed countries despite high vaccination coverage. This is explained largel y by 
waning immunity  both after vaccination and after natural infection (4-6). 
Two tetanus
-diphtheria- acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines (Adacel and Boostrix) were 
licensed for use in the United States (U.S.) in 2005 ( 7). These vaccines were 
recommended for routine use in non -pregnant ad olescents and adults when introduced. In 
2010, the California Department of Health began recommending Tdap vaccine to women 
at an y stage of pregnancy in response to a pertussis outbreak and several infant deaths
(8).One year later, the Advisory  Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) advised 
Tdap to be administered during pregnancy , at 20 weeks gestation or later, to women who 
had not been previously  vaccinated (9).In October 2012, ACI P expanded its 
recommendation of administering Tdap during pregnancy (10); in order to increase the 
protection of newborns, all pregnant women should be offered Tdap, regardless of 
whether they
 have received Tdap previously . While the ACI P recommends that optimal 
timing for Tdap administration is between 27 a nd 36 weeks gestation to optimize transfer 
of anti -pertussis antibodies, Tdap may  be given at any  time during pregnancy . Both 
Adacel and Boostrix can be used interchangeably .
Prelicensure clinical study data showed that the incidence of unsolicited adverse events 
reported in the 31 day s after vaccination was comparable between recipients of Boostrix 
and Adacel (17.8% and 22.2% for Boostrix and Adacel, respectivel y). Serious adverse 
events during 0 -6 months following vaccine were reported by  1.4% and 1.7% of subjects, 
respectivel y. During the 6
-month extended safet y evaluation period, no serious adverse 
events of a neuroinflammatory  nature or with information suggesting an autoimmune 
etiology  were reported in subjects who received Boostrix (11).
Safety  events 
following Tdap immunization during pregnancy  have been increasingl y 
examined in recent years. A placebo- controlled clinical trial of Adacel administered to 
pregnant women ( 2008- 2012 )found no Tdap- associated serious adverse events (12).
During a time when Tdap was not routinely  recommended for pregnant wo men, 
spontaneous abortions were the most frequent pregnancy -specific adverse events (16.7%) 
identified through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting S ystem (VAERS), a national 
database used for monitoring the safet y of vaccines in the population ( 13). However, the 
number of pregnant women who received the vaccine was small (n=132) and likely  a 
selective group since the vaccine was not in routine use. Asmall study  observing a 
limited number of maternal and infant outcomes (chorioamnionitis, postpartum 
endometritis, premature rupture of membranes
, 5-minute Apgar score, birth defects ) also 
found no Tdap -associated adverse events (14)
.However, the authors found that Tdap was 
associated with women having decreased odds of cesarean delivery . In a study  of 2010 -

12-NOV -2019 192012 live births in twoCalifornia health care systems partic ipating in the Vaccine Safet y 
Datalink (VSD) project, no associations between Tdap and maternal hy pertensive 
disorders were found, although a small but statistically  significant increased risk of 
chorioamnionitis was observed (6.1% in vaccinated, 5.5% in unvaccinated) (15),a 
finding 
consistent with alarger subsequent study  at seven U.S. health care sy stem VSD 
sites ( 16). An increased risk of chorioamnionitis was also found in a different U.S.- based 
study  of over one- million pregnant women (2010 -2014), which also found anincreased 
risk of postpartum h
emorrhage, one case of post -immunization anaphy laxis ,and 12 cases 
of post -delivery  encephalopathy  (17) . However, this study  did not find a significant 
association with preeclampsia/eclampsia or premature rupture of membranes. An 
evaluation of acute events post vaccination found no associations betwee n Tdap 
immunization and a composite outcome of acute events , incident neurologic events or
thrombotic events, or proteinuria in alarge VSD cohort ( 18).Additionally ,a study  of 
infant outcomes found that Tdap wasnot significantly  associated with increased risk for 
structural birth defects or microcephal y for vaccinations given during any  week of 
pregnancy  
(19). Except for the afore mentioned VSD studies in which Adacel comprised 
the majority  of Tdap vaccines administered (15),the Tdap product in the other studies 
was not explicitly  mentioned. 
Considering that Boostrix is recommended to be used interchangeabl y with Adacel, and
there are limited observational safet y data on Boostrix during pregnancy, a post -
marketing stud y describing the safet y of Boostrix vaccine in pregnant women is 
particularl y necessary  and can provide timel y safety  information to the public and 
healthcare providers.
1.2. Rationale for the study
The rationale for the current study  is to assess the safet y of Boostrix administered on or 
after the 1stday of the 27thweek of pregnancy  by conducting a post -marketing study  that 
will provide safet y information to the public and healthcare providers. This will be one of 
the largest cohorts of pregnant women vaccinated with Boostrix in the U
.S. Through 
partnership 
between Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) and the sponsor, 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), w e will provide information about the safet y of maternal 
vaccination with Boostrix and maternal and infant adverse events in a community  setting. 
The observational stud y design takes advantage of KPSC’s electronic health record 
(EHR) system , Health Connect . We will capture adverse events following Boostrix 
vaccination in pregnant women and adverse events in an unexposed historical 
comparison cohort of pregnant women . Retrospective ascertainment of pregnant women 
through Health Connect is an efficient strategy in comparison to a recruitment study , 
which would be practically  and financiall y infeasible because pregnant women are not 
likely  to enroll in safety  stud ies.
Primary  endpoints were differentiated from secondary  endpoints to allow evaluating the 
safet y of maternal vaccination with sufficient power on the primary  endpoints and to 
allow 
for hypothesis generation/signal detect ion on secondary  endpoints.
Primary  endpoints were selected based on their medical relevance, considering also the 
background incidence or prevalence of these endpoints .

2.1. Primary  objective
To rule out a two-fold increase (non- inferiorit y testing) in the incidence of each of the 
following maternal and infant adverse events
:
Preeclampsia and/or eclampsia
Intra -uterine infections such as chorioamnionitis andendometritis
Small for gestational age (SGA)
Preterm delivery
among women who were vaccinated with Boostrix on or after the 1stday of the 27thweek 
of gestation as compared to the incidence in a historical cohort of pregnant women 
(approximately  January  1, 2012 to December 31, 2013) who were unvaccinated with any  
Tdap vaccine throughout their pregnancy .
2.2. Secondary  objectives (amended 12November 2019
)
1.To explore differences (superiority testing) in the incidence rate of other maternal 
and infant adverse events, namely :
Transfusion during delivery hospitalization (as a proxy for severe post -partum 
hemorrhage)
Poor fetal growth
Stillbirth/fetal death with or without congenital anomalies
Neonatal death (within 28 day s of birth)
Maternal death (while pregnant or within 42 day s of end of pregnancy ) 
Placental abruption
Preterm pre -labor rupture of membranes (PPROM)
Congenital anomalies (CA) at birth and through 6 months of age
between women who were vaccinated with Boostrix on or after the 1stday of the 27th
week of gestation and a historical cohort of pregnant women ( approximately  January  
1, 2012 to December 31, 2013) who were unvaccinated with any  Tdap vaccine 
throughout their pregnancy .
2.To describe the 
incidence of maternal and infant adverse events described above, as 
well as the incidence of spon taneous and therapeutic abortion with or without 
congenital anomalies, in pregnant women who were vaccinated with Boostrix before 
the 27thweek of gestation.

12-NOV -2019 213. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Stud y setting
KPSC is an integrated healthcare s ystem that provides comprehensive prepaid health 
services for its 4.4 million members. There are 1 5medical centers that include a total of 
225 medical office buildings throughout Southern California. Members are raciall y 
diverse and include the entire socio -demographic spectrum, and over 99% are 
community -dwelling. The demographic makeup of the KPSC membership closely  
mirrors the Southern California population and the California c ensus population 
(20).
Compared to the racial/ethnic distribution of the 
U.S. population, the KPSC membership 
has twice as man y individuals of Asian descent and three times as man y Hispanics. Data 
regarding demographics, services ,diagnoses , and procedures are tracked in the KP SC 
EHR ( Health Connect ) from the outpatient, emergency  department, and hospital settings. 
Health Connect is the legal record of all medical care received within the KPSC sy stem. 
Records of vaccinations and medical events can only  be entered b y medical staf f. 
Pharmacy  records and vaccination sare linked through patients’ unique medical record 
numbers (MRNs). Vaccinations received outside of the health plan are recorded with 
appropriate documentation.
KPSC is a pre -paid health care s ystem. Vaccines are typicall y provided to KPSC 
members at no charge, which is an incentive for members to receive immunizations 
within the sy stem. Also, there is a very  strong motivation for members to use services 
internally . For outside providers to be reimbursed by  the hea lth plan for covered 
emergent or contract care, claims must be submitted with documentation of the episode 
of care. Thus, the capture of care delivered to members by  electronic administrative data 
is reasonabl y assumed to be very comprehensive. The KPSC Re gional Immunization 
Practice Committee (RI PC) makes recommendations to ensure appropriate use of 
vaccination and implementation of new ACIP immunization recommendations within 
KPSC.
Standard of care regarding use of Tdap in pregnant women
On October 24, 2012, ACI P voted to recommend Tdap for pregnant women with every  
pregnancy irrespective of previous Tdap history . In December 2012, the KPSC RI PC 
followed ACI P guidance and recommended that providers of prenatal care implement a 
Tdap immunization program fo r all pregnant women. The g uidance indicated that all 
health- care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy  
irrespective of the patient’s prior history  of receiving Tdap. In order to maximize the 
maternal antibod y response and passive antibody  transfer to the infant, optimal timing for 
Tdap administration was specified between 27 and 36 weeks gestation.
Prior to the conduct of this observational study  of Boostrix in pregnancy , Adacel had 
been the onl y Tdap vaccine on the KPSC formular y.

12-NOV -2019 22Process for identify ing pregnancy  information
If a woman receives prenatal care at KPSC ,her pregnancy is recorded in a pregnancy  
episode flowsheet. Theflowsheet is contained in the woman’s medical record and is 
created at the beginning of the pregnan cy. It is appended with all pregnancy  encounters 
including prenatal visits, the hospital admission for birth, a s well as an y post-partum 
visits. Pregnancy and birth information at KPSC including maternal age, pre- pregnancy  
height and weight, perinatal risk factors, prenatal visit information, complications of 
pregnancy  and delivery , and procedures used during labor and delivery  are available from 
the EHR and can be viewed in Health Connect. 
Process for linking mothers and infants
As standard of care at KPSC, all infants born in KPSC hospitals are automatically  
assigned a MRN regardless of whether the mother is a current plan member.  If the 
mother is a current member, the bab y’s MRN is automatically  linked to her medical 
record in her pregnancy  episode flowsheet. 
3.2. Feasibility  assessment
The following tables display  data to describe Tdap v accination among pregnant women at 
seven selected KPSC medical centers that will administer the Boostrix vaccine. 
Approximately  15,000 women vaccinated with Boostrix will be included in this study ,
over approximately  a one -year period .
Pregnant women receiving the Tdap vaccine
The following table provides demographic information on pregnant women receiving the 
Tdap vaccine at seven selected medical centers at KPSC (Table 1) . There were 19,804 
pregnant women receiving the vaccine within these medical centers in 2016. 
Over half of 
themwere of Hispanic race/ethnicity  (57%). The age distribution shows that pregnan t 
women aged 27 -35 years old made up more than half (55%) of the Tdap -exposed 
pregnant women (Table 2).

Rationale for h istorical comparison cohort 
The estimated period of1/1/2012 -12/31/2013 was chosen for the unvaccinated 
comparison group because Tdap uptake ranged between 27% and 38% during this time 
(Table 
5). The aim is to restrict the unvaccinated population to approximately 2012 -2013
tominimize the concerns of confounding b y indication. Given that Tdap uptake exceeded 
65% starting in 2014 , aconcurrent unvaccinated cohort will y ield a small and selective 
sample , and is not represen tative of an unvaccinated group.

3.3. Stud y design overview
The study  design is an observational retrospective matched cohort stud y. This proposed 
research will be conducted among pregnant women who are members of KPSC . 
The exposed cohort will consist of pregnant women irrespective of their risk profile (low 
or high-risk) who receive dthe Tdap vacc ine (Boostrix) on or after the 1st day of the 27th
week of pregnancy  during the vaccination period at ob -gyn clinics of seven selected 
medical centers. 
Approximately  15,000 women vaccinated with Boostrix will be included in this study  
over approximately  a one-year period. The unexposed cohort will consist of pregnant 
women during the approximate estimated period from 1/1/2012 to 12/31/2013 who never 
received Tdap vaccine during pregnancy .

membership at the date of vaccination, and who were not vaccinated with any  other Tdap 
vaccine at an y other time during the pregnancy in scope of this study will be part of a 
descriptive analy sis (secondary  objective).
Subject -level data will be collected for pregnant women and their infants through the 
EHR .For each individual pregnant woman, analytical follow up will begin on the date 
they receive the Boostrix vaccine ,or the index date for the unvaccinated cohort, and will
end on the date of disenrollment or the end of pregnancy , whichever c ame first. For the 
maternal death endpoint, pregnant women will be followed for 42 day s after theend of 
pregnancy .Infants born in KPSC hospitals will be followed for 6 months.
4. STUDY POPULA TION/CA SE DEFINITION(S)
4.1. Stud y population
The exposed and unexposed cohort swill consist of pregnant women with evidence of
prenatal care and continuous members hip(allowing up to a 31 -day gap) at KPSC 
between the 1stday of the 27thweek of gestation and the index (vaccination) date .
Women will be considered exposed if they  receive d Boostrix on or after the 1stday of the 
27thweek of gestation at selected ob -gyn clinics at seven medical centers throughout 
KPSC (vaccination period planned to begin in January  2018). U nexposed p regnant 
women comprise women pregnant sometime during the approximate estimated period 
between 1/1/2012 and 12/31/2013 who did not receive an y Tdap vaccine during 
pregnancy .If needed, we will consider adding additional yearsto increase the eligible 
number of unexposed pregnant women. Gestational age will be estimated from the most 
reliable estimated date of delivery  (EDD) which is based on the last menstrual period, the 
first accurate ultrasound examination, or both. Obstetric providers are recommended to
reference guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gy necology (ACOG) 
to calculate EDD (21). Pregnancy  start date will correspond to a gestational age of 0 
weeks. 
Matching process for pregnant women who were vaccinated with Boostrix after the 27th
week of gestation
The unexposed cohort w ill be matched 1:1 to the exposed group for comparisons of 
maternal and infant adverse events between the two cohorts . Every  unexposed woman 
will be assigned an index date that is determined by the number of da ys from pregnancy  
start to the Boostrix vaccination date of her matched exposed woman. The same number 
of day s calculated in the exposed woman will be added to the pregnancy  start of the 
unexposed woman to identify  herindex date. 
Existing health conditions, age, lifest yle factors, and conditi ons of pregnancy can place a 
pregnancy  at risk (22).Therefore, matching variables include maternal age at pregnancy  
start (± 1 y ear), race/ethnicity  (White, Blac k, Hispanic, Asian, and Other) and multiple 
gestation
.Other pregnancy  high -risk conditions will be considered as potential covariates 
in the anal ysis (see Section 6.2.1 Covariates).

12-NOV -2019 26For example, suppose there is a 28 -year-old (at pregnancy  start ) Hispanic pregnant 
woman expecting twins with a pregnancy  start date of 2/18/2018 receiving Boostrix on 
8/30/201 8on the 194th day  of her pregnancy  (from pregnancy  start date to vaccination). 
We will match her with a Hispanic woman pregnant sometime between 1/1/2012 and 
12/31/2013, who was 27 -29 years of age at pregnancy start and hada multiple gestation 
pregnancy , with an index date assigned to be the 194thday of pregnancy , and who never 
received Tdap vaccine during pregnancy .If a match is not feasible within the proposed 
two-yearperiod , the pool of unexposed women canbe expanded to include unexposed 
pregnant women from additional y ears. Both groups will be followed for events of 
interest from the index date. In this example, both women will be followed from the 
194th day  of their pregnancy .
4.2. Case definitions (amended 12November 201 9
)
Endpoints of interest will be extracted from the EHR using the pregnancy  episode 
flowsheet, diagnosis codes (ICD -9 and ICD -10 codes), procedure codes, ordeath records . 
While these events are recorded as part of routine care, in general, ACOG recommended 
guidelines are used b y KPSC providers to diagnose and manage these conditions 
(23-31).
With th e exception of SGA , preterm delivery ,and transfusion, chart review will be 
performed for the pre -specified maternal and infant adverse events to confirm the events
and that the events are incident after the index date.
4.3. Number of subjects
Approximately  15,000 pregnant women vaccinated with Boostrix over a period of 
approximately  one year. Unexposed pregnant women, matched 1:1 to the exposed group, 
will be identified from a historical cohort. Therefore, we aim to have a total sample size 
of approximately  30,000 pregnant women. 
4.4. Inclusion criteria
Pregnant women with prenatal care and continuous membership (allowing up to a 
31-day gap) at KPSC between the 1st day  of the 27th week of gestation and the 
index (vaccination) date.
Exposed cohort (from the27th week of gestation): Pregnant women vaccinated with 
Boostrix on or after the 1st day  of the 27th week of gestation ; who were not 
vaccinated with an y other Tdap vaccine at an y other time during the pregnancy in 
scope of this study . 
Unexposed c ohort: Women matched to the exposed cohort and pregnant sometime
during the approximate estimated period between 1/1/2012 -12/31/2013 and did not 
receive an y Tdap vaccine during the pregnancy  in scope of this study .

12-NOV -2019 27For the anal ysis of congenital anomalies among live births, at birth and through six 
months of age, the following additional inclusion criteria for infants will be applied :
Live born
Born in KPSC hospitals 
Note: 
Pregnant women vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy  before the 27thweek 
of gestation , with membership at the date of vaccination, and who were not vaccinated 
with any  other Tdap vaccine at any  other time during the pregnancy  in scope of this study  
will be part of a descriptive anal ysis (secondary  objective). 
5. DATA COLLECTION A ND MANAGEMENT (amended 12
November 201 9)
Vaccination and medical event data will be extracted directl y from the EHR (Health 
Connect) , which is the legal record of all medical care received within the KPSC sy stem.
Figure 1provides an overview of the data flow for this study .All details of a patient 
encounter, including diagnoses, procedures, and physician’s notes, are entered into the 
EHR at the point of ca re.All vaccinations are entered into the EHR when they  are given, 
with vaccine, dose, manufacturer, and lot number entered at the time of vaccination. 
Vaccinations received outside of the health plan are recorded with appropriate 
documentation. Records of vaccinations and medical events can onl y be entered b y 
medical staff. Endpoints of interest will be extracted from the EHR using the pregnancy  
episode flowsheet, diagnosis codes (ICD -9 and ICD -10 codes ), procedure codes, or death 
records . 
We will rely  on automated data from the EHR to ascertain SGA , preterm delivery , and 
transfusion . For other endpoints, c hart abstraction will be performed for the pre - specified 
maternal and infant adverse events to confirm the event and that they  are incident after 
the index date when applicable (i.e., events diagnosed during pregnancy  that may  have 
onset prior to index date). Events will be reviewed in the chart in which the incident 
diagnosis code is identified (i.e., mother’s chart or infant’s chart) .Unknown pregnancy  
outcomes and KPSC live born singleton infants with unknown birthweight will also be 
chart reviewed. Chart abstractors will not be masked to the exposure status as they  will 
have access to the entire medical record within Health Connect, includin g vaccination 
status. Data will be abstracted directly  from Health Connect. For the chart abstracted 
data, the study  team will develop a chart abstraction form in the Research Electronic Data 
Capture s ystem ( REDCap ) and a chart abstraction manual ( 32). The chart abstraction 
manual will be developed for the purposes of ensuring standardization and uniformity  of 
data collection among the chart abstractors. The ch art abstraction manual may include
guidance on how to navigate through the EHR to search for pertinent information 
(including screenshots of the EHR for reference), directives for how to address questions
in the abstraction form, and explanation s
of clinical terms and other variable definitions. 
A sample of abstraction forms will be quality  checked by  a second person. Logic and data 
range checks will be performed on the abstracted data collected electronically  in 
REDCap.

number of domains, mapping rules, and will output the dataset according to the SAS 
study  dataset, required analy sis report and CDISC implementation guide; map the 
original SAS da ta to the domains according to the specification to create Study  Data 
Tabulation Module ( SDTM )and Anal ysis Data Model ( ADaM ) datasets; validate the 
SDTM and ADaM datasets using an open source CDI SC validation program (e.g., 
Pinnacle 21 ); and produce submission documentation including DEFINE.XML  and Study  
Data Reviewers Guide for SDTM and AD aM.

This study  will involve both descript ive and multivariable anal yses, and all anal yses will 
be conducted using the SAS statistical software package (version 9.3 or later ). 
6.1. Primary  and secondary pre-specified events of interest
(amended 12November 201 9
)
The pre-specified events of interest arematernal and infant outcomes identified from 
KPSC’s EHR sy stem using thepregnancy  episode flowsheet, diagnosis codes , procedure 
codes, or death records for the exposed and unexposed groups . While these events are 
recorded as part of routine care, i n general, ACOG recommended guidelines are used b y 
KPSC providers to diagnose and manage these conditions (23-31). In addition, we will 
use a commonly  accepted definition to identify  congenital anomalies, such as that used 
by the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (33).Additional birth outcomes will 
be captured for descriptive purposes, but not considered adverse event s: birth length, 
head circumference , and Apgar scores . To avoid capture of preexisting conditions, 
diagnostic codes representing each condition should not appear prior to the index date 
within the pregnancy under study .All pre-specified events of interest will be collected 
through the completion date .Anal yses will be done on chart confirmed incident events
when applicable .

Analysis of primary  and secondary objective s(amended 12
November 201 9)
Demographics andpregnancy  information will be compare d between the exposed and 
unexposed cohorts. Bivariate anal yses will be conducted for all covariates of interest. 
Continuous variables will be summarized by  means, medians, ranges, and standard 
devia tions and compared using t -tests; categorical variables will be summarized by  
frequency  distributions and compared using chi- square tests for the exposed and 
unexposed groups. Potential confounders will be determined based on bivariate anal yses 
and scientific relevance.
For events identified at delivery  such as SGA , preterm delivery , and transfusion during
delivery hospitalization ,we will calculate crude incidence and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) for each adverse event for the exposed and unexposed groups. The incidence of each 
maternal adverse event during pregnancy  will be calculated separately and will consist of 
the total number of women with the condition in the numerator and the number of women 
for whom the condition can be assessed in the denominator .The adjusted relative risk 
with CI  will be estimated by  a Poisson regression model with adjustment for potential 
confounders. If the outcome is common (i.e., incidence> 2%), a Poisson regression model 
with robust variance estimation will be used to estimate the relative risk ( 34). For primary  
endpoints ,a two-sided 98.75% CI will be used for the relative risk with multiple 
comparison adjustment ,while for secondary  endpoints a two-sided 95% CI will be used. 
For events identified an y time after the index date such as intra -uterine infection, we will 
calculate crude incidence and 95% CI for each adverse event for the exposed and 
unexposed groups. The incidence of each maternal adverse event during pregnancy will 
be calculated separatel y and will consi st of the total number of women with the condition 
in the numerator and the total person time in the denominator. The person- year for a 
pregnant woman will be the time from the index date to the date of each adverse event ,
end of the pregnancy ,or disenrol lment , whichever comes first .The adjusted relative risk 
with CI  will be estimated by  a Poisson regression model accounting for the follow -up 
time with adjustment for potential confounders. If the outcome is common (i.e., 
incidence>2%), a Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation will be used 
to estimate the relative risk. For primary endpoints ,a two-sided 98.75% CI will be used
for the relative risk with multiple comparison adjustment ,while for secondary  endpoints 
a two-sided 95% CI  will be used.
Congenital anomalies will be identified at birth and through 6months of age among 
infants born in KPSC hospitals .Most congenital anomalies are diagnosed by 6 months of 
age (35). The prevalence of congenital anomalies (overall ,by type, at birth ,and through 6 
months of age ) will be calculated as the number of infants with a congenital anomaly in 
the numerator and the total number of infants born in KPSC hospitals in the denominator. 
The proportion of live births without congenital anomalies will be calculated as 1 minus 
the proportion of live births with congenital anomalies among all KPSC live born infants .
The adjusted re lative risk with 95% CI will be estimated by  a Poisson regression model 
with adjustment for potential confounders. If the outcome is common (i.e., incidence
>2%), a Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation will be used to 
estimate the relative risk.
The following table outlines the planned method of anal ysis by endpoint.

Analyses interpretation
Analy sis of primary  endpoints will be used to evaluate the safet y of maternal vaccination 
and concluded to be non-inferior if the upper limit of the 98.75% CI for the adjusted 
relative risk is below 2.
While the analy sis of primary  endpoints will be used to evaluate the safet y of maternal 
vaccination with sufficient statistical power , the analy sis of secondary  endpoints will be 
used for h ypothesis generation/signal detection.
6.3. Sample size considerations
The power computation for the primary  objective was performed using PASS non -
inferiority  of two independent proportions using Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
Although th e power is not based on the Poisson regression model, it is expected to reflect 
the power on the planned anal ysis since inference on proportion and incidence rate 
provide similar results when incidence rates are low.
The following table ( Table 8) shows the power to rule out a two- fold increase considering 
an assum edpossible design bias leading to a 1.25 relative risk increase . 
To be able to make i ndependent conclusions for each of the four primary  endpoints while 
controlling the t ype I error below 2.5% ,a Bonferroni adjustment will be used , i.e., each 
primary  endpoint will be evaluated using a one-sided 0.625% (2.5% type Ierror / 4
primary  endpoints ) nominal type I error. More specificall y,the upper limit of the two-
sided 98.75% CI  will be used to make conclu sions .
Considering that the four primary  endpoints are expected to have an incidence rate above 
1%, the power to conclude that maternal immunization is non- inferior for anyprimary  
endpoint is at least 95% and the power to conclude that maternal immunization is non -
inferior for all 4 primary  endpoints is at least 80% (100% - 4*beta).

12-NOV -2019 347. STUDY CONSIDERA TIONS
Most of the Boostrix exposures during pregnancy  will occur at 27 weeks gestation or 
later. As such, we expect pregnancy  outcomes that occur earlier in pregnancy  such as 
spontaneous abortion and therapeutic abortion to be rare in our stud y. Furthermore, while 
we will describe the frequency  of congenital anomal iesamong the exposed and 
unexposed cohorts, we note that the most plausible time period for development of 
congenital anomalies is during earl y pregnancy (35). Cautious interpretation of maternal 
Boostrix immunization and congenital anomal iesis warranted.
One potential limitation is that the exposed (Boostrix vaccinated) cohort and the 
unexposed coh ort come from different time periods. With the exposed cohort from the 
ICD-10 era and the unexposed cohort from the ICD-9 era there is a potential risk of bias 
if the prevalence of adverse events is higher or lower in either exposed or unexposed 
cohorts due to coding variation or secular trends .This issue is not specific to KPSC but 
rather affects all health care organizations and similar research conducted in the U.S . 
However, 
this is not a major concern at KPSC as there is specific mapping (crosswalk) 
between ICD-9 and ICD -10 for all of the outcomes (36, 37) . Most importantly , no matt er 
which sy stem is used, a comprehensive list of codes will be used to identify  all potential 
events of interest. In addition ,
areview of medical records will be conducted to determine 
whether the events are truly  incident events with onset after the inde x date (vaccination 
date for the exposed). Similarly , by using a historical cohort to identify  the unexposed 
group to compare to a current exposed cohort , there is a concern that the baseline 
incidence of the selected safet y endpoints will vary significantl y between the Tdap 
(Boostrix) vaccination period and the historical comparison period . However, the 
advantage of comparing to a historical population of pregnant women during 
approx imately  2012- 2013 is that we are identify ing an unvaccinated group during a 
period when prenatal Tdap vaccine uptake was low, making these pregnant women more 
representative of an unvaccinated cohort. A current unvaccinated cohort would yield a 
small and selective sample (given over 70% Tdap uptake) that is not representative of an 
unvaccinated group and would be affected b y confounding b y indication. 
If a safet y signal is identified, further exploration of the data will be completed to 
investigate alterna tivepotential sources for the Boostrix -outcome association
, including
but not limited to changing secular trends or coding practices. 
8. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will engage KPSC to provide activities including conducting the 
study  on behalf of GSK. The study  will be conducted by  the Investigator at KPSC’s 
premises under the oversight of the sponsor, GSK. Through this partnership, we will 
provide critical information about the safet y ofmaternal vaccination with Boostrix in a 
community  setting.

eTrack study number 
and Abbreviated Title207221 (EPI-PERTUSSIS -047 VS US DB)
Amendment number: Amendment 2
Amendment date: Final: 12 November 2019
Rationale/background for changes: 
The protocol has been amended to modify the secondary endpoint of “post -
partum hemorrhage (PPH)” to “transfusion during delivery hospitalization” as 
a proxy for severe PPH. We originally planned to identify PPH from automated 
diagnosis codes (ICD -9 and ICD -10) and then perform chart review to confirm 
the event. However, in October 2017 (ACOG Practice Bulletin PPH 2017), the 
threshold for estimated blood loss (EBL) for PPH diagnosis changed, affecting 
the comparison between the historical (~2012- 2013) and th e Boostrix exposed 
(2018 -2019) cohorts. The potential for using EBL as an objective measure is 
limited by differential missingness of EBL data between these two cohorts as well 
as inconsistency in EBL measurements. We propose to use transfusion during 
delivery hospitalization as an indicator of severe blood loss and as a proxy for 
severe PPH. Transfusion can be captured by procedure codes, and transfusion 
data are stable across the study period. Transfusion is a relevant endpoint 
because hemorrhage that lea ds to blood transfusion is the leading cause of severe 
maternal morbidity in the United States (ACOG Practice Bulletin PPH 2017).
The following changes have been implemented .
Secondary objectives; Data collection Figure 1; Statistical methods Tables 6 
and 7 -"Post -partum hemorrhage" was changed to " Transfusion during 
delivery hospitalization."
Case definitions; Data collection and management -Transfusion during 
delivery hospitalization is captured by procedure codes and will not be chart 
reviewed. 
Data collection Figure 1; Statistical methods Table 7 - Transfusion will be 
identified among pregnant women with delivery hospitalizations.
Analysis of primary and secondary objectives; Statistical methods Table 7 -
The statistical method for analyzing transfusi on will be an adjusted Poisson

Amended text has been included in bold italics and deleted text in strikethrough in the 
following sections:
Synopsis:
Secondary Objectives Post-partum hemorrhage Transfusion during delivery 
hospitalization (as a proxy for severe post -partum 
hemorrhage)
Endpoint(s) Secondary
Post-partum hemorrhage Transfusion during delivery 
hospitalization
With the exception of SGA, andpreterm delivery ,and 
transfusion , medical records of the potential events will then 
be reviewed b y trained research associates to confirm the 
diagnosis and to ascertain that it is an incident event.
Section 2.2 Secondary objectives
 Post-partum hemorrhage Transfusion during delivery hospitalization (as a proxy for 
severe post -partum hemorrhage)
Section 4.2 Case definitions
With the exception of SGA, and preterm delivery ,and transfusion, chart review will be 
performed for the pre -specified matern al and infant adverse events to confirm the events 
and that the events are incident after the index date.
Section 5 Data collection and management
We will rely  on automated data from the EHR to ascertain SGA , and preterm delivery , 
and transfusion .
Figure 1. Illustration of data flow was updated and changes include:
Post-partum hemorrhage secondary  endpoint was changed to “Transfusion during 
delivery  hospitalization ”
Modified sentence “All secondary  endpoints but transfusion will be confirmed by 
medical record review”
Secondary  endpoints, footnote a, modified to say  “Identified among pregnant women 
with KPSC delivery delivery hospitalization ”

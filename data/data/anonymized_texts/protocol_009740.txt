28 January 2020 v1.0 Page 23 of 64 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effic acy of K-877-ER   
compared to K-877-IR   from baseline to Day 28 in lowe r i n g  f a s t i n g  T G  l e v e l s  i n  
patients with fasting TG levels 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of thi s study are the following: 
 To demonstrate the efficacy of K-877-ER   compared to K -877-IR   
from baseline to Day 28 in loweri ng fasting TG levels in patien ts with fasting TG levels 
200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL; 
 To evaluate the efficacy of K- 877-ER  treatments (from day to day) from 
baseline to Day 28 in altering PD  properties, including lipid p arameters, in patients with 
fasting TG levels 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL; and 
 To evaluate the multiple-dose  properties at steady state of K-877-ER

28 January 2020 v1.0 Page 30 of 64 If the patient withdraws from the study, the reason should be c aptured and could include the 
following:  
1. The patient withdraws consent at  any time or requests discontin uation from the study;  
2. The patient fails to comply with protocol requirements or study -related procedures if, in the 
opinion of the Investigator or th e Sponsor, the non-compliance will significantly compromise 
data interpretat ion or safety;  
3. In the Investigator’s judgment, it is in the patient’s best int erests;  
4. Violation of the protocol inclus ion and exclusion criteria is d iscovered, if, in the opinion of the 
Investigator or the Sponsor, the violation will significantly c ompromise data interpretation or 
safety; or  
5. The Sponsor or the regulatory a uthority terminates the study. 
Patients who choose to withdraw consent will be asked to docume nt withdrawal of consent in 
writing.  Although a patient is not obligated to give his/her reason for withdrawing prematurely, the 
Investigator will make a reasonabl e effort to obtain the reason while fully respect ing the patient’s 
rights. The reason for withdrawal from the study must be documented in the eCRF. The Clinical Study Report will include the reas on(s) for withdrawal from the  study.  
If a patient withdraws prematur ely from the study, study staff will make every effort to complete 
the full panel of assessments scheduled for the Early Terminati on (ET) visit. 
If a patient withdraws from the study due to an AE, the patient  will be asked to return to the site 
for, at a minimum, the evaluations scheduled for the ET Visit. If the AE has still not resolved, 
additional follow-up will be performed, as appropriate, and documented in the patient’s medical records. As a minimum requirement, ongoing AEs are to be follow ed for 30 days after the patient’s 
last dose of study drug. If patie nts are lost to follow-up, att empts to contact them must be made 
and documented in the study records. Withdrawn patients will no t be replaced. 
4.5 Re-Screening of Screen Failures 
Patients who are screen failures for a modifiable condition (su ch as elevated HbA1c or 
uncontrolled hypertension), other than failing the TG criteria,  can be re-screened once, and 
enrolled in the study at a future date if they are then deemed eligible for study participation based 
on protocol entry criteria after having medications adjusted an d stabilized. Before each patient is 
re-screened, the Investigator should discuss the case with the Medical Monitor. 
4.6 Study Drug Discontinuation for Pe rsistent Abnormal Clinical Lab oratory 
Values 
A patient will discontinue treatment with study drug if persistent elevations in ALT, AST, bilirubin, CK, or TG, or a persis tent decrease in eGFR, occur a ccording to the following criteria: 
1. ALT or AST >8 × ULN, confirmed on repeat; 
2. ALT or AST >3 × ULN and bilirubin >2 × ULN or international nor malized ratio >1.5, 
confirmed on repeat (if patient has Gilbert’s syndrome, bilirub in will require Medical Monitor 
review);

28 January 2020 v1.0 Page 31 of 64 3. ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the a ppearance of fatigue, nausea, vom iting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, a nd/or eosinophilia (>5%) conf irmed on repeat; 
4. ALT or AST >5 × ULN which persists for 2 weeks; 
5. Unexplained CK >5 × ULN confirmed on repeat. For patients with CK 10 × ULN, 
Investigators should immediatel y interrupt study drug while awa iting re-evaluation; 
6. Fasting TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) with signs or symp toms of pancreatitis at any 
time during the study. For repeate d or persistent elevations of  TG >2000 mg/dL 
(22.60 mmol/L) that are not accompanied by signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, Investigators 
may discontinue study drug a t their discretion; or 
7. eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 occurring on or after Day 14 (Visit 5), confirmed on repeat. 
Note: Repeat testing should occu r as soon as possible within 72  hours unless otherw ise specified. 
If at any time during the study a patient develops elevations i n ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 
CK >5 × ULN, TG >2000 mg/dL (>22.60 mmol/L), or a decrease in e GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 
the study site will receive an ale rt from the central laborator y.

along with subsequent visits are detailed in the Schedule of Pr ocedures in Appendix A. The 
Treatment Period begi ns on Day 1 and conc ludes on Day 28.  patients will be required to 
return to the clinical site on Day 14 (±3 days) and Day 28 (±3 days) for efficacy and safety 
assessments. 
 patients will be admitted to the clinical site on Day -1 and  will remain until discharged from 
the clinical site on Day 2.  patients will return to the clinical site on Day 14 (±3 days) for efficacy and safety assessments. On Day 27,  patients will be  readmitted to the clinical site and 
will remain until discharged fro m the clinical site on Day 29. 
6.5 Follow-Up Telephone Call  
Patients will participate in a Follow-Up Telephone Call 7 days (2 days) following the last dose 
of study drug. 
6.6 Early Termination Visit and Withdrawal Procedures 
The end of treatment for patients completing th e study is Day 2 8. For patients w ho are withdrawn 
from the study prior to completion, all Day 28 procedures will be performed at an ET Visit. These

28 January 2020 v1.0 Page 40 of 64 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinic al investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or u nintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally ass o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h e  u s e  o f  a n  investigational medici nal product, whether  or not related to th e investigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, which include clinical labor atory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the 
time of informed consent until the Follow-Up Telephone Call. Pa tients should be instructed to 
report any AE that they experien ce to the Investigator, whether or not they think the event is due 
to study treatment. Beginning from the time of informed consent , Investigators should make an 
assessment for AEs at each visit and record the event on the ap propriate AE eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associ a t e d  s i g n s  a n d  
symptoms should be identified by  the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a compon ent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g. , surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be record ed as an AE, not the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already present at the Screening Visit should be recorded as medical history and not be reported as an AE unless the medical condition or si gns or symptoms present at baseline 
changes in severity, frequency, or seriousness at any time duri ng the study. In thi s case, it should 
be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination  (e.g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the st udy or are present at the Screening Visit  and significantly w orsen during the 
study should be reported as AEs, as described below. The Invest igator will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment i n deciding whether an abnormal  laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically  significant. Clinically signi ficant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repe at tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results tha t are determined to be an error should 
not be reported as an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or other abn ormal clinical findings (e.g., ECG 
abnormalities) should be reported as an AE if any of the follow ing are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 
 If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality; or 
 Based on the clinical judgmen t of the Investigator. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal  product means that a causal 
relationship between a m edicinal product and an adverse event is
 at least a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., the relationship c annot be ruled out.

28 January 2020 v1.0 Page 41 of 64 8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is defined as an adverse re action, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information .  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each A E as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship t o study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity 
Mild – An event that is easily t olerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities. 
Moderate – An event that is su fficiently discomfo rting to inter fere with normal daily activities. 
Severe – An event that is incap acitating with inability to work  or perform normal daily activities. 
Causality Assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study dr ug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: No (unrelated, not related, unlik ely to be related) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi es, complications, etc.) is su spected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defi nitely related) – The time cour se between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consist ent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs , therapies, complications, et c.) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study drug administration- 
The event must occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure 
to the event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the  event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, i ntercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be evaluated i n the context of the natural h istory and course of the disease 
being treated and any other dise ase the patient may have. 
 Concomitant drug- The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the pati ent receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of the m might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particu lar response is likely to be a 
class effect.

28 January 2020 v1.0 Page 43 of 64 knowledge of the occurrence. After the 30-day reporting window, any SAE that the Investigator 
considers related to study drug must be reported to the  or the 
Sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed,  personnel will be notified 
electronically by the EDC system and will retrieve the form. If  the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to  at 
 or call the  SAE reporting line (phone 
number listed below), and fax/email the completed paper SAE form to  (contact 
information listed in Section 8.6 ) within 24 hours of awareness . When the EDC system becomes 
available, the SAE information must be entered as soon as possi ble of the system becoming 
available. 
Follow-Up Reports 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nat ure, stabilizes (in the case of  persistent impairment), or the patient 
dies. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to  via fax or email. If it is 
not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial reporting 
of SAEs.  
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a patient becomes pregnant from the time of initiation of st udy drug through the safety follow-up 
period defined in the protocol, the Investigator is to stop dos ing with study drug immediately and 
the patient should be withdrawn from the study. ET procedures s hould be implemented at that 
time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it must be reported to  
 within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  will then 
provide the Investigator/site th e Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it b ack to  
within 24 hours of completion.  If the female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while the patient is re ceiving study drug 
or within the safety follow-up period defined in the protocol, the Investigator should notify 
 as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregn ancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (i.e.,  postpartum complication, sponta neous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), th e Investigator should follow t he procedures for reporting an SAE.

28 January 2020 v1.0 Page 44 of 64 8.5 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant information about  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) that are fatal or life-threatening as soon as possible to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by the Sponsor/designee of such a case. Relevant follow-up information will subsequently be communicated within an additional 8 days.  
All other SUSARs will be reported to the FDA as soon as possibl e but within a maximum of 
15 days of first knowledge by t he Sponsor/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inf orm all Investigators as requ ired per local regulation. 
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to in vestigational medicinal product. 
8.6 Special Situation Reports 
Special situation reports include reports of overdose, misuse, abuse, medication error, and reports 
of adverse reactions associated with product complaints. 
 Overdose:  Refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal prod uct given per 
administration or cumulatively (a ccidentally or intentionally),  which is above the maximum 
recommended dose according to the protocol. Clinical judgement should always be applied. 
In cases of a discrepancy in the drug accountability, overdose will be established only when 
it is clear that the patient has taken additional dose(s) or th e Investigator has  reason to suspect 
that the patient has taken additional dose(s).  
 Misuse:  Refers to situations where the  medicinal product is intentiona lly and inappropriately 
used in a way that is not in accordance with the protocol instr uctions or local prescribing 
information and may be accompanied by harmful physical and/or p sychological effects.  
 Abuse:  Is defined as persistent or spo radic, intentional excessive us e of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by harmful  physical or psychological effec ts. 
 Medication error:  Is any unintentional error in the prescr ibing, dispensing, or administration 
of a medicinal product by a heal thcare professional, patient, o r consumer, respectively. The 
administration or consumption of  the unassigned treatment and administration of an expired 
product are always reportable as  medication errors, cases of patients missing doses of 
investigational product are not c onsidered reportable as medica tion errors. 
 Product complaint:  Is defined as any written, elect ronic, or oral communication t hat alleges 
deficiencies related to the id entity, quality, durability, reli ability, safety, e ffectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or device af ter it is released for distri bution. A special situations form 
will only be completed if a complaint is associated with an adv erse drug reaction.  
All special situation events as described above m
 ust be reporte d on the Special Situations Report 
form and faxed/emailed to  (contact info rmation listed below) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. All AEs associated with the se Special Situation reports should 
be reported as AEs or SAEs as well as recorded on the AE eCRF a nd/or the SAE report form. 
Details of the symptoms and signs, clinical management, and out come should be provided, when 
available.

10.1 Data Management 
10.1.1 Data Handling 
Data will be recorded at the site on eCRFs and reviewed by the Clinical Research Associates 
(CRAs) during monitoring visits. The CRAs will verify data reco rded in the EDC system with 
source documents. All corrections or changes made to any study data must be appropriately tracked 
in an audit trail in the EDC system. An eCRF will be considered  complete when all missing, 
incorrect, and/or inconsistent data has been accounted for. 
10.1.2 Computer Systems 
Data will be processed using a validated computer system conforming to regulatory requirements. 10.1.3 Data Entry 
Data must be recorded using the EDC system as the study is in p rogress. All site personnel must 
log into the system using their secure user name and password i n order to enter, review, or correct 
study data. These procedures must comply with Title 21 of the C ode of Federal Regulations 
(21 CFR Part 11) and other appr opriate international regulation s. All passwords will be strictly 
confidential. 10.1.4 Medical Information Coding 
For medical information, the following thesauri will be used: 
 Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (latest) for medic al history and AEs; and 
 World Health Organization Drug Dic tionary for prior and concomitant medications. 
10.1.5 Data Validation 
Validation checks programmed within the EDC system, as well as supplemental validation 
performed via review of the downloaded data, will be applied to  t h e  d a t a  i n  o r d e r  t o  e n s u r e  
accurate, consistent, and reliable data. Data identified as err oneous, or data that are missing, will 
be referred to the site for re solution through data queries. 
The eCRFs must be reviewed and e lectronically signed by the Inv estigator.

11.3 Informed Consent 
The ICF and any changes to the ICF made during the course of th e study must be agreed to by the 
Sponsor or designee and the IRB prior to its use and must be in  compliance with all FDA 
regulations/ICH GCP guidelines, loc al regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
The Investigator must ensure that each study patient is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated with part icipation and must ensure that the 
patient has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The Investigator will obtain written informed consent from each patient before any study-specific activity is  performed and must document in 
the source documentation that c onsent was obtained prior to enr ollment in the study. The original 
signed copy of the ICF must be maintained by the Investigator a nd is subject to inspection by a 
representative of the Sponsor, th eir representatives, auditors,  the IRB and/or regulatory agencies. 
A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the patient. 
11.4 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the  study is conducted in accordance with 
the protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, FDA/ICH GCP, and applica ble regulatory requirements, and 
that valid data are ent ered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the CRA’s duties are to aid the Inve stigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well-organized  and easily retrievable data. Before 
the enrollment of any patient in this study, the Sponsor or the ir designee will review with the

their completion, informed consent process, and the procedure for reporting SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit th e Sponsor or their designee to m onitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will b e verified against source 
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be m ade. After the eCRF data is entered 
by the site, the CRA will review the data for safety informatio n, completeness, accuracy, and 
logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data incon sistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarific ation or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expec ted to cooperate with the monitor and 
provide any missing informa tion, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In add ition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the clinical sit e by signature and date on the st udy-specific monitoring log. 
11.5 Disclosure of Data 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection b y the FDA, the Sponsor or their 
designee, applicable foreign health authorities, and the IRB as  appropriate. Patients or their legal 
representatives may request their medical information be given to their personal physician or other 
appropriate medical personnel resp onsible for their welfare. 
Patient medical information obtained during the study is confid ential and disclosure to third parties 
other than those noted above is prohibited. 
11.6 Retention of Records 
To enable evaluations and/or audi ts from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator 
will keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link 
records, e.g., eCRFs and hospital records), all original signed  ICFs, copies of all eCRFs, SAE 
forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disp osition. The records must be 
retained by the Investigator according to specifications in the FDA regulations/ICH GCP guidelines, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer. 
The Investigator must obtain written permission from the Sponso r before disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met. 
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withd raws from the study, the Sponsor must 
be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferre d to an acceptable designee, such 
as another Investigator, anothe r institution, or to the Sponsor .  
11.7 Publication Policy 
Following completion of the study, the data may be considered f or publication in a scientific 
journal or for reporting at a scientific meeting. Each Investig ator is obligated to keep data 
pertaining to the study confidential. The Investigator must con sult with the Sponsor before any 
study data are submitted for publication. The Sponsor reserves the right to deny publication rights 
until mutual agreement on the content, format, interpretation o f data in the manuscript, and journal 
selected for publica tion are achieved.

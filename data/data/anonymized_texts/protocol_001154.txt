 1 PURPOSE 
The objective of this study is to compare the noninvasive RRp p erformance of the Masimo MightySat device 
against the RR measured by capnography, Masimo’s RAM technology  and the manual annotation. All of the 
devices are noninvasive and data will be collected from healthy  volunteers.  
 This is a nonrandomized single arm study where all of the subje cts are enrolled into the experimental arm and 
receive the MightySat device on their index finger along with a  RAM sensor on their neck, a pulse oximeter 
on their other index finger, and a nasal cannula which will be attached to the capnography device.   
 
Outcome Measure: Comparison of MightySat, capnography, rainbow acoustic monitoring and manual 
annotation of RR by ARMS calculation.  
 
2 BACKGROUND 
Masimo Corporation develops non-invasive medical technologies. These devices have applications in the 
operating room, critical care unit, emergency room, emergency t ransport vehicles, as well as physician’s 
offices.  
 
Recording respiratory rate is considered standard for monitorin g patients. However, measurement frequency 
and documentation of respiratory rate is often poor and inaccur ate. Respiratory rate is difficult to assess and 
often is not even recorded in the patient record. This is in sp ite of the fact that elevated respiratory rate is one 
of the best predictors of respiratory deterioration, cardiac ar rest, and admission to the intensive care unit 
(ICU). Our Masimo MightySat and RAM technologies allows for rea l-time, non-invasive monitoring of 
respiratory rate in patients and has the potential to improve c linical outcomes while reducing the cost of care 
and risks to patients.  
Respiratory rate can be determined by the plethysmographic wave form. This method measures respiration per 
minute (rpm) based on plethysmgraphic amplitude changes that co rrespond to the respiratory cycle.

 6.1.1 Subjects will be recruited using IRB-approved advertisements. O ur Web Ad (FRM-
3954) will be posted publically on craigslist or similar websit es. Subjects may also be 
referred to the study by previous volunteers. 
6.2 Phone Screening  
6.2.1 Once the potential subject sees the recruitment material (i.e. Web Ad), they contact our 
clinical schedulers to inquire more about details about the scr eening. The recruitment 
process is taken care of by the designated clinical staff who a re trained for 
screening/scheduling. 
6.2.2 Appointments are made once the phone screening process is compl eted and the person 
screening the subject determines if they qualify or not for the  screening based on the 
Recruitment Script (FRM-3953).  
6.2.3 If the person does not qualify at this time their information w ill not be kept. 
6.3  Consent Process   
6.3.1 Have each subject read and sign the correct forms set below. Th e consent form must be 
stamped with current IRB approval. No study related activities will be conducted until 
the correct document is signed. 
6.3.2 Have each subject complete FRM-3124- Confidentiality Agreement 
6.4 Screening   
6.4.1  Have each subject complete FRM-3957 – Health Assessment Questi onnaire. 
6.4.2 Female volunteers of child bearing potential will be required t o take a pregnancy test as 
part of screening. A positive pregnancy test will disqualify th em from the study. A 
negative pregnancy test qualifies them for the study.  
6.5 Study Procedure 
6.5.1   Have each subject complete FRM-3956 – Gender and Ethnicity Ques tionnaire  
6.5.2 Have subject at rest, sitting in a dental chair.

onto the subject’s neck and a pulse oximeter onto the subject’s  other index finger. A 
flexible tube called a nasal cannula will be put in their nose.  In some cases, it may be 
required for subjects to shave their neck hair for the purpose of applying an adhesive 
sensor with their consent. The study starts once the first sens or is placed.  
6.5.4 Photos may be taken of sensor placement. Photos may only be tak en with the subject’s 
consent. All photos will be de-identified and will not show the  subject’s face.  
6.5.5 Subjects will be asked to breathe at nominal rates described be low.

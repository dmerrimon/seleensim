 2 Introduction  24 
 25 
Since “early goal -directed therapy,” early recognition of septic shock using the serum 26 
lactate has become standard of care [1 -4].  Indeed, the central place of lactate in sepsis 27 
care has been promoted by the Surviving Sepsis campaign, and it is now backed by 28 
financial incentives for hospitals with its adoption as a CMS Core Measure [5].  29 
 30 
In this context, it is important to elucidate all possible causes of hyperlactatemia. 31 
Previous studies have shown that serum lactate increases in all shock states, not just 32 
septic shock [6].  Furthermore, l actate has also been shown to increase from albute rol [7], 33 
anti-retroviral medications, metformin, propofol, and alcohols [8]. 34 
 35 
According to Surviving Sepsis Guidelines, patients diagnosed with septic shock should 36 
receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid solution within three hours [9].   One commonly used 37 
crystall oid, Lactated Ringer’s solution (LR), contains 28 mmol/L of racemic lactate in the 38 
form of sodium lactate. While lactate is rapidly metabolized by the liver and kidney, 39 
aggressive fluid resuscitation with LR may transiently raise serum lactate, potentially  40 
confounding the interpretation of this test.  41 
 42 
There has only been one trial looking at the question of whether administration of LR 43 
raises serum lactate. That study did not show a difference in lactate levels in those 44 
receiving LR versus those receiving a lternative crystalloid solutions. However, that study 45 
used only 1 liter of LR delivered over one hour [1 0].  As mentioned above, patients in 46 
 3 septic shock are mandated to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid solution, and the fluids are 47 
typically given at a rate  faster than 1 liter per hour.  Therefore, when LR is given at a 48 
volume and rate more similar to what is done for septic shock patients, LR may have an 49 
effect on serum lactate level that was not identified in the previous study.  50 
 51 
Thus, we p ropose  a double -blind, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether the 52 
administration of intravenous LR at 30 mL/kg increases levels of serum lactate. As our 53 
study compares  the effect of NS and LR, it lends  itself easily to secondarily investigating 54 
changes in sod ium (Na), chloride (Cl), and pH in the NS group compared to the LR 55 
group.  56

Materials and Methods  58 
 59 
Study Design and Setting  60 
 61 
This will be  a double -blind, randomized controlled trial performed on a group of healthy 62 
volunteers, made up primarily of family, friends, and colleague s of the investigators .   63 
 64 
All subjects will be  healthy volunteers aged 18 years or older. Healthy volunteers are 65 
defined as subjects with no acute symptoms who me et none of the following exclusion 66 
criteria: pregnant, breast -feeding, prisoners, history of conditions associated with fluid 67 
overload (congestive heart, renal, or hepatic failure), baseline serum lactate leve l >2.2 68 
mmol, and baseline creatinine >1.5 mg/dL.  69 
 4  70 
All volunteers will fill  out a short data collection form assessing their age, weight, 71 
gender, and medical history. All volunteers will signed a written consent, approved by the 72 
IRB.  73 
 74 
A random -number genera tor will be  used to assign each subject to either LR or NS. After 75 
assignment, a pharmacist with no role in data collection prepared the fluids in a locked 76 
room.  The pharmacist will use  an opaque black bag to obscure the fluids. The subjects 77 
will then rece ive 30 mL/kg rounded to the nearest 100 mL of the solution to which they 78 
were randomized.   79 
 80 
An investigator will place an 18 gauge IV in one upper extremity, and an initial serum 81 
lactate and electrolyte panel will be  drawn, measured using the i -STAT 1 ana lyzer 82 
(Abbott Point of C are, Princeton, NJ). Fluids will be  administered as a rapid bolus via 83 
pressu re bag. Post -treatment blood will be  drawn from the contralateral upper extremity 84 
five minutes after the conclusion of the IV fluid administration.      85 
 86 
Outcomes  87 
 88 
The primary outcome will be  the difference in change in serum lactate levels between the 89 
LR and NS groups. Secondarily, we will compare  the change in lactate within each group 90 
(before and after treatment), and we will compare  the change in pH, crea tinine, 91 
bicarbonate, Na, and Cl levels between NS and LR groups.    92

Data Analysis  94 
 95 
We powered the study as follows. A sample size of 30 achieves 80% power to detect a 96 
difference of 0.5 mmol/L in the mean change in lactate between the NS and LR groups 97 
assuming a standard deviation of differences of 0.5 and an alpha of 0.05.  We chose the 98 
value of 0.5 mmol/L by clinical gestalt based on what we consider a clinically significant 99 
difference in lactate levels. Before and aft er treatment lactate level s will be  compared 100 
within each group using paired t -tests. We will compare  the change in mean lactate and 101 
the change in other variables (pH, creatinine, bicarbonate, Na, and Cl) between the LR 102 
and NS groups using two -tailed t -tests.   103

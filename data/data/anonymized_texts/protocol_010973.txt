1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Glioblastoma Multiforme  
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, World Health Organization/WHO grade IV) is the most 
common malignant primary brain tumor and one of the most devastating cancers [ 1]. 
Between 2004 and 2007, there were 37,690 patients newly diagnosed with GBM, with an estimated incidence rate of 3 cases per 100, 000 people in the United States [2]. The current 
standard of care for GBM includes maximal safe resection followed by radiotherapy  (RT)  
and temozolomide  (TMZ) . The incorporation of TMZ  in the treatment of these patients 
represent ed the first breakthrough against this fatal cancer in decades and was shown to 
significantly improve outcome in a randomized study. However, despite such multi -
modality therapy, the median survival is approximately 14 months, with a five -year 
survival of less than 10%  [3]. The combined RT and TMZ regimen was associated with 
relatively low rates of grade 3 -4 toxicities: 4% neutropenia, 3% thrombocytopenia, 3% 
infection, 7% fatigue, 1% rash, <1% nausea/vomiting. Completion of therapy was also very high: 5%  were  unable to complete 90% of RT (4% due to disease progression, 1% due to 
incompliance), 13% did not complete concurrent TMZ (5% due to toxicity, 4% due to disease progression, and 4% due to other causes) [ 4]. 
 Many institutions have attempted to increase the dose of  RT to improve tumor control using 
various methods , including radiosurgery and brachytherapy, but each method has failed to 
improve outcome  [5-7]. A recent retrospective study from our research group at 
Washington University showed that moderate RT dose -escalation with concurrent TMZ 
did not appear to improve outcome as compared to standard dose RT and TMZ  [8]. Thus, 
novel therapeutic approaches are desperately needed for this devastating disease.  
 
Recent evidence suggest s that a cellular hierarchy exists in GBM [9,10] . A small fraction 
of GBM cells have the ability to regenerate the entire tumor and share many similar characteristics as neural stem cells, such as self -renewal, extensive proliferation, and 
differentiation  [11-14]. Those cells have been referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs) or 
tumor -initiating cells. Experiments have shown that CSCs  are more resistant to  RT and 
chemotherapy than the rest of the tumor cell population [15,16]. Therefore, CSCs  may 
represent an important reason why GBM  may initially respond but invariably recur after 
chemoradiotherapy. Importantly , recent laboratory study has suggested that CSC hierarchy 
may be reversible and that non- CSCs can convert into CSCs  [17], which would imply that 
the optimal therapeutic approach to GBM would be to combine conventional therapy that 
eradicate s non-CSCs with CSC- directed therapy. Other preclinical studies have also 
suggested that disulfiram  (DSF) , a FDA -approved, non- cancer therapeutic drug, may target  
the CSC- like subpopulation of GBM. Its mechanism is still unclear but may be due to 
aldehyde dehydrogenase  (ALDH)  inhibition, O6-methylguanine -DNA methyltransferase 
(MGMT ) inhibition, NF-kB inhibition, proteasome inhibition, DNA repair inhibition, or 
increased intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation (Brar, et al. 2004; Klein, 
et al. 1994).   
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 11 of 72 1.2 Disulfiram  
 
1.2.1 Current Usage of Disulfiram and Proteasome Inhibition  
 
Disulfiram (Antabuse, Teva  Pharmaceuticals, North Wales, PA ) is a n FDA-
approved medication that has been used for treating alcoholism since 1951. It  
inhibits ALDH , which leads to accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood after 
ingestion of alcohol. The resulting acetaldehyde causes unpleasant symptoms such as sweating, flushing, nausea , and vomiting. The association of these aversive 
reactions with drinking thus discourages further consumption of alcohol. More recently, disulfiram (DSF ) has also been used to treat cocaine addiction  [18]. Upon 
absorption, DSF is immediately reduced to its active metabolite, 
diethyldithiocarbamate (D DTC). DD TC is a potent copper  (Cu) chelator and can 
readily penetrate the blood brain barrier  [19]. Increasing data has emerged that the 
Cu-DDTC complex appears to be a proteasome inhibitor  [20,21].    
 A proteasome is a large multi -subunit complex in eukaryotes which  controls the 
degradation of intracellular proteins  [22]. As an important regulator of many 
cellular processes such as cell -cycle and apoptosis, proteasomes have emerged as a 
promising target for anticancer therapy  [23]. Proteasomes  contain at least three 
known catalytic activities: chymotrysin -like, trypsin -like, and caspase- like. 
Specifically, the inhibition of the proteasomal chymotrypsin -like activity has been 
shown to be associated with apoptosis of tumor cells  [24,25]. One of the first 
proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib (Velcade, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Bortezomib  
has also shown significant cytotoxic effect on GBM cells in vitro  [26] but has 
limited penetration across the blood brain barrier  [27,28] . It has been shown to be 
ineffective for recurrent GBM  [29]. Although the  results of th e phase II study of 
bortezomib combined with vorinostat are  disappointing, disease response  may be 
complicated by bortezomib’s  poor intracranial penetration and its  focus on heavily 
pretreated tumors.  
     
1.2.2 In Vitro Studies of D SF on GBM Cells  
     
DSF has shown selective anti -tumor activity against breast cancer, melanoma, and 
prostate cancer in vitro  with minimal cytotoxicity against their normal tissue 
counterpart  [20,30,31] . Recently, a few studies have also demonstrated promising 
activity against GBM models. Hothi et al . have performed a high- throughput 
screening study of 2000 compounds and identified DSF as a potent inhibitor of 
patient -derived GBM stem cells (GSCs), with its greatest effect at a concentration 
above 0.75 µM. Similar to the previous reports for other tumor models, DSF  
showed remarkable selectivity against GSCs as compared to normal neural stem cells (IC
50 of 31 nM versus 283 nM, respectively). The study further identified that 
the effect is dependent on a complex formation with C u and its inhibition of 
chymotrypsin- like proteasomal activity  [32].  
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 12 of 72 Liu et al. have also confirmed the Cu-dependent cytotoxicity of DSF against GBM 
cell lines and provided evidence that DSF  preferentially targets the GSC 
subpopulation. They observed that the IC 50 ranged from 119.7 to 464.9 nM for 
different GBM cell lines. Furthermore, after only 3 hour exposure to 0.5 µM of 
DSF with 1 µM of Cu , the neurosphere -forming ability of different GBM cell lines 
was completely abolished, which is a key characteristic of the GBM stem -like cells . 
They also showed that DSF -Cu complex could induce intracellular reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) to trigger intrinsic apoptosis of GBM cells through activation of JNK and p38 pathways  [33].  
 In a third study, Triscott et al . showed that DSF is active against TMZ -resistant 
GBM cell lines and provided synergistic activity when combined with TMZ. They reported that the IC
90 for the  TMZ resistant cells was 100 nM. At such 
concentration, the neurosphere -forming ability of the GBM cells was abolished 
completely, but the normal astrocytes were not affected. Altogether, those in vitro studies support that DSF  has selective activity against the G SC-like subpopulations 
and may also increase the efficacy of TMZ [ 34].  
 
1.2.3 In Vivo  Studies  of D SF 
 
Paranjpe et al. showed that DSF  increased sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ through 
inhibition of O
6-methylguanine -DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and 
demonstrated that DSF  preferentially inhibited tumor MGMT in GBM xenografts 
as compared to MGMT in the liver . MGMT is a DNA repair protein that removes 
the mutagenic O6-akyl groups from guanines, which would negate the effect of 
TMZ on tumor cells. The inhibition of MGMT provided a mechanism explanation for the synergistic effect with TMZ  [35]. Lun et al. have also recently reported that 
a combination of DSF , Cu gluconate, and TMZ could significantly improve 
survival of mice with orthotopic GBM tumors.  They have also shown that DSF 
inhibited the 26S proteasome in a Cu -dependent manner and induced activation of 
both heat shock and unfolded protein responses  [36].  Altogether, the in vivo  studies 
have confirmed the findings of the in vitro  experiments and support clinical trial to 
test the synergistic benefit of  combining DSF and copper with RT and TMZ for 
treating GBM.   DSF has also been tested on breast and prostate cancer xenografts. Chen et al . 
injected 50 mg/kg of DSF  intraperitoneally daily for 29 days to mice implanted 
with breast cancer xenografts. They found that DSF  reduced tumor growth by 74% 
as compared to the control group. They also confirmed that the proteasom e 
chymotrypsin- like activity was inhibited by 87% in the tumor tissues treated with 
DSF as compared to the control. Along with the proteasome inhibition, there was 
also increased apoptosis within the tre ated tumor, including increased caspase -3 
activity and cleaved PARP  [20]. When given to mice implanted with prostate 
cancer xenografts, daily treatment of 200 mg/kg/day DSF  in olive oil for three 
weeks also reduced tumor growth by 40% as compared to olive oil alone  [31].  
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 13 of 72 These preclinical studies further support the promising role of  DSF as a novel 
approach to treat cancer.   
 
1.2.4    Safety and  Toxicology 
 
DSF has been used clinically  for more than 50 years, so its safety profile is well  
known. The current FDA- recommended dose of DSF  is 250- 500 mg daily for 
alcohol abstinence . The primary pharmacological action of DSF is its ir reversible 
inhibition of ALDH , leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde with ingestion of 
alcohol. The acetaldehyde then produces unpleasant DSF -ethanol reaction, 
characterized by flushing, palpitation, headache, nausea , and vomiting [18]. In the 
early clinical practice, a much higher dose of 1000- 3000 mg per day was used  [37].  
At high dosages, the DSF -ethanol reaction may be severe and even fatal , but such 
high dosage in the absence of alcohol is well tolerated . In the early 1950s, 4 patients 
(out of an estimated 11,000 patients prescribed high doses of DSF) died of sudden 
respiratory or cardiovascular causes likely related to the DSF -ethanol reaction [38]. 
At such high dosages, there were also case reports of psychosis in the absence of alcohol ingestion [39,40] . A previous phase I study combining a single dose of oral 
DSF and cisplatin every 3 weeks observed dose -limiting confusion at 3000 mg/m
2 
(approximately 4800 mg) [ 41]. High doses of DSF  may inhibit cerebrospinal 
dopamine B -hydroxylase  [42], and people with very low activity of dopamine 
hydroxylase may be prone to transient psychosis with such inhibition [ 43].    
 
Early toxicology studies done in mice, rats, dogs, and rabbits have show n that DSF 
has very low toxicity, with LD 50 between 1.8- 10g/kg when administered orally. At 
those extreme doses, demyelination of brain and spinal cord was observed on 
histopathology [44]. Interestingly, long- term administration of high doses of DSF  
to rats did not induce any laboratory or histological signs of liver damage  [45]. High 
doses of DSF  (up to 6 g daily) are relatively nontoxic in humans. Symptoms of 
overdose include vomiting, headache, apathy, ataxia, motor restlessness, irritability, hallucinations, psychosis, loss of consciousness and convulsions. Death occurs by respiratory arrest, preceded by ascending paralysis, and pathological lesions are seen in the liver, spleen, kidney and CNS, with congestion in the adrenal gland and edema in the heart muscle.   
 1.2.5 Pharmacology and  Drug Metabolism  
 After oral ingestion, DSF  is partially reduced to DDTC in the acidic stomach, which 
in turn forms a complex with Cu to form  Cu(DDTC)
2. Both the parent DSF  and 
Cu(DDTC) 2 are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, more than 
80% of an oral dose is absorbed, and enteric formulation and oil may enhance improved absorption. After absorption, DSF  is again reduced to DDTC and then 
Cu(DDTC)
2. Downstream metabolites also include diethylamine, carbon 
disulphide, diethyldithiomethylcarbamate (Me -DDTC),  and glucuronic acid of 
DDTC. Me -DDTC is biotransformed into active inhibitors of ALDH [19]. 
Experiments with radiolabeled DSF  have shown distribution in the blood, liver, 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 14 of 72 kidney, he art, adrenal  gland , thyroid, pancreas, testes, spleen, marrow, muscles, 
and, most importantly , brain  [46].  
 
1.2.6 Clinical Experience  
   
Clinical experience with DSF  for the treatment of alcoholism has been extensive 
over the last 50 years. At the dose  of 250- 500 mg per day as  recommended by the 
FDA, DSF is safe and well -tolerated  [18,37] . A few clinical studies have been 
reported in the literature on its use in cancer patients. A phase II study randomized 
64 non- metastatic breast cancer patients after mastectomy to chemotherapy either 
with DDTC (the main metabolite of DSF ) or placebo. The group that received 
DDTC had significantly better disease -free survival (DFS) and overall survival 
(OS) as compared to the placebo group [47]. A phase I study treated non- metastatic 
recurrent prostate cancer patients with 250 -500 mg of DSF  (9 patients with 250 mg 
and 10 patients with 500 mg). Only 5 of the 19 patients completed at least 6 months 
of DSF, and the biochemical response appeared to be minimal. There were 3 
patients with grade 3 toxicity for each dose level, including double vision, hearing loss, LFT abnormality, diarrhea, constipation, and ataxia. Due to lack of clear signal for treatment re sponse and the toxicities reported, the authors did not recommend 
additional testing of DSF in the recurrent prostate cancer population [ 48]. A recent 
double -blinded, randomized phase II study compared chemotherapy with and 
without DSF  for metastatic non -small cell lung cancer [49]. DSF was given at 40 
mg three times daily (TID ). Patients who received concurrent DSF  had significantly 
better PFS and OS than who received chemotherapy alone (5.9 vs. 4.9 months, and 10.0 vs. 7.1 months, respectively). The authors recommended a larger phase III 
studies to test DSF with chemotherapy for metastatic non -small cell lung cancer.   
 We have recently conducted a phase I  pharmacodynamic study combining 500-
1000 mg of DSF with adjuvant temozolomide for newly diagnosed GBM  patients 
after RT and concurrent TMZ , which has determined 500 mg of DSF  per day as the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with adjuvant  TMZ. Dose -limiting 
toxicity, which was defined as within the first 28 days of DSF administration, occurred at 1000 mg of disulfiram per day and included delirium and ataxia. At the MTD of 500 mg per day, 2 of 7 patients eventually stopped DSF after the first month due to possibly DSF -related toxicity. One patient developed grade 3 delirium 
after 55 days of DSF; a nother patient developed grade 3 motor neuropathy (lower 
extremity weakness and foot drop). Both toxicities resolved after discontinuing DSF. Grade 2 -3 toxicities that were possibly or probably related to DSF are 
described in table below. All the toxicities were self -limiting or resolved within 30 
days of cessation of DSF. A descriptio n of this clinical trial is available on 
http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

1.2.7 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Previous pharmacokinetic  studies were done on alcoholi c patients after either single 
dose or repeated doses for 12 consecutive days. Apparent half -lives of DSF , DDTC, 
and Me-DDTC were 7.3, 15.5, and 22.1 hours , respectively . Average time to reach 
maximal plasma concentration was 8 -10 hours for DSF  and its metabolites. The 
mean peak plasma concentrations of DSF and Me -DDTC were 1.3 nM and 4.7 nM, 
respectively. However, there was marked intersubject variability in the plasma 
concentrations  [50,51] . Dose s as low as 100 mg of DSF  could produce detectable 
plasma concentrations of Me- DDTC and complete blockade of ALDH activity in 
erythrocyte s [52]. As seen in Figure 1, three  daily doses of DSF will allow for DSF 
and its metabolites to reach steady state.  
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 16 of 72  
Figure 1: Predicted pharmacokinetic profile of DSF and its metabolites (DDTC & Me -DDTC)  
 
 
 
The metabolites of DSF  are mainly excreted via kidneys, feces, and the lungs. Up 
to 20% of an oral dose may not be absorbed and thus excreted in the feces. About 
65% is eliminated through the kidneys, mostly as the glucuronide of DDTC and inorganic sulfates. The metabolite c arbon disulphide is mostly eliminated via the 
lungs  [19].  
 
In the blood, both DSF  and Me -DDTC are mostly bound to albumin, with average 
binding percentages of 96 and 80% over the ranges 200- 800 and 345- 2756 nM, 
respectively. The average number of binding sites was approximately 1 for both substances, suggesting a single binding site fo r both. The average association 
constants were 7.1 x 10
4 and 6.1 x 103 M-1, respectively. Therefore, patients with 
impaired protein synthesis and decreased albumin level s may have considerabl y 
different plasma concentration of DSF  and its metabolites. Both DSF  and Me -
DDTC are also very lipophilic, with Log P (octanol -water partition coefficient) of 
2.81 and 1.85, respectively [53], which support their ability to cross the BBB . 
However, specific measurement of DSF  and its metabolites in gliomas have not 
been conducted to date.   
 
1.2.8 Measurement of Intratumoral Drug Concentration using Resected Tumo rs 
 Although no studies have analyzed uptake of DSF and its metabolites in gliomas, a few prospective studies have investigated i ntracranial drug penetration by 
administering chemotherapy before planned resect ion of brain tumors. In a study 
measuring cisplatin level, high- grade gliomas appeared to have higher drug 

Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 17 of 72 concentration than low -grade gliomas but lower when compared to brain 
metastases, suggesting break -down of the blood- brain barrier plays an important 
factor in intratumoral drug concentration [ 54]. Previous studies have shown a 
sample size of 5 is typically sufficient to detect difference in drug concentration 
between dos e levels [ 55]. Given the tumor specimen invariably contain blood, high 
plasma concentration may lead to over -estimation of the tissu e drug concentration 
[56]. Thus, an accurate estimation of intratumoral drug concentration would require 
measurement of concurrent plasma level and would ideally be mea sured when the 
plasma level has peaked.      
 
1.2.9 Co-administration of Copper  (Cu)  
 
Previous in vitro  studies have consistently shown the effect of DSF  is dependent on 
Cu, at a concentration of approximately 1 uM. Based on 130 autopsy cases of non-
poisoned people, the Cu concentration of brain, blood, and stomach were 
approximately 49.0 uM (median) [range: 10.6- 118.3], 13.1 uM [9.0- 20.6], 15.7 uM 
[3.8- 76.7], respectively [57]. Furthermore, cancer cells including gliomas cells 
appear to contain highly elevated levels of Cu  as compared to surrounding normal 
tissues [58-60]. However, typical Western diets provide only 1 mg of Cu  daily, less 
than the lower limit of 1.5 to 3.0 mg which is estimated as a safe and adequate daily 
dietary intake (ESADDI) of copper [ 61,62]. Therefore, dietary Cu supplementation 
may be required  for DSF to be maximally effective as an antineoplastic drug. The 
upper level of recommended daily elemental Cu  is 8 mg a day (Institute for 
Medicine 2002), administered as Cu  gluconate, a substance generally regarded as 
safe (GRAS) (Code of Federal Regulation 2004). Large amounts of ingested Cu  
could result in hepatic failure and hemolysis similar to that seen with Wilson's disease, the rare genetic syndrome from hyperabsorption of Cu . 
 
Prior reports have shown that 10 mg of elemental  Cu can be  administered for 2 -3 
months without any apparent side -effect nor any significant increase of serum 
copper level [ 63,64] . A previous phase I study for patients with advanced liver 
metastasis has shown 6  mg of elemental Cu  in the form of Cu gluconate is well 
tolerated when given with 250 mg of DSF  daily. In this study, Cu  gluconate was 
given in the morning half hour before breakfast, and DSF  was given with the 
evening meals [ 65]. 
 
1.2.10 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
The safety risks of DSF  are well established based on over 60 years of clinical use  
[18,37,66] . From 1968 to  1991, 154 adverse drug reactions were reported to the 
Danish Committee on Adverse Drug Reactions: hepatic (34%), neurological (21%), cutaneous (15%), psychiatric (4%), and other (26%). However, some patients may have received much higher doses than the cu rrently approved dosage  and may have 
consumed alcohol  while taking DSF. Rate of adverse event is estimated to be one 
per 200- 2000 patients per year  [67]. The more common and mild side  effects 
include: drowsiness, usually of short duration (can be managed by taking 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 18 of 72 medication in the evening); headache; nausea and vomiting; metallic or garlic -like 
aftertaste; allergic dermatitis; impotence; DSF -ethanol reaction after ingestion of 
alcohol (flushing, headache, nausea, sweating, palpitation, dyspnea, tachycardia, 
hypotension, and rarely cardiovascular collapse). These symptoms are generally transient and typically resolve within first two weeks. DSF -ethanol reaction can be 
avoided by abstinence from drinking alcohol, and case reports of fatal DSF -ethanol 
reaction in the past occurred with much higher doses of DSF. Other rare but more 
severe toxicities include: hepatotoxicity or hepatitis, typically reversible if DSF  is 
discontinued early (should be followed with liver function tests); peripheral neuropathy ; optic neuritis; extrapyramidal symptoms; psychosis. Patients with 
hepatic dysfunction, active pregnancy, and idiopathic seizure disorder should not be given DSF .  
 
As discussed in S ection 1.2.6, our previous phase 1 study of DSF in combination 
with adjuvant TMZ established 500 mg of DSF per day as the MTD. At this dose, most patients tolerated DSF with adjuvant TMZ well, but 2 of 7 patients developed dose-limiting confusion and motor neuropathy after prolonged administration. 
Possible or probable DSF -related toxicities were all neurological and were mostly 
self-limiting or reversible.  The investigators and patients should pay particular 
attention of any early signs o f the neurological  symptoms  seen in the previous phase 
I study including delirium , ataxia, and neuropathy, but careful workup to rule out 
tumor progression or other causes should also be considered before attributing those symptoms to DSF.  
  
Given its long track record of safety when used alone , especially below 1000 mg , 
DSF should pose minimal  risk when given to presumed GBM patients before their 
surgical resection. Although patients without histological confirmation would 
qualify for this study, a misdiagnosis of GBM based on MRI finding is relatively uncommon. Furthermore, since it is not a cytotoxic chemotherapy, a short -course 
administration of pre-operative DSF for 3 days to a patient with a different 
diagnos is should not adversely affect his/her subsequent treatment.  As for 
overlapping toxicity with TMZ or RT, DSF  appears to have preferential inhibition 
of tumor MGMT  versus liver MGMT in vitro, and our previous phase I study 
demonstrated safety when combining it with TMZ. Since DSF  may be 
radiosensit izing due to its possible effect on DNA repair  based on in vitro  studies , 
its tolerability with RT  is currently unknown. To monitor for severe toxicity, 
patients will be follo wed frequently  during RT  with weekly clinical ev aluation and 
CBC. Liver function test will be checked before starting DSF, and every month  
while taking DSF .

1.3 Study Rationale  
 
Preclinical  in vitro  studies have identified DSF  as a promising and selective drug against 
GBM  cells. In vivo  experiments have showed  synergistic effect of DSF  with RT and TMZ 
against orthotopic GBM models. Given its well-established safety profile, excellent 
penetration across the blood brain barr ier, relatively low  cost, and ease of  administration 
with an oral formulation , the potential of DSF  to enhance the efficacy of RT and TMZ for 
GBM warrants clinical trial investigation . We have previously demonstrated the feasibility  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 20 of 72 and safety  of combining DSF  with adjuvant  TMZ  after RT and concurrent TMZ . Adding 
DSF to RT and concurrent TMZ in the initial treatment GBM is a rational next  step to test 
the potential  of DSF to improve clinical outcome of GBM patients.  Since Cu has been 
shown in the preclinical studies to be crucial for the activity of DSF, pati ents will also take 
Cu TID with meals to maximize the biological activity  of DSF . Therefore, the purpose of 
this study is to identify the optimal dose of DSF  to combine with RT and TMZ .   
 
The proposed study will be a single arm , phase I/II  study of  DSF/Cu in combination with 
adjuvant standard RT and TMZ for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. There will be an 
optional phase 0 pharmac okinetic  study where patients will take 3 days  of DSF/Cu prior to 
their surgery  to allow for collection of blood and tumor samples  during surgery for analysis 
of drug uptake.  
 As for the rationale for the proposed expansion cohort, this is based on the promising finding of the dose -escalation phase of the study . After enrollment of the 18 patients for 
the dose -escalation phase, 8  patients were treated with DSF of 250 mg/day (dose level 2) 
and 10 patients with 375 mg/day (dose level 3). Three dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
observed: 1 with 250 mg/day (grade 2 urinary incontinence and ataxia), and 2 with 375 mg/day (both grade  3 elevated liver enzymes). The TITE -CRM model est imated the DLT 
probability of DSF to be 10% (95% CI: 3- 29%) at 250 mg/day, and 21% (95% CI: 7 -42%) 
at 375 mg/day. Thus, we have declared that the MTD of DSF in combination with RT/TMZ/Cu for GBM is 375 mg/day, and the recommended phase II dose is 250 mg/da y. 
Furthermore, tumor mutations were evaluated with next -generation sequencing for all 
patients to explore possible biomarkers for response. Notably, GBM patients with IDH (n 
= 6), BRAF (n = 2), and NF1  (n = 1) mutations exhibited much better PFS and OS than 
those without these mutations  (n = 9) : 1-year PFS of 100% vs 22%, respectively, p = 0.001; 
1-year OS of 100% vs 42%, re spectively, p = 0.006. Given that the historical PFS and OS 
of newly diagnosed GBM patients treated with RT and TMZ is approximat ely 27% and 
60% at one year [ 4], respectively, the preliminary data of this molecular subset of GBM 
are thought -provoking and raise the possibility that these mutations make GBM tumors 
more sensitive to DSF/Cu in combination with chemoradiotherapy. Interestingly, all three mutations , which affect approximately 15- 20% of GBM tumors,  make tumor cells more 
dependent on glutamat e for cellular metabolism [ 68-70]. As DSF metabolite can affect 
glutamate uptake, this may be the biological mechanism for the improved outcomes for GBM with these mutations. Thus, we have proposed to add an expansion cohort to this phase I/II study to treat additional GBM patients with IDH, BRAF, or NF1  mutations to 
increase the statistical power of our preliminary finding . 
    
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 21 of 72 2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
Dose -escalation Phase:  To determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
disulfiram (DSF) when administered with 
concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and 
temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). 
 
Dose -expansion Phase:  To evaluate the OS 
of the molecularly -defined cohort of newly 
diagnosed GBM with IDH, BRAF, or NF1 
mutations when treated with the combination of DSF/Cu plus concurrent RT and TMZ. Dose -escalation Phase:  The maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of DSF with concurrent RT+TMZ 
will be defined as the dose associated with a 20% probability of dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT). 
Toxicity will be coded using CTCAE version 4.0, 
and DLT will be defined as toxicity that occurs 
within 18 weeks from the first day of RT and is 
possibly, probably or definitely related to DSF/Cu (or 12 weeks from the completion of RT if there is a delay/interruption of RT).  
 
Dose -expansion Phase:  For the expansion cohort 
of GBM with IDH, BRAF, and NF1 mutations, 
the overall survival (OS) of this molecularly -
defined cohort will be measured from the first 
day of RT.  
Secondary  
1. To describe the toxicities of DSF when 
given concurrently with RT and TMZ.  
2. To evaluate the PFS of the molecularly-defined cohort of newly diagnosed GBM with IDH, BRAF, or 
NF1 mutations 
when treated with the combination of 
DSF/Cu plus concurrent RT and TMZ  
3. To determine the active DSF metabolite 
concentration in plasma and tumor 
tissues.  1. The adverse events will be graded by NCI 
CTCAE version 4.0.  
2. Progression- free survival (PFS) will be 
determined from the first day of RT to the 
time of tumor progression or death, whichever 
occurs first. Tumor progression will be 
determined using the RANO criteria.  
3. Intratumor and plasma concentration of DSF metabolite (ditiocarb -copper complex) will be 
determined using mass spectrometer method.   
Tertiary/Exploratory  
1. To estimate rate of pseudo -progression 
after chemoradiotherapy  
2. To explore the pharmacodynamics effect of DFS on glutamate metabolism in plasma and tumor tissues  1. Pseudo -progression is defined as a transient 
increase of tumor after chemoradiotherapy that subsequently stabilizes without a change of therapy  
2. Pharmacodynamics studies on glutamate metabolism will include measurement of glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, glucose, and lactate levels in blood and tumor tissues 
using mass spectrometry method.

  5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Pretreatment Evaluation  
 Prior to enrollment, patient must have a complete history, physical examination, evaluation of performance status (KPS) , baseline laboratory studies (CBC, BMP, and LFTs) , and 
MRI . For the expansion cohort, patients must have confirmed diagnosis of GBM with IDH, 
BRAF, or NF1 mutations . Diagnosis will be confirmed through the pathology report as a 
part of standard of care. Although for the dose -escalation phase, there was an optional pre -
operative disulfiram study before the initial surgery, this will no long er be applicable for 
the expansion cohort  and has been removed.   
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 26 of 72 5.2 Radiation Therapy  
 
RT should start approximately 4- 6 weeks after surgery (up to 8 weeks is permissible). 
Standard fractionated RT to 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions will be administered in this study. 
Gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as T1 contrast enhancing abnormality and surgical cavity . Clinical tumor volume  1 (CTV1) is defined as GTV  with a margin of 1.5  cm. 
Clinical tumor volume  2 (CTV2) is defined as GTV  with a margin of 0.5 -0.7 cm.  CTV s 
may be modified to respect natural barriers such as bone or tentorium. CTV 1 and CT V2 
should be expanded uniformly by 0.3- 0.5 cm into planning target volume  1 and 2 (PTV 1 
and PTV2 ), respectively  to account for setup uncertainty. PTV 1 should be treated to 46  Gy 
in 23 fractions of 2 Gy each, and PTV 2 should be boosted to an additional 14 Gy in 7 
fractions of 2  Gy each for a cumulative total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2 Gy each . 
3D conformal RT  (3DCRT)  and intensity modulated RT (IMRT) are all permitted for RT 
delivery.  
 5.3 Concurrent Temozolomide Treatment  
 Concurrent TMZ  will be administered continuously (Monday through Sunday)  from Day 
1 of RT to the last day of RT  at a daily oral dose of 75 mg/m
2 for a maximum of 49 days 
as per standard clinical care. TMZ should be taken before RT. The drug should typically 
be administered orally at least 1 hour before  breakfast  every morning. TMZ should not be 
taken within one hour of DSF  and Cu administration. Patients will be instructed to bring 
all unused drug and the completed medication diary (Appendix C) to each study visit for assessment of compliance.  
 
5.4 Disulfiram and Copper Administration  during Chemoradiotherapy  
 
DSF and Cu will be administered during chemoradiotherapy as per dose escalation 
instructions  in Section 5.10.  For patients enrolling in the expansion cohort, the dose of 
DSF will be  250 mg/day.  During chemoradiotherapy, DSF should be taken in the morning 
with approximately 8 ounces of water approximately 1 hour after  breakfast, and 2 mg of 
Cu gluconate should be taken TID with meals  but not concurrent ly with DSF . The rationale 
of giving  Cu in 3 doses is to maintain relatively constant plasma copper throughout the day 
while DSF is absorbed and metabolized.  Concurrent DSF during chemoradiotherapy is 
administered in the morning to provide the maximum radiosen sitizing effect. DSF and Cu 
should not be taken within one hour of TMZ administration.   If the patient misses a dose, 
s/he should be instructed not to make up that dose but should instead resume dosing with 
the next scheduled dose.  Patients will be instructed to bring all unused drug and the 
completed medication diary (Appendix D) to each study visit for assessment of 
compliance.

DSF 1 hour after breakfast   
Cu With breakfast, lunch, and dinner  
 
5.5 Laboratory Studies and Tissue Collection  during Chemoradiotherapy  
 
Routine laboratory studies (CBC, BMP, and LFTs) will be obtained before the start of 
chemoradiotherapy and weekly (for CBC) and monthly (for BMP and LFTs) during 
chemoradiotherapy or more frequently as clinically indicated . If , during 
chemoradiotherapy treatment, the patient develops disease progression and undergoes 
surgical resection of the glioblastoma, a portion of the tissue removed during surgery and along with blood will be archived for future research purposes  (please refer to Section 9.0) . 
 
5.6 Adjuvant  Temozolomide  and Disulfiram  Treatment  
 Approximately 4- 6 weeks after completion of RT with concurrent TMZ, adjuvant  TMZ 
may be administered for 6 cycles. Dosage of each cycle is 150 -200 mg/m
2 PO per day on 
Days 1 -5 of every 28 -day cycle. DSF will be administered  at 500 mg PO daily continuously 
in combination with adjuvant  TMZ for up to 6 cycles  as establish ed by our previous phase 
I study. The timing for DSF and Cu are same as in Section 5.7. Additional adjuvant TMZ 
beyond 6 cycles may be given at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist but not with DSF. Per standard clinical care, adjuvant  TMZ is typically given in the evening before 
bedtime  rather than in the morning . The timing of adjuvant TMZ will be established at the 
discretion of the treating medical oncologist.  Tumor -treating fields or Optune device 
(Novocure) as per routine clinical care during adjuvant TMZ is permitted at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
 
During adjuvant TMZ, the patient should be assessed every 2 months as per routine clinical 
care; however, more frequent visits may be performed as per the treating physician. During 
adjuvant  DSF with concurrent TMZ , if a patient develops disease progression and 
undergoes surgic al resection of the GBM , a portion of the tissue removed during surgery 
and along with blood will be archived for future research purposes (please refer to Section 9.0). 
 
5.7 Optional Preoperative Disulfiram before Salvage Surgery  
After completion of adjuvant DSF , patient s should be followed every 2 -3 months as per 
routine clinical care. If a patient develops recurrent tumor during follow -up and plans to 
undergo another resection, he/she may opt for an optional preoperative DSF study prior to salvage surgery. Patients who would like to participate in this optional portion of the study 
will be treated with a 5- day ( +/- 2 days) lead -in with oral DSF and Cu. DSF should be taken 
as 250 mg per day approximately 1 hour after dinner  in the evening, and Cu should be 
taken as 2mg TID with each meals. Patient should not  take DSF or Cu on the day of the 
surgery and should complete the drug diary (Appendix E) . 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 28 of 72  
 
5.8 Disulfiram Dose Escalation  Criteria  
 
The first patient wi ll be treated at D ose Level 2 with  250 mg of DSF  daily , and doses for 
subsequent patients will be provided at the time of registration based on the toxicity experience of the previous patients on study using the TITE -CRM  method, as detailed  in 
Section  13.3 .  
 
Dose Escalation Schedule  
Dose Level  Dose of Disulfiram  
Level 1  125 mg PO daily  
Level 2  250 mg PO daily  
Level 3  375 mg PO  daily  
Level 4  500 mg PO daily  
 
For patients enrolling in the expansion cohort, the dose of DSF during RT will be  250 
mg/day.  
 
5.9 Definition of MTD, DLT, Dose Escalation Criteria, and Toxicity, Response, and DLT Evaluations  
 
5.9.1 Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DSF  is define d as the dose level at which 
20% of the  cohort experience DLT within 18 weeks from start of RT  (or 12 weeks 
from the end of RT if there is a delay in RT).  MTD is assessed from the first dose of DSF in combination with TMZ and RT; patients will not be assessed for DLT during the pre -surgery period when they are receiving the lead- in doses of DSF. 
 
5.9.2 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) 
 A DLT is defined as a clinically significant adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications/ TMZ/adjuvant DSF  which occurs within  18 weeks 
following the first dose of DSF  with RT +TMZ (corresponding to approximately 6 
weeks during RT and 12 weeks after RT) and meets any of the following criteria (all toxicity will be graded using CTCAE version 4.0):  
 
• Any delay in RT treatment > 14 days that is possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to DSF  will be considered a DLT.  
• Any adverse event that requires dose reduction or discontinuation of DSF during RT that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to DSF will be considered a DLT.  
• Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 29 of 72 Note: These dose limiting hematological toxicities are most likely due to TMZ 
and may be attributed to TMZ. However, as a conservative assessment of the 
ability to combine DSF  with RT and TMZ, these toxicities will be counted as a 
DLT as they would prompt discontinuation of TMZ.  
• Serum creatinine > 2.0 x ULN  
• Total bilirubin > 2.0 x ULN; AST or ALT > 3.0 x ULN  
• Other grade 3 or grade 4 non- hematologic toxicity that is possibly, probably, or 
definitely related  to DSF , with the following specific exceptions:  
• Grade 3 fatigue  
• Grade 3 arthralgias/myalgias  
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or anorexia that does not require discontinuing RT or TMZ  
• Diarrhea that can be adequately managed with outpatient medication such as loper amide and does not require hospitalization 
 
Headaches are frequent in the brain tumor population and are usually due to diffuse increased intracranial pressure or compression of pain -sensitive intracranial 
structures (example: dura). The oncologists participating in this study are experienced clinicians accustomed to evaluation of brain tumor patients with headaches. Each patient with a headache is approached individually with a systematic assessment as to the etiology of the pain. Appropriate tests may include 
vital signs , CT or MRI scans,  or other investigations. If, in the opinion of the 
treating oncologist, the headache is due to DSF, then the toxicity will be graded as 
above, and if ≥ grade 3, it will be defined as a DLT.  Seizures are also a common complication associated with brain tumors. As noted in the preceding paragraph each patient will be approached individually and 
assessment for the cause of the seizure will be performed. If, in the opinion of the treating oncologist, the seizure is due to DSF , then the toxicity will be graded, and 
if ≥ 3, it will be defined as a DLT.  
 
5.9.3 Toxicity, Response, and DLT Evaluations  
 
All patients who receive at least one  dose of DSF  are evaluable for toxicity. 
However, patients have to receive the combination of DSF with RT+TMZ to be evaluable for DLT. Of note, DLT evaluation starts when patient starts DSF with 
RT and does not apply during the preoperative DSF administration. Patients who 
do not have at l east one dose of DSF with RT +TMZ  will not be evaluable for DLT 
and will be replaced.  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 30 of 72 5.10 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
The following medications and procedures are prohibited during the study:  
• Any antineoplastic therapy other than RT , temozolomide,  and DSF, except for the 
tumor -treating fields or Optune device when used in conjunction with adjuvant 
temozolomide and DSF  
• Any investigational therapy other than DSF   
 
All other medical conditions  or manifestations of the patient’s malignancy  should be 
treated at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with local community standards 
of medical care.  
 
Patients should not drive, operate dangerous tools or machinery, or engage in any other potentially hazardous activity that requires full alertness and coordination if they 
experience sedation while enrolled in this study.  
 Patients are to be instructed to abstain from alcohol while enrolled in this study.   
 
5.10.1 Nausea and Vomiting  
 
Prophylactic antiemetic therapy may be used in this study at the discretion of treating physician. Because of the potential of benzodiazepines to interact with DSF  
through the cytochrome  P450 system , the use of benzodiazepines for antiemetic 
prophylaxis should be reserved for patients who cannot be satisfactorily managed otherwise.   
 
5.10.2 Diarrhea  
 
Antidiarrheal medications will not be used prophylactically; however, patients will be instructed to take loperamide, 4 mg total, at the occurrence of the first loose stool 
and then 2 mg every 2 hours until they are diarrhea -free for at least 12 hours.  
During the night, patients may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours.  Fluid intake should be maintained to avoid dehydration.  
 
5.10.3 Central Nervous System Effects  
 
In our previous experience with 500- 1000 mg of DSF per day with adjuvant  TMZ, 
significant neurological toxicities, including delirium/psychosis, ataxia, visual changes, peripheral neuropathy, were observed, especially at the  1000 mg dose. 
Early signs of those symptoms should be carefully monitored. Once other causes such as tumor progression are ruled out, dose reduction of DSF during adjuvant 
TMZ should be considered if the toxicity is grade 2 or greater . If symptoms are not 
improving with dose reduction, DSF should be discontinued. Patients whose 
symptoms  are not considered immediately life -threatening should be carefully 
monitored . Each patient may be approached individually with a systematic 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 31 of 72 assessment to rule out other causes. Appropriate tests may include vital signs; CT 
or MRI scans or other investigations.  
 If the patient’s level of consciousness is considered to be life -threatening, the 
patient should be hospitalized and necessary measures should be instituted to secure 
the airway, ventilation, and intravenous access.  
 
5.10.4 Management of D isulfiram -Alcohol Reaction  
 Severe DSF reactions caused by the patient's ingestion of alcohol  should lead to 
emergency evaluation and supportive measures to restore blood pressure. Other 
recommendations include: oxygen, carbogen (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide), vitamin C intravenously in massive doses (1 g) , and ephedrine sulfate. 
Antihistamines have also been used intravenously. Potassium levels should be monitored, particularly in patients on digitalis, since hypokalemia has been reported.  
 
5.11 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential ( defined as women with regular menses, women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, or  women who have had a tubal ligation) are required to 
have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first  dose of the study 
treatment.   
 
Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use a method 
of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for 4 months following the last dose of study treatment.  
 If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, study treatment should be immediately discontinued.  In addition a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume treatment.  
 If a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during therapy or within 4 months after the last dose of study treatment, the investigator must be notified in order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.12 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation doc umented 
in the case report forms.  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 32 of 72 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, DSF  treatment may continue until 
completion of 6 cycles of adjuvant  TMZ  or in the event of following:  
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression  
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious noncompliance with the study protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
5.13 Duration of Follow -up 
 
Patients are evaluated  for adverse events for 30 days after the last dose of DSF  or until 
death , whichever occurs first . Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  Follow -up after the 
conclusion of adjuvant  TMZ + DSF will be per routine clinical care.   Two years after the 
patient comes off study, the chart will be reviewed to collect data on progression and survival.  
 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Temozolomide  Dose Modifications  during R adiation Therapy   
 
No dose reduction will be made, but delay or discontinuation of TMZ administration will 
be decided weekly according to hematologic and non- hematologic adverse events, as 
specified below .  Additionally, TMZ can be held at the discretion of the treating physician.  
If the administration of TMZ has to be interrupted, RT  will proceed normally. Missed doses 
of TMZ will not be made up at the end of RT . The total number of days and total dose of 
temozolomide will be recorded on the patient’s medication diary (Appendix C) . 
 If one or more of the following are observed:  
• ANC < 1. 5 x 10
9/ L (Grade 2)  
• Platelet count < 75 x 109/L (Grade 2 ) 
• Grade 3 non- hematologic AE (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting while on 
maximal antiemetic therapy, and fatigue)  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 33 of 72 Then treatment with concurrent  TMZ  will be withheld until all of the following conditions 
are met:  
• ANC ≥ 1. 5 x 109/L 
• Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L 
• Grade ≤ 1 non -hematologic AE (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue)  
In case of hematologic AE as defined above, a complete blood count (CBC) should be 
performed at least weekly. In case of non- hematologic AE, the patient should be assessed 
at least weekly with relevant laboratory test(s). As soon as all of the above conditions are 
met, the administration of temozolomide will resume at the same dose as used initially.  
 
If one or more of the following are observed:  
• ANC < 0.5 x 109/L (Grade 4)  
• Platelet count < 25 x 109/L (Grade 4) 
• Grade 4 non- hematologic AE (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting unless the 
patient has failed maximal antiemetic therapy, and fatigue)  
Then treatment with concurrent temozolomide should be discontinued.  
 
AE Value  Action  
Grade 3 neutropenia  ≥ 0.5 and < 1.0 x 109/L Hold TMZ until  
--ANC ≥  1.5 x 109/L 
--Platelet ≥ 75 x 109/L 
--Grade ≤ 1 non-hematologic AE  Grade 2 -3 thrombocytopenia  ≥ 25 and < 75 x 109/L 
Grade 3 non -hematologic 
(except alopecia, nausea/vomiting unless on 
maximal antiemetic therapy)  NA 
Grade 4 neutropenia  < 0.5 x 109/L Stop TMZ  
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  < 25 x 109/L 
Grade 4 non -hematologica 
(except alopecia, 
nausea/vomiting)  NA 
 
If RT has to be temporarily interrupted for technical or medical reasons unrelated to TMZ, 
then treatment with daily TMZ should continue. If RT  has to be permanently discontinued 
then TMZ should stop until it is re -initiated at the adjuvant  phase of treatment.  
 
6.2 DSF  Dose Modification s 
 During radiotherapy, i f a patient experiences any adverse event that requires dose reduction 
in the opinion of the investigator and that is  considered by the investigator to be possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to DSF , DSF/Cu should be discontinued  and the event will 
be considered a DLT . If RT has to be temporarily interrupted for technical or medical 
reasons unrelated to TMZ or DSF/Cu, then treatment with daily TMZ and DSF/Cu should continue.  If RT has to be permanently discontinued then TMZ and DSF/Cu should stop until re -initiated at the adjuvant phase of treatment.  If TMZ is h eld due to toxicity  unrelated 
to DSF/Cu , DSF /Cu should continue as tolerated.  
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 34 of 72 During adjuvant TMZ, the dose of DSF may be reduced from 500 mg per day to 250 mg per 
day due to toxicity or intolerance at the discretion of the treating physician. Expansion patients who discontinue d DSF during RT and concurrent TMZ  due to toxicity  may be 
considered to resume  DSF with adjuvant TMZ but at 250 mg/day as long as the toxicity has 
resolved prior to the start of cycle 1 of adjuvant TMZ and after discussion between the treating physician and the PI.  Special attention should be paid to neurologi cal symptoms 
such as delirium/psychosis, gait disturbance/ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. A grade 2 toxicity of the above neurological symptoms should prompt a consideration for further work-up and consideration of dose reduction if thought to be related to DSF . No second dose 
reduction  (below 250 mg/day)  is allowed —if a second dose reduction is required, DSF and 
Cu will be permanently discontinued. Of note, hematologic toxicity is uncommon for DSF and is likely related to TMZ.  
 
6.2.1 Administration of DSF  to Patients with Abnormal Hepatic Function  
 
DSF/Cu should only be administered if hepatic function is within the parameters 
established in the eligibility criteria. Hepatic toxicity from DSF/Cu is uncommon 
but may occur. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction that occurs while the patient is on 
study should prompt an evaluation to determine the cause, including the possibility of hepatotoxicity from concurrent medications  including TMZ .  
 
6.2.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions  
 Hypersensi tivity reactions rarely occur. If they do occur, minor symptoms such as 
flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, lower back pain, hypotension, or tachycardia  may 
require no intervention;  however, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring 
treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of study drug administration and a ggressive 
symptomatic therapy. Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to DSF should discontinue DSF immediate ly and should not be re -challenged.    
  
7.0 REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 The entities providing oversight of safety and compliance with the protocol require reporting as outline below.  
 The Washington University Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) requires that all events meeting the definition of unanticipated problem or serious noncompliance be reported as outlined in Section 7.2.

clinically or laboratory adverse events that are > grade 1 (excluding lymphopenia) will be collected.  
  
8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
8.1 Disulfiram  
 
8.1.1 DSF  Description  
 
DSF is an alcohol antagonist drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
alcoholism. Its powder is white, odorless, and almost tasteless. It is soluble in water 
to the extent of about 20mg in 100mL, and in alcohol to the extent of about 3.8 g in 100 mL.  
Molecular formula: C
10H20N2S4 
Chemical name: bis(diethylthiocarbamoyl) disulfide.  
Molecular weight: 296.54. 
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 
DSF is mostly known as an irreversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, which 
affects alcohol metabolism and causes accumulation of acetaldehyde. However, 
increasing preclinical studies have shown that DSF  is also a proteasome inhibitor, 
specifically the chymotrypsin -like activity. GBM cells and its stem -like 
subpopulation (also referred to as CSC) may be more susceptible to the effect of 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 38 of 72 proteasomal inhibition than normal brain cells.  DSF is very lipophilic and readily 
crosses the blood -brain barrier.  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 39 of 72 8.1.3 Supplier  
 
DSF (trade name Antabuse) is commercially available and will be provided to 
participants by the study .   
 
8.1.4 Dosage Form  
 
DSF is supplied as white, round tablets of 250 mg. Each tablet also contains 
colloidal silicon dioxide, anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline 
cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, and stearic acid.  The tablet may be cut in half to 
obtain 125 mg dose.  
 
8.1.5 Storage and Stability  
 
DSF is dispensed in a tight, light -resistant container. It should be stored at 
controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C or 68° to 77°F) in its original container to protect from bright light.  
 
8.1.6 DSF  Administration  
 
DSF is taken by mouth daily. It should be taken with meal to improve absorption . 
It should not be taken within one hour of temozolomide. Patient should not have consumed any alcohol at least 12 hours prior to the first dose. In the rare event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue DSF  immediately.  
 
8.2 Temozolomide (Temodar)  
 8.2.1 Temozolomide Description  
 Chemical name: 3,4- dihydro- 3-methyl- 4-oxoimidazo[5,1- d]-as-tetrazine -8-
carboxamide. Structural formula:  
 
 8.2.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 Temozolomide is not directly active but undergoes rapid nonenzymatic conversion at physiologic pH to the reactive compound 5- (3-methyltraizen -1-yl)-imaidazole-
4-carboxamide (MTIC).  The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be primarily due 
to alkylation of D NA.  Alkylation (methylation) occurs mainly at the O
6 and N7 
positions of guanine.  
 

Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 40 of 72 8.2.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
Temozolomide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma concentration (C
max) achieved in a median T max of 1 hour.  Food 
reduces the rate and extent of temozolomide absorption.  
 
Temozolomide is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH to the active species, 
MTIC and to temozolomide acid metabolite.  MTIC is further hydrolyzed to 5 -
amino -imidazole -4-carboxamide (AIC), which is known to be an intermediate in 
purine and nucleic aci d biosynthesis, and to methylhydrazine, which is believed to 
be the active alkylating species.  Cytochrome P540 enzymes play only a minor role 
in the metabolism of temozolomide and MTIC.  
 
About 38% of the administered temozolomide total radioactive dose is recover ed 
over 7 days : 37.7% in urine and 0.8% in feces.  Temozolomide is rapidly 
eliminated, with a mean elimination half- life of 1.8 hours.  
 
8.2.4 Supplier  
 
Temozolomide is commercially available.  
 
8.2.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Temozolomide capsules are supplied in child -resistant sachets containing the 
following capsule strengths: 5 mg, 20 mg, 100 mg, 140 mg, 180 mg, and 250 mg. 
 
8.2.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Store temozolomide capsules at 35°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15- 30°C (59-
86°F). 
 
8.2.7 Administration  
 
Please refer to Sections 5.6 and 5.9. 
 
8.2.8 Special Handling Instructions  
 
The use of gloves is recommended.  
 
 
9.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
The correlative studies to measure drug concentration will be performed in all  enrolled patients

9.1 Collection of Specimens  
 
If a patient is participating in the optional tumor collection at time of recurrence, a tumor 
specimen of at least 0.2 cubic cm or approximately  200 mg will be collected . At the time 
of salvage surgery, approximately 2 0 mL of periphe ral blood (10 mL into each of 2 green 
top tube containing sodium heparin) will also be collected. Tumor and blood samples will be submitted  at ambient temperature to Tissue Procurement Core (TPC)  for processing and 
storage .

   12.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
12.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 9 +/ - 1 
weeks.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 9 weeks 
(not less than 4) weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the updated response assessment criteria for high -grade gliomas: Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology 
(RANO) working group guideline [ 78]. 
   
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 45 of 72 Criteria for Determining First Progression Depending on Time f rom Initial Chemoradiotherapy  
First Progression  Definition  
Progressive disease < 12 
weeks after completion of 
chemoradiotherapy  Progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new 
enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high- dose region or 
80% isodose line) or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on 
histopathologic sampling (eg, solid tumor areas [ie, > 70% tumor cell nuclei 
in areas], high or progressive increase in MIB -1 proliferation index 
compared with prior biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression or 
increased anaplasia in tumor). Note: Given the difficulty of differentiatin g 
true progression from pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the 
absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of progression, will not 
be sufficient for definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after 
completion of concurrent c hemoradiotherapy.  
Progressive disease ≥ 12 weeks after 
chemoradiotherapy 
completion
 1. New contrast -enhancing lesion outside of radiation field on 
decreasing, stable, or increasing doses of corticosteroids.  
2. Increase by ≥ 25% in the sum of the products of perpendicular 
diameters between the first postradiotherapy scan, or a subsequent 
scan with smaller tumor size, and the scan at 12 weeks or later on 
stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids.  
3. Clinical deterioration not attributable to concurrent medication or 
comorbid conditions is sufficient to declare progression on current 
treatment but not for entry onto a clinical trial for recurrence.  
4. For patients receiving antiangiogenic therapy, significant increase in 
T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion may also be considered progressive 
disease. The increased T2/FLAIR must have occurred with the 
patient on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids comp ared 
with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy and not be a result of comorbid events (eg, effects of radiation therapy, 
demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects). 
 
 
Criteria for Response Assessment Incorporating MRI and Clinical Factors (Adapted from JCO 2010)  
Response  Criteria  
Complete response  • Requires all of the following: complete disappearance of all enhancing 
measurable and nonmeasurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks.  
• No new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions.  
• Patients must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only) 
and stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable disease 
only cannot have a complete response; the best response possible is stable 
disease.  
Partial response  Requires all of the following:  
• ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at 
least 4 weeks.  
• No progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 46 of 72 Response  Criteria  
• Stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose 
of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan; the corticosteroid dose at the 
time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of 
baseline scan.  
• Stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable disease only 
cannot have a partial response; the best response possible is stable disease.  
Stable disease Requires all of the following:  
• Does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression.  
• Stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid 
dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without confirmation of 
disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow -up imaging 
shows that this increase in corticosteroids was required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan 
obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dos e.  
Progression  Defined by any of the following:  
• ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing 
lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids
*. The absolute increase in any dimension must be at least 5mm 
when calculating the products.  
• Significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable or increasing 
doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after 
initiation of therapy* not caused by comorbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, 
demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or 
other treatment effects).  
• Any new measureable lesion.  
• Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor 
(e.g. seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of therapy, 
cerebrovascular events, infection, and so on) or changes in corticosteroid dose.  
• Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating condition; or 
clear progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
• NOTE. All measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as at 
baseline.  
• Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; FLAIR, fluid -attenuated inversion recovery.  
• Stable doses of corticosteroids include patients not on corticosteroids.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Bi -dimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins 
by MRI scan .  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).    
 
Non-measurable or evaluable  disease:   Uni -dimensionally measurable lesions or lesions 
with margins not clearly defined such as  areas of T2/FLAIR signal abnormality or poorly 
defined enhancing abnormality.  
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 47 of 72 Note: For cystic lesions, the only measurable part is any enhancement area around the cyst 
that is  clearly defined and bi -dimensionally measurable. The cyst itself should not be 
considered measurable or non- measureable disease.  
 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions that are residual of the lesion treated with MLA 
should be identified as target l esions and recorded and measured .  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion , which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  When there are too many measurable lesions, choose the largest 3 lesions as target lesions to follow.  The other measurable lesions should be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status determination.  
 Non-target lesions:  All non-measurable lesions should be identified as non- target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler .  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 2 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable on brain MRI when 
they are ≥  5 mm diameter as assessed using a ruler.  
 
Histology:  This technique  can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases when biopsy or surgical resection of a measureable 
lesion is clinically indicated.  
 
Perfusion/CBV: This advanced brain MRI technique can be used as an adjunct test to 
determine treatment response or disease status.  However, it should not be used as the primary or sole method to determine response or disease status.   Brain FDG -PET coupled with head CT or brain MRI:  This advanced metabolic 
imaging technique can be used as an adjunct test to determine response or disease status. 
However it should be used as the primary or sole method of determining response or disease status.  
 
12.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disapp earance of all target lesions.  
 Partial Response (PR):   ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 48 of 72 products of perpendicular diameters of all target lesions sustained for at least 4 
weeks.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 25 % increase in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of at least 1  target lesion , taking as reference the smallest 
sum of products of perpendicular diameters on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  The absolute increase in any dimension must be at 
least 5mm when calculating the products of perpendicular diameters.  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of products of perpendicular diameters while on study. 
 
12.3.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions .  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of o ne or more non- target lesion(s).  
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions  on stable or increasing doses 
of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of 
therapy
* not caused by comorbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment 
effects). Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  
It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investiga tor). 
 
12.3.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

† Increase in corticosteroids alone will not be taken into account in determining progression in the 
absence of persistent clinical deterioration.  
NOTE: Patients m ay continue on  treatment and re main under close obs ervation and evalu ation at 
4-8 week interv als if there is u ncertainty  regar ding whether  pseudoprogression may be present as 
determined by the investigators.  If subsequ ent radiographic or clinical assessments  suggest that 
the pa tient is in fact exp eriencing pr ogression,  then the da te of progres sion should be t he time point  
at which t his issue was first raised.  Similarly,  stable disease may be assigned in c ases of  presu med 
“pseudop rogres sion” associ ated with dec reased ster oid use. 
 
12.3.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive d isease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
12.3.5 Progression -Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression 
or death, whichever occurs first.  
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 50 of 72 13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING

according to institutional guidelines.  
      
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 51 of 72 14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
14.1 Definition of Primary Endpoint 
 
The maximum tole rated dose (MTD) of DSF  with concurrent RT +TMZ  will be defined as 
the dose associated with a 20% probability of dose -limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicity will 
be coded using CTCAE version 4.0, and DLT will be defined as toxi city that occurs within 
18 weeks from the first day of RT and is possibly, probably or definitely related to DSF /Cu 
(or 12 weeks from the completion of RT if there is a delay/interruption of RT). 
 For the expansion cohort of GBM with IDH, BRAF, and NF1  mutations, the overall 
survival  (OS)  of this molecularly -defined cohort  will be measured from the first day  of RT.  
 
14.2 Definition of Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints  
 
1. The adverse events will be  graded by NCI CTC AE version 4.0.  
2. Progression- free survival (PFS) will be determined from the first day of RT to the time 
of tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first. Tumor progression will be determined using the RANO criteria.  
3. Intratumor and plasma concentration of DSF  metabolite (ditiocarb -copper complex) 
will be determined using mass spectrometer  method . 
4. Pharmacodynamics studies on glutamate metabolism will include measurement of 
glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, glucose, and lactate levels in blood and tumor tissues  
using mass spectrometry  method.  
5. Pseudo- progression is defined as a transient  increase of tumor after chemoradiotherapy  
that subsequently stabilizes without a change of therapy.    
 
14.3 Analytic Plan for Primary Endpoint  
 
14.3.1 Background of Time -to-Event Continual Reassessment Method ( TITE-
CRM ) and Trial R ules 
 
The standard phase I 3+3 design is poorly suited for trials of RT , for which 
toxicities may occur up to several months after treatment. In this case, the 3+3 design, or any design that requires all patients to have completed observation for toxicity, is subject to openings and closings as patients present after a dose level potentially has filled, but before sufficient time has elapsed to be certain that treatment has not produced DLT.  
 As such, dose escalation for this trial will be guided by the Time -to-Event Continual 
Reassessment Method (TITE -CRM).  TITE -CRM seeks to determine the target 
dose, defined as the dose most closely identified with the target rate, which is the largest accep table probability of toxicity, determined a priori by the investigators 
based on the relative costs and benefits of the treatment (typically between 5% and 25%). As the trial progresses and patients do or do not experience toxicities at different doses, th e estimates of probability of toxicity are recalculated using a 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 52 of 72 Bayesian expectation, and subsequent patients are assigned to doses under the 
principle to always treat at the target dose.  In a Monte Carlo simulation of 60,000 
phase I trials comparing 3+3 design to TITE -CRM in studies with delayed toxicity, 
the TITE- CRM trials were significantly shorter when toxicity observation times are 
long, treated more patients at or above the MTD , identified the MTD more 
accurately, but did not expose patients to significant additional risk [ 79]. 
Additionally, given that TITE -CRM concentrates most of th e accrual around the 
MTD , early estimates of efficacy are possible for a phase I trial.  
 The Time -to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE -CRM) proposed by 
Cheung and Chappell is an adaptive Phase I design [ 80]. In a TITE- CRM clinical 
trial, patients enroll as they become available to be studied. Each participant is 
assigned to a dose level from a set of dose levels pre- defined by investigators and 
is monitored for DLTs over time. The design is adaptive in that the dose level assigned to a ne wly enrolled patient depends on the dose level assignments and 
DLT  outcomes of the patients already in the study.  A patient's observation period 
ends at the occurrence of a DLT , or if a DLT does  not occur, after a fixed time T  of 
follow -up. The trial end s when a fixed number of patients, n, have been observed. 
Once the final patient has been observed, the MTD can be estimated using the available data. The TITE -CRM differs from the traditional CRM in that the 
estimation process is weighted to account for t he proportion of the observation 
period that each currently enrolled patient has been observed.  By not requiring complete observation before the enrollment of the next patient, new participants can be assigned a dose and begin evaluation as they become av ailable, subsequently 
shortening the overall duration of the study.  
 The Biostatistics Unit at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center has developed a program titecrm.sas for SAS 9 (SAS Institute, Inc.; Cary, NC) that 
makes all of the calculations necessary to determine dose allocation of a trial in real-time.  They have also developed simulation programs that allow the user to 
determine the efficacy of the trial based on a priori  estimates of the probabilities of 
toxicity and necessary sample sizes.   
 In order to properly utilize this type of trial, a few assumptions and many rules must be determined before the start of the trial.  The main assumption that must be determined is how many different dose levels will be included in the trial and a priori  estimates of the probability of a DLT at each of those dose levels.  For this 
trial, we have 4 dose levels (d
1,…, d 4) ranging from 125mg PO daily to 500 mg PO 
daily, with initial toxicity probability estimates (p 1,…, p 4) ranging from 0.05 to 
0.30, respective ly.  The following table shows the dose design with associated 
estimated probabilities of toxicity.

Dose Escalation Schedule  
 
Dose Level   
Dose of DSF  Initial Toxicity 
Estimate  
Level 1  125 mg PO  daily  0.05 
Level 2  250 mg PO daily  0.10 
Level 3  375 mg PO  daily  0.20 
Level 4  500 mg PO daily  0.30 
 
14.3.2 TITE- CRM D esign  for the Dose- escalation Phase  
 
The starting dose can have a large impact on the properties of the design. After the 
trial is completed, most information about the MTD will be obtained if many 
patients are treated at or near the MTD, thus the sooner the choice of dose can 
converge on the MTD the more effective the trial will be. However, with concerns about safety we will start a t the one dose level lower than the expected MTD . 
Therefore, our starting dose for this trial will be 250  mg PO daily.   
 The next thing to be considered is the dose escalation rules.  For this trial, we will only allow a single dose level escalation per new patient enrolled on the trial.  
Therefore, if the previous patient was treated at dose level, d
k, then a new patient 
can only be treated at dose levels d k+1 or lower.  In order to determine at which level 
to treat the new patient, we will use a non -weighted, cumulative time of exposure 
approach.  The total length of follow -up for DLT for any patient is 18 weeks.  In 
order to efficiently and effectively determine the MTD, we allow for a dose change when the cumulative time of exposure is 18 weeks.  Also, since previously published data shows that toxic events occur evenly throughout the time of the study we will not implement a weighting function.  The dose for the next patient is selected so that the estimated probability at that dose is close to the target level. A feature of the dose escalation part of the TITE -CRM program is the flexibility in 
specifying the margin for the dose selection. This allows the selection of the dose level for the next patient that may have an estimated probabil ity of toxicity larger 
than the target level but less than the target level plus the margin. It finds the dose closest to the target probability even if it has a higher estimated probability. For this trial we set the admissible margin to be 5%, therefore,  the MTD will be chosen as 
the dose that yields a posterior toxicity estimate closest to 20% while being between 15% and 25%.  The admissible margin is also used to help determine stopping rules for the trial.  In order to account for the possibility of poor initial outcomes we will employ a run- in of 6 patients, meaning that the minimum number of treated patients 
will be 6.  If after these 6 patients, or any other time during the trial, the lowest dose 
level has a posterior probability higher than 25% then  the trial will stop.   
 
14.3.3 Simulation and S ample S ize C alculations  
 
The TITE- CRM manual details methods for utilizing trial simulation in order to 
obtain estimated posterior probabilities on toxicity estimates.  We utilize  the 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 54 of 72 simulation program to determine the efficacy of our trial and obtain estimates for 
needed sample size.  While there is no exact power calculation for this type of trial, 
the effectiveness of the trial’s sample size can be determined by looking at the stabi lity of the posterior probability under different prior probabilities.  We ran 
1000 simulations under various increasing and decreasing prior probability estimates utilizing the previously described rules and assumptions for this trial and found that we wi ll be able to determine the MTD with 18 patients. Simulations 
showed that approximately 98% of the time the trial will come to completion after 18 patients and the MTD will fall between the 2
nd and 3rd dose level more than 95% 
of the time.  Therefore, the sample size of this adaptive phase I/II study will be 18 patients.  
 
14.3.4 Workflow  
 
The first patient will be enrolled on the trial and treated at the 250  mg PO daily 
dose level, which is one dose level below the hypothesized MTD.  That patient will be entered into the titecrm.sas program and follow -up will begin from start of 
treatment (RT+TMZ+DSF+Cu) .  Although the entire study duration is 34 weeks or 
at the completion of adjuvant DSF, f or the purposes of  DLT evaluation, the patient 
will be followed from start of treatment until the patient completes 18 weeks of follow -up, has a DLT, or is lost to follow -up.  If any of these endpoints occur, the 
statistician will be notified and the date corresponding to the event will be entered into the program.  While there is a maximum follow -up of 18 weeks for observation 
of possible DLTs , sometimes patients have a delay in their treatment resulting in 
the need for a prolonged observation period (at least 12 weeks after completion of 
RT if there is delay/interruption of RT). This delay will be accounted for as needed 
for this study to ensure completed 18 week follow -up.  When a new patient is 
enrolled on the trial the statistician will be notified of the date of enrollment.  At 
this time the statistician will update the follow -up for all patients currently on the 
trial and determine the dose that will be administered for the new patient.  We will 
utilize the cumulative time of exposure method which will allow the contribution 
of patients with no DLT at this time to be partially weighted consistent with their 
time observed.  At this point, the program pr ovides a summary of the number of 
patients treated at each dose so far, along with the number of DLTs that have 
occurred. The posterior probability and 95% credible intervals of dose limiting toxicity for each dose level is calculated.  At this point, the model determines the 
dose level that has an estimated toxicity rate closet to 20% within the 5% admissible 
margin.  The newly enrolled patient will be enrolled in the corresponding dose level 
if that dose level is within one dose jump from the dose level the most current 
patient is enrolled on.  If the suggested dose level is more than one dose level from the current dose level , the next patient will be enrolled on the dose level that is 
closest to the current level in the direction of the dose level determined from the 
estimated posterior probability.  This continues until the trial has accrued all 18  
patients or, if after 6 patients are e nrolled, the estimated posterior probability  for 
the lowest dose level is  higher t han 25% .  
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 55 of 72  
14.3.5 Sample Size for the Dose- expansion Phase  
To further explore the effect of the addition of DSF/Cu to standard 
chemoradiotherpay for the subset of GBM with IDH/BRFA/NF1  mutation s, we 
propose to add an expansion cohort to further confirm that the addition of DSF/Cu to chemoradiotherapy may be a promising strategy to treat GBM with these mutations. Given historical data for a cohort of GBM is not readily available, some assumptions are used to derive a historical control benchmark. GBM with BRAF or 
NF1 mutations are not known to have different prognos is than typical IDH-
wildtype GBM [ 81,82] , with historical OS of approximately 30% at 2 years and 
10% at 5 ye ars [3,83,84 ]. Both BRAF and NF1 mutations affect the RAS /MAPK  
pathway and can also occur in the same patient, thus we will combine both mutations into one molecular cohort. However, IDH-mutant GBM is known to have 
better OS than IDH- wildtype GBM, with 2 year OS of approximately 50% and 5 
year OS of approximately 20% [ 85], so we will define the second molecular cohort 
by the presence of IDH mutation .  Therefore, a cohort with equal proportion of 
IDH- mutant GBM and BRAF/NF1 -mutant GBM should theoretically have 2 year 
OS of 40% and 5- year OS of 15%. Based on such assumptions, a sample size of 24 
patients (including 12 with IDH mutations and 12 with BRAF/NF1  mutations) 
would provide 80% power with one -sided alpha of 0.10 to detect an improvement 
of 2- year OS from historical 40% to 60% (or a hazard ratio of 0.55). Since we have 
already enrolled 9 patients with these mutations (6 with IDH mutat ion, 2 with BRAF 
mutation, and 1 with NF1  mutation), only additional 15 patients will be needed: 6 
with IDH mutation, 9 patients with BRAF and/or NF1 mutation s.  For the dose -
expansion phase, patients are considered evaluable if a patient has received at least 
4 weeks of DSF with RT, at either the MTD (375mg/day) or the RP2D 
(250mg/day). Inevaluable patients will be replaced. 
 
14.4 Analytic Plan for Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints  
 
Adverse events will be tabulated by type and grade.  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize and compare concentration of ditiocarb -
copper complex and glutamate metabolites  in plasma and tumor tissue, including median 
and range.  
 The c ox proportional hazard models will be used to assess for associations between 
intratumor drug concentration with tumor control and survival .  
 The Kaplan -Meier product -limit metho d will be used to estimate tumor control and 
survival probabilities.

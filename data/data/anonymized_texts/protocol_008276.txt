1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 General principles of the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  
 
This document details the proposed analysis strategy for the sub-study of CROWN 
CORONATION,  leading to scientific publication(s) . The results reported in these papers will 
follow the strategy set out here, which adheres to the guidelines for the content of a statistical 
analysis plan1. Moreover, the reporting of the main trial will adhere to the CONSORT 
guidelines2. 
 
Suggestions for subsequent analyses by oversight committee s, journal editors or referees, will 
be considered carefully in line with the principles of this analysis plan.  Subsequent analyses 
of a more exploratory nature will not be bound by this strategy, and will be detailed in 
separate analysis plans.  
 
Any devia tions from the SAP will be described and justified in the final report s. This document 
is intended to be stand -alone from the protocol and adhere to the main points in the analysis 
summary specified in the protocol. However, the SAP can undergo revision ou tside of the 
protocol.  
 
1.2 Background and rationale of the sub-study  
 
Adaptive memory immune responses (particularly B cells and antibodies) are considered the 
cornerstone of vaccination in humans. However, recent studies demonstrate that a 
memory -like respon se in innate immunity can also enhance resistance to infection. These 
observations have led to the paradigm -shifting concept of trained immunity, where 
functional reprogramming of innate immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and 
Natural Killer (NK) cells can improve immune responses against infections. Epidemiological 
studies have shown that certain vaccines employing live attenuated microorganisms such as 
Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG), measles -containing vaccines (such as MMR), and oral polio 
vaccin e (OPV) exert heterologous protective effects against infections other than those for 
which these vaccines are administered, and this cannot be explained by induction of any 
specific T - or B cell responses. Vaccination with measles seems to induce a transi ent 
suppression of lymphoproliferative responses, but an increase in innate immune responses, 
as measured by nonspecific cytokine production.  
 
Recent exposure to a vaccine may affect the immune response to subsequent vaccination 
with an unrelated vaccine.  Such interaction between different vaccines has not been studied 
extensively. Evidence suggests that the chronological order of different vaccines in 
childhood immunization schedules can have a notable impact on overall childhood 
mortality. Interaction be tween vaccines may occur through modification of the adaptive  
response and / or modification of the innate immune response. Such interaction can be 
either positive or negative.  
 
The rapid development and rol l-out of specific SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in  the USA, 
 
CROWN CORONATION  sub-study  SAP V1 .2 [21 Sep 2021], Page 6 of 12 
 
coincided with enrolment of participants into the CROWN CORONATION trial 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) – a study investigating the efficacy of the MMR vaccine to prevent 
symptomatic, PCR positive COVID -19. Subsequent to randomization to either MMR or 
placebo inj ection, a number of participants in the CROWN CORONATION trial were 
vaccinated with a SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccine .   
1.3 Objectives of the sub-study  
 
The goal of this sub -study is to characterize and compare, in those exposed to a) recent MMR 
vaccination followed by SARS -CoV-2 vaccination and b) recent placebo injection followed by 
SARS -CoV-2 vaccination,  
 
I) the in -vitro, cytokine  and chemokine  respons es (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, 
interleukin (IL) -1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL -17, IL -22, interferon (IFN) -α, and  IFN-γ) to heterologous 
stimuli.  
 
II) the SARS -CoV-2 neutraliz ation assay ( half-maximum effective concentration [EC50]; 
half-maximum inhibitory concentration [IC50] ).

2 STUDY METHODS  
 
2.1 Trial design  
 
This is  a sub -study within the CROWN CORONATION trial.  
 
At Washington University in St Louis, consenting participants are recruited into the sub -study. 
Additional blood sample s will be required from participants in the sub -study, to enable 
measurement of the outcomes of the sub -study. Apart from additional blood samples that 
will be collected from those in the sub -study, these participants will be treated the same as 
those taki ng part in the CROWN CORONATION trial .  
 
2.2 Framework  
 
CROWN CORONATION is a superiority trial . The aim is to demonstrate that the trial 
intervention(s)  is(are) effective at decreasing the incidence of symptomatic COVID -19 disease.  
 
In the sub -study, w e hypothesize that, compared to SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccination alone, 
MMR vaccination prior to SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccination will induce lasting trained immunity 
in reci pients, manifested by improved innate immune responses upon in vitro exposure of 
supernatants to heterologous pathogen products. We also hypothesize that MMR vaccination 
prior to SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccination does not alter the adaptive immune response to SA RS-
CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.  
 
2.3 Randomisation  
 
Sequence generation, allocation and implementation takes place within the CROWN 
CORONATION trial .  
 
2.4 Sample size  
 
All CROWN CORONATION participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be contacted for 
recruitment. We will enrol as many participants as possible into the sub -study. The eligible 
population size is 160.  
 
For the purpose of sample size calculation, we used the t -test to compare t he primary 
outcome  between treatment arms , i.e. the difference in cytokine and IFN -γ response between 
MMR and placebo groups. Table 1 reports power given the expected difference in IFN -γ 
responses, with a two -sided type -1 error rate of 5%.

2.5 Study outcomes  
 
i) Primary outcomes:  
a. PBMC cytokine production (TNF -α, IL -1β, IL -6, and IFN-α) 1 day  after stimulation  
with heterologous products (inactivated SARS -CoV-2, live attenuated MMR 
viruses, toll -like receptor (TLR) -3 ligand, TLR -7/8 ligand, TLR -4 ligand, and RPMI 
medium).  
b. IL-10, IL -17, IL -22, and IFN-γ production 5 days after stimulation of PBMCs with 
heterolog ous products.  
 
ii) Secondary outcomes:  
c. SARS -CoV-2 neutraliz ation  assay  (EC50 ; IC50) .  
d. Measles IgG antibody titres  
 
Timing: Blood  collected at a single sub -study visit around 6 to 9 weeks following the 
participant’s second SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccine injectio n.

3 STATISTICAL PRINCIPLES  
 
This sub -study is hypothesis generating. No adjustment will be made for multiple testing. All 
results comparing the treatment arms will be provided with 95% confidence interval (except 
if specified otherwise).  Analysis will be for complete cases ; no imput ation will be performed 
for missing data. Missing data will be summarised and reported with results.  
 
3.1 Analysis population  
 
All randomised participant data will be included in the Intention -To-Treat (ITT) analysis 
according to the arm they were randomised to, irrespective of the actual study drug that they 
took. This ITT analysis will be the main strategy for the sub-study (primary and secondary 
outcomes) .  
 
A modified ITT analysis will be performed at the end of the CROWN CORNATION trial , based 
on serology  results. Participants with evidence of COVID -19 infection at the start of the study 
will be removed from the analysis set.  It is anticipated that this sub -study will be completed 
and reported on prior to analysis of the main trial so that the modified ITT  analysis of the sub -
study data will be reported separately.  
 
3.2 Baseline patient characteristics  
 
Baseline characteristics will be summarised for all participants  in the sub-study. Summary 
measures for the baseline characteristics will be presented as mean and standard deviation 
for continuous (approximate) normally distributed variables, medians and interquartile 
ranges for non -normally distributed continuous variables, and f requencies and percentages 
for categorical variables. We will plot histograms of continuous variables to assess normality.  
 
3.3 Analysis methods  
 
The results of the analyses will be reported following the principle of the ICH E3 guidelines on 
the Structure an d Content of Clinical Study Reports5. There will be no imputations for missing 
data.  
 
Endpoints  will be summarised graphically with box -whisker -dot plots .  
3.3.1 Adjustment factors  
 
All models  for the primary outcomes  will be adjusted for sex and the calendar date of sample 
collection  (by quarter of the year) . Diagnostics for regression models will be assessed to 
ensure that underlying assumptions are met.   
 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed by individually adding adjustment for age, interval 
dura tion between last SARS -CoV-2 vaccine injection and blood draw, interval duration 
between MMR or placebo injection and blood draw, and interval duration between MMR or 
 
CROWN CORONATION  sub-study  SAP V1 .2 [21 Sep 2021], Page 10 of 12 
 
placebo injection and SARS -CoV-2 vaccination  (figure 1) . Outcomes will be plotted over time 
to assess the effect of the stated interval durations  (figure 1) on the measured outcomes.  
 
 
Figure  1: Interval durations in sub -study  
3.3.2 Primary endpoint s analysis  
 
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL -6, IL-10, IL -17, IL -22, IFN-α and IFN-γ will be analysed by line ar regression, with 
a coefficient for treatment arm, and adjusted for sex and the calendar date  (which quarter of 
the year)  of sample collection . The endpoints will be reported a s the adjusted mean (95% CI) 
effect of MMR pre -exposure on the endpoint . For each specified endpoint, the individual 
participant assay response to RPMI will be evaluated and if the response is greater that three 
times the lower detectable limit of the assay, the data from that participant will be excluded 
from analysi s for the specific endpoint. For example, if the IL -6 value is greater than three 
times the lower detectable limit  in response to RPMI , the participant’s data will be excluded 
from the analyses of IL -6 responses to the heterologous stimuli. The participant ’s data will 
still be used for the other endpoints in which the assay response to RPMI was less than three 
times the lower detectable limit.   
 
3.3.3 Secondary endpoints analysis  
 
SARS -CoV-2 neutraliz ation  assay (EC50 ; IC50)  and Measles IgG antibody titres will b e analysed 
by linear regression, with a coefficient for treatment arm , and adjusted for sex and the 
calendar date (which quarter of the year) of sample collection .

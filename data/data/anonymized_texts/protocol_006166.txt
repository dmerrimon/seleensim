Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 11 of 72 the study participants are screened. The result of the screening visit should be recorded in the screening log by the study delegated staff. See figure below with Screening log.   Study Treatment Description   In this clinical investigation, eligible study subjects will be randomized to either HB-adMSCs or placebo. Randomization process will be conducted during screening process by a designated study randomizer. See below the description of the study treatment.   HB-adMSCs Infusions   Study subjects must have banked their mesenchymal stem cells with Hope Biosciences to participate in this clinical trial. Study subjects who are randomly assigned during the screening process to the HB-adMSCs group will receive their own mesenchymal stem cells in each infusion with a dose of 200 million cells.   Study subjects, investigators and study staff will be blinded to the assigned treatment. To maintain the blinding of this investigation, amber plastic bags shall be used to cover treatment bags. Only subject identification number, patient initials, date of birth and the phrase: “Caution: New Drug Limited by Federal law to Investigational Use (required by 21 CFR 312.6) will be on the bag label, to ensure proper distribution.  Placebo Infusions   Study subjects who are randomly assigned during the screening process to the Placebo group will receive Saline Solution 0.9% in each infusion.    Study subjects, investigators and study staff will be blinded to the assigned treatment. To maintain the blinding of this investigation, amber plastic bags shall be used to cover treatment bags. Only subject identification number, patient initials, date of birth and the phrase: “Caution: New Drug Limited by Federal law to Investigational Use (required by 21 CFR 312.6) will be on the bag label, to ensure proper distribution.  Each study treatment will be provided by Hope Biosciences, LLC after all quality control essays have been performed and the results are within normal range.  
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 12 of 72 Treatment Regimen    Study subjects will receive the allocated treatment (HB-adMSCs or Placebo) through intravenous infusion only, with a treatment duration of 32 weeks, infusion rate 4-5ml/min and total volume of 250 ml Sodium chloride 0.9%. Each study participant will receive a total of 6 doses of HB-adMSCs or Placebo with a dosing regimen of approximately 4 to 8 weeks between infusions.    Study Treatment Storage, Preparation and Administration Instructions.   Each syringe with the study treatment (HB-adMSCs or Placebo) is individually packaged in a Styrofoam cooler with a temperature strip and icepacks. The product should not be stored since it is meant for immediate preparation and infusion. In the event of unanticipated delays, the product should be kept in a refrigerator (2° to 8°C) for a time not to exceed 96 hours. Do not freeze. Do not use any syringe or other infusion supplies beyond the expiration date.  The infusion should be prepared by a designated unblinded pharmacist using aseptic technique with the following procedures: (detailed instructions will be available in the Investigational Product Manual):   1. Gather all equipment and materials you need including cooler with HB-adMSCs or placebo.  2. Don non-sterile gloves and clean countertop where infusion is to be prepared using antibacterial wipes according to manufacturing instruction. 3. Remove and discard gloves, clean hands with hand sanitizer and allow to dry. 4. Don non-sterile gloves. 5. Open cooler and remove bag containing syringe with the study treatment.  6. Check the randomization procedure by checking the study subject's identification number and date of birth.  7. Visually confirm temperature tape is in biohazard bag and is within range (2° - 8° C), document compliance. 8. Visually confirm syringe is closed with cap. 9. Remove syringe from bag and begin mixing syringe, gently rocking back and as well as rolling between hands, bringing the study treatment to room temp, and suspending them into a homogenous solution.  No particulates should be visible.   10. Inject the contents into a 250cc bag of normal saline for injection 11. Properly label the infusion bag with the subject ID, D.O.B, preparation date, time and expiration and cover it with an amber bag.   Once, the study treatment has been mixed by the unblinded pharmacist following the above procedures, the infusion nurse or designated study staff will administer the study treatment as follows:  
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 13 of 72  1. Confirm that the subject number and DOB placed on the amber bag label belong to the subject receiving the infusion.  2. Administer the infusion solution over a period of 1h (infusion rate 4-5ml/min).  3. Do not store or reuse any unused portion of the infusion solution. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed in a biohazard container.  4. Complete the source documents of the visit to accurately collect the start and end times of the infusion and add comments if necessary.  5. The study’s subject will be monitored for a total of 2 hours from drug exposure to discharge.  - During the Investigational product administration (1 hour) vital signs will be measured at minute 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60.  - Post infusion, vital signs will be measured at minute 90 and 120.   6. Follow study procedures as described in the schedule of assessments of the visit.   Investigational Product Assignment (Randomization and Blinding)  A total of 24 eligible subjects will be randomized to either placebo (approx. 12) or active drug (approx.12) (HB-adMSCs) in a 1:1 balanced design. The randomization will be applicable only to eligible subjects. If a subject is not eligible during the screening process for study participation, this subject shall not me randomized to any group.   Randomization will be conducted using the REDCap randomization module. REDCap does not use an algorithm to dynamically randomize subjects, but rather a pre-determined, stratified, and permutated randomization schedule. The module allows for creating a custom allocation list, which serves as a lookup table for deciding how to randomize subjects. The allocation table is stratified to achieve even study treatment distribution within the following subgroups. Raw coded values corresponding to the table are in parenthesis following their representative category.  • Multiple’s sclerosis severity (Mild vs Moderate):   o Mild disability (1) (EDSS < 4) o Moderate disability (2) (EDSS > 4 and < 6.5)   • Age:    < 55 (1) vs > 55 (2) • Gender: Female (1) or Male (2)   
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 14 of 72 1:1 Drug to Control Group Distribution Rule  The allocation table is structured so that there is 1 to 1 respective distribution between drug and control groups.   Modifications to Allocation   There are more permutations assignments created in the allocation table, than the 24 required to accommodate multiple subgroups and support possible drop-out scenarios. Once the randomization model is defined in REDCap, the allocation table will become locked and unmodifiable. If more allocations are necessary, REDCap has the capability to ONLY append to the existing allocation table and not replace it.  Controlling Blinded Information  REDCap system’s user privileges can be used to allow only certain users to be able to set up the randomization, perform the randomization, or view the allocation information. All REDCap end users will be blinded and will not have access to the randomization information with exception to the unblinded pharmacist and the personnel who will be responsible in setting up the randomization schedule and performing the randomization.   Blinding for Dose Administration  All subjects, investigators, and site staff will be blinded to treatment assigned.  Amber plastic bags shall be used to cover sodium chloride (saline) bags with the product under investigation for infusion. Only subject identification number and date of birth will be on the bag label, to ensure proper distribution.   For the preparation of the investigational product, Unblinded pharmacist (UP) will inject the investigational product into a 250 ml sodium chloride (Saline) infusion bag, cover it with an amber plastic bag and apply the label before delivering it to study site.   Unblinded pharmacist, also identified as Mixer, will keep records of the treatment assigned to each subject in the unblinded pharmacy binder. Access to this pharmacist binder will be limited to the unblinded pharmacist.   Blinding for Clinical Evaluators  To minimize assessment bias, clinical evaluators (data analysts and physicians) will be trained on how to maintain blinding to treatment as best as possible. “Best as possible” means that blinding 
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 15 of 72 will be maintained unless an adverse event or serious adverse events occurs that requires unblinding the physician, which is determined by the medical monitor or DSMB.   Training includes review of the process of blinding, describing who will be responsible for assigning product for the appropriate group, labels that will be used to identify subjects but not treatment group, and the process that should be followed if an adverse event occurs, triggering review by medical monitor and/or DSMB.  Prior and Concomitant Medications          Concurrent and prior medications (up to one week before the screening visit) should be recorded in the subject’s medical history at the screening visit. This list of concomitant medications may be updated, if necessary, at the following visits.   It is important to ask the subject about the start and end date of the current and prior medications, if the subject does not remember the specific date or month, it is recommended to include the approximate year to give an estimate of how long the patient has been taking the medication.  Trial Procedures     The trial includes an up to 28 days screening period, a 32-week Treatment Period and a 20-week Safety Follow-up Period. All periods are associated with evaluations and procedure that must be performed at specific time points as represented in Table 4 Schedule of Assessments.

Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 20 of 72 The Investigator may at his/her discretion arrange for a study participant to have an unscheduled visit (UNS). Some of the circumstances by which a study participant will be called for a UNS visit are:    • Adverse events (AEs) that require follow-up.  • Collection of laboratory samples for safety reasons.  • Procedures missed at previous study visits.    All unscheduled visits should be documented in the study’s participant source.   Trial Assessments   Assessments Related to Endpoints    Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of patients with MS.  The scale was developed by a neurologist called John Kurtzke in 1983 as an advance from his previous 10 step Disability Status Scale (DSS).  The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5-unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist.  EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with MS who can walk without any aid and is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems (FS):  • pyramidal – muscle weakness or difficulty moving limbs • cerebellar – ataxia, loss of balance, coordination, or tremor • brainstem – problems with speech, swallowing and nystagmus • sensory – numbness or loss of sensations • bowel and bladder function • visual function - problems with sight • cerebral functions - problems with thinking and memory • other  
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 21 of 72 A functional system (FS) represents a network of neurons in the brain with responsibility for tasks. Each FS is scored on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 (more severe disability).   EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to walking. The scale is sometimes criticized for its reliance on walking as the main measure of disability.  Although the scale takes account of the disability associated with advanced MS, most people will never reach these scores. A large study that looked at people with MS at a clinic in Ontario (prior to the development of the expanded version) found that 51% of people had a DSS score of 5 or lower. 88% had a score of 7 or lower (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2020).  Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54 Instrument.   The MSQOL-54 is a comprehensive health-related quality of life measure incorporating general and MS-specific questions into a single instrument. The developers used the SF-36 as a base and added 18 questions to address MS-specific problems, including fatigue and cognitive function. This 54-item questionnaire provides 12 subscales, two summary scores, and two extra single-item measures. The subscales are physical function, role limits-physical, emotional role restrictions, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social position, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 2021).   The Barthel Index   When it comes to patients with chronic, debilitating illnesses, the Barthel index is an ordinal scale that evaluates functional independence in the domains of personal care and mobility. A total of ten variables describing activities of daily living and mobility are considered, with a higher number reflecting better capacity to operate independently. The Barthel Index assesses the level of help needed by a person on a set of ten activities of daily living (ADL) related to mobility and self-care (Elite Learning, 2008).  9-Hole Peg test   The 9-HPT is a short, standardized upper extremity exam. In MS research, gait analysis has been given precedence over arm and hand function analysis. In recent years, clinical investigations have increasingly recognized the value of assessing arm and hand function, particularly in severely disabled patients. The 9-HPT has recently become one of the most widely utilized upper extremity measurements in MS. Many qualified examiners can administer the 9-HPT since it is short and standardized. (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 2021).   PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)  Suicide prevention programs may also have a clinical component, which refers to how individuals are evaluated and treated for mental health problems or suicidal thoughts in medical facilities. The PHQ-9 is the most used depression and suicidal thoughts screening test. Other

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 22 of 72 screening methods exist, although some are tailored to certain populations or situations. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic tool for common mental illnesses (Kroenke, 2001).   Physical Examinations   A complete physical examination will be performed by the principal investigator or delegated sub-investigator, including general appearance, head, eyes, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT), neck, cardiovascular, thorax/lungs, abdomen, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, lymph nodes, skin, neurological and mental status examination, height (at Screening only), and body weight at Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.   The principal investigator or delegated sub-investigator will evaluate the clinical significance of abnormal findings identified during physical examinations. Pre-existing conditions diagnosed through assessments and examinations at the screening visit or during the screening period are not adverse events but are recorded as medical history. If any clinically significant abnormal findings are discovered after informed consent or any pre-existing conditions worsen during the trial, these must be recorded as adverse events.  Vital Signs    Vital signs will be measured at Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and will include respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure (measured after the study participant has been in a seated position for more than 5 minutes of rest), body temperature and oxygen saturation. Clinical significance of any abnormal result must be evaluated by principal investigator. Clinically significant abnormal findings will be reported as adverse events.

Adverse Events    Definitions  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all the following criteria:   
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 26 of 72 • Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e., not described in study-related documents such as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.)  • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e., possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research.   • Serious (as defined below) “Serious” is different than “severe” as reported in the CTC criteria that applies a grade to the AE.  Adverse Event  An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness, or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are adverse events if the abnormality:  • results in study withdrawal • is associated with a serious adverse event • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms • leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests • is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  Serious Adverse Event  Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  • fatal • life-threatening • requires or prolongs hospital stay • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • a congenital anomaly or birth defect • an important medical event  Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be considered serious.   
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 27 of 72 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events.   Adverse Event Reporting Period  The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  For this study, the study treatment follow-up is defined as approximately 20 weeks following the last administration of study treatment.   Recording of Adverse Events   At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source documents and CRF and in the appropriate adverse event section of the source documents.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document and CRF, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems.   Investigator and the Sponsor must follow reporting timelines if any Serious Adverse Event of Unanticipated Problem occurs to the subject. Also, if any of them have the following criteria, it must be reported in a timely manner:   • related to study participation • unexpected  • serious or involve risks to subjects or others   This report should include the minimum necessay information provided in the following table:   Stopping Rules    
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 28 of 72 Infusion Stopping Rules   Study treatment infusion will be stopped if a least one of the following events occur:   1. Allergic reaction as evidenced by severe dyspnea (defined as intense tightening of chest, air hunger, breathlessness or feeling of suffocation), bronchospasm (defined as coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing) or hypoxia (defined as pulse oximeter reading of less than 90%) after the product has been administered intravenously.   2. Patient verbally decline the treatment at any moment prior, or during the infusion.    3. Hyperpyrexia develops after infusion administration begins (core body temperature greater than or equal to 104°F).   4. Principal Investigator may stop the infusion at any time, based upon PI’s discretion.    5. Malignant Hypertension (180/120 mm/Hg)  6. Sudden Severe Hypotension (30-40 mm/Hg drop from pre-infusion level)  If an infusion is stopped for a subject due to an adverse event or serious adverse event, including but not limited to hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis, no additional study treatment will be given to the study participant who develops the event. Although, the study participant will not receive the investigational product, he or she must be followed for safety purposes according to the protocol.   Study Stopping Rules   This Clinical Trial will stop if any of the following events are present:   1. Subject’s Death.   2. Occurrence of any thromboembolic event during or after HB-adMSCs administrations (up to 72 hours).   3. Any cerebrovascular ischemia or seizure event occurring within 72 hours after any of the investigational product administrations.   4. Any Serious Adverse Events determined to be related to the following:

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 29 of 72 - When there is one CTCAE.v5 grade 4 or 5 AE, irrespective of attribution.  - Either any CTCAE Grade 2 adverse event that persists for more than two weeks, or any Grade 3 adverse event, that occurs within 72 hours after product administration.  Should the study participant discontinue study treatment he/she will be followed for safety according to the protocol safety monitoring plan. The study participant will receive follow up communication via phone calls and/or electronically to ascertain the outcome until resolved fully. All will be documented as per protocol.  All changes to the study stopping rules shall be reviewed by FDA.  If the study is suspended for any reason, it will not be re-opened until FDA agrees.  Regardless of whether the study is stopped or suspended all subjects will be followed to the EOS as per protocol.  Statistical Methods     Sample size consists of up to 24 subjects who have been diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. All data collected from subjects who are enrolled and received the investigational product will be analyzed. The incidence of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be recorded and reported. Efficacy will be measured by improvement of subject’s signs and symptoms associated with Multiple Sclerosis. Interim analysis of all safety and efficacy data may be performed at any time deemed appropriate by the Sponsor. Although, the subject’s data may be analyzed at any time, a data analysis of all available data will be conducted when a least 10 subjects in each group have completed Week 24. Data may be analyzed for internal informational purposes, reports, presentations, and manuscripts.    A repeat measure mixed model will be used to assess within-subject changes from baseline. correction for multiple comparisons will be employed for post-hoc comparisons. Multiple Sclerosis’s assessment scores (i.e., MSQOL) at screening and infusion 1 (before treatment) will be averaged and treated as a baseline. Averaging is performed to minimize sources of variance (i.e., patient condition, assessors) and particularly to establish a reliable baseline from which to establish changes.

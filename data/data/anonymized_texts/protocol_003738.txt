CooperVision is evaluating the clinical performance of  riofilcon A  lens (test) compared to 
Alcon Focus Dailies All Day Comfort lens (control) when worn on a daily wear, daily disposable 
modality in a randomized, bilateral crossover  dispensing  study.  
2 Study Objective 
This  pilot study seeks  to compare  the performance of  design lenses against Alcon Focus 
Dailies All Day Comfort l enses and will be used to provide additional performance in formation to 
add business confidence prior to  a larger post market study.  
The primary  variables of interest are: 
•Lens fit acceptability
Additional variables are:  
•L

2.1 Study Hypothesis 
The study hypothesis is  that there will be no difference in clinical performance between the  
test lens and the Alcon Focus Dailies control.  
3 Study Design 
This will be a double- masked,  randomized,  bilateral , 1-week crossover, di spensing  study, 
comparing the  test  lens against   Focus Dailies All Day Comfort control lens , such that 
each lens type will be worn for a week each.  Each subject will be randomized to wear either the 
test lens es or the control lenses as a matched pair, according to a predetermined randomization

•ISO 14155 Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects
•ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice
•Declaration of Helsinki
4.2 Institutional Review Board 
This study will be conducted in accordance with Institutional Review Board regulations (U.S. 
21CFR Part 56.103) or applicable IEC regulations. Copies of all IRB/IEC correspondence with the investigator/sponsor will be kept on file. 
The conduct of thi
s study will be approved by Sterling  Institutional Review Board. Approval  will be

Protocol V
ersion 1.1: CV -17-29 v 3.1: 27-Mar -17 6 6 Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
There might not be direct benefits to the subjects in this study. However, participation in a study 
may contribute to scientific research information that may be used in the development of new contact lens products. In addition, subjects will receive an examination of the front part of their eyes and may have the opportunity to try a different type of soft contact lenses and/or different lens care products at no cost to them.  
This study is considered to be a non- significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
admini stration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines due to the daily 
wear nature of the study.  The risks to the subjects are also reduced based on the results of previous cytoxicity testing.  
Complicati
ons that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses include discomfort, dryness, 
aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision. More serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens- related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does exist.  The incidence of 
infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection will occur only in one 
eye.  This risk is assumed by 35- million Americans who currently wear  contact lenses.  
Routine clini
cal procedures including auto -refraction, auto -keratometry, visual acuity, anterior 
ocular health assessment, and contact lens fitting will be used. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 mm or digital  cameras, in vivo confocal microscopy, 
and/or specular microscopy.  
7 Materials and Methods  
7.1 Participants 
Up to 45 subjects will be enrolled and dispensed in order for approximately 40 s ubjects to

Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind study of ascending single doses of CD388 
Injection administered SQ to healthy Japanese adult subjects. The goals are to assess safety, tolerability, and PK 
of CD388.  
Subjects will be randomized to recei ve a single dose of CD388 or placeb o administered via SQ injection 
(treatment assignment is blinded) according to the design in the table below.  
Number of Subjects (N = 27) 
Cohort: dose CD388 
(n = 21) Placebo 
(n = 6) 
Cohort 1: 50 mg 7 2 
Cohort 2: 150 mg 7 2 
Cohort 3: 450 mg 7 2 
Note: A subject may not receive treatment in more than one cohort.  
After 50% of Cohort 1 subjects have completed study drug  administration and have undergone protocol-specified 
procedures and DVVHVVPHQWVIRU 10 days, the Principal Investigator (PI) and Sponsor will review blinded safety 
data: AEs (including systemic reactoge nicity/injection site reactions, hype rsensitivity reactions, and adverse 
events of special interest [AESIs]), vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory results (hematology, 
coagulation, serum chemistry, urinalys is) to determine the safety and tolera bility of the study drug. The incidence 
and severity of AEs, and any adverse changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECGs will be 
considered when determining safety and tolerability of study drug. If the dose is determined to be safe and well WROHUDWHG 10 days after dosing, Cohort 2 will be enrolled. Enrollment of the remain ing 50% of Cohort 1 will 
continue while the safety data of the first 50% of Cohort 1 is being reviewed. Similar processes will be followed for dose escalation from Cohort 2 to Cohort 3. 
The Schedule of Events is presented in  Table 1 . All subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) 
for observation and safety assessments from Day -1 (check-in) to Day 14. Subjects will be monitored for AEs 
(including systemic reactogenicity/injection site reac tions, hypersensitivity reactions and AESIs) and SAEs 
throughout the study until the final study visit after dosing.  Safety will also be asse ssed by physical examinations, 
ECGs, vital signs measurements, and laboratory evaluations (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, 
urinalysis) at various time points during and after the CRU stay. Concomitant medication use will be recorded throughout the study.  
Blood samples for PK and ADA assessments will be collect ed throughout the study. To maintain the blind, 
samples will be collected from all subjects; however, only samples from  the CD388 Injection group will be 
analyzed (using validated assays) by an unblinded central bioanalytical laboratory. Additional blood samples will 
be collected for pharmacogenomics and exploratory biomarker evaluation.

Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 5 of 74 Respiratory tract infection (RTI) su rveillance will be conducted during th e outpatient phase of the study from 
CRU discharge through the Day 120/165 outpatient visit or a lab-confirmed influenza infection, whichever occurs 
first. Subjects will be provided nasal/throat swab kits (for detection of influenza infection or other respiratory 
pathogen by a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test) and symptom diary cards.  
If 3 or more RTI symptoms listed in the table below  occur (at least one must be a respiratory symptom), subjects 
will contact study staff, then collect nasal/throat swab sa mples (the swabs should take  place as soon as possible 
after the start of symptoms, ideally w ithin 48 hours, but no later than 5 da ys). Subjects will complete symptom 
diary cards every 7 days to capture the worst grade of symptoms that occurred during the previous week. The Investigator/study staff will arrange for prompt shipment of the nasal/throat samples to the testing laboratory. 
Note: If the reported symptoms are already of a level of severity that urgent care is indicated, the subject should be directed to the appropriate facility  to receive this care (e.g., emergency room). Otherwise, symptoms should be 
treated according to standard of care. 
If an influenza infection is confirmed by the testing laboratory before the Day 120/165 outpatient visit, the event 
should be documented until all symptoms have resolved, including completion of the symptom diary card every 
7 days. Thereafter, no further RTI surveillance will be carried out on the subject.  
If the nasal/throat swab samples are not confirmed to be influenza by the testing laboratory, diary card 
completion will continue through the Day 120/165 outpatient visit.  
Respiratory Tract Infection (RTI) Symptoms  
x Runny nose (rhinorrhea) x Shortness of breath (dyspnea) 
x Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) x Wheeze 
x Sore throat x Chilliness/feverishness or temperature °F 
x Earache x Headache 
x Cough x Body ache 
x Productive phlegm/sputum  
As part of the surveillance, subjects will be questioned during all outpatient site visits for RTI symptoms. If the 
interval to the next outpatient site  visit exceeds 15 days, subjects will be contacted by the Investigator/study staff 
every 2 weeks to query for RTI symptoms. Subjects should be reminded to contact the Investigator/study staff if 
RTI symptoms occur, and to collect the nasal/throat swab samples and complete the symptom diary cards every 7 days. 
Number of Subjects  
A total of 27 subjects will be enrolled in this study;  21 to receive CD388 Injection and 6 to receive placebo.

Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration  
CD388 Injection is a clear to lightly opalescent liquid essentially free of particulate matter containing the active 
pharmaceutical ingredient, CD388. CD388 Injection is supplied as a frozen st erile solution in single-use vials. 
CD388 Injection is administered by subcutaneous (SQ) injection at 50 mg, 150 mg, or 450 mg (Cohort 1,  Cohort 
2, or Cohort 3, respectively). Dose levels to be assessed will follow an ascending single-dose regimen with the 
starting dose based on findings from 3-month rat and monkey toxicology studies. 
Comparator 
Normal saline will be administered SQ as the placebo control.  
Duration of Treatment 
A single dose of study drug will be administered SQ on Day 1. Study participation will require up to 28 days for 
screening procedures, and ~120/165 days for dosing and follow-up (check-in to the CRU on Day -1; CRU 
inpatient stay for study drug administration, observation, and assessments and procedures for 15 days [Days -1 
to Day 14]; and 5 CRU outpatient visits for additional assessments and procedures). 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 8 of 74 Criteria for Evaluation 
Safety and Tolerability of Study Drug Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs (including systemic reactogenicity/injection site 
reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and AESIs), vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory results 
(hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, urinalysis), and concomitant medication usage throughout the study.  
See the Study Design section for details regarding cohort/dose level enrollment timing and assessment of safety 
and tolerability for dose escalation decision. 
If a dose level is considered not safe or well tolerated, the study drug assignment for the subject(s) with the safety 
issue may be unblinded. The Sponsor may also independently decide to unblind the entire cohort for safety 
concerns or terminate enrollment for any reason. 
,IDQ\VXEMHFWGHYHORSVD*UDGH$( or an SAE of any grade that is deemed related to the study drug, the 
mechanism of the AE may be assessed (i.e., cytokine level, complement activation, immunoglobulin G [IgG] 
subtypes, immunoglobulin E [IgE], T-cell/B-cell/mo nocyte and basophil activation as assessed by flow 
cytometry, ADA development, and immune complex formation) at Sponsor and Investigator discretion, and the 
study dose may be modified for the remainder of the study. 
Pharmacokinetics/Anti-drug Antibodies 
Pharmacokinetics will be determined by analyzing plasma samples for concentration of CD388 obtained from 
subjects who receive CD388 Injection in  each cohort at various time points after administration of study drug. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) will also be measured at selected time points by a validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. 
Pharmacogenomics  
A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample will be collected once, preferably on Day 1 (collection at 
another time point is permitted if necessary) to allow for genetic research to help understand the characteristics 
of CD388. Genetic analysis will be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help explore genetic markers that 
could explain differences in safety , immunogenicity, or clinical respons e among subjects. Host DNA assessment 
will be limited to research related to CD388, including  the development of tests/assays related to CD388 
and flu-like disease. 
Analyses of host DNA may be conducted at the Sponsor’s  discretion and reported separately from the study 
report. 
Exploratory Biomarkers  
Blood samples will be collected to allow for the exploration of biomarkers on the assumption that these markers 
could play a role in the response (safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity) to CD388. 
These samples and remaining material from other samples may be used for further assay optimization/
qualification, biomarkers, or further exploratory analyses. Samples will only be used for research related to influenza virus infection, flu-like disease, and safety , reactogenicity, and immunoge nicity of CD388, including 
the development of tests/assays related to CD388 and influenza. 
Analyses of biomarkers may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately from the study 
report. 
Withdrawal from Study  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
x Subject is unable or unwilling to continue 
x Subject elects to withdr aw informed consent 
x Adverse event (whether or not related to study drug) that precludes further participation in the study in 
the judgment of an Investigator and/or Sponsor 
x Protocol non-compliance 
x Subject lost to follow-up, or follow-up is not possible 
x The Investigator considers that it is in the subject’s best interest not to continue participation in the study 
If a subject is removed from the study for any reason, the subject will be followed for resolution of any ongoing 
AE(s).

If it is considered appropriate to restart the study following an internal safety review, an amendment, if required, 
will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institu tional Review Board (IRB). The study 
will not restart until the amendment has been approved by the FDA and IRB.  
Statistical Methods  
Safety, tolerability, and PK will be summarized using descriptive statistics. There will be no formal hypothesis 
testing. Analysis populations are: 
x Safety Population: all subjects who receive any amount of study drug 
x PK Analysis Population: all subj ects who receive CD388 Injection and who have any blood samples 
analyzed 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before unblinding for the first interim analysis. 
Any deviations from the final SAP will be described and justified in the study report. All statistical analyses will 
be performed using SAS®. 
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percenta ges for categorical variable s, and the numbers, means, 
standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables, will be provided. All data will 
be summarized separately by dose level and study drug (CD388 Injection or placebo). Listings of individual 
subject data will also be produced.  
Safety will be evaluated by presenting summaries of AEs and SAEs, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, urinalysis), and vital signs. Adverse events will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of TEAEs and AESIs will be presented 
by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT), relationship to study drug, and severity. A TEAE is 
defined as an AE that emerges during or after study drug administration having been absent pre-treatment, or 
worsens relative to the pre-tr eatment state, and through the final study visi t. In addition, the incidence of serious 
TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug or from the study will be presented by SOC and PT. Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory test re sults, ECG parameters, and vital signs, and for changes from 
Baseline, will be presented by time point. The incidences  of potentially clinically significant (PCS) clinical 
laboratory results, ECG parameters, and vital signs will also be summarized by time point.  
A summary of the injection site evaluation will be presented. The number and percentage of subjects with any 
local reaction will be provided, as will the number and percentage of subjects with pain, tenderness, 
erythema/redness, and induration/swelling. The severity of each local reaction will also be presented. 
The number and percentage of subjects with any RTI will be provided. The PK parameters that will be assessed in the PK Analysis Population include: 
x maximum plasma concentration (C
max) 
x time to maximum plasma concentration (T max) 
x terminal elimination half-life (t ½) 
x apparent clearance (CL/F) 
x apparent volume of distribution (V Z/F)  
x area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to time of last quantifiable sample (AUC 0-last) 
x area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-)  
Analysis of the ADA results is to be determined and may include determination of the subject’s positive/negative 
ADA status at baseline, treatment-emergent ADA in subjects with a negative baseline, as well as a post-baseline 
increase in titer for subjects with positive ADA at baseline.

Schedule of Events (continued)  
a. The timing of this visit is Day 120 for Cohort 1 and Day 165 for Cohorts 2 and 3. For subjects who discontinue study early, the  Day 120/165 procedures 
should be performed. 
b. Weight should be measured at each of the outpatient visits (Days 30, 45, 60, 90, 120/165). 
c. On Day 1, the targeted physical examination should be performed predose. Vital signs collection will occur predose, 6 hours pos tdose, and as clinically 
indicated, and will be measured with the subject in a seat ed position for at least 3 minutes prior to measurement.  
d. A triplicate 12-lead ECG is to be performed at screening, at CRU check-in on Day -1, predose (immediately prior to study drug a dministration) and 6 hours 
postdose (±10 minutes) on Day 1, and as indicated in the schedule. Subjects are to be resting (at least 5 minutes) and semi-recumbent when ECG is being 
conducted. 
e. Laboratory evaluations (including exploratory biomarker samples) need to be performed once during the Day 3–6 interval on Day 4 . 
f. $VHQVLWLYHVHUXPSUHJQDQF\WHVWȕဩKXPDQFKRULRQLFJR nadotropin) is required at screening and Day 120/165 for females of childbearing potential. Urine 
pregnancy test may be performed at all other time points. 
g. Drug and alcohol screen is to be performed during the outpatient visits if vital signs are abnormal (see Appendix 2). 
h. At indicated visits, inspection of administration site and surrounding area will be  performed twice daily (once between approxi mately 2–4 hours postdose, 
and once approximately 8–12 hours postdose, then twice daily on other indicated study days at least 6 hours apart), with any ab normal findings reported as 
AEs. Reactions will be rated according to the scale provided in Table 5 . 
i. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected predose (-24 hour window); post-dose at 2, 4, and 12 hours (each ±10 minute win dow); 24 hours (±30 minute 
window); 48 hours (±1 hour window); 72, 96, 120 hours (each ±2 hour window); and in the morning on Days 7, 9, 11, 14. Postdose samples collected at 
outpatient CRU visits at Days 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120/165 have the same windows (i.e., in ±days) as the visits.  
j. A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample will be collected once, preferably on Day 1 (co llection at another time point is  allowed if necessary) to 
allow for pharmacogenomic research related to CD388. 
k. Nasopharyngeal swab samples will be collected predose on Day 1, and on Days 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 30. 
l. Adverse events (including influenza-like illness which will be test ed for both COVID-19 and flu) will be collected for all subj ects from the time of signing 
the ICF through the final study visit. 
m. Concomitant medication and procedures, including those used to treat an AE, will be recorded from 28 days prior to the CD388 In jection/placebo 
administration until the final study visit.

4.1. Background 
4.1.1. Influenza – Prevention and Treatment 
Globally, millions are hospitalized each year and about 650,000 deaths occur due to influenza 
(Iuliano 2018 ). In the United States (US), an estima ted 37–43 million influenza- related illnesses, 
17–  20 million influenza-related medical visits, 500,000 to 650,000 influenza-related 
hospitalizations, and 61,000 deaths occu rred during the 2018–2019 influenza season 
(Brammer 2019 ). These numbers remain high year afte r year because currently no effective 
medicine is available for th e prevention of influenza. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) recommends the administration of 
an influenza vaccine yearly for the prevention of in fluenza, but the efficacy varies yearly due to 
the emergence of new strains. According to the CDC, during the 2018–2019 influenza season, 
the vaccine was only 29% effective ( Flannery 2019 ). Vaccines cannot offer complete protection 
because of high genetic diversity  between and within influen za A and B types. Additionally, 
rapid antigenic drift and antigen ic shift in the virus erodes vaccine durability (necessitating 
development of new vaccines annually), and slow vaccine manufac turing cycles make it difficult 
to keep pace with constantly mutating seasonal and pandemic  viral strains. 
The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oral oseltamivir and inhaled zana mivir are approved for 
prophylaxis and treatment of acute  uncomplicated influenza. Use of NAI antiviral prophylaxis is 
recommended to control instituti onal outbreaks of influenza when used within 48 hours after 
exposure in individuals who are not vaccinated  or who are unlikely to respond to influenza 
vaccines and are immunosuppressed or have co-mor bidities that predispose them to severe 
influenza illness. However, when NAIs are us ed for prophylaxis, even when used promptly 
after a known exposure, the efficacy is  only around 70–80% and prolonged use in 
immunocompromised individuals can lead to  the emergence of NAI drug resistance 
(Okoli 2014 ). 
Over the past 20 years there has been increasi ng concern that highly pathogenic avian strains 
such as H7N9 and H7N7 can be transmitted to humans causing high fatality rates in a manner similar to that of the H5N1 pandemic strain in 1997. Although the transmission of these avian 
strains to humans has been largely limited to individuals exposed to poultry, the possibility of 
the emergence of a highly pathogenic and human -adapted influenza variant is concerning 
(Paules 2017). Furthermore, recent modeling predicts that, in the event of a pandemic event 
along the lines of the 1918 Spanish flu, 33 million people would die in the first 6 months before a vaccine could be developed and many millions more would die during the time it would take for the global population to be immunized ( Abbasi 2019 ). 
Progress towards a medicinal agent that provides protection agains t a broad range of influenza 
strains with a longer duration of  protection, otherwise known as a “universal vaccine”, has been 
disappointing. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics developed to date have suffered 
from limited spectrum and commercial limitations due to high dosing requirements and/or the need for multiple antibody cocktails to achie ve a desired spectrum and efficacy. Thus, 
a significant unmet need exists for long-acting universal protective agents.

CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 22 of 74 4.1.2. CD388 – A Long-Acting Antiviral Fc-Conjugate 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Cidara) is developing a novel therapeutic and prophylactic agent that 
has a potential to provide durable single-dose “ universal” coverage per flu season. Cidara has 
replaced variable domains of a monoclonal an tibody with multiple copies of a highly potent 
small molecule antiviral agent (the marketed NAI zanamivir) tailored to target a small, highly 
conserved essential influenza target. This mo lecule, CD388, is a first in class long-acting 
antiviral Fc-conjugate (AVC) combining a surface-acting antiviral agent with the crystallizable 
fragment (Fc) of a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody. 
CD388 differs from traditional antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) molecules in the following 
aspects: 
x In traditional antibody-drug conjugates the dr ug is attached to full length human IgG 
(Fc + antigen-binding fragment [Fab]); in contrast, zanamivir dimers of CD388 are 
conjugated to an Fc fragment of human IgG1 (and not full length IgG1). 
x In traditional antibody-drug conjugates the dr ug is conjugated to the human IgG using 
a protease-cleavable linker to allow release of the drug inside target cells; the linker between zanamivir and the Fc in CD388 is not a substrate for proteases, and it exerts its 
antiviral activity in the extracellular space. 
x Traditional antibody-drug conjugates are used to treat cancer by delivering cytotoxic 
payloads to target cells with rapid rel ease; CD388 is designed to treat and prevent 
infectious disease using a l ong-acting stable conjugate of a non-cytotoxic small molecule 
to an Fc fragment of IgG1 
In nonclinical in vitro and in vivo models, CD388 has demonstrated the potential for significantly higher antiviral activity and efficacy compared to the parent molecule, zanamivir, as well as other NAIs, including oseltamivir. 
4.1.2.1. CD388 Nonclinical Studies 
Several in vitro and in vivo nonc linical studies have been conduc ted to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of CD388 and/or related Fc-conjuga ted prototype targeting molecules (TMs) to 
support dosing in humans. In vitro NAI and cell- based assays were conducted with CD388 to 
assess its spectrum and potency ag ainst Wild Type (WT) as well as drug-resistant influenza 
strains. In vitro studies to characterize the ex tent of neonatal crystalli zable fragment receptor 
(FcRn) and Fc- Ȗ receptor binding across different species  were conducted. In vitro studies to 
characterize the potential for resistance devel opment with CD388 have be en undertaken. In vivo 
efficacy of CD388 was observed in treatment, and prophylaxis or preventative mouse lethal 
infection models.

More importantly, following pharm acokinetic studies in the mouse, rat, and monkey, plasma 
concentrations were quantified by a neuraminidase (NA)-capture or Fc-capture with Fc detection

vivo. NA-capture/Fc-detection measures the concentration of intact NA-linked-Fc species while 
Fc-capture/Fc-detection measures the total concentration of Fc-related species. Plasma concentrations measured by both methods were  comparable, suggesting that intact CD388 
remained stable in vivo as designed. 
Single-dose, range-finding intramuscular (IM)  and/or subcutaneous (SQ) toxicity 
and toxicokinetic studies, with endpoint evaluations occurring over the plasma exposure 
periods of 4 weeks in rats and 6 weeks in monkeys, have been conducted. The pivotal Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies in clude endpoints to assess safety pharmacology 
(i.e., cardiovascular, respirator y, and neurobehavioral effects) and toxicokinetic s to determine 
safety margins. In addition, screening fo r anti-CD388 antibodies, cytokine analysis, 
and immunophenotyping have been performed. These pivotal GLP nonclinical studies 
supporting first-in-human (FIH) studies were designed in acco rdance with the relevant 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidance and US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) guidance on safety and toxicology studies  for CD388’s predecessor molecule (CD377). 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional nonclinical information. 
4.1.2.2. CD388 Clinical Studies 
In an ongoing study (CD388.IM.SQ.1.01), the safe ty and tolerability of CD388 is being 
evaluated in Western healthy adult subj ects, examining CD388 administered either 
intramuscularly or subcutaneously.  
Regular assessment of blinded safety/tolerability data from 33 healthy subjects who received 
a dose of 50 mg, 150 mg, or 450 mg of subcutan eous CD388 or placebo has not identified any 
concerning safety observations to date. 
All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) have been Grade 1 or Grade 2 (mild or 
moderate) in severity, with headache being the most frequently occurring (27.3% subjects), none 
of which occurred in the higher dose group (150 mg) as of the first Interim Analysis in the FIH 
study. Since then, preliminary safety data generated from the 450 mg dose group indicated that the safety and tolerability profile remained unchanged. 
Of note, as of the first interim analysis in the FIH study, all TEAEs in the higher dose group (150 
mg) have been Grade 1. No serious adverse even ts (SAEs) have occurred, and no drug-related 
TEAEs have resulted in clinically significant hematology or chemistry laboratory abnormalities. 
No safety issues associated w ith electrocardiograms (ECGs), vita l signs, or physical examination 
findings (including local injection site reactions) have been iden tified. No safety findings have 
resulted in discontinuation or study drug or withdrawal from study. Preliminary safety data 
generated from the 450 mg dose group indicated that the safety and tolerability profile remained 
unchanged. 
4.2. Summary of Benefits and Risks 
A brief summary of clinical and nonclinical data is presented in Section 4.1.2. 
The risks for the individual subj ect due to administration of CD 388 Injection are considered low 
and are outweighed by the potential to develop a ne w treatment in an area of high unmet medical 
need. To further minimize any potential risk, all subjects will be closely screened for any 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 24 of 74 underlying conditions that may increase risk of study participation. During the conduct of the 
study, subjects are housed in a clinical re search unit (CRU) for 14 days after CD388 
Injection/placebo administration, under continuous medical supervision.  
4.3. Justification of Dose 
The dose(s) planned for this study are based on results obtained from the FIH clinical study, GLP 
3-month exposure toxicology studies  in rats and primate s, and the FDA’s guidance contained in 
“Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult 
Healthy Volunteers ” (FDA 2005 ). 
From the 3-month GLP toxicology studies in ra ts and monkeys, a no-observed-adverse-effect 
level (NOAEL) of 500 mg/kg has been estab lished for both species. CD388 safety margins 
generated from these pivotal 3-month exposure st udies in support of the dose are presented in 
Table 2 . At the 50 mg human dose administered as a bol us SQ injection, the safety margin based 
on the 3-month NOAELs and using body surface area (BSA) is 97-fold in rats and 194-fold in 
monkeys. Safety margins based on human area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
(AUC) predictions at 50 mg relative to the ra t and monkey 3-month plasma AUC exposures are 
166-fold in rats and 581-fold in monkeys.

exposures were predicted for IV administration and would represent the highest values expected as bioavailability from IM 
or SQ administration is anticipated to be approximately 70% of IV based on animal PK studies, potentially lowering the 
exposures in human from IM or SQ dosing. 
 
Safety results of the ongoing clinical tr ial CD388.IM.SQ.1.01 have indicated no significant 
safety findings following single SQ administration of 50, 150 mg, and 450 mg CD388. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 25 of 74 In summary, excellent safety margins were achi eved with CD388 in 3-month toxicity studies 
relative to the FIH human dose conservatively scal ed to BSA and to the predicted FIH plasma 
exposure. Although no adverse findings were identified in nonclinical studies, transient minor 
changes in clinical pathology parameters were  observed in the absence of other changes, 
including no changes in cytokines and microsc opic findings, and no CD388-related effects on 
kidney or the reticuloendothelial system. The out come of the CD388 noncli nical safety program 
supports the proposed clinical program and dos e of 50 mg, 150 mg, and 450 mg administered as 
bolus SQ injections. Results from the FIH st udy to date have shown no significant safety 
findings after 50 mg, 150 mg, and 450 mg CD388 administrations. 
4.4. Population to be Studied 
Healthy adult Japanese subjects. 
4.5. Rationale for Trial Endpoints 
The measures for evaluation of the safety and tole rability profile of CD388 Injection are standard 
for most clinical studies and follow the recommendations in the ICH guidelines. The assessments for determining the plasma concentrations are appropriate to characte rize the pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of CD388. 
Exploratory biomarkers, anti-drug antibodies, and pharmacogenomic research are exploratory in 
nature and do not have pre-defined endpoints. 
4.6. Statement of Compliance 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use 
(ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory and IRB requirements.

6.1. Description of the Study 
This is a Phase 1, single-center, prospective,  randomized, double-blind study of ascending single 
doses of CD388 Injection administe red SQ to healthy Ja panese adult subjects. The goals are to 
assess safety, tolerab ility, and PK of CD388.  
Subjects will be randomized to re ceive a single dose of CD388 or  placebo administered via SQ 
injection (treatment assignment is blinded) according to the design in Table 3 . 
Table 3: Study Design 
Number of Subjects (N = 27) 
Cohort: dose CD388 
(n = 21) Placebo 
(n = 6) 
Cohort 1: 50 mg 7 2 
Cohort 2: 150 mg 7 2 
Cohort 3: 450 mg 7 2 
Note: A subject may not receive treat ment in more than one cohort. 
After 50% of Cohort 1 subjects have complete d study drug administration and have undergone 
protocol-specified procedures and DVVHVVPHQWVIRU 10 days, the Principal Investigator (PI) 
and Sponsor will review blinded safety data: AEs (including syst emic reactogeni city/injection 
site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and adverse events of special interest [AESIs]), vital 
signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clini cal laboratory results (hematol ogy, coagulation, serum chemistry, 
urinalysis) to determine the safe ty and tolerability of the study drug. The incidence and severity 
of AEs, and any adverse changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECGs will be considered when determining safe ty and tolerability of study drug. If the dose is determined to be 
VDIHDQGZHOOWROHUDWHG 10 days after dosing, Cohort 2 will be enrolled. Enrollment of the 
remaining 50% of Cohort 1 will con tinue while the safety data of  the first 50% of Cohort 1 is 
being reviewed. Similar proce sses will be followed for dose escalation from Cohort 2 to 
Cohort 3. 
The Schedule of Events is presented in Table 1 . All subjects will be admitted to the clinical 
research unit (CRU) for observati on and safety assessments from Day -1 (check-in) to Day 14. 
Subjects will be monitored for AEs (including systemic reactogenicity/inj ection site reactions, 
hypersensitivity reactions, and AE SIs) and SAEs throughout the study until the final study visit 
after dosing. Safety will also  be assessed by physical exa minations, ECGs, vital signs 
measurements, and laboratory evaluations (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, 
urinalysis) at various time points during and after the CRU stay. Concomitant medication use will be recorded throughout the study.  
Blood samples for PK and ADA assessments will be collected throughout the study. To maintain 
the blind, samples will be collected from all subjects; however, only samples from the CD388 
Injection group will be analyzed (using validated  assays) by an unblinded central bioanalytical 
laboratory. Additional blood sample s will be collected for phar macogenomics and exploratory 
biomarker evaluation.

Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 28 of 74 Respiratory tract infection (RTI) surveillance will be conducted during th e outpatient phase of 
the study from CRU discharge through the Day 12 0/165 outpatient visit or a lab-confirmed 
influenza infection, whichever occurs first. Subj ects will be provided nasal/throat swab kits (for 
detection of influenza infection or other resp iratory pathogen by a multiplexed polymerase chain 
reaction [PCR] test) and symptom diary cards.  
If 3 or more RTI symptoms listed in the table below occur (at least one must be a respiratory 
symptom), subjects will contact study staff, then collect nasal/throat swab  samples (the swabs 
should take place as soon as possible after the start of symptoms, ideally within 48 hours, but no later than 5 days). Subjects will complete symptom diary cards every 7 days to capture the worst grade of symptoms that occurred during the pr evious week. The Investigator/study staff will 
arrange for prompt shipment of the nasal/throat samples to the testing laboratory. Note: If the reported symptoms are already of a level of severity that urgent  care is indicated, the subject 
should be directed to the appr opriate facility to receive th is care (e.g., emergency room). 
Otherwise, symptoms should be treated  according to standard of care. 
If an influenza infection is confirmed by the te sting laboratory before the Day 120/165 outpatient 
visit, the event should be documented until all sy mptoms have resolved, including completion of 
the symptom diary card every 7 days. Thereafter, no further RTI surveillance will be carried out on the subject.  
If the nasal/throat swab samples are not confirmed to be influenza by the testing laboratory, diary 
card completion will continue through the Day 120/165 outpatient visit.  
Respiratory Tract Infection (RTI) Symptoms  
x Runny nose (rhinorrhea) x Shortness of breath (dyspnea) 
x Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) x Wheeze 
x Sore throat x Chilliness/feverishness or temperature °F 
x Earache x Headache 
x Cough x Body ache 
x Productive phlegm/sputum  
As part of the surveillance, subjects will be questioned during all outpatient site visits for RTI symptoms. If the interval to the next outpatie nt site visit exceeds 15 days, subjects will be 
contacted by the Investigator/study staff every 2 weeks to query for RTI symptoms. Subjects 
should be reminded to contact the Investigator/study staff if RTI symptoms occur, and to collect the nasal/throat swab samples and complete the symptom diary cards every 7 days.
 
6.2. Criteria for Evaluation 
6.2.1. Safety and Tolerability of Study Drug 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs (including systemic reactogenicity/
injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and AESIs), vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, 
clinical laboratory results (hematology, co agulation, serum che mistry, urinalysis), 
and concomitant medication usage throughout the study.  
See Section  6.1 for details regarding cohort/dose level enrollment timing and assessment of 
safety and tolerability for dose escalation decision. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 29 of 74 If a dose level is considered not safe or we ll tolerated, the study drug assignment for the 
subject(s) with the safety issue may be unblinded. The Sponsor may also independently decide to 
unblind the entire cohort for safety concerns or terminate enrollment for any reason. 
,IDQ\VXEMHFWGHYHORSVD*UDGH$( or an SAE of any grade that is deemed related to the 
study drug, the mechanism of the AE may be assessed (i.e., cytokine level, complement 
activation, immunoglobulin G [IgG] subtypes, im munoglobulin E [IgE], T-cell/B-cell/monocyte 
and basophil activation as asse ssed by flow cytometry, ADA deve lopment, and immune complex 
formation) at Sponsor and Inve stigator discretion, and the study dose may be modified for the 
remainder of the study. 
6.2.2. Pharmacokinetics/Anti-drug Antibodies 
Pharmacokinetics will be determined by analyzing plasma sa mples for concentration of CD388 
obtained from subjects who receive CD388 Injection in each cohort at various time points after 
administration of study drug. Anti-drug antibodies will also be measured at selected time points 
by a validated ELISA method. 
6.2.3. Pharmacogenomics 
A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample  will be collected once, preferably on 
Day 1 (collection at another time point is permitted if necessary) to  allow for genetic research to 
help understand the characteristics of CD388. Gene tic analysis will be conducted if it is 
hypothesized that doing so may aid in exploring ge netic markers which could explain differences 
in safety, immunogenicity, or c linical response among subjects. Host DNA assessment will be 
limited to research related to CD388, including the development of tests/assays related to CD388 
and flu-like disease. 
Analyses of host DNA may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion a nd reported separately 
from the study report. 
6.2.4. Exploratory Biomarkers 
Blood samples will be collected to allow for th e exploration of biomarkers on the assumption 
that these markers could play a role in the response (safety, reactogeni city, immunogenicity) to 
CD388. 
These samples and remaining material from ot her samples may be used for further assay 
optimization/qualification, biomarke rs, or further exploratory an alyses. Samples will only be 
used for research related to influenza virus infe ction, flu-like disease, and safety, reactogenicity, 
and immunogenicity of CD388, incl uding the development of tests/assays related to CD388 
and influenza. 
Analyses of biomarkers may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately 
from the study report. 
6.3. Number of Subjects 
A total of 27 healthy volunteers w ill be enrolled in this study in 3 cohorts: 9 of the 27 subjects 
will be enrolled in the first c ohort and randomized in a 7:2 ratio to receive either 50 mg CD388 
SQ injection or matching placebo injection; the remaining subjects will be enrolled in the second 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 30 of 74 and third cohorts (9 subjects each) and randomized in a 7:2 ratio to receive either 150 mg 
(Cohort 2) or 450 mg (Cohort 3) CD388 SQ injection or matching placebo injection.  
6.4. Measures Taken to Minimize Bias 
Study drug assignment (CD388 Injecti on or placebo) will be blinded to all blinded clinical site 
and Sponsor study team until at l east after the final subject in a cohort has completed the Day 90 
visit. Unblinded personnel include  the site pharmacist (or pharmacist designee) preparing the 
injections, the unblinded pharmacy monitor (to ensure study drug accountability and assignment throughout the trial), and the Sponsor’s unblinded team. 
6.5. Expected Duration of Subject Participation 
A single dose of study drug will be administered SQ on Day 1. Study partic ipation will require 
up to 28 days for screening procedures, and approximately 120/165 days for dosing and follow-
up (check-in to the CRU on Day -1; CRU inpatient stay for study drug administration, observation, and assessments and procedures for 15 days [Days -1 to Day 14]; and 5 CRU 
outpatient visits for additional assessments and procedures). 
6.6. Method of Treatment Assignment and Blinding 
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened for study eligibility before randomization. 
Within each dose level (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3), subj ects will be randomized to receive a single dose 
of CD388 Injection or saline placebo (treatment assignment is  blinded). The study site’s 
pharmacist (or pharmacist desi gnee) will obtain a computer-gen erated study drug assignment. 
A subject is considered randomized when a rando mization transaction is appropriately recorded. 
Unless a formal interim analysis is conducted after all subjects have completed the Day 90 visit, 
all blinded study personnel (including the Sponsor , Investigator, and site personnel directly 
involved in study conduct) and s ubjects will remain blinded to study drug assignment until the 
study is completed and the final database is locked with the exception of the unblinded pharmacy 
personnel, pharmacy monitor, and unblinded Sponsor personnel (such as Data Review 
Committee, clinical supply manager, PK lead, and quality manager) who may be unblinded to 
study medication at any time dur ing study conduct. The pharmacy monitor will monitor study 
drug preparation and accountability during the stu dy and cases in which unblinding is required 
due to a safety or tolerability issue. To ma intain study blinding, study drug preparation will be 
performed by an unblinded site pharmacist (or qua lified unblinded personnel at the study site not 
involved with study procedures or evaluations). Any unblinding related to an interim analysis 
will be documented in the blinding plan. Instructions for study drug preparation and dosing are outlined in the Pharmacy Manual provided 
separately to the site. In the event of a medical  emergency requiring the Investigator to know the 
identity of the study drug, the Investigator will follow the procedures outlined in Section 8.4 . 
6.7. Data Review Committee 
A Sponsor Data Review Committee, consisting of re presentatives of the Sponsor not involved in 
day-to-day management of the study, may be established to re view unblinded data to allow

CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 37 of 74 8. STUDY DRUG 
8.1. CD388 Injection 
CD388 Injection is a clear to lightly opalescent liquid essentially free of particulate matter 
containing the active pharmaceutical  ingredient, CD388. CD388 Injection is supplied as a frozen 
sterile solution in single-use vials. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details. 
CD388 Injection is administered by SQ injection at the doses described in  Table 3 . Dose levels 
to be assessed will follow an ascending single-dose regimen with the starting dose based on 
findings from 3-month rat a nd monkey toxicology studies. 
8.1.1. Directions for Use 
CD388 Injection should be thawed at room temper ature over 30 minutes (not to exceed 24 hours) 
prior to drawing the dose from the vial into the syringe. 
After CD388 Injection is drawn from the vial in to the syringe, it must be administered within 
4 hours. 
8.1.2. Drug Storage 
Vials of CD388 Injection are stored frozen at -20°C. 8.1.3. Dose Adjustment 
Dosage adjustments of CD388 Injection in individual subjects are not allowed in this study. 
8.2. Placebo Injection 
Normal saline will be administered SQ as the placebo control. 
8.3. Compliance 
Treatment compliance for CD388 Injection/pl acebo will be documented in the eCRF by 
recording the date, administration time, and the volume of the dose of study drug administered. 
8.4. Breaking the Blind 
The study is a double-blind design. The Sponsor, Inve stigator, study site personnel, and subjects 
will not make any effort to determine which blinded study drug (C D388 Injection or placebo) is 
administered. Unblinded pharmacy personnel will be responsible for preparing syringes such that 
the double-blind is maintained. 
Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of a specific subject, ma y the Investigator unblind a subject’s study drug 
assignment. As soon as possible and without revealing the subject’s study drug assignment (unless important 
to the safety of subjects remaining in the study), the Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the 
blind is broken for any reason. The Investigator will record in source documentation the date 
and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for that subject.

CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 38 of 74 As PK samples from subjects assigned to placebo treatment will not be analyzed for 
determination of CD388 concen trations, the bioanalytical laboratory will receive the 
randomization list to allow for correct selection of the samples. Unblinding of the randomized 
treatment assignment will be performed at the bioanalytical laboratory. Specific procedures will 
be in place to ensure that randomized treatme nt assignment will not be revealed to anyone 
involved in the execution of the study. 
8.5. Previous and Concomitant Medications and Substances 
All medications administered within 28 days prior to study drug admin istration and throughout 
the study will be documented and recorded in the eCRF. 
Subjects must refrain from OTC, herbal medications, and nutritional supplements within 7 days 
and prescription medications within 14 days or <5 half-lives before first study drug 
administration, and until after the final study visit (except for hormonal contraceptives, 
acetaminophen, or ibuprofen). The Investigator should consult the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
for guidance regarding other medication or vaccine usage during the study. 
8.6. Accountability Procedures 
The pharmacy or study personnel are responsible for ensuring that a current record of CD388 
Injection inventory and acc ountability are maintained.  
A Pharmacy Monitor will be responsible for checking drug accountability at the site. Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by regulatory authorities at any time. 
Each shipment of study drug will require acknow ledgment of receipt. Upon receipt of study 
drug, the pharmacy or study personne l will visually inspect the shipment and verify the number 
and condition of vials received. Refer to th e Pharmacy Manual for additional information. 
8.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal 
Unless expressly disallo wed by institution rules or local regulations, used and unused vials 
of CD388 Injection will be retained at the study site until study drug accountability has been 
performed by the Pharmacy Monitor. Upon comp letion of the study, termination of the study, 
or upon written authorization from the Sponsor, all retained unused and partially used study drug 
will be centrally destroyed or  destroyed at the site upon wr itten authorization from Sponsor, 
unless expressly disallowed by local  regulations. Adequate docume ntation to support destruction 
is required prior to destruction of the vials, and a certificate of destruction or written 
documentation that specifies the date, quantity, lo t numbers, and method of destruction that is 
traceable to the study drug must be provided to  the Sponsor. All records of disposal will be 
maintained by the Sponsor.

The Schedule of Events ( Table 1 ) summarizes the frequency and timing of all applicable study 
assessments, including allowable windows for stu dy visits and assessme nts/procedures. Written 
informed consent must be obtained before any study-related procedures are performed. 
All procedures should be completed as close to the prescribed/scheduled time as possible. 
Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take precedence 
over all routine scheduled procedures. 
When multiple assessments are scheduled at the same time point, perform the assessments in the 
following order: 12-lead ECG, vital signs, and blood sample collection.  
9.1. Medical History 
A complete medical history will be recorded, including demographic information (age, gender, race, and ethnicity).  
9.2. Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination is required at screening. Targeted (i.e., symptom directed) physical examinations may be perfor med at all other indicated visits , and as clinica lly indicated. 
9.3. Vital Signs 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart ra te, respiration rate, and oral 
temperature, and will be measured with the subject in a seated position for at least 3 minutes prior to measurement. Height and weight are to be measured and body mass index (BMI) calculated when indicated. 
9.4. Electrocardiograms 
Subjects should be resting (at l east 5 minutes) and semi-recumbent for safety triplicate 12-lead 
ECGs. Data collection includes abnormal findings; if abnormal finding(s) are assessed as 
clinically significant, the finding(s)  should be reported as AE(s). The Investigator is responsible 
for interpreting and measuring ECG data. 
The screening ECG may be repeated once to confirm eligibility. 
9.5. Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood and urine for laboratory evaluations will be  collected and analyzed at a laboratory in

CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 44 of 74 11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
11.1. Safety Parameters 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs (including systemic 
reactogenicity/injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and AESIs), vital signs, 12-lead 
ECGs, clinical laboratory resu lts (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, urinalysis), and 
concomitant medication usage throughout the study. 
11.2. Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be collected for all subj ects from the time of signing the ICF through the 
final study visit. The Investigator will assess all AEs and SAEs and will record the following 
information on the appropriate eCRF page: 
x Date of onset 
x Resolution status, and da te of resolution or stabilization if achieved 
x Seriousness 
x Severity 
x Causal relationship to study drug 
x Action taken with  study medication 
Medically indicated laboratory tests (emergency  or unscheduled tests)  should be conducted 
at the local laboratory. The Investigator shoul d employ best medical judgment in determining 
how to manage AEs and SAEs. Any questions regarding AE or  SAE management should be 
directed to the Medical Monitor. 
The Sponsor is responsible for: 
x Confirming the seriousness assessment of all reported AEs and SAEs 
x Confirming the causal relationship between re ported AEs/SAEs and the investigational 
product 
x Assessment of SAEs for expectedness 
The Sponsor will continuously assess the safety of the inves tigational product throughout the 
study. 
11.3. Adverse Event Reporting 
11.3.1. Notification of Serious Adverse Events 
The Sponsor has requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific criteria to 
worldwide regulatory authorities in accordance with ICH guidelines and local regulatory 
requirements. Therefore, the Investigator mu st notify the Sponsor immediately regarding any 
SAE that occurs after informed consent via tr ansmission of a Serious Adverse Event Report 
(SAER) by the study site to the safety vendor by email within 24 hours of awareness that an SAE 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 45 of 74 has occurred, with a copy to the Medical Monitor. Contact details will be provided to the site(s). 
An optional initial report can be made via telephone, but a completed SAER must still be 
emailed within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event.  
The Investigational site will be provided with SAER forms wherein the following information 
is requested: 
x Subject identification, Investig ator name, and site number 
x SAE information: event term, onset da te, severity, and causal relationship 
x The outcomes attributable to the event (e .g., death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient 
hospitalization, prolongation of existing hosp italization, a persiste nt or significant 
disability or incapacity, or other important medical event[s]; refer to Section  11.4.4) 
x A summary of relevant test results, pertinent laboratory da ta, and any other relevant 
medical history 
x The date of study drug administration (NOTE: as this is a double-blind study, SAERs should not indicate specific study drug assignments) 
Supplemental information may be requested, including the following: hospital records, 
laboratory results, radiology re ports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, 
holding and observation notes, discharge summaries , autopsy reports, and death certificates. 
Relevant eCRF pages can be appended to communicate information relevant to the SAE, 
including study drug administration details, medical history, conco mitant medications, relevant 
laboratory test results, and subj ect outcome information. The SA ER should be emailed within 
24 hours with as much of the above informati on as available at the time. The following minimum 
information is required for reporting an SAE: subject identification, Investigator contact 
information, an AE with a serious outcome, and the Investigator’s assessment of causal relationship to study drug. Serious adverse events are to be reported immediately and under no 
circumstance should this reporting time exc eed 24 hours following knowledge of the SAE. 
Supplemental information may be  transmitted using a follow-up report and should not delay the 
initial report. The Sponsor may c ontact the investigational site to solicit additional information 
or follow up on the event. 
The Investigator must take all therapeutic m easures necessary for resolution of the SAE. 
Any medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the subject’s eCRF. 
If the Investigator becomes aware of any SAEs th at occur after the study period that are believed 
to be causally related to use of the investig ational product, they should notify the Sponsor 
immediately. The Sponsor will report all suspected unexpected se rious adverse reactions (SUSARs) within the 
required regulatory timeframes to all applicable regulatory authorities and to Investigators as 
required. 
All SAEs that do not meet expedited reporting requirements will be summarized in the 
Development Safety Update Repor t (DSUR) and reporte d annually by the Sponsor as required. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 46 of 74 11.3.2. Notification of Emerging Safety Issues 
Additionally, the Investigator should alert th e Sponsor immediately (under no circumstance 
should this reporting time exceed 24 hours) by contacting the Medical Monitor of any new 
findings that necessitate the impleme ntation of urgent safety measur es to protect subjects against 
any immediate hazard. If time per mits, the Investigator should cont act the Sponsor to discuss the 
hazard and any actions taken or to be taken prior to implementation.  
The Sponsor is responsible for informing other investigators who may need to implement the 
same procedures and for alerting the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees of the new 
findings and measures taken in accordance with local regulations within  the required timeframes. 
11.4. Definitions 
11.4.1. Adverse Event 
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug or study 
procedure in humans, whether or not considered  drug-related. An AE can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (e.g., a c linically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. An AE can arise with any use of the dr ug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with 
another drug) and with any rout e of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require me dical intervention. However, each laboratory 
abnormality (e.g., clinically significant changes detected on hematology, coagulation, chemistry, urinalysis) independent from a ny underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical 
intervention, or that leads to interruption of study drug or discontinuation, must be recorded 
as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laborat ory abnormality is part of a clinical condition 
or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndro me or diagnosis rather than as the individual 
laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments (e.g., ECGs) that are associated with signs or sympto ms must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they 
meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in this section and in Section  11.4.4, 
respectively. 
11.4.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of Inves tigational New Drug (I ND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE. “Suspected adverse reaction”  implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than “adverse reaction”, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
11.4.3. Life-Threatening AE or Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered  “life threatening” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 47 of 74 11.4.4. Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is consid ered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death 
x A life-threatening AE – see definition above 
x Inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospitalization 
x A persistent or significant incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect in the of fspring of a subject who received study drug 
x Is a suspected transmission of any in fectious agent via a medicinal product  
x Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered seri ous when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
11.4.5. Unexpected AE or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction 
An AE or suspected adverse reac tion is considered “unexpected”: 
x If it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochur e or is not listed at the nature, severity, 
frequency, or outcome that has been observed 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator’s Broc hure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
“Unexpected”, as used in this definition, also re fers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that 
are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular dr ug under investigation. 
11.4.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) include anaphylaxis (refer to Appendix 3  for 
diagnostic criteria and management). 
11.4.7. Emerging Safety Issue 
Any new safety information that may lead to a reassessment of the risk/benefit balance of the 
investigational product a nd/or impact subjects’ he alth. Examples include: 
x Any new safety issue relating to the conduct of  the clinical trial that may impact the 
safety of the trial subjects such as significant safety results from a recently completed non-clinical study or early termination or temporary suspension of a trial for safety reasons that is conducted on the same investigational product 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 48 of 74 x Recommendations from a Data Review Committee that may affect the safety of trial 
subjects  
11.4.8. Urgent Safety Measure 
An urgent safety measure (USM) is a procedure not defined by the protocol that can be put in place immediately, without prior authorizati on from Ethics Committees or Regulatory 
Authorities, to protect study subjects from any im mediate hazard to their health and safety. 
11.5. Adverse Event Classification 
11.5.1. Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious; 
Table 6 ). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists 
a reasonable possibility that the study dr ug caused or contributed to an AE. 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgmen t, should be used as a guide for determining 
the causal assessment. If the event is thought to be unrelated to study drug administration, 
an alternative explana tion should be provided. 
Table 6: Table Guidelines for Assessing Relationship of Event to Study Drug 
Unrelated There is little or no chance that  the study drug caused the adverse event (AE); other conditions, 
including concurrent illnesses, progression or e xpression of the disease state, or a reaction 
to a concomitant medication best explain the event. 
Related The association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; however, the AE is not clearly due to 
another condition, or a reasonable temporal as sociation exists between the AE and study drug 
administration and, based on the Investigator's clinical experience, the association of the AE with the study drug seems likely. 
11.5.2. Severity 
For injection site reactions, the Investigator will use the grading scale in Table 5 . To describe the 
intensity of all other AEs following general categorical descriptors outlined in the DAIDS table

Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 49 of 74 11.5.3. Serious Adverse Event 
Any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study medication that occurs from the time 
of informed consent through the final study visit, are considered serious if they result in any of 
the outcomes listed in Section  11.4.4. 
Hospitalization for a planned or elective procedur e or surgery for a pre-existing condition that 
has not worsened is not considered an SAE. 
11.6. Adverse Event Follow Up 
All unresolved SAEs and study drug-related AEs will be fo llowed by the study staff until 
resolution or deemed stable , regardless of severity. 
11.7. Adverse Event Management 
The Investigator should employ best medical j udgement in determining how to manage AEs. 
Any questions regarding AE management should be directed to the Medical Monitor. 
11.8. Risks for Women of Childbearing Potential or During Pregnancy 
The risks of CD388 Injection in pregnant or  lactating/nursing women are unknown. Pregnant 
or nursing female subjects are excluded from this study. 
Subjects must be instructed to inform the Investigator immediately if they or their partner 
becomes pregnant during the study. In the case of a partner pregnancy, partner informed consent must be obtained prior to collecting info rmation related to the pregnancy and to allow 
the Investigator to follow them for the outcome of the pregnancy. In th e event of a confirmed 
pregnancy, the following ac tions should be taken: 
x The pregnancy should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the subject notifying the Investigator using the applicable Pregnancy Report Form. 
x The Investigator should counsel female subj ects regarding the possible effects of CD388 
Injection exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of the outcome of the 
pregnancy. 
x The subject or subject’s partner, if consented, should be monitored until the postnatal day 28 or until termination of  the pregnancy. The outcome should be reported using 
the Pregnancy Outcome or Abnor mal Pregnancy Outcome form. 
Pregnancy is not an AE, in and of itself. Ho wever, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered an SA E and will be reported as described in the AE 
and SAE sections. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome post-study must be reported to the Medical Monitor.

A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before unblinding for the first 
interim analysis. Any deviations from the final SAP will be described an d justified in the study 
report. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS®. 
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the 
numbers, means, standard deviations, medi ans, minimums, and maximums for continuous 
variables, will be provided. All data will be summarized separa tely by dose level and study drug 
(CD388 Injection or placebo). Listings of i ndividual subject data will also be produced. 
Safety, tolerability, and PK will be summarized using descriptive statistics. There will be no 
formal hypothesis testing.  
12.1. Analysis Populations 
Analysis populations are: 
x Safety Population: all subjects w ho receive any amount of study drug 
x PK Analysis Population: all subjects w ho receive CD388 Injecti on and who have any 
blood samples analyzed 
12.2. Analysis of Study Population and Subject Characteristics 
Demographics (including age, race, ethnicity, and gender), ba seline assessments (including 
height, weight, and BMI), medi cal history, and administration of study drug will be summarized 
for the Safety Population. 
12.3. Safety Analyses 
Safety will be evaluated by presenting summaries of AEs and SAEs, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, coagul ation, serum chemistry, urinalys is), and vital signs. Adverse 
events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of TEAEs and AESIs will be presented by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT), relatio nship to study drug, and severity. A TEAE is defined as an AE 
that emerges during or after study drug administr ation having been absent pre-treatment, or 
worsens relative to the pre-treatment state, a nd through the final study visit. In addition, the 
incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leadi ng to discontinuation of study drug or from the 
study will be presented by SOC and PT.  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory test results, ECG parameters, and vital signs, and for 
changes from Baseline, will be presented by time point. The incidences of potentially clinically 
significant (PCS) clinical laboratory results, ECG parameters, and vital signs will also be 
summarized by time point.  
A summary of the injection site evaluation will be presented. The number and percentage of 
subjects with any local reaction will be provided, as will the number and percentage of subjects 
with pain, tenderness, erythema /redness, and induration/swelling. The severity of each local 
reaction will also be presented.

0-last) 
x area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC
0-) 
CD388 concentration in the upper respirat ory tract will also be determined.  
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimation will be performed by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) with Phoenix
® WinNonlin® version 8 or higher. The actual elapsed sampling times relative to 
dosing will be recorded during the study and will be  used in the NCA analysis. Pharmacokinetic 
data handling and analysis will be further detailed in the SAP. 
Descriptive statistics will be cal culated for plasma concentrati ons at each individual time point 
and for all PK parameters. Mean and individual plasma concentration-time profiles will be 
presented graphically. Inferen tial statistics will also be c onducted for log transformed PK 
exposure parameters versus historical c ontrol data in Western subjects from Study 
CD388.IM.SQ.1.01. 
Pharmacokinetic samples for CD 388 from this study may also be included in a population PK 
analysis, which will be reported separately. 
12.5. Analyses of Pharmacogenomics, Exploratory Biomarkers, 
and Anti-Drug Antibodies 
Analysis of the ADA results is to be determined  and may include determin ation of the subject’s 
positive/negative ADA status at baseline, treatment -emergent ADA in subjects with a negative 
baseline, as well as a post-baseline increase in titer for subjects with positive ADA at baseline.

Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 65 of 74 APPENDIX 3.  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND MANAGEMENT FOR 
ANAPHYLAXIS 
Diagnostic Criteria  for Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to seve ral hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized  hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen 
lips, -tongue, -uvula) 
and at least one  of the following: 
a. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, whee ze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow, hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated  symptoms of end-organ dysfunction 
(e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi dly after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that subject (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e .g., generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, whee ze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow, hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated sy mptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms  (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced blood pressure after e xposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to 
several hours): a. Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or >30% decrease from that person's baseline 
 
Management of Anaphylaxis 
1. Epinephrine:  When a subject meets any of the di agnostic criteria, the subject should 
receive epinephrine immediately, as it is the tr eatment of choice in anaphylaxis. Aqueous 
epinephrine, 0.01 mg/kg (maximum dose, 0.5 mg) administered intramuscularly every 
5 to 15 minutes as necessary, is the re commended dosage for controlling symptoms 
and maintaining blood pressure. The 5-minute interval between injections can be 
liberalized to permit more frequent injections if deemed necessary by the clinician. 
2. Oxygen and adrenergic agonists:  High-flow oxygen (through a nonrebreather mask 
or endotracheal tube) should be administe red to subjects experiencing respiratory 
symptoms or hypoxemia. Those who are hem odynamically unstable might benefit from

2-agonists, such as albuterol, mi ght be useful for bronchospasm 
refractory to epinephrine.

CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 66 of 74 3. Positioning of  the subject: Subjects in anaphylactic shock (i.e., those with anaphylaxis 
and signs of critical organ hypoperfusion) should be placed in a recumbent position with 
the lower extremities elevated unless precluded by shortness of breath or vomiting. 
4. Fluid resuscitation:  Subjects who remain hypotensive despite epinephrine should have 
aggressive fluid resuscitation. La rge volumes of crystalloid might be needed in the first 
5 to 10 minutes; in severe reactions with hypotension, up to 35% of the blood volume might extravasate in the first 10 minutes, and vasodilatation can cause pooling, with even more reduction in the effective bl ood volume and thus distributive shock. 
5. Vasopressors:  Potent vasopressors, such as noradr enaline, vasopressi n, or metaraminol, 
might be required to overcome vasodilatation if epinephrine and fluid resuscitation have 
failed to maintain a systolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mmHg. 
6. H
1- and H 2-antihistamines:  Antihistamines (H 1- and H 2-antagonists) are slower in onset 
of action than epinephrine, have little effect on blood pressure, and should be considered a second-line treatment for anaphylaxis. 
7. Corticosteroids:  Because the onset of action is slow, steroids are not useful in the acute 
management stage. It has been suggested th at their use might prevent a protracted or 
biphasic reaction.

If administration of epinephrine in these subjects is ineffective, administration of glucagon can be attempted. Glucagon is thought to reverse refractory hypotension

however, the occurrence and importance of this  mechanism of action in anaphylaxis is 
unproved. 
9. Observation: After the treatment of an anaphyl actic reaction, an observation period 
should be considered for all subjects as th e reaction might recur as the effect of 
epinephrine wears off (intramuscular epinephrine results in increased serum levels for an hour or more) and because of the risk of  a biphasic reaction (1–72 hours after the acute 
reaction).

Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 67 of 74 APPENDIX 4.  RASH MANAGEMENT 
For subjects reporting rash, the following should be performed: 
All rashes will be discussed betw een the Investigator and the Sponsor, and in case of a causal 
relationship between the rash and the study dr ug, then the following visits and assessments 
will be performed as indicated below and in the “Visit Schedule for Rash Management” 
(see Appendix 5). Unscheduled follow-up visits for close follow-up of rash will be performed 
based on the grade (severity) of the rash. At th e Investigator’s discretion, additional visits 
and assessments may be performed. 
The rash event should be captured in the AE sect ion of the electronic case report form (eCRF), as 
well as in more detail in the specific rash assessment pages of the eCRF. 
In case of rash, blood samples need to be collect ed for safety laboratory testing, and processed by 
the local laboratory. These samples need to be collected during the unscheduled visits as 
described below and in Appendix 5. A copy of the local laborator y reports should be anonymized 
and will be retrieved by the monitor. 
The following parameters need to be tested: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), creatinin e, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a complete blood cell 
count (including hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell [RBC] count, white blood cell [WBC] count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eo sinophils, basophils, and platelet count). 
Digital pictures need to be ta ken as described below and in Appendix 5. Digital pictures will be 
anonymized and stored on the Sponsor’s secure se rver. Only the study team will have access to 
the pictures. 
The subject may be treated symptomatically until the rash resolves. If the rash is considered to be 
most likely due to concomitant  illness or non-study medication, standard management, including 
discontinuation of the likely causative agent, shou ld be undertaken, and th e continuation of the 
subject in the study should be discussed with the Sponsor. 
Dermatologist fees for evaluating subjects who experience a rash will be reimbursed by the 
Sponsor. 
The following grades are based on th e DAIDS Toxicity Grading Scale ( DAIDS 2017 ) with 
adaptations made by the Sponsor: Subjects should be informed that they should contact their doctor and visit the clinic 
immediately (unscheduled visit, day 1 of  the rash) when they notice any rash. 
Grade 1 Rash 
A Grade 1 rash is defined as erythema . 
x Subjects may continue the inta ke of study drug(s) (at the Investigator’s discretion). 
x An unscheduled visit for initial rash evaluation (day 1 of the rash) is required. 
x Assessment of safety blood samples by the lo cal laboratory is required. A copy of the 
local laboratory report should be anonymized  and will be retrieved by the monitor. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.SQ.1.03 
CD388 Injection 
Amendment 1 Confidential  Page 68 of 74 x Digital pictures should be  taken within 24 hours after the onset of the rash. 
x Referral to a dermatologist is only needed if the rash diagnosis is uncertain (preferably 
within 24 hours after the onset of the rash). A copy of the dermatologist’s report should 
be anonymized and will be retrieved by the monitor. 
x Cetirizine, levocetirizine, topical corticosteroids, or antipruritic agents may be prescribed. 
x The description of the rash should be reported per ‘Unscheduled  Visit in Case of Rash’ in 
the eCRF (i.e., the initial rash assessment pages). 
For close follow-up of the rash, unscheduled visits will also be performed 1 and 7 days after the initial assessment of the rash. At these visits, sa fety blood samples and dig ital pictures should be 
taken. The follow-up rash assessment pages of the eCRF should be completed for all follow-up 
visits. For these and all subsequent local laboratory blood sample assessments: a copy of the 
local laboratory reports should be anonymized  and will be retrie ved by the monitor. 
If the rash is unresolved after 7 days, additiona l unscheduled visits may be performed at the 
Investigator’s discretion. Upon resolution/stabiliza tion of the rash, digital pictures should be 
taken and the final rash assessment pa ges of the eCRF should be completed. 
The subject should be advised to contact th e Investigator immediat ely if there is any 
worsening of the rash, if  any systemic signs or symptoms appear, or if mu cosal involvement 
develops. 
In case the rash evolves from a Grade 1 to a highe r grade, additional unscheduled visits have to 
be conducted according to the guidelines fo r Grade 2 or Grade 3–4 rash, respectively. 
Grade 2 Rash A Grade 2 rash is defined as diffuse, maculopapular rash OR dry desquamation . 
x Subjects will permanently discontinue the inta ke of study drugs and be withdrawn from 
the study. No rechallenge is allowed. 
Note:  Subjects experiencing Grade 2 rash follo wing the last intake of study drug may 
continue in the study as long as they are not re-exposed to suspect study drug. 
x An unscheduled visit for initial rash evaluation (day 1 of the rash) is required. 
x Assessment of safety blood samples by the lo cal laboratory is required. A copy of the 
local laboratory report should be anonymized  and will be retrieved by the monitor. 
x Digital pictures should be  taken within 24 hours after the onset of the rash. 
x Referral to a dermatologist is  required, preferably within 24 hours after the onset of the 
rash. A copy of the dermatologist’s report s hould be anonymized and will be retrieved by 
the monitor. 
x A biopsy is performed (preferably within 24 hour s after the onset of the rash) if advised 
by the dermatologist. A copy of the biopsy report should be anonymized and will be 
retrieved by the monitor. 
x Cetirizine, levocetirizine, topical corticosteroids, or antipruritic agents may be prescribed.

assessments and digital pictur es) may be performed at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Upon resolution/stabilization of the rash, digital pictures should be taken and the final rash 
assessment pages of the e CRF should be completed. 
The subject should be advised to  contact the Investigator imme diately if the rash fails to 
resolve (after more than 2 weeks), if there is  any worsening of the rash, if any systemic 
signs or allergic symptoms develop, or if mucosal involvement develops. 
In case the rash evolves from a Grade 2 to a Gr ade 3–4 rash, additional unscheduled visits must 
be conducted according to the guidelines for Grade 3–4 rash.

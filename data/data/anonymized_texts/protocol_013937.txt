2Rationale for Am endment 5
This document describes the changes to the protocol incorporating Amendment 5. The 
primary  rationale f or thi s amendment is 
tomodify the study  assessments. The second 
interim analysis (IA) was conducted (data cutoff date 02 December 2019), and th e primary  
endpo int of progression- free survival (PFS) did not reach statist ical significance. Because 
the primary  endpoint was not met,the planned final analysis will not occur andthe study  is
now unblinded .
Although the primary endpo int was not met, pat ients in both treatment arms appeared to 
receive benefit. As such, patien ts deriving clinical benefit may cont inue their current study 
treatm ent if there are no other means of accessing the study  drugs ,until such t ime as other 
means of accessing the study drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should co mplete 
an End of Treatment (EOT) visit and transit ion onto a commercial supply o f ixazo mib 
and/or l enalido mide ,or other standard of care treatment. 
Patients who are receiving ixazo mib and lenalidomide will cont inue to receive ixazo mib and 
lenalido mide. Patients who are receiving placebo and lenalidomide will receive 
lenalido mide only; the placebo capsule will no longer be administered and patients receivi ng 
placebo will  not be crossed over to ixazomib in this study .
For pati ents continuing on study , the m ajority of study  assessments are discontinued to ease 
the burden o f protocol -mandated assessments. Upon implementation of Amendment 5, data 
collect ion req uirements will  be limi ted to collect ion of adver se events (AEs) and seriou s 
adverse events ( SAEs).All other study assessments are no longer required. All central 
laboratory  efficacy  measures of response and progressio n are discont inued. Bone marrow 
aspirates for confirmati on of  com plete response (CR) o r minimal residual disease (MRD) 
status are nolonger requi red. No further Independent Review Co mmittee (IRC) response or 
progression evaluat ions will be performed. Radiogra phic studi es and bone densit y studi es
for study  purposes are no l onger requi red. Qu ality of life and healt h utilizati on assessm e nts 
and co llection of conco mitant m edicat ions and procedures are discont inued. Patients will  not 
be followed for the PFS or overall survival ( OS)follow-up peri ods, as PFS and OS data are 
no longer being collect ed. Pati ents shoul d otherw ise be treated by  the invest igator acc ording 
to standard of care. See the updated Schedule of Events —Amendm ent 5 an d Bey ondfor 
more detailed information.
Descriptions of how to manage study  procedures during unavo idable circumstances, such as 
the COVID -19 pandemic, have addit ionally been added.
Minor gramma tical, edi torial, formatting, and administrative c hanges are included f or
clarificati on pur poses only. For specific examples of changes in te xt and where the changes 
are located, see Secti on15.19 .

4PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Study Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind,Multicenter Study Compari ng Oral MLN9708 
Plus Lenalidomide and Dexameth asone Versus Placebo Plus Lenalidomide and Dexameth asone in 
Adul t Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
Study Phase: 3
Number of Patients: Approximately 701
Study Objecti ves
As of this amend ment, th e objectives are to provide continued access t o ixazo miband/or 
lenalidomide to patients who are continuing to have clinical benefit and to continue collectin g 
relevant safety data to monitor patient safety. All other study obje ctives will no longe r be assessed. 
However, the complete list of objective s is retained below for reference.
Primary Objective:
To determi ne whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to lenal idomide and dexamethasone 
improves progression -free survival (PFS) in patients with newly -diagnose d multiple myeloma 
(NDMM) 
Key Secondary Objec tives:
To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to lena lidomide and dexamethasone 
improves overall surv ival (OS)
To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to lenalid omide and dexamethas one 
improves the rate of com plete response (CR) 
To de termine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to len alidomide and dexa methasone 
improves pain response rate, as a ssessed by the Brief Pain Inventory –Short Form (BPI -SF) 
and analgesi cuse
Other Secondar y Object ives:
To determine o
verall response rate (ORR) , including partial response ( PR), very good partia l 
response (V GPR), and CR
To determine time to response (TTR) , duration of response (DOR), and time to progression 
(TTP)
To determi nethe effect of the addition of MLN9708 to lena lidomide and dexamethasone on 
progr ession -free survival 2 (PFS2), defined as the date from randomization to the date of 
second disease pro gression or death from any cause, whichever comes first 
Todeter mine the safety of the ad dition o f MLN9708 to lenalid omide and dexamethasone 
To assess change in global health status, as measure d by the glob al health status, functioning, 
and symptoms as m easured by the patient -reported outcome (PRO) instrument Eu ropea n 
Orga nization for Researc h and Tr eatment of Cancer Qu ality of Life Questionnair e (EORTC 
QLQ -C30) and MY -20 module 
To determine th e PFS and OS in high -risk cytogenetic patient groups defined by the 
following cytogenetic abnormalities: t(4;14), t(14;1 6), amp(1q2 1), and del(17p)

5!To evaluate minimal residual disease status (MRD), via flow cytometry, in patients suspected 
to have reached CR at any time during the entire conduct of the study, and at Cycle 18 for 
patients who have maintained CR until that point. The impact of MRD status on TTP, PFS, 
and OS will be assessed. 
!To assess time to pain progression 
!To collect pharmacokinetic (PK) data to contribute to population PK analyses
!To evaluate the frequency of skeletal-related events (SREs) (eg, new fractures [including 
vertebral compression fractures]), irradiation of or surgery on bone, or spinal cord 
compression) from baseline through the last survival assessment
Overview of Study Design: 
This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
MLN9708 versus placebo when added to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (LenDex) in patients 
with NDMM. Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) 
who have not received previous antimyeloma treatment, who are ineligible for high-dose therapy 
plus stem cell transplantation (HDT-SCT) because of age (ie, ∀65 years) or coexisting conditions 
per investigator judgment, who are candidates for treatment with LenDex as their standard therapy, Property y Terms of Useing ng of

6and who meet other eligibility criteria detailed in S ection 5will be enrolled in this study.
Following the Screening period, patients to be enrol led will be randomized to r eceive either 
MLN9708 or pl acebo in a double -blind fashion in addition to the background th erapy of LenDex. 
Eligible patients will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio into those 2 treatment arms, stratified by age 
(75years vs 75), International Staging Syste m (ISS) (stage 1 or 2 vs st age 3), and BPI -SF worst 
pain score ( 4 vs 4) at screening .
Patients will receive oral MLN9708 4.0mg or a ma tching placebo capsule on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus 
lenalidomide (25 mg) onDays 1 through 21 and dex amethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
a
28-day cycle. Patients over 75 years of age at r andomization will receive a reduced dexamethasone 
dose (20 mg ). Dose modifications may be made throughout the study based on toxic ities. Patients 
with a low cr eatinine clearance 60 mL/min (or 50 mL/min , according to local label/practice) but 
30mL/min will receive a reduced lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once dail y on Days 1 through 21 of 
a 28-day cycle. The lenalidomide dose may b e escalated to 15 mg once dai ly after 2 cycles i f the 
patient is not respondi ng to treatment and is tolerating the treatment. Ifrenal func tion normalizes 
(ie,creatinine clearance > 60 m L/min or > 50 mL/min, according to local label/practice) and the 
patientcontinues to tole rate thi s treatment, lenali domide may then be escalate d to 25 mg once daily.
Patients may continue to rec eive treatmen t as outlined previously for 18 cycles (approxim ately 
18months), or until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable t oxicity, whichever co mes firs t. After 
18 cycles, patients will continue tre atment in the same randomization arm on the same sc hedule with 
modified dose levels of the study drug and lenali domide: reduce MLN9708 (or placebo) dose to 
3.0mg, reduce lenalidomi dedose to 10 mg, and no dexa methasone.
The trea tment period of the study i s defined as any time a patient is receiving any of the study dr ug 
regimen, and will be comprised of 28 -day trea tment cycles. Patients will be seen at regular treatment 
cycle interv a
lswhile they are pa rticipat ing in the study: w eekly for the first 2 cycle s,twice a 
treatment cycle during the third cycle, and then once a treatment cycle for the remainder of their 
participation in the treatment period, until they experience disease pr ogression or disconti nue for 
alternate reasons. If a patient discontinues t reatment with the study regimen before disease 
progression, they will enter the PFS follow -up period of the stud y.
Patients will be assessed for disease response and progression by t
heinvestigator and an indep endent 
review commi ttee (IRC). Response will b e assessed according to the International Myeloma 
Working Group (IMWG) criteria for all patients every cycle dur ing the treatment period until PFS 
significance has been claimed in t hisstudy. After the primary endpoint has been m et, central efficacy 
and in vestigator assessments for protocol purposes will b e discontinue dexcept for investigator 
assessment of PFS2. Fo r patients who discontinue treatment before disease progression, asse ssments 
will be made every 4weeks during the PF S follow -up period until di sease progression is confirmed 
or the patient is st arted on anot her anticancer therapy, or the PFS significance has been claimed in 
this study. After disease progression or start of another anticancer t herapy, all patients will be 
followed for survival in the OS follow -up period. Patients will be contacted every 12 weeks from the 
start of the OS follow -up period unt il death or termination of the study by the sponsor. All 
subsequent a nticancer therapies f or MM wi ll be reported as p art of the OS follow -up per iod 
assessments. In addition, patients who receive a subsequent anticancer therapy for MM will be 
assessed by the investigator for disease response (at minimum disease progression) onthe second 
line of antican cer therapy to dete rmine PFS2.
As of Amendment 5, however, the second interim analysis has been c onducted (dat a cutoff date of 
02December 2019), and the prim ary endpoint o f PFS did not reach statistical significance. Thus, 
the
planned final analysis will not oc cur andthestudy is now unblinded . Alth ough the primary endpoint 
was not met, patients in both treatmen t arm s appeared to receiv e benefit. As such, pat ients deriving 
clinical benefit may continue their current study trea tment until such time as other means o f

For patients continuing on study, the majority of study assessments are discontinued t o ease the 
burden of protocol -mandated assessments. Upon impleme ntation of Amendment 5, data co llection 
requirem ents will be limited to collect ion of adverse events and serious adverse e vents. All other 
study asses sments are no longer r equired. All central laboratory efficacy measure s of res ponse and 
progr ession are di scontinued. Bone marrow aspirat es for confirmati on of CR or MRD status are no 
longer required. No further IRC response or progress ion evaluations will be performed. 
Radiogr aphic studies and bo ne density studies for study purpose s are no longer required. Quality of 
life and health utiliz ation assessments and collection of concomitant medications and procedures are 
discontinued. Patien tswill not be followed forthe PFS or OS follow -up periods, a s PFS and OS data

NOTE:Upon implementation of Protocol Amendment 5, follow -up for PFS and OS will no l onge r occur. The 
full Stu dy Overview Diagram is retained for reference.
a Patients with a low creatinine clearance of 60mL/min (or 50 mL/min, according to local l abel/practice) 
but 30 mL/min will receive a reduc ed lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 21 of a 
28-day  cycle. The lenalidomide dose may be es calated to 15 mg o nce daily  after 2 cy cles if the patient is n ot 
respond ing to treatment and is tolerating the treatment. If renal funct ion normalizes (ie, creatinine clearance 
> 60 mL/min or > 50 mL/min, a ccording to local label/practice) and the patient continues to t olerate this 
treatment, lenalid
omide may then be escalated to 25 mg once daily.
bPatients over 75 years of age at randomi zation w ill receive a reduced dexamethasone dose (20 mg).
cIf the dos e of MLN9708 (or placebo) was reduced to 3.0 or 2. 3mg during th e first 18 cycles of treatment,
dose will remain at that r educed level beyond 1 8 cycles (see Table 4-1).
dIf the dose of lenalidomide w as reduced to 15 mg or 10 mg during the first 18 cycles of treatm ent, dose wil l 
be 10 mg beyond 18 cycles. If the lenalidomide dose was reduced to 5 mg durin g the first 18 cycles of 
treatment, dose wi ll remai n at 5 mg beyond 18 cycles (see Table 4-1
).
ePatients who receive a su bsequent line of anticancer therapy will be evaluated by  the investigat or for disease 
respon se (at minimum disease progression) for determinati on of PFS2. Disease response on the next line of 
therapy will be recorded ever y 12 weeks during the OS follow -up period until PFS2 is reported or a new 
(third) line of antica ncer thera py is started, whiche ver comes first.

Patients who are receivin g ixazomib and lenalidomide will cont inue to rec eive ixazo mib and 
lenalido mide. Patients who are receiving placebo and lenalidomide will receive 
lenalido mide onl y; the pl acebo capsul e will no longer be adminis tered and patients receiving 
placebo will not b e crossed over to ixazo mibin this study . 
For p atients continuing on study ,the majority of study  assessments are discontinued to ease 
the burden o f protocol -mandated assessments. For ease of study  conduct, t he Schedule of 
Events now presente d has been si mplified to apply to the remainder of the study .Beyond the

21Study Pe riod Definitions
Screening Period A period of time 1 to 28 days before randomiza tionwhen a prospective patient is 
screened for eligibility criteria.
Treatment Period The time d uring which a patient receives any dose of the study drug regimen, and 
is comp rised of 28 -
day treatment cycles.
End of Treatment ( EOT) 
VisitA visit within 3 0 days after the last dose of th e study drug regimen w hen certain 
procedures are performed, as out linedinthe Schedule of Events.
Progression -free Survival 
Follow -up P eriodVisits for patient s who sto p treatment with the study drug regime n for any  reason
other than progressive disease. See Section 15.12 forthe full Schedule of Events 
before Amendment 5was implemented for app ropriate assessments. The 
progression -free survival follow -up should oc cur ever y 4 week s until the 
occurrence of diseas e progression; radiographic disease assessments are to be 
performe d every 8weeks for patients with documented ex tramedullary disease. 
Note that with the impleme ntation of Amendment 5, patients wil l not be fo llowed 
for the P FS or OS follow -up periods, as P FS and OS data are no longer being 
collected.
Progression -free Su rvival
2Follow -up PeriodPatients who receive a subsequent anticancer therapy for MM will be a ssessed by 
the investigator for dise ase respons e (at minimum di sease progression) to 
determine PFS2; response assessments should be made using local laboratory 
results, and the frequency will be determined by the investigator (recom mended 
every 12 weeks) o n the next line of therapy only (as part of the overall surviva l 
follow-
up period [see below]).When a patient experiences disease progression on 
the next line o f antica ncer therapy or initiates a third line of anticancer therapy, 
whicheve r comes first, fu rther disease response will no longer be record ed. Note 
that wi th the implementation of Amendm ent5, patients will not be followed for 
the PFS or OS follow -up pe riods, a s PFS and OS data are no longer being 
collected.
Overall Survi val 
Follow-up PeriodVisits (may be conducted by phone, inte rnet, etc) every 12 weeks t o assess 
survival. Depending on response to treatment, patients may enter the OS follow -up 
period atdifferent times:
Patients who experience dis ease progression during the tre atment period 
enter the OS follow -up period after the EOT visit
Patients who do not experience disease progress ion during the treatment 
period go on to the PFS follow -up period. They will enter the OS 
follow -up after experien cing disease progression in the PFS follow -up.
Patients who are removed from study t reatment pr ior to disease 
progression (ie, for toxicity) AN D immediately continue to receive a 
subsequent line of anticancer therapywill skip the PFS follow -up period 
and enter the O S follow -up p eriod.
Note that with th e implementation of Amendment 5, pat ients will not be followed 
for the PFS or OS fo llow-up peri ods, as PFS and OS data are no longer being 
collected.

221.   BACKGRO UNDAND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1   Scientific Backgr ound
1.1.1    Disease Under T reatmen t
Multiple myel oma (M M), a B -cell tumor of malignant plasma cell s within the bon e marrow, 
remains incurable desp ite advances in novel therapies with proteasome inhibitors, 
immuno modulating drugs (IMiD), and stem cell transpla nt (SCT) therapy . MM is 
charact erized by  the acc um
ulation of plasma cells in the bon e marrow (a nd other organs)
andcan result in b one m arrow f ailure, bone destruction, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. It 
constitutesapproximately 1% of all reported neopl asms and approximately 1 3% of  
hematol ogic cancer s wo rldwide. [1]In the Americas, C anada, and Western European 
countri es, approximately  5to 7 new cas e
s of MM are diagnosed per 100,000 people each
year. [1-3] Alt ho ugh less co mmo n in Asian count ries, incidences of MM have increased 
almost 4 -fold in the past 25 year s and are characterized by younger onset a ge, m ore invasive 
disease, and a less favorable prognosis. [4,5]
MM i
ssensitive to m any cy totoxic drugs includin g alkylat ing agents, anthrac yclines, and 
corticosteroids for both init ial treatmen t and rel apsed disease. Over the past decade, 
significant ach ievements have been made in expanding treatment options for MM wi th
novel therapies such as thalido mide, bortezom ib, and lenalidomide. These regimens have 
extend ed PFSand/or time -to-progression (TTP). [6-10] The introduction o f novel therapies 
and the increased use of high -dose therapy  significant ly improved overall sur vival in 
patients wi th newly  diagn osed m yeloma who were eligible for autologous stem cell 
trans plant (ASCT). [11-13]For pati ents wi th newly diag nosed myelo ma who arenot eligible 
for ASCT, adding VELCAD
E to melphalan and predniso ne (VMP) significant ly exte nded 
overall survival. Final results of the internat ional, mult icenter, ph ase 3 VISTA trial 
confirmed that after 5 years o f follow-up, VMP demo nstrated a persist ent,significant OS
benefit versus melphalan an d prednisone (MP) wi th a 13.3 median mo nth incre ase (43.1 vs

a
gentsthat target the proteas ome, Millennium Pharmac euticals, Inc. (Millenn ium) has 
develope d ML N9708, a sm all molecule 20S
proteasome inhi bitor.
1.1.2    MLN9708, Millennium’s Next -Generation Proteasome Inhibitor
The p roteasom e was validated as an effect ive oncolo gy target wi th the clinic al success of 
intraveno us and subcutaneous bor tezomib (VELCADE®), the first -in-class, s mall molecule 
proteasom e inhibi tor devel oped by  Millennium . 
Building on the efficacy seen wit h 
bortezomib in MM and other hematologic mali gnan cies, Millennium has subseq uently 
develope d oral  MLN9708 to improve the p harmacol ogy of the agentand provide a mo re 
conveni ent m ode of drug administrati on.
Like VELCADE, MLN9708 i s a m odified pepti de boroni c acid. MLN9708 i s the ci trate 
ester of MLN22 38,thebiologically act ive form that potently , revers ibly, and select ively 
inhibi
ts the prote asom e. MLN9708 was formu lated to i mprove the ch emical  properti es of 
MLN2238 for clinical delive ry. MLN9708 rapi dly hydroly zes to MLN2238 upon contact 
with either plasma or aqueous sol utions. In contrast to bortezomib , MLN9708 dem onstrates 
a faster dissocia tionrate from  the prote asom e, pos sibly result ing in enhanced tum or 
penetrati on, exhibits ant itumor activit y in a broader range of tumor xenografts, and has more 
prolonged ti ssue penetrati on.
MLN2238 preferen tially binds the 5 site of the 20S proteasome w ith a concentration 
producing 50% inhibit ion (IC50) of 3.4 nM. At higher concentrations, it als o inhibits the 
activit y of the 1 and 2 sites. MLN2238 was selecti
ve for the proteasome when tes ted 
against a pa nel of proteases (IC 50values b etween 20 and 100 M), kinases (IC 50values 
> 10M), and recept ors (IC 50values > 10 M). MLN2238 and bortezomi b have different 
5 proteas ome dissoci ation half -lives (t 1/2), refl ecting differences in their on -off binding 
kinetics (the 5 proteasome dissoc iation [t 1/2] forMLN 9708 and bortezomib is 18 and 
110minutes, respectively). Based on these favorable characte ristics, MLN9708 is 
anticipated to be effect ive against MM.

MLN9 708is the first investi gational oral  proteaso me inhibitor in clinical trials in humans 
with safety, tolerabilit y, PK, pharmacod ynamics, and disease response assessed in each 
phase 1 and ph ase 1/2 study . As of 30 Apr il 2012, 382 patients have been treated with
MLN9708 across 9 enrolling sponsor -led ph ase 1 or phase 1/2 studies with a twi ce-weekly  
(TW) and a weekly dosing schedule b eing evaluate d. MLN9708 is available as an 
intravenous and or al formulation. Regardless of the route of administration in the TW
dosingschedule, MLN9708 is g i ven on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 -day cycle. In the weekly 
dosing schedule, the drug is given o n Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle. 
To date, the developm ent of  oral MLN9708 has foc used on m ultiple myel oma (rel apsed 
and/o r refractory  as well  as newly  diagnosed) and a different y et rel ated pl asma c ell

1.4   Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism
Clinical IV and oral  PK data s how that MLN9708 (m easured as the bio logically active 
boroni c acid form of MLN9708 [MLN 2238]) has multi - expone ntial disposit ion with a rapi d 
initial phase tha t is largely  over by 4 hour s. Oral MLN9708 is rapidly  absorbed wi tha
median time to first maximum plasma concent ration (T max) of approximately 0.5 to 
2.0hours and terminal t 1/2after multiple d osing of appr oximately  5 to 7 days. Results o f a 
popul ation PK analy sis (N = 137) show t hat there is no relat ionship between bod y surf ace 
area (BSA) or body  weight and cleara nce (CL). Also, based on stocha stic simulat ions for 
fixed dose, exposure s are inde pendent of th e individual pat ient’s BSA. Based on these data,
a reco mmendat ion was made for fixed dosing in clinical trials. An a
bsolute bioavailabilit y of 
67% was determined for MLN9708 using the populat i
on PK analysis. S ee the IB for 
inform ation on the PK for IV dose s of MLN9708.

27is metabo lized by multiple cy tochrom e P45 0 (CYP) en zymes and non -CYP 
enzymes/proteins. At clinically relevant co ncentra tions of MLN2238, in vitro studi es using 
human cDNA- expresse d CY P isozymes showed that no s pecific CYP iso zyme 
predominant ly contributes to MLN2238 cleara nce. At concentrations e xceeding t hose 
observed clinically  (10µM), MLN2238 was metabolized by  multiple CYP i soforms with 
estimated relat ive contribut ions of 3A4 (42.3%), 1A2 (26.1%), 2B6 (16.0 %), 2C8 (6.0%),
2D6 (4.8%), 2C19 (4.8%), and 2 C9 (< 1%). In con trast, at 0.1 µM and 0.5 µM substr ate 
concentra tions, which are cl oser to clinical concentratio ns of M LN2238 fo llowing ora l 
administration of 4 mg MLN2238, non -CYPm
ediated cl earance was observed and seemed 
to play a maj or rol e in MLN2238 clearance in vitr o. These data indicate that at clinically 
relevant concentrati ons of MLN2238, minimal CYP -mediated dru g-drug i nteracti ons (DDIs) 
with select ive CYP inhibitors woul d be expected. In addit ion, MLN2238 is neit her a 
reversible nor a time -depen dent inhibi tor of CYP s 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C 19, 2D6, or 
3A4/5. 
In a recent ly concluded, phase 1 DDI study , the PK of MLN2238 ( maximum [pe ak] 
concentration [Cmax]and area under t heplasma concentrati on versus time curve [AUC]) was 
similar with and withou t co-administrati on of clarithromycin, a stro ng CYP3A inhibitor 
(Study  C16009, Arm  5) [16]; hence, no dose adjustment is necess ary when MLN2238 is 
administ ered wi th strong CYP3A inhibitors. These f
indings are explained by the in vitro 
metabo lism data indicating the lack of a discernible contribut ion of CYP -mediated 
metabo lism at clin ically relevant MLN2238 concentrations. As discu ssed ear lier, no CYP 
isoforms have been ident ified to contribute mea ningfully to MLN2238 metabo lism at 
clinically relevant concentrations, and C YP3A contri butionto total metabolism  was high est 
across all CYP isoforms when characterized at a supratherapeut ic conce ntration of  10 µM. 
Therefore, on the basis of the totalit y o
f information from the clinical clarithro mycin DDI 
study  and the in vitro CY P phenoty ping dat a, it can be concluded that M LN2238 PK is not 
likely  to be al tered upon co -administration with any CYP isoform -select ive inhibitor, 
including strong CYP1A2 inhibit ors. Consistently in the popul ation PK analysis, 
co-administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitor s did not affect MLN2238 clea rance; 
therefore, no dose adjustment is required for patients rece iving st rong inhibitors of C YP1A2. 
MLN2238 may  be a weak affinit y substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not of breast 
cancer resistance protei n (BCRP) or mult idrug resistance associated pr otein (MRP2) efflu x 
pump transporters. MLN2238 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, or MRP2. The potenti al for 
DDIs wi th substrates or i nhibitors of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is, therefore, inferred to be 
low.

1.5   Study Rationale
The recommended course of tr eatment for pati ents wi th newly diagnosed m ultiple myelo ma 
(NDMM) de pends largely on their age and overall healt h, and thus their abilit y to tol erate 
toxic combi nation therapies. For patient s under the age of 65 who are in otherwise good 
healt h, the standa
rd treat ment for NDMM is hig h-dose therapy  followed by  autol ogous 
stem-cell transplantation (HDT -ASCT) with or without maintenance. [17,18] On the other 
hand, HDT -ASCT i s n
ota preferred treatment option for most elderly pat ients. Rando mized 
trials that dem onstrat ed the superiorit y of standard dose versus HDT -ASCT were done in 
patients 65 or y ounger. Moreov er, el derly pat ients are often not able to tolerate the 
accompanying toxicity. Because of this, improvements in survival seen over the past deca de 
in patients wi th MM have been more pronounced in younger pati ents than in elderly  
patients. [19] It is hypothesi zed that the apparen t lackin survival progress in these elderly 
patients m ay be a resul t of treatment -related to xicity burden and/or the inabili ty to deliver 
efficacious therapy. [19]Furtherm ore, wi thin the heterogeneous elderly patient popul ation, 
there is a subset of pat ients who are particularly frail and are especial ly challenging to 
treat. [
18]Themedian age of diagnosis for patien tswith multiple myelo ma is between 
63and 70 y ears, categori zing many  newly diagnosed pati ents as elderly  and thus not 
candida tes for trans plant. [17] This fact, coupled with lagging sur vival improvements in the 
elderly , highlights th e clear medical need to develo p novel co mbinat ion therapies with 
improved efficacy and toxicit y profiles. In el derly pat ients, current treatment options incl ude 
melp halan -containing regimens (decl ining in use in recent y ears due to the known risk of 
leukem ia and myelodysplast ic syndro me wi th melphalan), or a non -melphalan containing 
regimen such as lenalidomide (an immuno modulatory  agent) pl us dex amethasone. 
Individually and in co mbinat ion, the pr oteasom e inh ibitors and immunomodulatory  
analogues (IMiDs) h ave changed the conventional treat ment of NDMM. The combinat ion of 
a
proteasome inhibitor, IMi D, and dexamethasone have shown significant improv ements 
largely  interms of overall response rates an d are now re cogni zed by the Nat ional 
Com prehensive Cancer Ne twork (NCCN) as induction therapy  for both transplant and 
nontranspl a

29were conducted before the a vailabilit y of bortezom ib and the IMi Ds.More recently, the high 
response ra tes reporte d with these agents in transplant -eligible and -ineligible pat ients and 
the reports of similar outcomes when such ag ents arecontinued after the induction period 
and tra nsplant delayed unt il disease progressi on–co mpared to the usual upfront tran splant–
have raised the quest ions of the utilit y of early AS CT and of maintenance therapy  in 
ND
MM. [20-22]
Moreover, despi te the current therapeutic options, the disease is characterized by frequent 
relapses and there re mains a need for more active, safer, and convenient agents as well a s
the 
challenge of co mbining current ly established agents with contemporary novel ones in an 
attempt to achieve lo ng-term disease control .[23] To examine the f easibility of those 
objectives, this study  is proposed based on the result s of bortezomib, Millennium’s first 
generat ion proteaso me inhibi tor, and MLN9708, a next generat ion proteasome i nhibi tor, will  
be administered in co mbinat ion with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Further support for 
MLN9708 in this trial is provided by  Chauhan and colleague s. Based on thei r work in 
invitro model system s, thi s group reports MLN2238 combined with lena lidomide or 
dexamethasone triggers sy nergist ic ant i‒m
ultiple myel oma activity supporting further 
clinical evaluat ion of MLN9708 in co mbination w ith these agents. [
24]
The purpose of thi s study  is to eval uate whether the ad dition of MLN9708 to lenalido mide
anddexa methasone increases efficacy and safet y outcom es in patients with NDMM who are 
transplant ineligible.
1.6   Rationale for t he Combi nation of MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and 
Dexamethaso ne
1.6.1    Combination of MLN9708, Lenali domide, and Dexam ethasone
Standa rdfront-l ine treatment for patients with multiple myelo ma consists of eith er high -dose 
induction antineoplast ic therapy (HDT) fo llowed by  stem  cell transplantati on (SCT) or 
antineoplasti c therapy  alone for those who are not eligible for HDT -SCT. [20,25-28] Oral 
combinat ion of melphalan and prednisone (MP) and MP -based therapi es (VELCADE 
[bortezomib] +MP; Th a
lidomide +M P) have been the standard of treatment recommended 
by the NCCN and European Soci ety for Medi cal Onco logy  and for pati ents withNDMM 
who are not eligible for HDT- SCT. [17,29,30] The VISTA phase 3 study confirms that the 
addition of  VELCADE to MP was m ore active t han MP -alone and produced a hi ghe
rhealth-
related qualit y of life in this popul ation.[31,32] The NCC N gui delines on Mult iple Myelo ma

30Professio nalsrecommend co mbination treatment with a protea some inhibi tor and/or 
lenalido mide plus dexametha sone for the init ial treatment of NDM M in pat ients who are not 
candid ates for stem  cell transplant. Clinical data from mult iple studi es support the 
combinat ion of a proteasom e inhibitor, an IMiD, and a gluco corticosteroi d. The combinat ion 
of bortezomib, le nalido mide, and l ow-dose dexamethason e, as no ted in Sect ion1.5and the 
NCCN guidelines, illustrate s that this co mbination is very  active and well  tolerated in th e
NDMM population. [20,33-35] On the othe r hand, there is also a solid rationale for the 
control  arm of lenalidomide -dexamethasone (plus placebo), which has demo nstrated activit y 
in phase 3 testing in this popul ation.[
36,37] Given that MLN9708 has improved b inding 
kinet ics and pharmaco logicprofile co mpare d with bortezomib, i tis expected that th ese 
differences will translate into similar, if not im proved, efficacy and safet y profiles. [
38]
Preclinical work by Chauhan and colleagues also supports cl inical evaluation of MLN9708 
in combination with lenalido mide and dex a
methasone based on th eir resul ts reporting that 
MLN2238 co mbined with lena lidomide or dexam ethasone tri ggers synergist ic anti ‒mul tiple 
myelomaactivity.[24] Though n o clinical studies have been co mpleted w ith the combinat ion 
of MLN9708, l enalido mide, and dex amethasone (Study C16005 and Study  C16010 are 
ongoing), the data available wit h bortezomib forms the foundat ion for adding the 
proteasome inhibitor in the combinat ion in this study .
In term s of safet y, the toxi cological profile of MLN2238 in nonclinical st udies is generall
y 
consistent with class -based effects of protea some inhibit ion and is similar to what has been 
reported previously in nonclinical studies wi th bortezomib. The most commo n treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAE) of single -agent MLN9708 acr oss all dose leve l cohorts 
regardl ess of causalit y in all phase 1 stu dies reported to date, as discussed in Sect ion1.3, 
were ant icipated based on preclinical data and previous experience wit h bortezomib. Given 
the available cli nical data in Study C16005, the similar nonclin ical toxici ty profil e between 
MLN2238 and bortez omib, the toxicit ies dem onstrated in studies with l enalido mide and 
dexamethasone, and the l ow potenti al for DDI, i t is ant icipated that any  pote ntial for 
overl apping toxicities wi th a combinat ion of MLN9708, lenalidomide, and de xamethasone 
can be monitored in the clinic wit h routine clinical observat ions and clinical pathology  
assessments.
1.6.2    Rationale for MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone Dose and 
Schedul e Selection
Oral MLN9708 administered weekly  onDays 1, 8, and 15 o f a 28-day cycle is supporte d by

31and in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexa methasone. The we ekly schedule was well 
tolerated in in vivo tox icology studi es and was predi cted to allow dosin g on a schedule that 
produced m aximum antitumor act ivity in mouse models. These doses are c hosen based on 
the Study  C16005, which is an open -label, dose escal ation, phase 1/2 study  of MLN9708 
dosing on a week ly schedule (Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28- day cycle) in combinat ion with 
lenalido mide an d low-dose dex amethasone (LenDex) in adult patients wi th NDMM. In the 
phase 1 portion of Study  C16005, 3 ev aluable pat ients were enrolled in each of the 
following cohorts: Coho rt 1 (1.68 mg/m2), Cohort 2 (2.23 mg/m2), Cohort 3 (2.97 mg/m2), 
and Cohort 4 (3 .95 mg/m2). Wh ile 2.97 mg/m2was determined to be the maximum tol erated 
dose (MTD), 3 out of 6 patients wer e not able to rec eive all of their lenalidomi de doses 
during Cyc le 1 due to Grade 2 or 3 rash. Given that the do se of MLN9708 at 2.97 mg/m2
significa ntly compromis ed the doses o f the LenDex background re gimen, and that the dose 
of 2.23m g/m2is very tolerable and clinically active, the sponsor has decided to use 
2.23 mg/m2as the dose for the phase 2 portion of the C 16005 study . Enrollment in 
Study C160 05 has been co mpleted wi th atotal of 65 pati ents (15 in phase 1 and 50 in phase 
2). Final study  results ar e not available, but preliminary data suggests oral MLN9708 give n 
weekly plus lenalido mide and dexamethasone in a 28-day cycle appears well tolerated with 
manageab le toxicit y and encouraging ant itumor ac tivity. Encouraging signs of ant itumor 
activit y were observed with pre liminary overall  response rates ( partial resp onse [PR]) of 
91% and a CR+ very  good parti al response (VGPR) rate of 39% in a setting where patients 
have received a m edian of 4 cy cles o f therapy  (range 1 -15) as of the 30 April 2012 data c ut. 
In the MTD co horts, fat igue was the most comm on AEreported (38%). Other commo n AEs 
(at least 15%) reported include nausea (32%); constipat ion (30%); upper respirat ory 
infect ion (23%); peripheral ede ma(21%); thrombocy topeni a, vo miting, and diarrhea (1 9% 
each); anemia, fever, and back pain (17% each); and dysgeusia (15%). Skin toxicit y, 
primarily ery thematous ra sh, occurred in 62% of pati ents (of n ote, rash is an ove rlapping 
toxicity with MLN9708 and lenalido mide). Peripheral neuropathy was reported in 13% of  
patients; Grade 3 in 1 pat ient. The data today  support further clinical study  of MLN9708 in 
combinat ion with LenDex in pat ients with NDMM.
This recommended start ing dose of 2.23 mg/m2is translate d into a fixed dose of 4.0 mg 
based on the results fr om popul ation PK analysis. A population PK model was built using
data from  both the TW and W IV (N = 86) and ora l (N= 51) dosi ng regimens (N = 137).
Popul ation PK anal ysis showed that MLN9708 PK can be well described by  a 
3-compartment m odel with linear e liminat ion for IV data and with a n addit ional absorption 
compartment (first order absorption) for oral administr ation (PO) data . Covariate an alyses

32indicate that interpatient variability in B SA and/or body weight did not significantly 
contribute to the variability in CL and volume of distribution in the central compartment 
(V2). CL and V2 are the PK parameters that will affect AUC and C max. The lack of a 
discernable relationship between BSA and MLN9708 CL based on data in 137 patients over a relatively wide BSA range (1.4-2.6 m
2) indicates that total systemic exposure (AUC) 
following fixed dosing should be independent of the individual patient’s BSA (see 
Figure 1-1) . Accordingly, the starting dose of MLN9708 in the phase 2 portion of
Study C16005 is a fixed dose of 4.0 mg, based on the recommended dose of 2.23 mg/m2
(using mean patient BSA of 1.86 m2from the 2208 MM patients in bortezomib clinical trials 
for conversion to fixed dose).

341.6.4   Rationale for the Comb ination of MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and 
Dexamethasone in Patients with Hig h-Risk Cytogenetic Characteristics 
The clinical outcome of multiple myeloma patients is highly variable and can be related to 
specific cytogenetic subtypes. Abnormalities such as t(11;14), t(6;14), and hyperdiploidy are 
associated with neutral or favorable prognosis  while t(4;14), t(14;16), deletion of 17p, and 
amplification of 1q21 impart an unfavorable prognosis. [50] Some reports suggest that 
bortezomib treatment, in combination with le nalidomide, is able to overcome the adverse 
effects associated with high-risk cytogenetics , whereas other studies show contradicting 
results. Recently Dimopoulos et al., has described the outcome of these subtypes in the context of patients with relapsed and refractory MM treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) with or without bortezomib. [51] In this study poor risk cytogenetic 
populations were associated with lower response rate, which was significant in the RD arm 
(p = 0.01), but not in the RD with bortezomib (VRD) arm (p = 0.219). The adverse effect of del13q, amp(1q21), and t(4; 14) were more pronounced mainly for the RD-treated patients.
Despite the responses observed in the high-ris k cytogenetics groups with VRD, the PFS and 
OS in these patients, especially the del(17p) group, was significantly worse than standard 
risk patients (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017 respectively). One potential reason the VRD responses 
in del(17p) did not translate into improved time to event could be the difference in length of treatment between RD and VRD arms. Patients  enrolled in the RD arm were treated until 
progression or until unacceptable toxicity arise. Differently, patients enrolled in the VRD 
arm received the treatment for only 8 cycles, then VELCADE was dropped, and patients who did not progress at that time were treated with RD until progression. 08, Len8, Len

35The aggressiv e del(17p) myel omas may  requi re long-term treatment with a proteasome 
inhibitor. This hypothesis is further supported by  Neben at al ., where i t was shown that 
VELCA DE based treatm ent bef ore and after ASCT in NDMM improves outcome in pat ients 
with del(17p) compared to control  therapy .[ 52]In thi s pha se 3 study , the b ortezomib, 
adriamycin, and dex amethasone regi men was co mpared to vincrist
ine, adriamycin, and 
dexamethasone . PFS and OS were compared in the whole populat ion and spe cifically  in the 
high-risk cy togeneti c popul ations. Median PFS and OS (3 y ears) rates were at least 
comparable or superi or in the bortez omib-containing arm co mpared to the standard arm. 
However, a statistically significant difference was found only for patie nts carrying the 
del(17p) abnorm ality. PFS in del (17p) -positive patients w as 26.2 months in the bortezomib 
containing arm , com pared to 1 2 months in the standard arm. Similarly, 3 -year OS benefit in 
patients wi th del(17p) was 69% in the bortezomib -containin g regimen vs 17% in t he 
standard arm , while it was 80% in the bortezomib a rm versus 85% i n the standard arm  in 
patients w ithout del(17p) .
1.6.5    Minimal Residual Disease Assessment
Com plete response re mains the optimal objec tive in front -line treatment of mye loma to 
improve survi val. The definit ion of CR has evolved in recent years from norm aliza tion of  
serum  protein electropho resis and bone marrow morphol ogy with negat ive immuno fixation 
to norm al serum free light -chain ratiotest (stringent CR), and more rece ntly to normal 
immuno phenoty pic response (IR). Immunophenotyping defines a tumor’s surfac e ma rker 
profile via flow cy tome try and is high lysensi tive to the presence of tumor cells in marrow 
specimen s. Pati ents wi th tumor cells below the detection thresho ld(1MM cell in 
~10,000cells) are considered to be in a flow cytometric r emissio n. Altho ugh the long-term 
utilit y of this approach is s till in its early  day in MM, several studies have indicated th at 
MRD -negat ive patient s experienced longer PFS and OS th an flow cy tometric
-positive 
patients. Recent ly, Paiva and colleagues fro m Salamanca, Spain , have investigated the 
impact of IR versus CR and stringent CR in 260 newly  diagnosed el derly ( 65 years) 
patients wi th multiple m yeloma treated wi th novel agents i n the PETHEMA/GEM 05 
trial.[53] In thi s trial, IR showed significant ly increased 3 -year rates of PFS and TTP as 
compared w ith those in st ringent CR or CR (90% vs 69% and 60%, and 96% v s 71% and 
68% [p 0.001], respectively). On a mult ivariate COX regressio n anal ysis forPFS, only IR 
status was an indep endent prognostic fac tor (rel ative risk, 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] , 
1.4-12.0; p 0.01).

36In this study, the assessment of MRD will be done using bone marrow aspirates collected 
when a patient is suspected to have reached CR at any time during the conduct of the entire 
study. A repeat bone marrow aspirate will be obtained at Cycle 18 for only those patients 
who have maintained a CR until that point. This repeat bone marrow aspirate may be collected up to 4 weeks after Cycle 18, Day 1 to assess MRD.
If a patient has had MRD testing because of a suspected CR within 2 cycles of Cycle 18, 
then this repeat MRD assessment does not need  to be performed. Samples are required to be 
sent to a central lab for analysis. These samples will be processed according to the Laboratory Manual.
1.6.6   Ration ale for Bone Disease Assessment
Bone disease is a common feature of MM, occ urring in more than 80% of patients, and can 
result in bone pain, fractures, spinal c ord compression, and hypercalcemia. There is 
increasing evidence that bortezomib has a positive effect on bone metabolism, and 
MLN9708 may have a similar positive effect. Bortezomib therapy has been associ ated with
a reduction in bone disease-related myeloma progre ssion events, increases in bone density, 
and favorable changes in bone biomarkers. [54] The phase 3 VISTA trial randomized 
682 patients with NDMM to melphalan/predni sone with or without the addition of 
bortezomib. The bortezomib group had lower rates  of disease progression due to worsening 
bone disease (3% vs 11%), lower rates of bisphosphonate use (73% vs 82%), and a lower 
requirement for subsequent radiotherapy (3% vs 8%). [55]
This study will build on the VISTA trial by studying skeletal-related events (SRE), bone 
density,  
 using blood samples.
1.6.7   Rationale for Selected Subgroups
If the test for PFS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population is not statistically significant at the 
first IA, PFS will be tested at IA2 in both the ITT population and in 3 prespecified subgroups: 1) p atients with ba seline creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 60 mL/min; 2) p atients 
aged < 75 years; and 3) patients harboring high -risk cytogenetic abnormalities defined as 
del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and amp(1q21). These subgroups were selected on the basis of
recent data suggesting the potential for treatment benefit in these patients:

37[56-59] . Therefor e, it coul d be clinically plausib le that in a re nally impaired (CrCl 
≤60 mL/min) or older ( ≥
75years) subp opulation, the already higher risk/benefit 
ratio (less tol erabili ty with less efficacy) is further affected by the addit ion of a thi rd 
agent.
In add ition, the International Myelo ma Working Group c onsensus has recently 
identified cytogenetic a bnorm alities asconferring poor prognosis [60,61] . However, 
patients harboring high -risk cy togene tic abnormal ities may  derive parti cular benefit 
in this tri al on the basis of data showing improved treatment outcomes in patients 
with relapsed and/or refractory mu
ltiple myelo ma treated wi th ixazo mib (MLN97 08) 
in combinat ion with lenalido mide/dexamethaso ne in Study  C16010 and in patients 
with newly  diagnosed m ultiple myelo ma treated wit h another proteasome inhibitor 
(bortezomib) [62-65] .
1.7   Potential R isks and B enefits
As of the clinical cutoff date of 30 April 2012, 382 patients across 9 ongoing sponsor -led 
studi es have been treated with MLN9708. Clin icalsafet y data in cludes experience fro m 
patients who received mu
ltiple cycles fo llowed by treatm ent-free peri ods and fro m patients 
who reduced or discont inued treatment. The emerging safet y profile indicates that the AEs 
reported with MLN9708 are consist ent with the known effects of proteasome inhibit ion and 
are simi lar to what has been previously reporte d wit h VEL CADE, thoug h the frequency and 
severit y may slightly differ. While so me of these potential toxicit ies m ay be severe, they  can 
be managed by  clinical monitoring an d standard medical interventio n. It is possible that 
MLN9708 will have toxicit ies th at were no t predi cted from its evaluat ion in nonclinical 
studi es or previ ously  observed in ongoing clinical studies. To mit igate the inherent risks in 
clinical studi es of MLN9708, pati ents are m onitoredclosely for an ticipated toxi cities. 
Guidance for the management of AEs and procedures for reducing doses are provided in the 
protocol s, and drug dosage can be reduced by eit her reducing the dose administere d orby 
interrupti on of the scheduled treatment w ithin a cycle.

434.   STUDY DESIGN 
4.1   Overview of Study DesignThis is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, mult icenter study in patients with NDMM to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral  MLN9708 versus placebo when added to 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Adult patients  with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic 
MM who have not received previous antimyeloma treatment, who are ineligible for 
high-dose therapy plus stem cell transplantation (HDT-SCT) because of age (ie, ∀65 years) 
or coexisting conditions per investigator judgment, who are candidates for treatment with LenDex as their standard therapy, and who meet all other eli gibility criter ia (see Section  5) 
will be enrolled in this study. Approximately 701 patients will be enrolled in the study.
The following describes the study desi gn before Amendment 5 was implemented.
General eligibility criteria may be assessed prior to the formal Screening period if it is part 
of standard clinical practice. However, formal screening will occur during the Screening period, which may last for up to 28 days prior to rando mization. A M illennium
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MPI)/designee clinician w ill confirm patient eligib ility prior to 
randomization by the investigator.
Following the Screening period, patients to be enrolled will be randomized to receive 
MLN9708 or placebo in a double-blind fashion, in addition to the background therapy of 
LenDex. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into those 2 treatment arms, 
stratified by age ( #75 years vs ∀75), International Staging System (ISS) (stage 1 or 2 vs 
stage 3), and BPI-SF worst pain score ( #4 vs ∀4) at screening.
Patients will receive study drug (MLN9708 4.0 mg or matching placebo capsule) on Days 1, 
8, and 15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg) on

60 mL/min (or 50 mL/min, according to local label/pract ice) but 30 mL/min will 
receive a reduced lenalido mide dose of 10 m g once daily  (QD) on Day s 1 through 21 of a 
28-day cycle. The lenali domide dose may  be escalated to 15 m g QD after 2 cy cles if the 
patient is not responding to treatment and is tolerating the treatment. If renal fun ction 
norm alizes (ie, creatinine clea rance >60mL/min or > 50 mL/min, according to lo cal 
label/practice) and the pati ent continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalidomide may then be 
escalated to 25 mg QD. Dose modificat ions may be m ade throughout the st udy based on 
toxicities.
Patients m aycontinue to receive treatment as detailed previo usly for18cycles, or until 
progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxi city, whichever com es first. After 18 cy cles, 
patients rem aining on treatment will cont inue the study drug regimen in the same

45The treatment period o fthe study  is defined as any time a pat ient is receiving any  of the 
study  drug regimen and will be co mprised of 28 -day treatment cy cles.Patients will be seen 
at regular treatment c ycle intervals while th ey are parti cipat ing in the study: weekly for the 
first 2 cycles, twice a treatm ent cycle during the third cy cle, and then once a treatment cy cle 
for the rem ainder of their participati on in the treatment period, until they experience disease
progression or discont inue for alternate reasons. Patients will t hen enter ei ther the PF S 
follow-up period (for patients who discont inue before disease progressi on) or the OS 
follow-up period (for pat ients who have disease progression during the t reatm entperiod).
Patients will be assessed for disease response and progr ession by the invest igator and an 
IRC. Response will be assessed according to the IMWG uniform r esponse cri teria 
(Secti on15.11 ) for all  patientsevery cycle du ring the treatment peri od. F or pati ents who 
discont inue treatm ent before disease progression, response will also be assessed in 
accordance with the IMWG uniform response criteria every 4 weeks during the PFS 
follow-up period unt il disease pr ogression is co nfirmed o r the patients are started on another 
anticancer therapy ;radiographic disease assessments are to be performed every 8 weeks for 
patients with documented extramedullary  diseas e. Following di sease progressi on or start of 
another anti cancer therapy ,patients will enter the OS fo llow-up peri od and wi ll be contacted 
every 12 weeks unt il death or terminat ion of the study  by the sponsor. All subse quent 
anticancer therapies for MM will bereported as part of the OS fo llow-up peri od 
assessme nts. Inaddition, patients who receive a subsequent anticancer the rapy for MM will 
be assessed by  the invest igator (according to the IMWG uniform response criteri a 
[Secti on15.11 ]) for disease response ( at minim um,disease pro gression) to determine PFS2 
on the next line of the rapy. Response assessments should be made using local laboratory  
resul ts, and the frequency  will be determined by the invest igator (r ecom mended every  
12weeks). Results will be recor ded in t he electronic c ase report form (eCRF) every 
12weeks until PFS2 is reported or a new (third) line of ant icancer therapy  is started, 
whichever comes first.
Pain ev aluat ion (using the BPI -SF) will incl ude quant ified ass essments of intensit y, 
frequenc y and du ration,degree of disco mfort, locati on, and likely relationship to MM 
(versus co morbidities). Time to pain progression will be based on pain assessments using 
theworst pain item on the BPI -SF rated on a scale fro m 0 to 10, collected as outlined in the 
Full Schedule of Events .Health -related qualit y of life (QOL) will also be evaluated through 
patient self -reported i nstrum ents including the EORTC QLQ -C30, M Y

An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) review edsafet y and efficacy data at the 
2 planned IAs. See Section 9.2for more informat ion. 
As of Amendment 5, the 2 planned IAs have been conducted (data cutoff date of 
15February 2018 for the first IA and data cutoff date of 02 D ecember 2019 for the second 
IA). However, in the seco nd IA, the primary endpoint of P FS di d not reach statistical 
significance. Thus , the planned final analysis will not occur andthe study  is now unblinded .
Although the primary endpo int was not met, p atients in both treatment arms appeared to 
receiv e benefi t. As s uch, pati ents deriving clinical benefit may cont inue their c urrent study  
treatm ent if t here are no other means of accessing the study  drugs ,until such t ime as other

break, chew, or o pen the capsule s. Study  drug shoul d be taken on an empt y stom ach, at l east 
1 hour before or no sooner than 2 hours after a m eal. The cap sule shoul d be swall owed wi th 
water. A total of approx imately 240 mL of water should be taken with the capsules. 
Missed doses can be t aken as soon as the patient remem bers as long as the next scheduled 
dose i s 72 hours or m ore away . A double do se should n ot be taken to m ake up for a missed 
dose. If the patie nt vomit s after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the d ose but 
shoul d resume dosing at the time of the next sc hedul ed dose.
6.2   Background Therapies
6.2.1    Lenalidomide Administration
During the first 18 cycles of treatment, lenalidomide will be gi ven as a single, daily, oral 
dose of 25 mg for a total of 21 day s out of a 28 -daycycle. Pati ents wi th a low creat inine 
clearance 60 mL/min (or 50 mL/min, according to local label/practic e) but 30mL/min 
will receive a reduced lenalido mide dose of 10 mg QD on Days 1 through 21 of a 28 -day 
cycle. The lenalidomide do se may be escal ated to 15 m g QD after 2 cycles i f the pati ent is 
not responding to treatment and is tolerat ing the treatment. If renal f unction norm alizes 
(ie,creatinine clearance > 60 mL/m in or > 50 m L/min, according to loca l label/pract ice) and 
the pati ent continues t o tolerate thi s treatment, lenali domide m ay then be escalated to 25 mg 
QD. 
After 18 cy cles o f treatm ent, if t he patient is still receiving the study  drug regimen, a 
reduced l enalido mide oral dose of 10 mg daily will be given as on the same schedule as 
above. If the dose of lenalido mide w as reduced to 5 mg during the first 18 cy cles of 
treatm ent, the patient will remain on t he 5 m g dose after 18 cy cles of treatm ent (see 
Table 4-1).
Administrati on of  lenalido mide wil l be at approximately the same ti me each day , and may  
be wit h or without food. Patients should be instructed t o swallow l enalido mide capsules 
wholewith water and not to break
, chew, or open the capsules. 
If a patient misses a dose of lenalido mide, he/she may st ill take it up to 12 hours after the 
time they  woul d norm ally take i t. If more than 12 hours have elaps ed, they  should be 
instructed to skip the dose for that day . The next day , they  shoul d take l enalido mide at the 
usual t ime. A patie nt should not t ake 2 doses of lenalido mide to ma ke up for the one that

55they missed. If the patient vomits after taking a dose , the pati ent shoul d not repeat the d ose 
but shoul d resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.
Patients who take more th an the prescrib ed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed to 
seek emergency  medical care if needed and contact study  staff immediately . 
Upon implementation of this amendment, lenalidomide may be administered as commercial 
REVLIMID or as generic lenalido mide through clin ical tri al material .
6.2.2    Dexame thasone Administration
During the first 18 cycles of treatment, dexamethasone w ill be give n as a single, oral dose o f 
40mg/day weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28 -day cycle. Pati ents over 75 years old (at 
rando mizat ion) will receive a reduced dose of dexamethasone (20 mg, same schedule).
After 18 cy cles o f treatm ent, if the pati ent is still receiving the study  drug regimen, 
dexamethasone wi llbe discont inued.
Dexamethasone should be taken at approximately t he same t ime ea ch day . 
Each dose of 
dexamethas one shoul d be taken wi th food or li quid (i e, milk) to avoid stomach irritation,
according to the l ocal label/pract ice. 
If a dose of dexametha sone is missed, the dose should be taken as soon as the patient 
remembers as lo ng as the next scheduled dose is 72 hours or more away . A double dose 
shoul d not be taken to m ake up for a missed dose. If th e patient vomits after tak ing a dose, 
the pati ent sh ould not repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next 
scheduled dose.
6.3   Dose- Modification Gu idelines
The patient will be evaluated for possible toxicit ies that may have oc curred afte r the 
previous dose(s) according to the Schedule of Events . Toxi cities are to be assessed 
according to the NCI Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
versio n4.03. Each adverse ev ent shoul d be att ributed to a specific drug, if possible, so that 
the dose m odifications can be made accordingly. Reduction or discont inuat ion of 1 agent 
and not t he other is appropriate if the toxicity is suspected to be related primarily  to 1 of  the 
agents; however, dose reduction of multiple agents is permitted for overlapping toxi cities 
after consul tation wi th the Millennium clinician/study  clinic ian designee. P rior to beginning 
the next cycl e of treatm ent, refer to the guidelines in Section 6.5.

56Further cl arificat ion can be obtained in consultation wi th the Millennium  clinician/study  
clinician designee. If multiple to xicities are noted, the dose a djust ments and/or delays should 
be made according to the highest CTCAE toxicit y grade.
Alternative dose modificat ions may be recommended after discussio n with the invest igator 
and MPI clinician/designee to maxim ize exposure of study  treatm ent while protect ing 
patient safet y. After init iation of lenalido mide and dexamethasone , dose m odificat ion of 
those drugs should be based on individual pat ient treatm ent tol erance, as described in the 
PI/Sm PC.

of treatment.
6.4.1    Dose Adjustments for Hematologic and Nonhematologic Toxicity: Study 
Drug and Lenalidomide
A decisio n regarding dose reducti on of  study drug and/or lenalido mide will be dependent 
upon the toxicit y, its onset, and time course. Alternative dose mo dificat ionsmay be 
recommended after discussio n with the invest igator and Millennium clinician/study  clinician 
designee to maximize exposure of st udy treatm ent while p rotecting patient safet y given that 
there m ay be overlapping dose -limit ing toxicit ies (eg , thrombocy topeni a, neutropeni a, rash,

646.5   Criteria for Toxicity Recovery Before Beginning the Next Cycle of Treatment
The cri teria for toxi city recovery before the patient can begin the next cycle o f treatment ar e 
as fo llows:
ANC 1,000/mm3
Platelet coun t 75,000/mm3, and 
Other clinically significant nonhematologic toxicit ies ≤Grade 1 (or to the patient’s 
baseline condit ion)
Based on attribution o f toxicity to a parti cular drug in the study  drug regimen (see 
Secti on6.4), hol d the study drug until reso lution of toxicit y. A patient i s to then be r estarted 
on the study  drug at the next l ower dose. If a patient fails to meet the criteria above for 
beginning the next cy cle of treatment, init iation of the next cycle should be delayed for 
1week. At the end of that time, the patient should be re -evaluated to determine whether the 
criteria for retreatment have been met.
The m aximum  delay  allowed before treatm ent should be perm anent ly discont inued (except 
in the case of invest igator deter mined clinical benefit and discussio n with the MPI/designee 
clinician )will be 3 weeks.
6.6   Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures
The fo llowing m edicat ions and procedures are prohibited while the patient is on the study  
drug regimen. Note that th e excluded conco mitant medicat ion informat ion has been updated 
to ref lect the available in vitro metabo lism and clinical drug -drug interaction information as 
of Amendment 2. Pl ease refer to Section 1.4and the IBfor addit ional details.
Systemic treatm ent wi th any of the fo llowing metabolizing enzyme inducers should be 
avoided, unless there is no appropriate alternative medicat ion for the pati ent’s use 
(Rati onale: If there were to be a drug -drug i nteractio n with an ind ucer, MLN2238 exposure 
woul d be decreased.)
Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, rifapent ine, rifabut in, carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
and phenobarbital
Excluded medicinal products include St. John’s wort.

65The fo llowing procedures are prohibited while the pa tient is on the study  drug regimen:
Any ant ineoplast ic treatment other than study drug regimen
Radiotherapy  (note that, in general, the requirement for local radiotherapy  indicates 
disease progressi on). Palliat ive local radiotherapy  for pain control  in a p reexis ting 
lesion at baseline may  be considered after agreement with the Millennium/designee 
clinician
Platelet transfusions to help patients meet eligibilit y criteria are not allowed
6.7   Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
All necessary  suppo rtive care consistent with optimal patient care will be available to 
patients, as necessary . All blood products and concomitant medications received from first 
dose of the study  drug regimen unt il 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the 
eCRFs.
The fo llowing m edicat ions and procedures are permitted while the patient is receiving the 
study  drug regimen: 
Myel oid growth factors (eg, granulocy te col ony stimulating factor [G -CSF], 
granulocy te macrophage -colony st imulat ing factor [GM -CSF]) are permit ted. Thei r 
use should fo llow the product l abel, published guidelines and/or institutional 
practi ce.
Erythropoi etin will be allowed in this study, but given the potential increased risk of 
DVT when ery thropoi etin is administered concurrent with le nalido mide , the use of 
erythropoi etin should be minimized as much as possible.
Patients shoul d be transfused with red cells and platelets as clinically indicated.
Concomitant treatment with bisphosphonates will be encouraged for all pat ients with 
evidence of lytic destructi on of  bone or wi th osteopenia, according to the American 
Society of Clinical  Oncol ogy Clinical Practice Guidelines or institutional practice in 
accordance with the product label, unless specifically  contraindicated. If 
bisphosphonate ther apy was no t started pri or to the study  start, i t shoul d be ini tiated 
as soon as clinically indicated.

66Supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care may be given throughout 
the study .
6.8   Precautions and Restrictions
When digoxin was co -administe red wi th lenalido mide, the digoxin AUC was not 
significant ly different; however, the digoxin C maxwas increased by 14%. Periodic 
monitoring of digoxin plasma levels in accordance with clinical judgment and based 
on standard clinical pract ice in pat ients receiving this medicat ion is recommended 
during administration of lenalido mide.
Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of treatment and during treatment .
Nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avo ided wit h impaired 
renal funct ion given re ported NSAID -induced renal failure in pat ients with decreased 
renal funct ion.
6.9   Contraception Requirements
It is not known what effects MLN9708 has on human pregnancy  or devel opment of the 
embry o or f etus. Lenalido mide is structurally related t o thalido mide. Thalido mide is a 
known human teratogenic act ive substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects. 
Therefore, female patients participat ing in this study should avoid beco ming pregnant, and 
male pat ients should avo id impregnat ing a female pa rtner. Female patients of childbearing 
potenti al (FCBP) and m ale pat ients should use effective methods of contraception through 
defined periods during and after study treatm ent as specified b elow. 
Definition of FCBP
All countri es except Canada: This proto col defines a FCBP as a sexually mature 
wom an who: 1) has not undergone a hy sterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 
2)has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea fo llowing cancer therapy  
does not rule out childbearing potential) for at lea st 24 cons ecutive months (ie, has 
had menses at any  time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
Canada: This protocol defines a FCBP as a sexually  mature wom an who: 1) has not 
undergone previous bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy  or hysterectomy  or 2) has n ot

time in the preceding 12 consecut ive months)
All females of childbearing potential m ust ei ther:
Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line wit h the preferred and usual 
lifest yle of the patient, for at least 28 days before starting the stu dydrug regimen 
through 90 da ys after the l ast dose of study treatm ent (peri odic abst inence 
[eg,calendar, ovul ation, symptothermal, post -ovulati on methods] and wi thdrawal  are 
not acceptable methods of contraception) OR
Agree to use 2 reliable methods of contraception, at the same time, for at least 
28days before starting the stu dydrug regim en through 90 da ys after the l ast dose of 
study treatm ent
oThe 2 m ethods of reliable contraception must include 1 highlyeffect ive method 
and 1 additional effect ive (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified 
provi derof contraceptive methods if needed. Th e foll owing are examples of 
highly effect ive and addit ional effective methods of contraception:
Highly effect ive methods:
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Tubal ligat ion
Partner’s vasecto my
Addit ional effect ivemethods:
Condom
Diaphragm  + spermicide 
Cervical Cap + spermicide 
Must also adhere to the guidelines o f the Revlimid REMS (formerly known as

counseling must be documented.
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembo lism in pat ients with multiple 
myelo ma taking lenalido mide and dexamethasone, combined oral contr aceptive pills 
are not recommended. If a pat ient is currently using combined oral contraception, the 
patient shoul d swi tchto 1 of the effect ive methods listed above. The risk o f venous 
thromboembo lism continues for 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuing co mbine d oral  
contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during 
co-treatm ent wi th dexamethasone.
Male pati ents, even if surgically  sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), must either:
Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in lin e with the preferred and usual 
lifest yle of the patient (periodic abst inence [eg, calendar, ovulat ion, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception) OR
Agree to use effect ive barrier contraception during the ent ire study  treatm ent peri od 
and through 90 days after the last dose of study  treatm ent if thei r partner i s of

6.10   Management of Clinical Events
Prophylaxis Against Risk of Infection
Patients m ay be at an increased risk of infect ion including reactivation o f herpes zoster and 
herpes simplex viruses. Ant iviral therapy such as acyclo vir or valacyclo vir may be init iated 
as clinically indicated.
Hypotension
Symptom atic hypotensio n and orthostatic hypotension with or wi thout syncope have been 
reported with MLN9708. Blood pressure should be closely monitored while the pat ient is on 
study  treatm ent and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting of

69concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased appetite. Patients 
taking medicat ions and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either hypo -or 
hypertensio n) shoul d be managed according to standard clinical pract ice, including 
considerations for dose adjustmen ts of their concomitant medications during the course of 
the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of any drug in th e study  drug 
regimen and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydrat ion.
Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
While on lenalido mide, patients should be on routine thromboprophylaxis. [6]Prophylact ic 
therapy  with aspirin (70 -325 m g PO QD, or equivalent dose per country  product l abel [PI 
or Sm PC]) or LMWH (equivalent to enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous [SQ] per day ) per 
published standard or inst itutional standard of care i srequi red for all pat ients to prevent 
thromboembo lic co mplicat ions that may occur with lenalidomide -based regimens in 
combinat ion with dexamethasone (see Section 5.1, incl usion criterion 8 for details on the 
mandatory  use of LMWH).
Nausea and/or Vomiting
Standard antiemet ics including 5 -hydroxy tryptamine 3 serotonin receptor (5 -HT3) 
antagonists are recommended for emesis if it occurs once treatment is init iated; proph ylactic 
antiemetics may also be considered at the physician’s discret ion. Dexamethasone should not 
be administered as an ant iemetic. Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of any 
drug in the study  drug regimen , and during treatment .
Diarrhea
Prophylactic ant idiarrheals will not be used in this protocol. However, diarrhea should be 
managed according to clinical practice, including the administration of antidiarrheals once 
infect ious causes are excluded. Fluid intake should be maintained to avoid dehydrat ion. 
Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of any drug in the study  drug regimen, and 
during treatment .
Erythematous Rash With or Without P ruritus
Rash has been reported with both lenalido mide and MLN9708. The lenalido mide -induced 
rash is characterized as generalized, maculopapular, morbilliform, urticarial, papular, often 
with pruri tus, and is noted as a warning/precaution in the lenalido mide PI.[68,70 ,71]Serious 
skin react ions such as Stevens -Johnson Syndro me, toxi c epidermal  necrolysis, and ery thema

70multiforme have been reported. Lenalidomide interruption or discont inuat ion shoul d be 
considered as described in the PI/SmPC. [68]
Rash may  range from  som e erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular bumps that 
may or m ay not be pruri tic over a few areas of the body , to a m ore generalized eruption that 
is predo minately on the trun k or extremit ies. Rash has been most commo nly characteri zed as 
maculopapular or macular. To date, when it does occur, rash is most commonly reported 
within the first 3 cy cles of therapy . The rash is often transient and self -limit ing, and is 
typically  Grade 1 to 2 in severit y. As in any  other oncol ogy trial, rash may  occur in pati ents 
receiving placebo and in patients receiving MLN9708. If rash occurs, consideration should 
be given to alternate causes of the rash such as concomitant medicat ions, infect ions, etc.
Symptom atic m easures such as ant ihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topical) have been 
successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically  in subsequent cy cles. 
The use of a topical, IV, or oral steroid (eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per day or equivalent [see 
Secti on
 15.5]) is permitted. Management of a Grade 3 rash may require IV ant ihistamines or 
corticosteroi ds. Administration o f MLN9708 (and/or other causative agent if given in 
combinat ion) should be modified per protocol and re -initiated at a reduced level fro m where 
rash was noted (also per protocol) (see Table 6-3).
In line with clinical practice, dermatology  consul t and bi opsy of Grade 3 or hi gher rash or 
any SAE involving rash is recommended. Prophylactic measures shou ld also be considered 
if a pat ient has previously deve loped a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol -free emo llient cream 
on dry  areas of the body  or oral  or topi cal antihistamines).
The rare risks of Stevens -Johnson syndro me, toxic epidermal necro lysis, drug re action with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), and pemphigus vulgaris have 
been reported in oncology  studi es when MLN9708 (or placebo) was given wit h concomitant 
medicat ions that are known to cause rash (eg, Bactrim, lenalido mide, aspirin ), and/or in the 
setting of confounding TEAEs. These s evere, potent ially life-threatening or deadly 
condi tions may  involve rash with skin peeling and mouth sores and should be clinically 
managed according to standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for hi stopa thol
ogical 
analysis are encouraged at the discret ion of the investigator. Addit ional information 
regarding these reactions can be found in the IB.

71Thrombocytopenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly as outlined in theprotocol  with addi tional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practi ce. Thrombocy topenia m ay be severe 
but has been manageable with platelet transfusions according to standard clinical pract ice. 
Lenalido mide or study  drug administration should be modified as noted as pe r dos e 
modificati on recommendat ions in theprotoc ol when thrombocy topeni a occurs (see 
Table 6-1). Therapy  can be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of platelet counts.
Thromboti c microangiopathy (TMA), in cludi ng thrombotic thrombocy topenia purpura and 
hemo lytic uremic syndro me, are rare, serious blood disorders that cause low levels of 
platelets and red blood cells and result in blood clots in small blood ves sels. Symptom s may  
include fat igue, fever , bruis ing, nose bleeds, and decreased urinat ion. These disorders can 
occasi onally  be fatal. 
TMA shoul d be m anaged symptom atically according to standard 
medical pract ice.
Neutropenia
Blood counts sh ould be m onitored regul arly as outlined i n theprotocol  with addi tional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Neutrop enia may be severe but has 
been manageable. Growth factor support is not required but may be considered according to 
standard clinical pract ice. Lenalido mide or study drug admin istrati on shoul d be m odified as 
noted as per dose modificat ion recommendat ions in theprotocol when neutropenia occurs 
(seeTable 6-2). Therapy  can be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of absolute 
neutro phil co unts.
Fluid Deficit
Dehydrat ion shoul d be avo ided since lenalido mide is substant ially excreted by  kidney , and 
MLN9708 may  cause vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration . Acute renal failure has been 
reported in patients treated with MLN9 708, commonly  in the setting of the above -noted GI 
toxicities and dehydration. Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of any  drug in 
the study drug regimen and during treatment to avoid dehydration (see Sect ion 6.8).
Poste rior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
One case of posterior re versible encephalopathy syndro me, which ult imately reso lved, has 
been reported with MLN9708. This condit ion is characterized by headache, seizures, and 
visual loss, as well as abrupt in crease in blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed by

condi tion is reverse d by control  of hyperten sion or other inst igating factors. 
Transverse Myelitis
One case of transverse myelit is has been reported with MLN9708. It is not known whether 
MLN9708 causes transverse myelit is; however, because it happened to a patient receiving 
MLN9708, the poss ibilit ythat MLN9708 may  have contributed to transverse myelit is 
cannot be excluded. Transverse myelit is should be managed according to standard medical 
practi ce.
Overdose
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administ ration of  investi gational 
drug, to or by  a study  subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual 
subject according to the study  protocol . If overdose occurs, consider close observation 
including hospitalizat ion for hem odynamic support. G astric lavage may be con sidered if 
instituted wi thin 1 hour of ingest ion of MLN9708 over dose.
6.11   Blinding and Unblinding
To m aintain the blind, all study  personnel including the investigators, site personnel, study  
clinicians, and the sponsor will be blin ded to the treatm ent ass ignments for the duration of 
the study . When a patient is discon tinued fro m the study  drug regimen, the invest igator can 
request to know the patient’s actual study  drug assignment upon approval from the 
Millennium clinician/ study  clinician designee (conta ct inform ation is in the Study  Manual). 
The invest igator will pr ovide a j ustificat ion for the request (eg, why  knowing the study  drug 
assignment will aid decisio n making as to the patient’s subsequent anticancer treatment or 
why thi s information is requi red to investi gate and treat a suspected study  drug -related 
toxicity).
Treatment assignments will be obtained through the interactive vo ice/ web response system 
(IXRS) according to the procedures outlines in the Study  Manual. Inform ation regarding the
treatm ent assi gnments will be kept securely at Millennium or designee, per its standard 
operating procedures. Emergency unblinding, if necessary, will be conducted via the IXRS.
Records of the patient number, the date each drug in the stu dy drug regimen w as disp ensed, 
and the treatment assignment will be maintained by  the study  site. If  the treatment 
assignment must be revealed for the safet y of the pati ent or to treat an AE, the invest igator

73will contact the Millennium clinician/ study  clinician designee. A deci sion to break the blind 
must be reached by the Millennium clin ician/study clinician designee and the invest igator. 
The invest igator, or designee, may break the blind through the IXRS independent of the 
Millennium clinician/ study  clinician designee if it is considered to be an emergency  by the 
investigator that requi res specific knowledge of the blinded study  treatm ent in order to 
properly treat the AE/safet y issue. If the treatment of the AE/ safet y issue is the same 
regardl ess of t he study drug ass ignment , the blind should not be broken. In addit ion, the 
patient wil l be discont inued fro m further study  drug administration in this study .
As of Amendment 5, the second IA has been conducted and the primary  endpoint of PFS did 
not reach statistical signi ficance . The study is now unblinded globally. Individual pat ient 
treatm ent assi gnments are now available in the IXRS. Patients deriving clinical benefit may 
continue their current study  treatment if there are no other means of accessing the study  
drugs ,until such time as other means of accessing the study  drugs are arranged.  When 
possible, patients should co mplete an EOT visit and transit ion onto a commercial sup ply of 
ixazo mib and/or lenalido mide or other standard of care treatment.  
Patients who are receiving ixazo mib and lenalidomide will cont inue to receive ixazo mib and 
lenalido mide. Patients who are receiving placebo and lenalido mide will receive 
lenalido mide only; the placebo capsule will no longer be administered and patients receiving 
placebo will  not be crossed over to ixazo mibin this study .
For pati ents continuing on study , the m ajority of study  assessments are discontinued to ease 
the burden o f protocol -mandated assessments. Discontinued pat ients will be treated b y their 
physician per standa rd of  care .

strategies to deliver study  drug to pati ents (eg, vi a couri er or si te staff), per local standard 
practiceand regulations. Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the patient to 
ensure compliance w ith dosing procedures. Patients who are receiving take -home 
medicat ion shoul d be given only  1 cycle of medicati on at a tim e. More than 1 cycle of 
medication may be dispensed on a case -by-case basis for holidays, tr avel, or other 
circumstances upon discussi on wi th the invest igato r and sponsor’s project clinician/designee
(Note: patients in France are only permi tted to receive 1 cy cle of  medicat ion at a time) .
Shoul d more than 1 cycle of medicat ion be dispensed, the invest igator and/or healt hcare 
provi der m ust revi ew the proper do sing instructions with t he patient to avoid the potential 
for inco rrect self -administrati on or overdose of medicat ion.
Patients should be instructed to store the medicat ion according to the storage condit ions that 
are outlined in the Pharmacy Manual or equ ivalent storage guidelines for the duration of 
each cy cle. Pati ents shoul d be instructed to return their empt y cartons to the invest igative 
site, rather than di scarding them, as permitted by  site policy . Recon ciliat ion will occur 
accordingly when the patie nt returns for their next cy cle of  take -home medicat ion. In case of 
extenuat ing circumstances that prevent a patient fr om attending th e study  site (eg, the 
COVID -19 pande mic), drug packs and dosing diaries should be returned at the next 
avail able on -site clinic visit. Any extre me in temperature should be reported as an excursio n 
and should be dealt with on a case -by-case basis.

treatm ent do sing decisio ns, local hematol ogyand chemistry  laboratory  resul ts may be used; 
however, samples must still be sent to the central laboratory  in parallel. The central 
laboratory  resul ts will  be used for determination of 
eligibilit y criteria. Pati ents m ay have 
central  laboratory assessments repeated when discrepant results between the central and 
local laboratori es are observed. Hematology  and chem istry panels may  be collected up to 
3days before Day  1 dosing and 24 hours b e fore Days 8, 15, and 22 dosing, whe re requi red. 
Local  laboratory  evaluations m ay be done m ore frequent ly at the invest igator’s discretion, 
ie,for acute management of TEAEs. Hand ling and shipment of central clinical laboratory  
samples are outlined in the
Study Manual.
Please consult y our ce ntral laboratory  manual for the turnaround times in obtaining the 
central  laboratory  resul ts. The si te must all ow an adequate am ount of time fo r these samples 
to be processed and include this in the planning during the Screening period. If the samples 
have been submitted to th e central l aboratory  but were unable to be processed for technical 
reasons and the end of the screening window is approach ing, the si te may submi t local 
laboratory  resul ts for consi derat ion by the M
PIproject clinician or desi gnee. The se samples 
shoul d be repeated an d dispatched to the central laboratory  before the pati ent receives their 
first dose of study  treatm ent. However , when approved by the MPI proj ect clinician or 
designee, the central la boratory resul ts do not need to be availa ble if the MPI proj ect 
clinician or desi gnee has approved eligibilit y based upon local laboratory  resul ts.
As the l aboratory  resul ts may  not be a
vailable at the init iation of the next cy cle, i t is not 
requi red that thesemeasurements be reviewed before ini tiating the next trea tment cy cle
unless either of the fo llowing applies:
1.The patient has an ongoing toxicit y. If the pati ent has had a toxi cityresulting in a

Treatment of Cancer)
The QOL asse ssments (EORTC -QLQ -C30 and MY- 20; see Sections 15.9 and 15.10 ) will be 
completed by  the pat ient as specified in the Full Schedule of Events (before implementation 
of Amendment 5).The EORTC QLQ -30 incorporates 5 funct ional scales (physical 
funct ioning, role functioning, emotional funct ioning, cognit ivefunctioning, and social 
funct ioning), 1 global health status sca le, 3 symptom scales (fat igue, nausea and vo miting, 
and pain), and 6 single items (dy spnea, inso mnia, appetite loss, const ipation, diarrhea, and 
financial difficult ies). The time recall per iodfor this instrument is 1 week (the we ek 
immediately  preceding t he as sessm

The MY- 20 m ultiple myel oma module (20 -items) has 4 independent subscales, 2 functional 
subscales (body  image, future perspective), and 2 symptoms scales (disease symptoms an d 
side-effects of treatment). This will b e administered subsequent to theEORTC QLQ -C30.
These are reliable and valid measures of heal th-related QOL in patients with cancer and 
takes about 15 minutes to administer. The instruments consist of a total of 50 items and have 
been validated and used in many countri es.

7.4.15    Pain As sessment
Pain assessments will be performed at study  visits as described in the Full Schedule of 
Events (before implementation of Amendment 5). Patients who exper ience new or 
worsening pain between scheduled visits should be seen at an un scheduled visit, if 
necessary , or when the next scheduled visi t is more than 4 weeks in the future. At the 
unscheduled visits, pain assessments should be completed and appropriate managem ent 
instituted. In addit ion, pati ents who report new or worsening pai nateither a regularly 
scheduled visit or are seen for pain a t an unscheduled visit should have a fo llow-up visi t 3 to 
5 weeks l ater for confirmat ion of the pain progressio n and f or appropriate pain management.
The Bri ef Pain Inventory -Short F orm (BPI -SF)willbe the principal pain assessment tool for 
this study . The BPI -SF contains 15 items designed to capture the pain severit y (“worst,” 
“least,” “average,” and “now” [current pain ]), pa
in locati on, medicat ion to relieve the pain, 
and the interference of p ain with various daily act ivities including general act ivity, mood, 
walking act ivity, norm al work, rel ations wit h other people, sleep, and enjo yment of life.
The quest ionnaire empl oys a 24-hour recall period. The pain severit y items are rated on a 0 
to 10 scale
,with 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as y ou can imagin e. The PRO key  
secondary endpoint will be “pain response rate” as measured by  the worst pain item (Item 3) 
in the BPI -SF o r analgesic use. The use of the single it em, worst pain, i s supported by the
Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment i n Clinical Tri als (IMMPACT) 
recommendat ions for assessing pain in clinical trials and by  the European Medi cines 
Agency 2003 G uidance on Clinical Invest igation of Medicinal Products for Nocicept i ve 
Pain issued by the Co mmittee for Proprietary Medicinal Prod ucts. In addit ion, the newly 
released Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance uses the following example while 
discussingconceptual  frameworks: “The conceptua l framework of a PRO instrument may be

7.4.27    Resp onse Assessment
Patients will  be assessed for disease response according to the IMWG uniform  response 
criteria, versio n 2011 (see Section 15.11 ).[72]
Response assessments are made on the basis o f central  laborato rydata and should occur 
every cycle durin g the treatm ent period (until  disea
se progression is confirmed) unt il PFS 
significance has b een cl aimed for this study . At that time, central efficacy  and invest igator 
assessments for protocol purposes will be stop pedexcept for invest igator assessment of 
PFS2. For pat ients who di scont inue t reatm ent before disease progression, disease response 
should occur every  4 weeks durin g the PFS follow -up period until disease progression is 
confirmed or the patient is started onanother ant icancer therapy  (see the Full Schedule of 
Events [before implementation of Amendment 5]), or until PFS significance has been 
claimed for the study .
The MPI/designee clinician will confirm the i nvestigator assessment of PD pri or to the 
investigator taking the pat ientofftreatm ent. A treatment discont inuat ion form must be 
subm itted and approv ed pri or to rem oving a pati ent from study  treatm ent for disease 
progression, toxicit y, or any  other reason .
Patients who go on to receive a subsequent line of ant icancer therapy  willbe further 
evaluated for disease response (at minimum dis ease progression ) to confirm disease 
progression for determinat ion of PFS2. Response assessments will be made using local 
laboratory  resul ts, and the freq uency  will be determined by the invest igator(recommended 
every 12 weeks). Response assessments, inclu
ding the treatm ent received and date of second 
disease progressi on, shoul d be reported in the eCRF every  12 weeks as part ofthe OS 
follow-up period assess ments.

8.   STATISTICAL AND QUAN TITATIVE ANALYSES
The second IA has been performed (data cutoff date of 02December 2019) and the primary 
endpo int of PFS did not reach statist icalsignificance. Therefore, nosubsequent formal 
inferential statistical analyses will be co nducted
. The primary  analysis o f efficacy and safet y 
was performed on dat a from the sec ond IA and will be p resented in a clinical study  repor t 
(CSR) . Minimal descript ive analyses will be performed on patient data collected after the 
second IA and will be presented in a future CSR add endum . The description of the statistical 
methods presented belowreflects the original design and the pl anned analysis for the study ,
reflecting the stati stical consi derati ons up to the second IA.
8.1   Statistical Methods
In general, summary tabulat ions will be presen ted by  treatm ent arm  and will display the 
number of observat ions, m ean, standard deviat ion, median, minimum, and maximum for 
continuous variables, and the number and percent per category  for categori cal data. The 
Kaplan -Meier survival curves and 25th, 50th(median), and 75thpercent iles will  be provi ded 
alongwith their 2 -sided 95% CIs for time -to-event data.
Details for the anal yses will be provided in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will 
be written by  Millennium and will be finalized prior to the formal IA.

SAP; any further m odificat ions will be noted in the final clinical study  report.
8.1.1    Determination of Sample Size
The primary  object ive of this stud y is to determine if MLN9708 plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone im pr oves PFS compared wit h placebo pl us lenalidomide and dexa methasone 
in patients with newly diagnosed MM. The study  will not be stopped after the PFS analysis, 
however, even if a significan t PFS i s observed, in order t o obtain an adequate s tatistical 
power for OS. 
The total sample size o f approximately  701 pati ents was calculated based on maintaining 
80% power to test the OS. The study  is also adequately powered to test PFS. There are 
2planned IAs and 1 FA.
Assuming a hazard ratio of 0.70 (median PFS of 25 m onths in control  arm versus 
35.8 months in treatment arm ), 370 PFS events will be needed (92% power and 2 -sided 
alpha of 0.04) wi th up to 2 planned PFS analyses conducted at the first IA and potentially 
second IA of this study  using the Gam ma(-1) alpha-spending function.
The sample size adaptation rule is a pre specified stepwise funct ion to avoi d the back 
calculat ion problem result ing fro m one sample size corresponding to either barely pr omising 
or highly promising i nterim results. The sa mple size adapta tion rule was desi gned by the 
sponsor’s independent design statist ician and approved by the sponsor’s head of 
biostatistics. Neither the independent design statistician nor the head of bio statistics is 
involved in the study  conduct.

99Eligible pat ients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into those 2 treatment arms, stratified by: 
age (75 years vs 75), ISS (stage 1 or 2 vs stage 3), and BPI -SF wo rst pain score ( 4 vs 
4) at scr eening.
8.1.3    Populations for Analysis
The populat ions used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Safety population: The safet y popul ation is defi n
edas all pat ientswho receive at least 
1dose of any study  drug. Pati ents will be analyzed according to the treatm ent actually  
received. That is, those patients who are randomized to the active arm bu t receive the 
regimen in the control arm will be inclu dedin the contr olarm; those patients who are 
rando mized to the con trol arm but receive the regimen in the a ctive arm will be included in 
the active arm for safet y analyses.
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) popul ation: The ITT population is defined as all pat ients whoare 
rando mize d.Patients will  be analyzed according to the treatment the y are rando mized to 
receive, regar dless of any  errors of dosing. 
Per-Protocol (PP) population: The PP population is a subset o f the ITT population. The PP 
popul ation consists of al l patients who d o not have major protocol vio lations, as determined 
by the study  clinician, who is blinded to study  drug assi gnment . All decisio ns to excl ude 
patients f rom the PP popul ation will be made before the unblinding of the study .
Response -Evaluabl e
population: The response- evaluable popul ation is defined as pat ients 
who have measurable disease at baselin e, who receive at least 1 dose of any study  drug, and 
have at least 1 postbaseline response a ssessed by  an IRC.
8.1.4    Procedures for Handling Missing, U nused, and Sp urious Data
All available efficacy and safet y data will be included in data list ings and tabu lations. Data 
that are potentially spurious or erroneous will be examined according to standa rd data 
management operating procedures.
In general, m issing data will be treated as missing and no data imputation will be appli ed, 
unless otherwise specified. Fo r pati ent reported outcomes data, primarily  missing data 
imputati on will be based on publishe d instrum ent specific methods. Other missing data 
impu t
ation methods, such as last observat ion carry forward and mult iple imputat ion 
methods, may be explored as se nsitivity analyses for pati ent reported outcom es data.

100For the key  secondary  endpoints CR rat e, missing value is defined as no post -baseline 
respon seassessment ei ther due to l ost to f ollow -up or wi thdrawal  by patient. In the primary 
analysis, if the respo nse assessment in either arm is missing on comparing response rates, it 
will be counted as a failure (non -responder) instead of a missing value. Th e procedure to 
dealwith missing data in the primary analysis for the pain response rate will be using the 
same method as CR rate.
8.1.5    Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The demographic and baseli ne characteri stics will be summarized in a descript ivef
ashion. 
Data t o be evaluated will include age, gender, race, weight, base line disease characterist ics, 
and other parameters, as appropriate.
8.1.6    Efficacy Analysis
A closed sequential testing procedure will be used to test the primary endpo ints and all 3 key
secondary  endpoints with the f ollowing testing order:
1.PFS (primary  endp oint) in the ITT population at the first or both IAs (see 
Secti on8.1.1 )
 and PFS at IA2 in 3 prespecified subgroups: 1) patients with ba seline 
CrCl  >60 mL /min; 2) patients aged < 75 years; and 3) patients harbo ring high -risk 
cytogeneti c abnorm alities defined as del(17p), t( 4;14), t(14;16), and amp(1q21) ; 
2.OS (first key  secondary  endpoint) at the IAs or FA; 
3.CR rate (second key  secondary  endpoint) at the IAsor FA; and 
4.pain response rate (third key  secondary  endpoint) at the IAs or FA. 
OS will be tested at the IAs or FA at the significance level determined by the O’Brien -
Fleming alpha spending funct ion (the Lan -DeMets method). CR rate wil l
be tested at t he
same alpha level as that for OS whenever OS reaches stat istical significance. Pain respons e 
rate will be tested at the same alpha level as that for CR rate whenever CR rate reaches 
statist ical significance. Due to the closed sequential t esting property , the family -wise ty pe I 
error i s strongly controlled for both  the primary endpoint an d key  secondary  endpoints (see 
Secti on 8.1.10 ).
All other efficacy  endpoints will  be tested at a 2 -sided alpha level o f 0.05.

1018.1.6.1   Analyses for Prim ary Efficacy Endpoints
The analysis of primary endpoint, PFS, will be ba sed on the IRC -assessed progression data. 
PFS i s defined as the time from the date of rando mizat ion to the date of first documentation 
of PD or dea thdue to any  cause, whichever occurs first. Patients without documentation of 
PD will be censored at the dat e of last response assessment that is stable disease (SD) or 
better. 
A 2-sided, stratified log -rank test will be used to compare the treatment groups with respect
t
oPFS. In addit ion,an unadjusted stratified Cox model will be used to estimate the hazard 
ratio and i ts 95% CIs for the treatment effect using the stratificat ion factors. The Kaplan 
Meier (K -M) survival curves and K -M medians (if estimab le), along wi th their 2-sided 
95% CIs , will also be provided for each treat ment group. 
Sensit ivity analyses for PFS include:
1.PFS assessed by  invest igator will be analyzed in the ITT populat ion
2.PFS assessed by  IRC will  be analyzed in the per protocol popul ation
PFS assess edby IRC using different censoring mechanisms will be anal yzed in the ITT 
popul ation, for ex ample, not censoring for patients who discontinue treatment and go on 
alternat ive antineoplast ic therapy. Details of different censoring approaches will be include d 
in the SAP.
Subgroup analyses will be performed for PFS r elative to baseline stratificat ionfactors, 
demographic data, such as sex, race, and age, and disease characterist ics, such as ty pe of 
prior regimen.
8.1.6.2    Analyses of Key Secondary E fficacy
In addit ionto the prima ry com parison of PFS, there are 3 key  secon dary endpoints, whi ch 
will be test ed sequent ially.
Overall Survival
OS is defined as the time fro m the date of rando mization to the date of death. Patients 
without documentation of death at the tim e of analysis wi ll be censored at the date last 
known to be alive. OS will be analyzed based on the ITT populat ion.

102A 2-sided, stratified log -rank test will be used to compare the treatment groups with respect 
to OS in IAs, and Cui -Hung -Wang (CHW) test sta tistics will be used in FA testing to con trol 
the Type I er ror. The test significance level a t the IAs and FA i s decided by  the O’Brien -
Fleming alpha spending funct ion (the Lan -DeMets method). In addit ion, an unadjusted 
stratified Cox model will be used to es timate the ha zard ratio and its 95% CIs for the 
treatm ent effect using the stratificat ion factors. The K -M survival curves and K -M m edians 
(if estimable), along with their 2 -sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment 
group.
Subgroup analyse s will be perfor med for OS relative to baseline stratificat ion factors, 
demographic data such as sex, race, age, and disease characteristics such as t ype of prior 
regimen. 
CRRate
The CR rate is defined as the proportion of patients who ac hieve CR assesse d by an IRC 
relative to the ITT population during the treat ment period. If the response asses sment in 
either arm  is missing on comparing CR rates, it will be counted as a failure (non -responder) 
instead of a missing value.
Stratified Cochra n
-Mantel -Haensze l (CMH) test will be used to com pare CR rates between 
the 2treatm ent arms. A l ogistic regres sion model will be used to estimate the treatment 
effect in terms of odds ratio. The odds ratio and its associated 95% CIs will be presented.
Pain Response Rate 
Painresponse is defined as the occurrence of at least a 30% reducti on from baseline in 
BPI-SFworst pain score over the last 24 hours without an increase in analgesic use for 
2consecutive measurements 28 day s apart.
Pain response rate wi llbe analyzed i n patients with baseline worst pain score ≥4 in the ITT 
populat ion. Pain response rate is th e proporti on of  patients who have a pain response and 
will be summarized by  treatm ent groups. If the pain assessment in either arm is missing on 
comparing pain res po
nse rates, i t will be counted as a failure (non -responder) instead of a 
missing value. The stratified CMH test will be used to compare the 2 treatm ent arm s. In 
addition, the abso lute treatment difference in pain response rate will be provided, alo ng with
95% CI.

Other secondary efficacy parameters include overall response rate (ORR), TTR, time to 
progression, duration of response, PFS2, and OS and PFS in high-risk p opulation defined by 
del(17p), amp(1q21), and translocation t(4;14) and t(14;16).
Disease response-related endpoints will be analyzed using IRC-assessed response rate.
ORR
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved PR or better relative to the ITT 
population. ORR will be analyzed based on the ITT population using the method similar to 
that used in the CR rate analysis.
Time to Response
Time to response is defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of PR 
or better. Time to response for responders will be summarized descriptively.
Time to Progression
TTP is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation 
of PD. Patients without documentation of PD at the time of analysis will be censored at the 
date of last response assessment that is SD or better. TTP will be analyzed based on the ITT 
population using the similar method as PFS.
Duration of Response
DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documentation of a PR or better to the date 
of first documentation of PD for responders. Responders without documentation of PD will 
be censored at the date of last response assessment that is SD or better. DOR will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Progression-free Survival 2
PFS2 is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of second 
documentation of PD or death due to any cause , whichever occurs first. The second PD 
should occur during or after the second line of antineoplastic therapy following study 
treatment but before the third line of therapy. Patients who do not have documented PD will Property of Takeda: For Nppr Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useed byd by

OS and PFS in High -Risk Population
OS and PFS in a high- risk popul ation, defined as patientscarrying del (17p), am p(1q21), 
transl ocati on t(4;14), or t(14;16) will be analyzed using t he similar method as PFS and OS in 
ITT populat ion.
8.1.7    Analyses of Patient -Reported Outcomes and Health Economics
8.1.7.1    Patient -Reported Outcomes Analysis
PRO a ssess ments using the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the MY -20 will be analyzed using the 
ITT populat ion. The analysis will be performed on summary  scores as well  as on subscales 
and individual symptoms.
Differences between treatment groups in the EORTC QLQ -C30 and MY-20 sco reswill be 
evaluated using published minimally important difference (MID) values. Specific i nterest 
centers on physical funct ioning, gl obal quali ty of life summary  scores, and individual item 
scores for fat igue, nausea/vo miting, pain, dyspnea, appeti te loss,and const ipation/diarrhea. 
The m ain endpoint for the PRO analysis will be the global hea lth status/qualit y of life 
subscale o f the EORTC QLQ -C30 and MY- 20. The change in PRO scores between baseline 
and each postbaseline assessment will be describ ed ov erall and accord ing to the response to 
treatm ent. The other PRO endpoints include the remaini ng EORTC QLQ -C30 and MY-20 
subscale and individual item scores. The change in scores will be presented using 
cumulative frequency distribution figures. 
The a nalys isof PRO scores will be performed as a repeated -measures analysis using all

Addit ional analyses on pain beyo nd the key  secondary  endpoint of pain response rate 
include:
Time to pain response, as assessed by the t ime from rando mizat ion to init ial response 
classificat ion
Time to pa inprogressi on, as assessed by the time from rando mizat ion to init ial pain 
progression
Duration of  pain response, m easured as the time from the first documented pain 
response to the first documented pain progression classificat ion
Time to pain pr ogressi on anddurati on of  pain response will be compared using the stratified 
log-rank test betwee n the 2 treatm ent groups. An unadjusted stratified Cox model will be 
used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CIs for the treatment effect using the 
stratificat ion
factors. The K -M survival curves and K -M m edians (if estimable), along wit h 
their 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment arm. Time to pain response 
will be summarized descript ively for pain responders.
Pain progression is defi ned as the o
ccurrence of 1 of the fo llowing and confirmed by 
2consecutive evaluat ions(To qualify as progression, the patient must have a BPI- SF worst 
pain score 4 duri ng pain progression):
A ≥ 2 point and 30% increase fro m baseline in BPI -SF worst pain score wi thout an 
increase in analgesic use, or
A 25% or m ore increase in analgesic use from baseline wit hout a decrease in BPI -SF 
worst pain score from baseline
Analgesic use change can be inc reased, stabl e or decreased, as specified in the SAP. 
A sensit ivity analysis will be conducted on pain progression without confirmat ion by 
2consecutive assessments. Confirmat ion is not required if surgical treatment for pain, 
palliat ive radiat ion for pain, or subsequent antineoplastic therapy has been receive prior to a 
confirmatory  assessment (refer to Table 15-2 for a list of Step II and III analgesics). In

8.1.9    Safety Analysis
Safety will be evaluated by  the incidence of AEs, severit y and t ype of AEs, and by changes 
from baseline in the pat ient’s vital signs, wei ght, and clinical laboratory  results using the 
safet y popul ation. Exposure to the study drug regimen and reasons for discont inuat ion will 
be tabulated.
Treatment -emergent AEs that occur after adm inistrati on of  the fi rst dose of study  drug 
regimen and through 30 days after the l ast dose of study  drug regimen will be tabulated. 
AEs will be tabulated according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) and will include the fo llowing categories: 
Treatment -emergent AEs
Drug -related treatment -emergent AEs
Grade 3 or higher treatm ent-emergent AEs
Grade 3 or higher drug
-related treatment -emergent AEs
The m ost comm only reported treatm ent-emergent AEs (ie, those events reported by  
10% o f all pat ients)
SAEs
A listing of treatment -emergent AEs result ing in study  drug regimen dis continuat ion will be

Development of new or worsening of exist ing SREs (eg, new fractures [including vertebral 
compressi on fractures], i rradi ation of or su rgery  on bone, or spinal cord compressio n) from 
baseline through the development of PD will be summarized and presented.
Descript ive statistics for the actual values of clinical laboratory parameters (and/or change 
from baseline in clinical laboratory  para meters) will be presented for all scheduled 
measurements over time. Mean laboratory  values o ver time will be plotted for key  
laboratory  parameters.

and weight wi ll be tabulated by  scheduled t ime point. ECOG performance scores will be 
summarized using a shift table.
Shift tables for laboratory  parameters will be generated based on changes in NCI CTCAE 
grade fro m baseline to the worst postbaseline value. Graphical d isplays o f key safety 
param eters, such as scatter plots of baseline versus worst postbaselin e values, m ay be used 
to understand the MLN9708 safet y profile.
All conco mitant m edicat ions collected from screening through the study  period will  be 
classified to preferred terms according to the World Health Organizat ion (WHO) drug 
dictionary.
Two ty pes of incidence rates will be calculated for the safet y popul ation based on the new 
primary  malignancy  assessment:
Incidence proportions, defined as the percentage of the subjects reporting any  new 
primary  malignancy  in the safet y popul ation with available in formation
Incidence rates, defined by  the number of the subjects reporting any  new primary  
malignancy divided by the total duration of fo llow-up (pati ent-years = pt- yrs) in the 
safet y popul ation with available informat ion up to the onset of new primary 
malignancies
For incidence proportions, the relat ive risks, defined as the ratio of incidence proportions 
between the 2 randomized treatment groups, were provi ded al ong wi th their 95% CIs. For 
incidence rates, the relat ive risks, along with their 95% CIs, wil l be calculated using an 
exponent ial regressio n model for lifet ime data (assuming constant hazards). 
Due to the dist inct nature of hematologic and no nhem atologic neopl asms, as well as the 
emerging signals of new primary  malignancies for immunomodulating agents, analyses of 
new primary malignancies may be performed separately  for hematol ogic and non -
hematol ogic malignancies.
Addit ional safet y analyses m ay be performed to most clearly  enumerate rates of toxicit ies 
and to further define the safet y profile o f MLN9708.

1098.1.9.1    Time to Resolution and Improvement of Peripheral Neuropathy Events
Peripheral  neuropathy  is defined as the treatment emergent adverse eve nt in the high -level 
term of peripheral  neuropathi es NEC according to MedDRA.
A PN event is considered as resolved if its final outcom e is resolved with no subsequent PN 
event of the same preferred term occurring on the reso lution date or the day  before a nd after. 
A PN event is considered as improved if the event improves fro m the maximum  grade. That 
is, all the grades recorded after the maximum grade is less than the maximum grade.
Time to resolution and time to improvement are to be defined for each PN e vent. Time to 
resol ution is defined as the time fro m the init ial onset date (inclusive) to the resolut ion date 
for resolved events. Time to improvement is defined as the time fro m the init ial onset date 
(inclusive) of the maximum grade to the first onset d ate that the toxicit y grade i s below the 
maximum grade wit h no higher grade thereafter, or the resolut ion date, whichever occurs 
first.
Time to improvement and time to resolut ion of PN events will be summarized by outcome 
(improvement or resolut ion) using the Kaplan -Meier m ethod. The K -M survival curve and 
K
-M medians (if est imable), along with their 2 -sided 9 5% CIs, will be presented. This 
analysis is event based, thus 1 subject could contribute mult iple observat ions if the subject 
has m ore than 1 PN event .
The analysis may  be conducted for pati ents wi th any PN events or those wi th 
≥2 PN events 
or those ≥3 PNevents, respectively, if data permi ts.
8.1.10    Interim Analysis
There were 2 planned IAs. The first IA wasperformed when 328PFS events hadoccurred. 
The data cutoff date for this IA was 15February 2018 .The test for PFS in the ITT 
popul ation was not sta tistically  significant at the first IA. The second IA wasconducted 
when 378PFS event s hadoccurred. Because the test for PFS didnot reach statist ical 
significance at the first IAin the ITT population, in th e second IA PFS wastested in both the 
ITT pop ulation and in 3 prespecified subgroups, as described below.
The subgroup testing strategy  approach include d2 major com ponents: a) preservat ion of the

110< 75 years; and 3) patients harboring high-ris k cytogenetic abnormali ties defined as 
del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and amp(1q21). Subgroup testing was conducted using the 
remaining ,2= 0.01 and the Hochberg procedure for mu ltiplicity correction (refer to the 
appendix in the SAP for proof of strong control of the Type I error rate). Because the size of 
the treatment effect could be substantially greater in a prespecified subgroup than in the overall study population, analysis of patients in each subgroup at a stringent significance 
level could still provide a statistically signif icant outcome. The detailed statist ical design 
schema is presented in  Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1 Schematic of Statistical Plan
For the testing of PFS in the ITT population, the Gamma(-1) alpha spending function was
used to calculate the significance boundary based on the observed number of PFS events 
with total alpha=0.04. The first IA was perfor med when 328 PFS events had occurred. This 
was the first analysis for PFS for statistical testing purposes.
Because the test for ITT PFS was not statist ically si gnificant at the first IA, response 
assessments continued, and PFS testing in the ITT and subgroup populations was conducted 
in parallel at the second IA, when 378 PFS events  had occurred; this was the FA of PFS for Property of Takor oththe te

ingCommittee
An IDMC supported by  an independent stati stician will review safet y and efficacy  data at 
1planned interim analysis. The IDMC will provide a recommendation regarding study 
continuat ion bas ed on the safet y and efficacy parameters. In th e even tthat the study  is 
terminated early based on the IDMC recommendatio n, Millennium will notify the 
appropriate regulatory  authori ties. In addit ion, the IDMC will periodically review safety  data 
at regular ly scheduled meet ings prespecified in the IDMC charte r. As part of the IDMC 
safet y monitoring, thi s committee will receive reports of all cases of new primary 
malignancies occurring during the trial.
The first formal safet y review will occur after approxim ately  60 subjects (30 i n each arm )

10.   ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1   Definitions
10.1.1    Pretreatme nt Event Definition
A pretreatment event is any untow ard medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any study  
medicat ion; it does not necessarily have to have a causal r elationship with study  
participat ion.
10.1.2    Adver se Eve nt Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal re lationship wi th this treatm ent. An AE can there fore beany 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not i t is rela ted to the m edicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a 
previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent,dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline.

11310.1.3    Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death .
Islife-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more sever e).
Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolo ngatio n of an existing hospitalization
(see clarificati onin the paragraph below on planned hospitalizat ions).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion o f a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threa tening, or require hospitalization, but may be consi dered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or 
involves suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agen t. 
Exa
mples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse ;any organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.
In thi s study , inten sity for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, willbedetermined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010. [79] Clarificat ion should be 
made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe
i
s often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT 
the sam e as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or actioncriteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to

114funct ion. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered seri ous. For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1 000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
10.2   Procedures for Recor ding and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adver se Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent and/or in response to an open question fro m 
study  personnel or revealed by  observati on, physical  examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see S ection 10.3 for the 
period of  observat ion). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptom s indicat ing a 
commo n underlying pathology  shoul d be noted as 1 com prehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Sect ion 10.1) 
must be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observation) by the invest igato r to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (contact informat ion provi ded 
below). This should be done by emailing o r faxing the SAE Form wit hin 24 hours after 
beco ming aw are of the event. The SAE Form, created specifically  by Millennium , will  be 
provi ded to each clinical study  site. A sample of the SAE Form may  be found in the Study  
Manual. Follow -up informat ion on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be requested
byMillennium. SAE report information must be consistent with the dat a provided on the 
eCRF.
The paper SAE forms should be submitted via fax (see fax numbers below) within 24 hours 
of awareness. In case o f 
fax, site personnel  need to confirm successful tr ansm ission of all 
pages and include an e -mail address on the fax cover sheet so that an acknowledgment of 
recei pt can be returned via e -mail wit hin 1 business day . E-mail submissio n of paper SAE 
forms witha PDF attachment should only  be used in the case w here fax is not possible 
within 24 hours of receiving the event.  In c ase of e -mail, site personnel need to confirm 
successful transmissio n by await ing an acknowledgment of the receipt via e- mail within 
1business day. If SAEs are reported via fax or by e -mail , electroni c data capture 
(EDC )/RAVE must be updated as soon as possible with the appropriat e informat ion.

115SAE Reporting Contact Information
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condition 
deteriorated in an unexpected manner during th e trial (eg, surgery was performed earlier or 
later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the even t to study drug administration. For serious 
pretreatment events, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study procedures.
Intensity for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 .[79] The criteria are provided in the 
Study Manual.
Relationship to study drug administration will be determined by the investigator responding 
yes or no to this question: Is there a reasonab le possibility that the AE is associated with the 
study drug?
10.3   Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be monitored throughout the study as follows:Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Sus for anfor an

116!AEs will be reported from the first dose of study drug through 30 days after 
administration of the last dose of study drug and recorded in the eCRFs. AEs should 
be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).
!Serious pretreatment events will be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF) up to first dose of study drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.
!Related and unrelated SAEs will be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the first dose of study drug through 30 days 
after administration of the last dose of study drug or the start of subsequent 
antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first, and recorded in the eCRF. All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or inter current illness(es). In addition, all cases 
of new primary malignancy that occur during the follow-up periods must be 
immediately reported to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee, irrespective of causality to the study drug regimen, from the first dose of 
the study drug regimen through death or until termination of the study by the 
sponsor, whichever comes first. The IDMC  will also receive reports of all cases of 
new primary malignancies occurring during the trial.
10.4   Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of 
age or disease state) of a female patient o ccurring while the patient is on study drug or 
within 90 days of the patient’s last dose  of study drug are considered immediately reportable 
events. Study drug is to be discontinued immediately. The sponsor must also be contacted 
immediately by emailing or faxing a completed Pregnancy Form to the Millennium 
Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (see Section  10.2) . The pregnancy must be 
followed for the final pregnancy outcome. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to  (see Section  10.2)  
immediately by facsimile or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report 
Form or approved equivalent form. The female patient should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. The pregnancy must be followed for the final pregnancy outcome. onsent nsent

117The investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy and must 
notify MPI/Cognizant/BI Medical immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either 
normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form or approved 
equivalent form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e g, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets 
any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to  
immediately by facsimile or other appropriate method within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In a ddition, any infant death after 28 days that the investigator suspects 
is related to the in utero exposure to the investigational product should also be reported to 
 immediately by facsimile or other appropriate method within 24 
hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form or approved 
equivalent form. 
Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the 
male subject taking study drug must notify the investigator, and the pregnant female partner 
should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately. The sponsor must also be 
contacted immediately by faxing a completed Pr egnancy Form to the Millennium 
Department of Pharmacovig ilance or designee (see Section  10.2) . Every effort should be 
made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.
11.   ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS

aThese criteria identify Stage IB and Stages IIandIII A/B myeloma by Durie/Salmon stage. Stage IA 
becomes smoldering or indolent myeloma.
bIf no mo noclonal protein is detected (non-secretory disease), then 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma 
cells an d/or a biopsy -proven plasmacytoma required.
cA varietyof other ty pes of end -organ dysfunctions can occasionally occur and lead to a need for th erapy. 
Such dy sfunction is sufficient to support classification as myeloma if proven to be myeloma related.
d If a solitary (biopsy -proven) plasmacy toma or ost eoporosis alone (without fractures) is the sole defining 
criteria, then 30% plasma cells are re quired in the bone marrow.

aOpioid drugs NOT recomm ende
dinclude meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, partial agonists 
(bupreno rphine), and mixed agonist -antagonists (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine).
bOral morphine equivalent (OME) score is based on an oral morphine dose of 30 mg; t he conv ersion
factor listed is for chro nic dosing. Avoid using morphine in renal failure.
cAvailable in transdermal system for extended dosing. See the calculation below for dose conversion from 
other opioids to transde rmal fentanyl.
dWeak opioid recepto r ago nistwith som eantidepressant activity; for mild to moderate pain. 
Recommended dose of 100 mg 4 times daily (maximum daily dose of 400 mg) to avoid central nervous 
system toxicity. At maximum dose, tramadol is less potent than other opioid analgesics.
Oral Morph ine E quivalence Conversion Calculation
To cal culate the OME score of an opioid in Table 15-2:
X dose of an opio id equivalent to an oral morphine dose of 30 mg
Y dose of that opi oid consumed by  the pat ient in the last 24 hours
OME of that opioid consumed in the last 24 hours Y / X 30
Example: A pat ient consumed 100 mg of oral codeine in the last 24 hours. The OME 
calculat ion is:
X 200 m g
Y 100 m g
OME of oral co deine 100 / 200 30 15 mg

s Bone marrow aspirate (first or second pull preferred) for molecular analysis and cytogenetics are required to be collected and  sent to the central lab within 8 weeks 
of randomization. An additional bone marrow aspirate at relapse, only for patients who initially respond and then relapse, should  be collected. This additional sample 
is optional, but highly recommended.
t Additional cytogenetics may also be done locally (optional) if the site has the capability to perform analysis and sufficient sp ecimen available. Assessment of the 
following should be obtained if possible: amp(1q21), translocations t(4;14) and t(14;16), and del(17p).
u Bone marrow aspirate to be collected for assessment of MRD in all patients suspected to have reached CR anytime during the enti re conduct of the study. In 
addition, a repeat bone marrow aspirate for MRD assessment will be collected at Cycle 18 for only the patients who have maintai ned a CR until that point (this
sample can be collected up to 4 weeks after Cycle 18). If a patient has had MRD testing because of a suspected CR within 2 cycl es of Cycle 18, then this repeat 
MRD assessment does not need to be performed. Samples are required to be sent to central lab for analysis.
v
w If peripheral neuropathy is present at baseline, the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade must be reporte d in the patient’s medical history.
When PN occurs during active treatment on study, each subsequent monthly evaluation will record the CTCAE grade of peripheral n europathy at that visit. (This is 
in contrast to other AEs where only increases in grade are recorded until the maximum grade is reached and then followed at that  grade until complete resolution or 
return to baseline.)  Peripheral neuropathy will be followed every 4 weeks until 1) resolution of peripheral neuropathy, 2) the  start of a second-line alternative 
antineoplastic treatment, or 3) 6 months after disease progression has occurred, whichever occurs first.

16315.13    Amendment 1 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amend ment 1
The primary  rationale for thi s amendment is to add a study  objective evaluat ing progression -
free survival 2 (PFS2), defined as the date from rando mizat ion to the date of second disease 
progression or death fro m any cause, whichever comes first. Proc edures and assessments 
requi red for ev aluation of PFS2 have been added throughout the protocol. 
In addit ion, a second assessment of MRD was added for patients who have an init ial 
confirmed co mplete response.
Directions for administration of lenalido mide a nd dexa methasone were clarified to ali gn
moreclosely  with the package insert and the SmPC. 
Instructi ons for dose modificat ions were addit ionally  clarified based on the evo lving 
understanding of MLN9708 and its overlapping toxicit ies wit h lenalido mide and
dexamethasone. In addi tion, Secti on 6.10, Management of Clinical Events, has been updated 
to reflect the most recent understood safety  profile of MLN9708.
Language was added in case of unblinding to clarify that sites must provide justificat ion of 
unblind ing and receive approval fro m the spon sor before unbli nding.
Other changes clarify study
 procedures, as noted in the following list.
Purposes for Amendment 1
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Add the Intergroupe Francophone du My elome number
Update th e cover page with current signatories
Updatethe study overview diagram to remove subsequent antineoplast ic therapy as a 
grounds for treatment discont inuat ion, add PFS2, and clarify flow of pat ients 
depending on disease response
Clarify  permissible window for obtaining informed consent
Permi t locallaboratory evaluat ion of Cycles 1 and 2, Days 7 and 21 complete blood 
count assessments
Clarify  timing of radiographic disease assessment
Clarify  timing for serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electropho resis, serum 
free light chain assay, a ndimmunofixat ion
Clarify  timing of bone marrow aspirate for molecular analysis and cy togeneti cs
Clarify  timing of bone marrow aspirate for MRD
Clarify  requi red docum entati on of  peripheral  neuropathy
Add co llection of subsequent therapy  and di sease status for assessment o fPFS2
Add the duration of time permitted between randomizat ion and init iation of treatment

Clinical Study Protocol C16014 Amendment 5, 2013-000326-54, 09 July 2020
16615.14   Amendment 1A Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 1A
The primary rationale for this amendment is to establish a continuation of Study C16014 in 
South Korea to enroll additional patients from South Korea only. This amendment describes 
modifications to the global study procedures sp ecifically for patients who enroll in the South 
Korea continuation. Patients from South Korea who enroll in the global C16014 study will 
not be affected. Following completion of enrollment in the global study (701 patients), 
approximately 40 additional patients from South Korea will be enrolled in the continuation.
The South Korea continuation is an extension of the global study that will continue to assess 
the primary objective of progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary objectives of 
complete response rate, overall survival (OS), and pain response rate in patients from South 
Korea. Other secondary objectives that directly relate to disease response assessment, safety, 
and patient-reported outcomes will also be evaluated to thoroughly characterize the efficacy
and safety of MLN9708 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Some 
secondary and exploratory objectives will be explored in the global study but are not 
included in the South Korea continuation becau se they are signal-seeking in nature and 
require a larger number of patients to detect a difference between arms. 
The statistical and quantitative analyses, including timing of the PFS and OS analyses, have 
been revised to reflect the change in sample size. The primary objective of PFS will be 
assessed when approximately 40 PFS events have been reported in patients from South 
Korea (pooled from patients enrolled in the global study and the continuation). OS will be 
assessed at the time of the final analysis of OS  in the global study or when a total of
death events have been reported for patients in South Korea (pooled between global 
study patients and South Korea continuation patients), whichever occurs later, or termination 
of the study by the sponsor.
Purposes for Amendment 1A
The purposes of this amendment are to:
!Update signatories to reflect clinicians involved in this protocol
!Update the number of patients from 701 to 40 to reflect the approximate number of 
patients from South Korea that will be enrolled in the continuation
!Reclassify key secondary objectives and other secondary objectives as 1 category of 
secondary objectives
!Remove secondary objectives (and corresponding endpoints and study procedures) 
that do not directly contribute to the characterization of the efficacy or safety of 
MLN9708
!Remove exploratory objectives (and corresponding endpoints and study procedures) 
that do not directly contribute to the characterization of the efficacy or safety of MLN9708
!Clarify lenalidomide dose modification language for patients with low creatinine 
clearance to align with the South Korean label

16815.15   Amendment 2 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 2
The primary rationale for this amendment is to modi fy the statistical analysis plan to prevent 
early closure of the study in the light of the importance of collecting long-term patient
outcomes data.[86] To do so, an additional IA  has been added later in the study, while 
maintaining the previous first IA for progression-free survival (PFS) at approximately 
326 events. The new second IA will analyze PFS at approximately 435 events only if the 
threshold for significance was not met at the first IA; otherwise, the first IA will serve as the 
final PFS analysis for the study, and the second IA will be conducted to assess overall 
survival (OS) when approximately 250 deaths have occurred. The addition of this second IA 
will safeguard the PFS statistical power at 95%, and serve to determine whether the final 
number of OS events might be increased from approximately 320 death events to up to 
approximately 400 death events using unblinded event re-estimation by an ISC.
In addition, this amendment modifies the study assessments to be performed after PFS 
significance is met. Endpoints relating to disease response (ie, PFS, response rate, time-to-
progression) will not be assessed for protocol purposes  after the primary endpoint is met; as 
such, all efficacy response data (ie, laboratory samples) will stop being collected/sent to the 
central laboratory to minimize the burden on study patients. 
Other changes clarify study procedures, as noted in the following list.
Purposes for Amendment 2
The purposes of this amendment are to:
!Update the title page with current signatories
!Change the order of the key secondary ob jectives to move the complete response 
(CR) objective to appear after the overall survival (OS) objective
!  
 
!Clarify the definition of skeletal-related events
!Add a second IA to assess PFS (only if significance is not reached at the first IA) and 
OS
!Discontinue efficacy response assessments for protocol purposes after PFS 
significance has been met in the study (either at the first IA or second IA), except for investigator assessment of PFS2 (progression-free survival 2 [from rando mization on 
study to PFS on the next line of treatment])

17215.17    Amendment 3 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 3
This document descr i bes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 
No.3. The primary reason for this amendment is to fo llow the independent data monitoring 
committee (IDMC) recommendat ion to include a subgroup analysis approach focusing on 
patients who could derive particular benefit fro m ixazo mib wit h manageable toxicit y. To do 
so, a progression -free survival (PFS) subgroup analys is testing strategy  approach is 
prospectively included to be executed 
at the second interim analysis in para llel with the PF S
analysis in the intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion shoul d the fi rst interim analysis fail to 
demonstrate a stati stically significant PFS advantage in the ITT populat ion. The addit ion of 
this analysis wi ll serve to determine whether the ixaz omib treatment a rm shows superiorit y 
over the placebo control arm on the primary  endpoint of PFS in 3 prespecified subgroups 
using the Hochberg proc edure for mult iplicity correcti on: 1) patients wi th baseline creatinin e 
clearance > 60mL/min, 2) patients < 75 ye a rs of age ,and 3) patients harboring high -risk 
cytogeneti c abnorm alities defined as del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), amp(1q21).
Minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes are included for 
clarification purposes only.

17315.18   Amendment 4 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 4
This amendment describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating 
Amendment No. 4. The primary reason for this  amendment is to modify the statist ical 
analysis plan to ensure timely analysis of the primary endpoint, progression-free survival 
(PFS), in light of the slower than expected PFS event rate over the past year. The second 
interim analysis (IA) – the final analysis for PFS – will now take place when approximately 
370 PFS events have been observed. Power remains sufficient at 92%.
Additionally, this amendment clarifies other elements of the study design and procedures. 
REVLIMID or generic lenalidomide may be administered as part of the study treatment 
regimen.  
 
The requirement to document adverse events that 
require breaking the blind in the electronic case report form (eCRF) has been removed. The 
serious adverse event (SAE) reporting contact information in Japan has been updated from 
Bell Medical Solutions to BI Medical. The duration of new primary malignancy adverse 
event (AE) assessment has additionally been clarified.
Changes in Amendment 4
1.  
2. Update statistical procedures to modify the number of events for the final PFS analysis.
3. Clarify the statistical boundary for PFS at the second IA.
4. Clarify that REVLIMID or generic lenalid omide may be administered as part of the 
study treatmen t regimen.
5. Remove the requirement to document adverse events that require breaking the blind in 
the eCRF.
6. Update the SAE reporting contact information in Japan to BI Medical.
7. Clarify the duration of new primary malignancy AE assessment. 
8. Clarify the locations of study centers.

175Change 2:Added language to clarify ongoing treatment of pa tients —patients shoul d be 
moved off study  and on to commercial supply of ix azomib and/or lenalido mide, if available , 
and otherwise kept on study ).
The primary  change occurs in the Schedule of Events —Amendm ent 5 an d Bey ond:
Added text: As of Amendment 5, the second IA has be en conducted (data cutoff date 
of 02 December 2019) and the primary endpoint of PFS did not reach 
statistical significance. Thus, the planned final analysis will not occur and 
the s tudy is now unblinded. Although the primary endpoint was not met, 
patient sin both treatment arms appeared to receive benefit. As such, 
patients deriving clinical benefit may continue their current study 
treatment if there are no other means of accessing t he study drugs. When 
possible, patients should complete an End of Treatme nt(EOT) visit and 
transition onto a commercial supply of ixazomib and/or lenalidomide, or 
other standard of care treatment.  
Patients who continue to derive clinical benefit but are unable to access 
the study treatments outside of the clinical trial sett ing may continue on 
study and have treatment provided.  Patients who are receiving ixazomib 
and lenalidomide will continue to receive ixazomib and lenalidomide. 
Patients who are recei ving placebo and lenalidomide will receive 
lenalidomide only; the placebo capsule will no longer be adminis tered 
and patients receiving placebo will not be crossed over to ixazomib in this 
study.
Rationale for Change :
To clarify the ongoing treatment of patients in Study  C16014.

180Rationale for Chan ge: To explain that the study  design reflects the study  design before 
implement ation of Amendment 5.
Change 8: Revised information regarding the interim analy sesin theOverview of Study  
Design .
The p rimary  change occurs in Se ction4.1Overview of Study  Design .
Initial text: Two I As are planned to occur during the study. The first analysis wil l be 
performed when approximately 326 P FS events (dise ase progression ordeath) 
have occurred . If the tes t for PFS in the ITT population is statistically significant 
at the first IA, this will bethe final analy sis (FA) fo r PFS for statistical testing 
purposes; central effica cy and investigator assessments fo r protocol purpo seswill 
bestopped and not recorde d in the eCRF except for investigator assessment of 
PFS2 (see Schedule of Events ). In such a case, the second IA will assess OS 
when approx imately 250 death e vents have occu rred. If the tes t for PFS i n the
ITT is not stati stically s ignificant a t the first IA, then central efficacy and 
investigator response ass essments will continue until t he second IA, which will 
assess PFS and OS. 
Upon impl ementation o f this amendment (Prot ocol Amendment 4 ), the seco nd IA
will be conducte dwhen app
roximately 370 PFS event s have occurred (rather 
than the previous study design of 435 PFS events). In additio n, PFS will be tested 
at IA2 in both the ITT populatio n and in 3 prespeci fied subgroups: 1) patients 
with baseline CrCl > 60 mL/min; 2) pat ients ag ed < 75years; and 3) patients 
harboring high -risk cytogenetic abnormalities de fined as del(17p), t(4;14), 
t(14;16), and amp(1q21) .
The final OS analysis will be performed wh en appr oximately 320 to400 deaths 
have occurred withthetotal event s ize calcul ation based on the adapt ive sample 
size re -assessment approach .[66,67] The trial will be stopped for overwhelming 
efficacy if the O’Brien -
Fleming efficacy boundary of OS is cr ossed. 
An inde pendent data monitoring commit tee (IDMC ) will review saf ety and 
efficacy data at the IAs. See Section 9.2 for more information.

Upon impl ementati on of  this amendment (Pro tocol Amendment 4 ), the
second IA will be conduct ed wh en approximately  370 PFS ev ents have 
occurred (rath er than the previous study  design of 435 PFS events). In 
addition, PFS will be tested at IA2 in both the ITT populat ion and in 3 
prespeci fied subgroups : 1)patients wit h base line CrCl  >60mL/min; 
2)patie nts aged < 75years; and 3) patients ha rboring high -risk cy togeneti c

for overwhelming efficacy  if the O’Brien -Fleming efficacy  boundary  of OS is 
cross ed.
An independen t data m onitoring commi ttee (IDMC) will review edsafetyand 
efficacy  dataat the2planned IAs. See Secti on 9.2for more informat ion.
As of Amendment 5, the 2 planned IAs have been conducted (data cutoff 
date of 15February 2018 for the first IA and data cutoff date of 
02Decemb er2019 for the second IA). However, in the secon dIA, the 
primary end point of P FS did not reach statistical significance. Thus , the 
planned final analysis will not occur and the study is now unblinded.
Although the primary endpoint was not met, patients in both treatment 
arms appeared to receive benefit .As such, patients deriving clinical 
benefit may continue their current study treatment if ther e are no other 
means of accessing the study drugs, until such time as other means of 
accessing the study drugs are arranged.  When p ossible, patients should 
complete an EOT visit and transition onto a commercial supply of 
ixazomib and/ or lenalidomide or other standard of care treatment.  
Patients who are receiving ixazomib and lenalidom ide will continue to 
receive ixazomib and lenalidomide. Patients who are rece iving placebo

For patients continuing on study, the majority of study as sessments are 
discontinued to ease the burd en of protocol -mandated assessments. Upon 
impleme ntation of Amendment 5, data collection requirement s will be 
limited to collection of AEs and SAEs. All other study as sessments are no 
longer required. All central laboratory efficacy measures of response and 
progression are discontinued. Bone marrow aspir ates for confirmation of
CR or MRD status are no lo ngerrequired. No further IRC re spon se or 
progression evaluations w ill be performed. Radiographic studies and 
bone density studies for stu dy purposes are no longer required. Quality 
of life and health utilization assessments and collection of concomitant 
medications and procedures are di scon tinued. Patients will not be 
followed for the PFS or OS follow -up periods, as PFS and OS data are no 
longer being collected. Patients may choose to stay in the s tudy if the 
investigator believe s that the patient is conti nuin
gto benefit from the 
treatm ent.Altern atively, the patient may discontinue from the study and 
be treated by their physician according to standard of care. See the 
updated Schedule of Events –Amen dment 5 and Beyond for m ore

2078.1.1   Determination of Sample Size
…The first IA will be performed when approximately 326 PFS events have 
occurred. This is expected to occur approximately 45 months after the first patient is enrolled, including a 27-month enrollment period and additional 18-month 
follow-up from the last patient. 
If the test for PFS in the ITT population is statistically significant at the first IA, 
this will be the FA for PFS for statistical testing purposes, and the second IA will 
assess OS when approximately 250 death events have occurred.  
If the test for PFS in the ITT is not statistically significant at the first IA, then the 
second IA will assess PFS and OS when approximately 370 PFS events have
occurred. In addition, in su ch a case, PFS will be te sted at IA2 in 3 prespecified
subgroups: 1) patients with baseline CrCl > 60 mL/min; 2) patients aged 
< 75 years; and 3) patients harboring high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities defined 
as del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and amp(1q21).
For the final OS analysis, the total event size calculation will be based on the 
adaptive sample size re-assessment approach.[66,67] The minimum event size of 
 death events is based on an optimistic assumption of a hazard ratio of 0.72 
(median survival of 50 months in the control arm vs 69.4 months in the treatment 
arm) with 80% power at a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. The O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function (the Lan-DeMets method) will be used to 
calculate the significance boundary based on observed number of death events in 
each IA with a total of 320 OS events for the FA. In the second IA, if OS significance is not claimed, the conditional power based on OS will be calculated. 
If the conditional power falls in the favorable zone or unfavorable zone, the FA of 
OS with approximately 320 events will remain unchanged. If the conditional power falls in the promising zone, the event size will be determined according to 
a prespecified sample size adaptation rule, with an event cap of ~400 OS events. 
No futility analysis will be performed in the study.
The sample size adaptation rule is a prespecified stepwise function to avoid the 
back calculation problem resulting from one sample size corresponding to either barely promising or highly promising interim results. The sample size adaptation 
rule will be designed by the sponsor’s i ndependent design statistician and

8.1.10   In terim Analys is
There are2 planned IAs. The firs t IA will be performed when approxi mate ly 
326disease pr ogression/death events have occurred. This IA is expected to occur 
approximately 45 months after the fi rstpatient is enrolled. If the test for PFS in 
the ITT population isstatistically significant a t the first IA , this wi ll be the FA f
or
PFS for statisti cal testing purpo ses, centr al efficacy and investigator assessments 
of disease response for protocol pu rposes will be discontinued ( except f or 
investigator assessment of PFS2) given that the primary e ndpoint has been met, 
and the secon d IAwill be conducte d for OS when approximately 250 death
events have occurred. Ifthe test for PFS does not reach statisti calsignificance at 
IA1in the ITT po pulation, 
PFS will be tested in both the ITT population and in 3
prespecified subgr oups, as des cribed below.
The su bgroup testing strategy app roach includes 2 major components: a) 
preservation of the ability to detect the over all treatment effect using a reduced 
overall significance level of 1=0.04, which will beused for the ITT popul ation, 
andb) test of treatment effect for the 3 prespecif ied subgroups: 1) patients with 
baseline CrCl > 60mL/min; 2) patients aged < 75 years; and 3) patients harboring
high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities defined as del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and 
amp(1q21) . Sub group testing will be conducted using the remain ing 2=0.01 and 
the Hochberg procedure for multiplicity correction (refer to the appendix in the 
SAP for proof of strong control of the Type I error rate). Because the siz e of the 
treatment effe ct may be su bstantially greater i n a prespecified subgroup t han in 
the overall study population, analysis of patients in each subgroup a t a stringent 
significance level may still provide a statistically significant outcome. Th e

209detai led statistical design schema is pr esented in Figure 8-1.
[Figure 8 -1]
For the test ing of PFS in the ITT po pulation, t he Gamma( -1)alpha spending 
function willbe used to calculate the significan ce boundary based on the 
observed number of PFS events with t otal alpha=0.04. The fi rst IA will be
performed when approximately 326 PFS events haveoccurred. This will bethe 
first analysis for PFS for statistical testin g purpos es. If the test is statistica lly 
significant, then this analysis will be the FA of PFS fo r sta
tistical testing 
purposes. No subsequent PFS testing will be conducted, and ce ntral efficacy and 
inves tigator assessments of disease response for protocol purposes will be 
discon tinued 
except for the investigator assessment of PFS2 (see the Schedule o f 
Events ). In this scen ario, the se condIA will be for OS testing when 
approximatel y 250 death events have occurred and will determine whether the 
final number of OS events might be increased .
Ifthe test for ITT PFS is not stati stically significant at the first IA, response 
assessments will continue , and PFS testing in the ITT an d subgr oup populations 
will be conducted in parallel at the second IA, when approxi mately 370PFS 
events have occurred (rather than the previous study de sign of 435 PFS events);
this will be the FA of PF S for statis tical testing purposes. If the test for PFS is
significant at the second IA, OS will be tested, and determination of whether the 
final number of OS events willbe increased from 320 to up to 400 will occur. If 
the test fo r PFS in the second IA isnot stati stic
ally significant in any population 
(the ITT or any of the 3 subgroups), the study  will be stopped . 
Because at the time of this amendment , the boundary for I TT PFS at IA1 has 
already been ca lculated based on 328 PFS e vents observed at IA1, 435 PFS 
eventstargeted at PFS final analy sis, and t he Gamma (-1) alpha -spending 
function, this boundary will not be changed. However, th e boundary for ITT PFS 
at IA2 (final analy sis of ITT PFS) will be calc ulated based on the observe d 
number of PFS events at IA2 in order to spend what is left of the overall alpha-
level 0.04 for ITT. The final boundaries at IA1 and IA2 will not approximate a
Gamma(-1) function, but ty pe I erro r will remain protected under the flexible 
alpha-spending ap proach (see appendix in the SAP for more details).
For the testing of OS, a lpha spe nding for IA1 and IA2 will always be based on 
the observed events (informati on fraction) using alpha=0.04 with a different

with a tota l alph a of 0.04; there is no test on subgroup PFS. 
2.If ITT PFS is not significant in IA1, then parall el testing of the ITT

b. If t he ITT population’s PFS is significant and a ll 3 subgroup

willbe tested at FA with a to tal al pha of 0.05.
c.If the ITT population’s PFS is not signi ficant and at least 1 
subgroup population’ sPFS is significant, then no formal ITT OS 
testing will be conducted. 
The family -wise error rate for the 4 null hypotheses for PFS and the 1 hypothesis 
for OS for the overall study population is controlled using a pres pecified, 2-si ded 
0.05 l evel of sign ificance. 
The proof of strong control of the Ty pe I error rate for testing PFS and OS in the 
ITT population and PFS in the subgr ouppopulations is shown i n the appendix in 
the SAP. For the other 2 key secondary en dpoint s, the CR rate will be t ested at 
thesame alpha level, instead of the same critical value, as that of the OS analysis 
when OS reaches statistical significance. Thepainresponse rate will be tested at 
the same alpha level as that of the CR rate analy sis when the CR rate reaches 
statistical s ignificance. Because of the closed sequential te sting property, the 
family -wise error rate is strongly controlled for both t he primary endpoint and the 
3 key sec ondary endpoints [78]

new text:8   STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES
The second IA has been performed (data cutoff date of 02 December 2019) 
and the primary endpoint of PFS did not reach statistical significance. 
Therefore, no subsequent formal inferential statistical analyses will be conducted. The primary analysis of e fficacy and safety was performed on 
data from the second IA and will be presented in a clinical study report 
(CSR). Minimal descriptive  analyses will be performed on patient data 
collected after the second IA and will be presented in a future CSR 
addendum. The description of the s tatistical methods presented below 
reflects the original design and the planned analysis for the study, reflecting 
the statistical considerations up to the second IA.

8.1.1 Determination of Sample Size
…
The first IA will be performed when approximately 326 PFS events have 
occurred. This is expected to occur approximately 45 months after the first
patient is enrolled, including a 27-month enrollment period and additional 18-
month follow-up from the last patient. 
If the test for PFS in the ITT population is statistically significant at the first 
IA, this will be the FA for PFS for statistical testing purposes, and the second 
IA will assess OS when approximately 250 death events have occurred.  
If the test for PFS in the ITT is not statistically significant at the first IA, then 
the second IA w ill assess PFS and OS when approximately 370 PFS events 
have occurred. In addition, in such a case, PFS will be tested at IA2 in 3 
prespecified subgroups: 1) patients with  baseline Cr Cl > 60 mL/min; 
2) patients aged < 75 years; and 3) patients harboring high-risk cytogenetic
abnormalities defined as del (17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and amp(1q21).
For the final OS analysis, the total event size calculation will be based on the 
adaptive sample size re-assessment a pproach.[66,67] The min imum event size 
of  death events is based on an optimistic assumption of a hazard ratio of

waswill be conducted using the re maining 2=0.01 and the Hochberg 
procedure for mult iplicity correcti on (refer to the appendix in the SAP for 
proof of strong con trol of the Ty pe I error rate). Because the size o f the 
treatm ent effect could maybe substant ially greater i n a prespecified s ubgroup 
than in the overall study  popul ation, analysis of patients in each subgro up at a 
stringent significance l evel could may still provide a statist ically significant 
outcom e. Th e detailed stati stical design schema is presented in Figure 8-1.
[Figure 8 -1]
For the testing of PFS in the ITT po pulation, t he Gamma( - 1)alpha spendi ng 
functi on waswill be used to calculat e the significan ce boundary  based on the 
observed number of PFS eve nts with total alpha=0.04. Thefirst IA waswill be
perform ed when 328approxi mately 326 PFS events hadhave occurred. Thi s 
waswill bethe first analysis for PFS for stati stical testing purpos es.. If the test 
is statistically  significant, then this analysis w ill be the FA of PFS for 
statistical test ing purposes. No subsequent PFS tes ting will be conducted, and 
central  efficacy and inves tigator assessments of dise ase response for protocol 
purpos es will be discon tinued except for the investigator asse ssment of P FS2
(see the Schedule of Event s). In this scenario, the second IA will be fo r OS 
testing when appr oximately 250 death events have occurred and will 
determine whether the fina l number of OS events might be increased .
Because Ifthe test for ITT PF S wasisnotstatistically significant at the first 
IA, response assessments continued will cont inue, and PFS testing in the ITT 
and subgroup popul ations waswill b econdu cted in parallel at the second I A, 
when 378approximately  370 PFS events hadhave occurred (rather th an the 
previous study  design o f 435 PFS events) ;this waswill be the FA o f PFS for 
statist ical test ing purposes. If the test for PFS had been issignif icant a t the

Gamma( -1) funct ion, but ty pe I error will remain protected under the flexible 
alpha-spending approach (see append ix in the SAP for mo re details).
For th e testing of OS, a lpha spending for IA1 and IA2 will alw ays be base d on 
the observed events (info rmation fraction) usin g alpha=0.04 with a different 
adjustm ent of  critical value at OS FA testing (CHW test statist ics [67] will be 
used f or the primary analysis of OS at FA) based on the fo llowing scenarios: 
3.If ITT PFS i s significant in IA1, then IT T OS will be tested in the FA 
with a tota l alpha of  0.04; there is no test on subgroup PFS. 
4.If ITT PFS is not significant in IA1, t hen paralle ltesting of the ITT 
popul ation PFS and the subgroup populat ions PFS will occ ur in IA2:

be tested at FA using a tota l alpha of 0.04.
e.Ifthe ITT popul ation’s PFS i s significant and all 3 subgroup 
popul ations’ PFS are si gnificant, then the ITT popul ation’s OS 
will be tested a t FA wi th a total alpha of 0.05.
f.If the ITT population’s PFS is not signi ficant and at least 1 
subgroup p opulation’s PFS i s significant, then no formal ITT 
OS testing will be conducted. 
The fa mily-wise e rror rate for the 4 null hypot heses for PFS and the 1

The proof o f strong control of the Ty pe I error rate for testing PF S and OS in
the ITT populat ion and P FS in the subgroup populati ons is shown i n the

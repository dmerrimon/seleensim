Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  4 1. Study Summary  
 
1.1 Background and Significance  
Female sexual health is an important determinant in quality of life, contributing to both increased 
meaning in life and general well -being  [1]. Unfortunately, approximately 41% of women suffer 
from female sexual dysfunction (FSD)  [2]. There are several domains that contribute to sexual 
dysfunction. Difficulty with genital arousal can arise from low activity in the nerves or blood 
vessels of the genitals. Problems with low sexual interest can stem from hyperactivity in the 
brain. Some women suffer from FSD due to neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury 
(SCI). After injury, neural connections between central sexual function neural circuits (e.g. 
desire) and peripheral sexual functions (e.g. genital arousal) are interrupted. Al though not a 
factor in mortality, sexual function remains a critical component of quality of life after SCI and is 
frequently reported as a high priority for restoration  [3], [4] .  
 
A challenge in studying sexual function in women is the complexity of sexual arousal, which 
includes both cognitive desire and genital arousal components [5]. Overall female sexual 
function is not well understood, which contributes to the lack of good treatment options for 
dysfunction, regardless of type. Pharmaceuticals such as sildenafil (viagra) have occasionally 
been reported to improve genital arousal [6] but results are inconsistent and frequently present 
with mild to moderate side -effects  [7]. There is a need for an effective treatment for women who 
have genital arousal deficiencies without concurrent side -effects. The ultimate goal of this 
research is to provide improvement in genital sexual arousal for women FSD due to either 
neurogenic (i.e . SCI) or non -neurogenic causes.  
 
One treatment avenue is the use of electrical stimulation on targeted nervous system pathways. 
Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) are common 
third-line treatments for irregularities in pelvic organ function, such as bladder incontinence, and 
have been used for decades  [8]. Some patients undergoing SNM or PTNS to improve bladder 
function have also reported an improvement in their sexual health as an additional benefit  [9]. 
This is not entirely unexpected, as organs of the pelvic floor share common nerve pathways and 
spinal circuits [10]. For example, the sacral root targeted by SNM gives rise to the pudendal 
nerve, of which a distal branch is the genital nerve. Each has been a target for electrical 
stimulation to treat bladder problems and may also be a treatment option for FSD. This neu ro-
functional overlap gives reason to believe that the nerves that innervate the organs associated 
with genital arousal and that have been previously targeted in bladder neuromodulatory studies 
are a viable treatment option for women with genital arousal d eficiencies.  
 
In order to explore the potential for electrical stimulation to modulate genital arousal, our lab has 
started a research focus of examining peripheral nerve stimulation to address female sexual 
dysfunction, targeting pudendal and tibial nerve pathways  [11]–[14]. In animal studies we have 
shown that tibial and genital nerve stimulation can lead to increases in vaginal blood flow  [11], 
[12], which is an indicator of sexual arousal [15]. A human subjects study from our group 
(HUM00101713) focused on non -neurogenic subjects with FSD and showed that stimulating the 
posterior tibial and dorsal genital nerves repeatedly across twelve weekly sessions are feasible 
approaches for improving sexu al function based on improvements in clinically validated surveys  
[13]. The mechanisms that underlie this clinical effect, such as whether the applied nerve 
stimulation increases vaginal blood flow in women, are still largely unknown. This study aims to 
address this gap, to study the short -term effect of stimulation on vagin al blood flow. To 
potentially  amplify any stimulation effects, this study will incorporate the use of sexually explicit 
films, a method that is standard in sexual function studies [ 16]-[18]. The inclusion of healthy 
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  5 women and non -neurogenic women with FSD will also provide information about the underlying 
neural circuitry, based on whether either stimulation approach has better efficacy in spinal intact 
or damaged participants. While genital nerve stimulation is gener ally successful at improving 
bladder function in individuals with SCI, tibial nerve stimulation has had mixed results. These 
findings by other researchers suggest potential outcomes for our different study groups.   
 
1.2 Objective  
The overall purpose of this research is to improve sexual function in women with sexual 
dysfunction. The goal of this study is to see if either of two nerve stimulation interventions cause 
a short -term change in vaginal blood flow. The effect of this intervention will be compared 
between women who have neurogenic (spinal cord injury) or non -neurogenic dysfunction and 
healthy women, to reveal mechanisms underlying neural control over vaginal blood flow.  
 
1.3 Specific Aims  
The aims of this study are to:  
• Aim 1: Compare the effect of skin -surface genital nerve stimulation and tibial nerve 
stimulation on vaginal blood flow in women with spinal cord injury caused neurogenic 
sexual dysfunction.  
• Aim 2: Compare the effect of skin -surface genital nerve stimulation and tibial nerve 
stimulation on vaginal blood flow in women with non -neurogenic female sexual 
dysfunction.  
• Aim 3: Compare the effect of skin -surface genital nerve stimulation and tibial nerve 
stimulation on vaginal blood flow in neurologically -intact women without sexual 
dysfunction.  
1.4 Primary Outcomes  
The primary outcome measure in this study is the maximum change in VPA from the average 
baseline value for each stimulation location across each stimulation participant group. To 
determine if participant type, stimulation location, and stimulation interval  (i.e. timing within 
stimulation duration) has an effect on VPA, an ANOVA will be performed.   
1.5 Secondary Outcomes  
The secondary outcome measures will be the change in heart rate , blood pressure , and 
subjective arousal  from baseline for each stimulation location and participant group.  
1.6 Investigative team  
Dr. Tim Bruns is an Associate Professor in the Biomedical Engineering Department. He leads a 
research lab that develops interfaces with the peripheral nervous system to restore function. He 
is an expert on the use of electrical stimulation to activate spin al circuits to control pelvic organs. 
During his doctoral and postdoctoral training, Dr. Bruns participated in human subjects research 
studies with spinal cord injured subjects and individuals undergoing spine surgery to examine 
nerve stimulation approache s to control bladder function and develop new nerve electrodes. At 
Michigan, Dr. Bruns was PI on HUM00101713, which studied the use of skin -surface electrical 
stimulation to improve sexual function in women with sexual dysfunction.  
 
Dr. Priyanka Gupta is a Urologic Surgeon specializing in the diagnosis and management of 
voiding dysfunction and pelvic floor disorders. She completed a fellowship in Female Pelvic 
Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery at Beaumont Health in Royal Oak, Michig an. During her 
fellowship she gained additional expertise in the surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse, 
urinary incontinence, and the use of neuromodulation and robotic technology. Dr. Gupta’s 
clinical practice includes both the surgical and non -operative management of pelvic organ 
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  6 prolapse, incontinence, pelvic pain, voiding dysfunction, and pelvic floor disorders. Dr. Gupta’s 
research interests include outcomes of pelvic organ prolapse treatments and neuromodulation, 
and surgical education in the developing world.  
 
Dr. Gianna Rodriguez is an Associate Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Her 
clinical practice primarily revolves around evaluation and management of men and women with 
spinal cord injuries (SCI) and disorders. Dr. Rodriguez has a particular  interest in pelvic organ 
function, studying bladder and bowel care management practices by patients in this community 
and has a strong history of working with urologists at the University of Michigan.  
 
2. Research Procedures  
We will conduct the proposed study in accordance with the requirements of the University of 
Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board (IRBMED). All study visits will be conducted 
at University of Michigan Health System locations.  
 
2.1 Pre -study surveys  
Prior to the first visit, participants will complete five clinically validated surveys:  
1 The American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI) bladder symptom index 
[19] 
2 The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)  [20] 
3 Fecal Incontinence Severity Index ( FISI) [21] 
4 Patient Assessment of Constipation -Symptoms (PAC -SYM)  [22] 
5 The short -form (SF -36) quality of life survey  [23], [24] 
 
Surveys will be completed over the phone or online in REDCap, a standard clinical tool for 
survey data collection  [25]. Each survey is included in section 29.1.  
 
2.2 Study v isits 1 & 2  
The same steps will be followed for all three Aims. Participants will have two study visits. The 
interval between visits will be at least one month but not more than five months.  
On each study day, subjects will complete a urine pregnancy test. Next, subjects will recline in a 
comfortable position on an elevated table, with pillows and blankets provided if desired. An 
MCRU staff member will be available to provide assistance, if ne eded, in addition to one or 
more clinical research team members. A vaginal plethysmography transducer (Biopac TSD204) 
will be inserted about 3 inches into the patient’s vagina by 
a clinical staff member  or by the patient  with clinician 
supervision . The transducer measures vaginal pulse 
amplitude (VPA), the standard clinical technique for 
assessing genital sexual arousal in women  [5], [2 6]–[28]. 
No energy is transmitted from the TSD204 to the 
participant. A heart rate monitor (e.g. electrocardiogram 
or pu lse oximetry) and blood pressure monitor will be 
placed on the participant's arm, hand, or chest (as is 
appropriate per monitor) to monitor off -target autonomic 
responses.  
 
On the first study day, one of the two stimulation 
approaches will be randomly selected and prepared. For 
dorsal genital nerve stimulation, two circular 1.25 -inch 
diameter transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS)  
Figure 1. Electrode locations (red 
dots) for genital nerve stimulation , 
on either side of the clitoris . 
 

Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  7 electrodes (ValuTrode Fabric CF3200 or 
equivalent) will be placed on either lateral side 
of the clitoris  (Figure 1) . For tibial nerve 
stimulation, the two electrodes will be placed 
just above the medial malleolus and the 
ipsilateral calcaneus on one leg  (Figure 2). 
The placement of TENS device will be 
performed by clinical study team members, 
specifically Dr. Priyanka Gupta, Dr. Gianna 
Rodriguez, or other clinical practitioners or 
fellows who are  study team members . Each 
clinical study team member is a practicing MD 
physician trained in the use of 
neuromodulation including technology such as 
this. The conductivity of the electrodes may be tested with an impedance meter (Digitimer 
D175), which is connected to an electrode set and uses very low, imperceptible current levels. If 
the meter indicates poor conductivity, the electrodes may be repositioned.  
Prior to starting stimulation with a TENS device  (Empi Select, or similar) , the stimulation 
amplitude will be determined. The current will be increased until the participant expresses 
discomfort and then reduced to a comfortable level, or a maximum level of 60 mA is reached. 
During stimulation, the set stimulation amplitude will be applied at a frequency of 20 Hz, which is 
standard for PTNS and the frequency we used in our previous human subjects’  study 
(HUM00101713).  
Participants will be shown a neutral  video  (nature  film excerpt ) and an erotic film clip featuring 
sexually explicit material  at different intervals of the  testing period . The use of videos in this 
manner  is a standard method in studies of sexual function  [16]–[18], and may help enhance an 
arousal response . Two videos will be loaded on a laptop computer in a fixed  order that will not 
require patient intervention.  Participants will choose  a video based on their preference in 
viewing either two women or a woman and a man engaging in sexual activities.  
As shown in Figure 4, during the testing period p articipants will first view a 5-minute neutral  film 
depicting nature scenes  to allow blood flow levels to stabilize . This will be followed by a 10 -
minute period while the subject watches an erotic film clip  for assessment of arousal responses 
without electrical stimulation . The erotic film clip depicts sexually explicit material of two 
consenting adults engaging in sexual activities including manual and or al stimulation of breasts 
and genitals as well as peni le-vaginal intercourse depending on the film chosen. A 10-minute 
clip of the same neutral  film will follow, to allow blood flow levels to return to baseline. Five 
minutes into this film , electrical stimulation will be resumed  at the previously determined 
amplitude. Finally , the subject will view another 10 -minute erotic film clip depicting similar 
sexually explicit material as the first while electrical stimulation remains  on as the last sequence 
in the testing . 
At the beginning of the VPA recording sequence, in between each video transition, and at the 
end of the VPA recording sequence  (a total of 5 times) , participants will view a 15-30-second 
screen prompt asking them to  record their agreement with the statement, “I feel sexually 
aroused (e.g. sexually excited, turned on) right now,” according to a 5 -point Likert scale: (1) 
strongly disagree , (2) disagree , (3) neutral , (4) agree , and (5) strongly agree . At the end of each 
session participants will be asked their  general opinions of that stimulation session, whether it 
seemed to elicit any genital arousal responses such as lubrication, warmth, tingling, or any  
Figure 2. Electrode locations (white circles) 
for tibial nerve stimulation near the ankle.  
 

Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  8 sensations they would characterize as pleasurable, and whether they would consider further 
use of it.  
At the second study day, stim ulation using the same steps will be performed at the other 
location.  
 
2.3 Pelvic function daily  diaries  
To look for off -target or carry -over stimulation effects, participants 
will be asked to complete a daily bladder, bowel, and sexual 
function diary from two days before until two days after a 
session, to provide objective measures across several 
parameters (e.g. incontinence episodes, regularity). The full diary 
is in section 44.1 . Figure 3 shows the daily questions . Surveys 
will be completed in REDCap  or over the phone . Spinal cord 
injured patients will also have a question asking if they had an 
autonomic dysreflexia event.

3. Study Statistics and Data Analysis Plan  
 
3.1 Sample size  
The target population size (N=40) is based on intended recruitment of 40 women; 10 normal 
women  (e.g. without SCI nor FSD ), 10 non -SCI women with FSD , and 20 women with SCI . 
Efforts will be made to recruit equal numbers between AIS A SCI  and AIS B-C SCI  participants, 
but it may be challenging to get exactly 10 in each SCI group . The AIS A SCI and AIS B-C SCI 
is based on the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. AIS 
A SCI refers to complete, no sensory or motor functi on SCI, while AIS B-C SCI refers to  
incomplete SCI (e.g. sensory but not motor function is preserved ). This is a pilot study with no 
comparable studies for identifying an effect size and performing a power analysis. If we 
determine that a larger population size is needed for any participant groups, based on 
preliminary data analyses, then the target group size will be increased.  
 
3.2 Data Analysis plan  
VPA will undergo optimization, filtration, and a spectral analysis as in  [11], [12], [15] . The 
change in VPA from the average baseline value will be determine for each stimulation at four -
minute intervals, during which stimulation is paused for ten seconds. Although VPA will be 
recorded continuously, the genital nerve stimulation may cause a motion artifact and so equal 
pauses in stimuli will be used in each interval for both stimulation approaches.  We may 
eliminate this pause if data analysis indicates that there are no artifacts or that filtration and 
spectral analysis eliminates artifacts.  Similar calculations may be done for the heart rate and 
blood pressure. An ANOVA will be performed to determine whether participant type, stimulation 
location, and stimulation interval (i. e. timing within stimulation duration) has an effect on VPA. 
Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to test for differences within the groups. Similarly, 
changes in cardiovascular parameters will be assessed, to see if general autonomic responses 
are trig gered with either stimulation location or patient group. We will also look for correlations 
between the pre -session survey scores ( e.g. FSFI  total score ), patient demographics (e.g. age,  
Figure 4. Timeline summary for each participant.  

Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  10 BMI), and changes in items (e.g. decrease in incontinence events) with the maximal VPA 
responses with a regression analysis.  
 
4. Study Recruitment  
This study addresses a potentially sensitive topic. During the recruitment and consenting 
processes, all study activities will be carefully explained with particular attention to matters of 
privacy and confidentiality. Many women with spinal cord injury (S CI) have had negative 
healthcare experiences with respect to reproductive health. Alternatively, grateful patients can 
feel compelled to participate out of a sense of loyalty. As such, for recruitment and consenting 
processes, we will emphasize that partic ipation is entirely voluntary,  and refusal or withdrawal 
will have no effect on any care they receive.  
 
SCI participants will primarily be recruited through direct interactions with clinicians on the study 
team, Drs. Rodriguez and Gupta, in their clinical practice. We will also seek referrals from 
clinical colleagues who work with SCI women. Additionally, colleagues of Dr. Gupta and Dr. 
Rodriguez may distribute or post the study flyer in their urogynecology or SCI clinics. Women 
with female sexual dysfunction (FSD) may also be recruited from urogynecology or sexual 
health clinics run by a memb er of the study team or a colleague. If this occurs, these colleagues 
will have a general understanding of the study and will refer any patient questions to study 
investigators or the study coordinator. We will place flyers in relevant Physical Medicine & 
Rehabilitation, Urology, and Obstetrics & Gynecology clinics. We will also advertise the study on 
an online University of Michigan health research portal (umhealthresearch.org). Additionally, we 
will place flyers at several clinics outside of the UM healthcare system in S outheast Michigan, 
specifically, Detroit Medical Center/Wayne State, PM& R/Novi Rehab Institute of Michigan) and 
John D. Dingell VA Medical Center. Furthermore, this study will recruit via social media 
platforms (Facebook and Instagram). The study will be advertised via these social media 
platforms and direct interested people to the umhealthresearch.org website.  
 
 
Non-SCI participants will be primarily recruited through the online health portal  and we will place 
flyers in Obstetrics & Gynecology clinics, particularly Dr. Gupta's clinics.

the stimulation sessi on participants  may experience  short -term improvement in sexual function.  
Additionally, we will also explain that the knowledge gained from this research may be beneficial 
for others, society, and/or science.  
 
The research team will adopt an optional electronic informed consent procedure using SignNow. 
This option will be our preferred method for obtaining consent. Once an interested  participant  is 
identified , the study coordinator who will reach out to the participant over the telephone to 
discuss the study and either obtain consent  or schedule a time call the participant after they 
have had a time to review the consent form.  In the instance a potential participant does not have 
access to the internet or is not inclined to use the internet, research staff will revert back to 
using  the standard procedure for obtaining consent on paper during the first study visit.  We will 
recruit all potential  and eligible subjects who can speak, read, and understand En glish.  
 
8. Waiver of Informed Consent   
 
We are  seeking a waiver of informed consent  as there are a set of surveys that get completed at 
the very beginning of the study and daily diaries for the two days prior to the first study visit. 
Subjects will be able to complete their surveys and diaries at home and at their leisure. We 
prefer that they  are completed before the test session in order to ensure that their answers 
won’t be affected by the treatment and so that the time spent by the participant at that session is 
not too long. In order to do th is expeditiously, it would be simplest to send them the surveys and 
diaries if they agree to take part during their initial recruitment call. This means, though, that a 
participant could be completing surveys and diaries before formally signing the consent  form if 
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  13 they are not being recruited during a visit at a clinic with a study team member  or if they are not 
doing electronic consent . 
 
9. Confidentiality of Data  
 
Proper, standard procedures will be followed to protect participant identities. Each subject will 
be assigned an identification number. Only this number will be used to identify subjects in any 
individual tabulation. The surveys that the patients are requi red to fill out as part of the study will 
also only use this identification number as the piece of identifying information. These surveys 
will only be administered and collected by the study coordinator or other research team staff. 
The study coordinator w ill have access to the patient information and code key. The study 
coordinator's office will have a locked door. Paper research records will be stored in a locked 
cabinet in the study coordinator's office. No patient -identifying information will be shared outside 
the research team.  
 
Only group data is expected to be published. If individual subject data is published, then no 
identifying information will be included. Study files will also be maintained in a secured location. 
Access to computerized data will be restricted to IRB approve d study personnel and password 
authorization will be enforced. Data collection will be limited to the study investigators and 
research staff. All study personnel who have access to the data will be educated regarding the 
need to protect confidentiality and  the procedure to be followed to ensure such protection. All 
staff will also be required to sign a standard medical record confidentiality agreement.  
 
10. Data Safety and Monitoring  
 
10.1 Data Safety and Monitoring Board  
All research personnel involved in this study will have completed training in the protection of 
human research participants. A full Data and Safety Monitoring Board will not be used for this 
study as it is a small study. Once data collection has begun, Drs. Bruns and Gupta will discuss 
project progression, participant safety, and overall data on a monthly basis via phone, email 
correspondence, or an in -person meeting. Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported promptly to 
the IRB and to the Medical Monitor. If m ultiple patients experience adverse events related to 
research procedures, then the Medical Monitor will be consulted to discuss whether the study 
should be stopped or reassessed. If there is any evidence of a pattern of unanticipated AEs 
(regardless of ca usality), or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), then the Medical Monitor will 
immediately the data.  
 
10.2 Severity  
The investigator  will grade any Adverse Event signs and symptoms as mild, moderate, severe, 
or life threatening according to the following definitions in Table 1 . 
Table 1. Adverse events severity scale.  
Grade  Definition  
Mild:  Causing no limitation of usual activity  
Moderate:  Causing some limitations of usual activities  
Severe:  Causing inability to carry out usual activities  
Life Threatening:  Patient was at immediate risk of death from the event  
 
10.3 Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be identified as any adverse event (AE) that:  
• Is fatal;  
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  14 • Is life threatening, meaning the patient was, in the view of the investigator, at  
• immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more serious form or progressed, might have caused death;  
• Causes a persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization. Inpatient hospitalization will be considered a 
hospitalization if is longer than 24 hours or requires an intervention to treat emergent 
symptomatology (non -diagnostic);  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
 
Other important medical events may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes as listed in this definition. We will repor t all SAEs to 
the IRBMED, including death, due to any cause which occurs during this study and until 30 days 
after the last participation in the study, whether or not expected and regardless of causality.   
 
10.4 Termination of Subjects  
 
10.4.1 Subject Decision  
Participation is strictly voluntary , and the research is strictly knowledge driven; therefore, a 
subject may withdraw from further participation in the study without penalty or harm. Any 
reason(s) the subject may give for terminating his or her participation will be kept confidential. 
We will store the study documents according to the procedures outlined in the Confidentiality of 
Data section of this protocol (Section 9). We will require no further information of the subject and 
the subject will be compensated for their completed study visits prior to termination.  
 
10.4.2 Investigator Decision  
Study personnel (principal investigator, co -investigators, and study coordinator) will be 
authorized to release a subject from further study participation according to the following 
guidelines:  
• The researcher believes that it is not in the subject’s best interest to stay in the study.  
• Subject becomes ineligible to participate.  
• Subject’s condition changes such tha t she needs treatment that is not allowed while taking 
part in the study.  
• Subject does not follow instructions from the researchers.  
• The study is suspended or canceled.  
 
Upon termination of a subject, the investigators will ensure the subject is dismissed with any 
study documents to which he or she is entitled, as well as guidance for resuming medications 
safely. Subjects will be compensated for their completed study visit s prior to termination. 
Investigators will require no further obligation or participation from a terminated subject.  
 
11. Protection of human subjects  
 
11.1 Potential benefits of this research  
 
11.1.1 Potential benefits to society  
This study will provide new knowledge about the effect of peripheral nerve stimulation on 
vaginal blood flow for women with intact and damaged spinal cords. These findings may lead to 
new methods of treating female sexual arousal disorder for women with an d without SCI.  
 
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  15 11.1.2 Potential benefits to participants  
We do not expect pa rticipants to benefit directly from this study. It is possible the stimulation 
session may give participants short -term improvement in sexual function. Others may benefit 
from the knowledge gained from this study. Researchers may use the knowledge gained in this 
study to design treatments for sexual dysfunction.  
 
11.2 Risks to Human subjects  
Potential risks include release of identifying information, physical discomfort or pain during 
stimulation , skin irritation from gel and alcohol pad prior to electrode placement, women with 
SCI could have an increase in blood pressure (autonomic dysreflexia), infection from 
intravaginal sensors, and women with a history of trauma may feel triggered by the resear ch 
intervention.  
 
11.2.1 Potential Risks and Protection against risks  
See sections 11.2.2 through 11.2.7 for a complete list of potential risks and protections against 
each risk.  
 
11.2.2 Identifying information  
A risk to participating in the study is an increased risk of loss of privacy. Participants personal 
information will be protected per HIPAA guidelines. Only the study coordinator will keep the 
necessary PHI (name, address) to recruit and schedule the parti cipant session. Otherwise all 
references to each participant will be coded. Thus , only one person beyond each participant’s 
normal clinical team (for UMHS patients) will have access to their PHI. If individual subject data 
is published, then no identifying  information will be included. Study files will be maintained in a 
secure location. Access to computerized data will be restricted to IRB -approved study personnel 
and will be password protected. Data collection will be limited to the study investigators an d 
study staff. All study personnel who have access to the data will be educated regarding the 
need to protect confidentiality and the procedures to follow to ensure such protection. The 
likelihood of this risk is rare.  
 
11.2.3 Electrical stimulation  
Electrical stimulation can result in pain at site of stimulation. We will keep stimulation current 
levels at or below the perception threshold, which is normally below the pain threshold. Subjects 
will be able to report any discomfort or pain associated wi th the stimulation and current levels 
will be decreased until the discomfort is no longer observed. The likelihood of this risk is rare to 
infrequent.  
 
11.2.4 Skin irritation  
Participants skin may be cleaned with a mild abrasive gel and an alcohol pad prior to the 
placement of electrodes. If this procedure  causes discomfort and/or skin irritation, it will be 
stopped and not performed in the second visit. We anticipate the likelihood of this risk to be 
rare. 
 
11.2. 5 Intravaginal sensor  
The intravaginal sensor could cause an infection if it is not properly sterilized or improper sterile 
technique is used. Vaginal sensors will be properly sterilized between each session and 
placement of the sensor will be performed by a clinical staff who is trained in sterile procedures 
such as clean intermittent catheterization. If the sensor shows any signs of damage due to 
reuse or repeated sterilizations, then it will be replaced. We will have back -up sensors on hand 
throughout the study. The sensor is  specifically designed to be human use only and reused. As 
sensor placement will be guided by clinical staff who are trained in sterile methods including the 
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  16 standard clean intermittent (urethra) catheterization procedure, we expect that the likelihood of 
this risk is rare to infrequent.  
 
11.2. 6 History of trauma  
Subjects with a history of trauma may feel triggered by the research intervention. To reduce the 
risk of trauma triggering, patients will be fully informed about the treatment regimen and that 
their participation is voluntary. If psychological trauma occurs, patien ts will be referred to our 
sexual health therapists for treatment. The likelihood of this risk is rare to infrequent.  
 
11.2. 7 Spinal cord injured participants  
In spinal cord injured participants, electrical stimulation of nerves can lead to autonomic 
dysreflexia (AD) responses such as increased blood pressure that could have serious 
consequences to the subject. Risk of autonomic dysreflexia, or syndrome in which there is a 
sudden onset of excessively high blood pressure is generally limited to patients with injuries at  
the cervical and upper -thoracic levels.  Patients with injuries in levels C4 to T5 have a risk of 
autonomic dysreflexia, however patients are typic ally well -educated about it and mitigation for it 
is well established.  These patients have nitroglycerine paste in their regimen already, to mitigate 
against AD, and we will provide it  for any patients who do not have it . During the session, w e will 
have cardiovascular monitors (heart rate, blood pressure) that will be watched for any abnormal 
increases. The MCRU staff member and clinical research team member(s) present will be 
aware of these parameters, and will respond as needed by terminatin g stimulation , helping the 
subject to relax, applying nitroglycerine paste, and seeking further medical care if needed. Prior 
to the session we will ask spinal cord injured participants to try to empty their bladder, or if they 
have done it recently, to help further reduce the likelihood of autonomic dysreflexia.  In the at-
home daily pelvic diary , spinal cord injury participants will be asked if they have symptoms of 
AD including headaches, flushing, sweating, or goose bumps  (see Section 2.3) .  The likelihood 
of this ri sk is rare (T6-T10 patients) to infrequent  (C4-T5 patients) . 
 
11.2. 8 Reasonableness of risks  
The risks of participation in the study are minimal, and if there is pain caused by the stimulation 
it can be stopped by reducing the stimulation amplitude or stopping stimulation completely. 
Autonomic dysreflexia risk will be limited based on our subject recruitment, cardiovascular vitals 
will be tracked, and clinical team members will be prepared to respond if necessary. 
Psychological discomfort c an be reduced with psychological support. Infection can be treated 
with antibiotics. Study team members are fully trained on protection of human private 
information, and thus the odds of privacy loss occurring are minimally greater than the 
participant alr eady faces while getting their normal clinical treatment. The study will provide new 
human data that has never been addressed before. This presents a significant scientific benefit 
that may lead to new treatment for a patient population that is significant ly underserved.  
 
12. Research Costs  
 
All research -specific costs will be covered b y research accounts overseen by the research 
team.  Study participants will not be billed for any research study procedures . Participants will be 
reimbursed  for each study visit and travel expenses.  
 
13. Investigational Drug  
There is no involvement of any investigational drug in this study.  
 
14. Investigational Device  
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  17 There is no involvement of any investigational device in this study.  
 
15. Marketed Drugs/Device  
 
15.1 Device  
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (Empi Select TENS)  
 
15.2 PMA Number  
K061650  
 
15.3 Purpose of the device  
The Empi  TENS unit is used to apply electrical stimulation to the skin, to provide relief for pain 
through electrodes that accompany the unit. We will use the unit and accompanying electrodes 
to apply stimulation over cutaneous nerves that may modulate vaginal blo od flow - the posterior 
tibial nerve and the dorsal genital nerve. The selection of stimulation parameters will be similar 
to normal use of the device for pain.  
 
15.4 Frequency and total duration of use for an individual subject  
The TENS device will be used once per subject, for 20 minutes  of total stimulation during the 
test session.  
 
15.5 FDA classification of device  
Class 2  
 
15.6 How research use departs from the FDA -approved indication  
The Empi SELECT Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator Device is used for the 
symptomatic relief and management of chronic, intractable pain and relief of pain associated 
with arthritis. It is also used as an adjunctive treatment for post -surgical and post-trauma acute 
pain. The purpose of using the device in this study is to evaluate whether or genital nerve or 
tibial nerve stimulation will modulate autonomic neural circuits and vaginal blood flow.  
 
15.7 Purpose of evaluation  
Our goal is to determine support for a possible new indication for use of the device.  
 
15.8 Risk designation for device  
Non-significant risk  
 
15.9 Justify risk level and evaluate safety risk  
The device is not an implant. The device does not sustain human life or present a potential for 
serious health risk. The device does not have a substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, 
mitigating, or treating disease. The device is used in one short -term skin -surface stimulation 
sessions. The device applies electrical stimulation through electrodes placed on the skin. It is 
battery -powered, and thus does not have a ground -fault risk. As noted elsewhere in the 
protocol, stimulation could lead to pain or  discomfort below the electrodes. This is not expected 
to be significant pain. If observed, stimulation will be reduced or terminated such that the 
discomfort ceases. Each electrode placement will be performed be study personnel familiar with 
Version 6.0 August 1, 2022  18 proper use of the device.  
 
15.10 Procedures for controlling device  
The PI (Dr. Bruns) will have ultimate responsibility for receiving, labeling, storing, and 
dispensing the device. Once the study begins, study personnel will coordinate storage and use 
of the device, with oversight by Dr. Bruns. The PI or co -I Dr. Gupta wi ll be present for initial use 
of the device, verifying that it will be done in a manner consistent with the protocol. Any use of 
the device, in a session that either does not attend, will include study team personnel that have 
been previously overseen by D r. Bruns or co -I Dr. Gupta. Dr. Gupta has clinical experience with 
the device. After such a session, a report will be sent to Dr. Bruns verifying appropriate device 
usage. At the end of the study the device will be retained by the PI (Dr. Bruns) in their o ffice for 
potential use in a future study.

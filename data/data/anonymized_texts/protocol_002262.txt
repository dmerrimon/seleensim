Study Title:  A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of BBI608 in Combination with 
Sorafenib, or BBI503 in Combination with Sorafenib in Adult 
Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Study Number:  BBI608-503-103HCC  
Study Phase:  Phase Ib/II  
Study Drugs:  BBI608 and BBI503, investigational, small molecule, anticancer drugs that are 
hypothesized to affect multiple oncogenic pathways , including pathways 
implicated in cancer stem cell viability .  
Primary Objectives:  Phase Ib:  
To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) 
of BBI608 administered in combination with sorafenib and of BBI503 
administered in combination with sorafenib in adult patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic c hemotherapy.  
Phase II:  
To evaluate  the tolerability , safety. and preliminary anti -tumor activity  in 
patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma randomized to receive 
treatment with sorafenib  in combination with BBI608 , sorafenib  in combination 
with BBI 503, or sorafenib alone ; BBI608 and BBI503 would be administered 
at their respective RP2D dose levels for combination administration with 
sorafenib , which were determined during phase Ib.  
Secondary 
Objectives:  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of B BI608 administered in 
combination with sorafenib and of BBI503 administered in combination with 
sorafenib.  
To perform  biomarker  studies  for BBI608 administered in combination with 
sorafenib and for BBI503 administered in combination with sorafenib.  
Study Design:  
 This is an open label, phase Ib/II study.  The study population is adult patients 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received systemic 
chemotherapy.   
The phase Ib portion will involve dose -escalation of BBI608 administered in 
combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 1), and dose escalation 
of BBI503 administered in combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib 
(Arm 2).   The fixed starting dose -level of sorafenib for both arms will be 400 
mg twice daily (800 m g total daily dose).  Eligible patients will be randomized 
to either Arm 1  or Arm 2.   
In Arm 1, e scalating doses of BBI608 will be administered to cohorts of three 
to six patients until RP2D is determined according to the criteria for determining 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the criteria for dose -escalation .  
In Arm 2 , escalating doses of BBI503 will be administered to cohorts of three 
to six patients until RP2D is determined according to the criteria for determining 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and th e criteria for dose -escalation.   
Prior to initiation of combination therapy in each arm, sorafenib will be 
administered as monotherapy starting on Cycle 1, Day 1 for 14 days.  Dose -
adjustment of sorafenib according to the approved product label is allowed .  
Following the sorafenib run -in period, the combination regimen will begin on 
Cycle 1, Day 15.  Protocol therapy will continue in repeating 28 -day cycles until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion 
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 3 is met .   
For both arms, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be performed on Cycle 1, Day 
15 and Cycle 2, Day 15.  An additional pharmacokinetic study may be 
performed to confirm exposure following dose -modification.  Once RP2D is 
determined for both study arms, the p hase II portion will begin.   
The phase II portion will be an open -label, 3 -arm, randomized phase II trial of 
patients with advanced HCC who have not received prior systemic treatment .  
Patients will be  randomized to receive either, Arm 1: sorafenib admini stered in 
combination with BBI608 (at the RP2D determined for BBI608 plus sorafenib 
during the phase Ib portion); Arm 2: sorafenib in combination with BBI503 (at 
the RP2D determined for BBI503 plus sorafenib during the phase Ib portion), 
or Arm 3 : sorafeni b alone at a starting dose of 400 mg twice daily.  The starting 
dose for sorafenib is the same for all study arms.  
Note:  
Once the amendment 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion will be closed 
for enrollment due to BBI503 portfolio priorities and to increase efforts in 
enrolling patients on to Arms 1 and 3 . 
At the time of the amendment 3 being in effect, there were approximately 10 
subjects already enrolled in Arm 2.  Therefore, the actual sample size in Phase 
II in the end is projected to be appro ximately 70 patients after the amendment 3  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed in patients with readily 
accessible tumors through an optional on -study tumor biopsy.  Archival tissue, 
if available, will be collected from all patients.  
Throughout  the study,  safety and tolerability of BBI608 in combination with 
sorafenib and of BBI503 in combination with sorafenib will be assessed for the 
duration of study treatment and up to 30 days after discontinuation of study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503).   
Evaluation of anti -tumor activity will be performed at regular 8 –week intervals, 
with the first assessment 8 weeks (56-days) after Cycle 1, Day 1.  The radiologic 
assessments will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST 
(mRECIST) for patien ts with HCC.  Alpha -feto protein (AFP) measurement 
will be performed at baseline, at the end of the 2 -week sorafenib monotherapy 
Run-In, and at the start of each subsequent study cycle.   
A patient may continue protocol therapy beyond progression that is d etermined 
by RECIST criteria (either RECIST 1.1 or mRECIST for patients with HCC), 
provided that the patient is obtaining potential clinical benefit in the opinion of 
the investigator.  If sorafenib is discontinued due to sorafenib -related toxicities, 
study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) may be continued.   
Study Population:  
 This study will enroll patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
arising from any setting who have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for 
their disease, and for which sorafenib is an appropriate treatment option in the 
judgment of the tre ating investigator.   
Prior surgical or loco -regional therapy is allowed, including trans -catheter 
arterial embolization, trans -catheter arterial chemoembolization, percutaneous 
ethanol injection, or radiofrequency ablation, provided  that the procedure was  
performed at least 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, and provided that there has 
been documented disease progression per RECIST (either RECIST 1.1 or 
mRECIST for patients with HCC) since the surgical procedure.

Confidential    Page: 4 Additional key inclusion criteria include:  ECOG performance status < 1, Child -
Pugh class A  and B7  albumin , adequate renal function, and a life expectancy of 
greater than 3 months.  Patient accrual will occur over a period of time 
dependent upon the enrollment rate of the study.  Patients with HIV infection 
are excluded.  
Test Product, Dose, 
and Mode of 
Administration:  
 Phase Ib:  
Patients in this trial will receive study drug in combination with a fixed dose of 
sorafenib according to the arm they are randomly assigned to and according to 
the dose -level cohort that is currently open.  
Sorafenib will be administered at a fixed dose of 400 mg twice daily (800 mg 
total daily dose).  This dose of sorafenib will be the same for each arm and for 
each dose -level cohort.  Sorafenib should be taken on an empty stomach, one 
hour prior to or two hours after meals.  Sorafenib should not be taken with study 
drug, and at least 2 hours should separate a dose of sorafenib from a dose of 
study drug.  
The starting dose of study drug (BBI608 or BBI503) and dosing ins tructions for 
each arm during the phase are as follows.  
Arm 1:  
BBI608 will be administered orally, twice daily , with approximately 12 hours 
between doses .  The first dose of BBI608 should be administered shortly after 
waking in the morning .  The second  dose of BBI608  should be taken in the 
evening .  BBI608 should be taken with fluids, either 1 hour before a meal or 2 
hours after.  The first dose of BBI608 should be taken prior to the first dose of 
sorafenib.   
The dose of BBI608 to be administered will depe nd on the assigned dose -level 
cohort as follows in the table below:  
BBI608 Dose Level  BBI608 Dose & Schedule  
BBI608 Dose -Level I  160 mg Twice Daily  
BBI608 Dose -Level II  240 mg Twice Daily  
Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled at BBI608 Dose -Level 1.  Dose -escalation 
will proceed according to the Criteria for Dose Escalation and Criteria for 
Determination of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT).  
Alternate and/or intermediate dose -levels are permit ted upon agreement  with 
the Principal Investigator and medical monitor for the Sponsor.  
Arm 2:  
BBI503 will be administered orally, daily. The daily dose of BBI503 will be 
administered before bed.  The dose of BBI503 to be administered will depend 
on the assigned dose -level cohort as follows in the table below:  
BBI503 Dose Level  BBI503 Dose & Schedule  
BBI503 Dose -Level I  100 mg Once Daily  
BBI503 Dose -Level II  200 mg Once Daily  
Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled at BBI503 Dose -Level 1.  Dose -escalation 
will proceed according to the Criteria for Dose Escalation and Criteria for 
Determination of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT).   
Intermediate dose -levels are permitted upon agreeme nt with the Principal 
Investigator and medical monitor for the Sponsor.  The total daily dose of 
BBI503 may be divided into sub -doses.  
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 5 Phase II Portion:  
The dose of BBI608 or BBI503 *to be administered in combination with 
sorafenib during the phase II port ion will be the RP2D determined during the 
phase Ib dose -escalation portion of study.  Sorafenib administration will be as 
described for the phase Ib portion.   
* Once the amendment 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in Phase II portion will be closed 
for enrollment  
Criteria for Dose 
Escalation – Phase 
Ib Portion Only  Enrollment at the next dose level and/or additional patients into the ongoing 
cohort will occur according to the following criteria:  
• If zero treated patients experience a DLT (defined below) by Day 28 of  
continuous daily dosing, then dose escalation will occur.  
• If one treated patient experiences a DLT (defined below) by Day 28 of 
continuous daily dosing, then an additional three patients will be enrolled 
for a total of six patients treated at the same dos e level.  Escalation will 
occur if no additional DLTs are seen in that cohort (one of six patients).  
• If two or more treated patients at a dose level experience a DLT by Day 
28 of continuous daily dosing, this will be the maximally administered 
dose.     
• A total of six patients will be treated at the previous dose level, and 
subsequent escalation will not exceed the maximally administered dose.   
The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level at which no 
more than one out of six patients have an observable DLT.  RP2D will be 
determined according to safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.  The criteria 
for dose -escalation will apply to a given administration schedule independently.  
Criteria for 
Determination of 
Dose -Limiting 
Toxicity:  
 Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as the occurrence of any of the 
following toxicities possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503) or to study drug in combination with sorafenib during the 
first 28 days of combin ation therapy, unless there is a clear alternative 
explanation:   
• CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 4 
hematological toxicity.  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the presence of active bleeding will be 
considered a DLT.  
• Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological toxicity, except for Grade 3 
nausea/vomiting/anorexia, diarrhea, or fatigue, s ymptoms that will be 
considered  DLTs only if they persist more than seven (7) days despite 
optimal medical management .  Grade 4 toxicity will be considered DLT.  
Alopecia will not be considered DLT.  Assessment for DLT will occur during 
the first 28 days of BBI608 or BBI503 therapy in combination with sorafenib.  
DLT will be determined from adverse events, as well as changes from baseline 
in physical examination findi ngs and laboratory parameters.   
The criteria for determination of DLT will apply to a given administration 
schedule independently.  Patients who discontinue protocol therapy for a reason 
other than DLT may be replaced in order to fully evaluate a given do se-level.   
Duration of 
Treatment:  For an individual patient, treatment with study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) 
and sorafenib will continue in 28 -day cycles or until the investigator determines 
the patient is no longer deriving potential clinical benefit due to unacceptable 
toxicity, dise ase progression, or another discontinuation criterion.   
A patient may continue protocol therapy beyond progression that is determined 
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 6 solely by RECIST 1.1 criteria or mRECIST criteria for patients with HCC, 
provided that the patient is obtaining potential  clinical benefit in the opinion of 
the investigator.  
It is expected that most patients will receive between 4 and 24 weeks of 
treatment.  
Pharmacokinetic 
and 
Pharmacodynamic 
Variables:  Pharmacokinetic variables to be determined include maximum plasma drug 
concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax) , area under the time -
concentration curve (AUC), and terminal half -life.   
Blood samples for PK analyses will be performed on Cycle 1, Day s 15-16 and 
on Cycle 2, Day 1 5 of the phase Ib portion .  During the phase II portion,  
approximately six patient s will collect PK as Phase I schedule, then a single 
pharmacokinetic blood draw may be obtained on Cycle 2, Day 1 5.    
Paraffin embedded tumor ti ssue is requested from all patients prior to initiation 
of protocol therapy.  Patients may enroll if they do not have archival tissue.  
Patients may enroll if they are not aware if they have archival tissue.   
Pharmacodynamic studies as well as the concent ration of study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503) in tumors will be examined following study drug 
administration in patients with accessible tumors who consent to an optional on -
study biopsy. This optional biopsy will be obtained on Cycle 2, Day 1 5.   
Statis tical Methods:  
 Statistics will be descriptive in nature, and formal sample size calculations were 
not performed.     
Phase Ib:  
Central randomization will be performed whereby patients will be assigned to 
Arm 1 (BBI608 plus sorafenib) or Arm 2 (BBI503 plus sorafenib) using block 
randomization.  Each block will be considered a cohort with 3 subjects on Arm 
1 and 3 subjects on Arm 2.  After the first cohort for an Arm is complete, the 
dose level for the next cohort will be determined by the dose escalation rules.  
Safety will be summarized according to study arm.  All patients receiving at 
least one dose of study drug (either BBI608 or  BBI503) will be considered 
evaluable for safety analyses.  Adverse events will be assessed according to 
CTCAE and will be evaluated by grade and organ class.  Adverse event listings 
and tabulated summaries of categorized adverse events will be generated f or all 
patients.  Vital signs, laboratory data, and ECG data will be summarized for 
changes over time on study.   
The pharmacokinetic population will be all treated patients in a given arm with 
sufficient data to determine pharmacokinetic parameters.   
Phase II:  
Approximately 90 patients (30/arm) were planned to be randomized in 1:1:1 
ratio into three treatment arms: Arm 1 (sorafenib plus BBI608), Arm 2 
(sorafenib plus BBI503), and Arm 3 (sorafenib alone) before Amendment 3 was 
in effect.  After amendment 3  was in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion was 
closed for enrollment and randomization is conducted in a 1:1 ratio to the two 
remaining arms: Arm 1 and Arm 3. The targeted sample size remains 30 for 
Arm 1 and 30 Arm 3 after the amendment 3. There were a pproximately 10 
subjects already enrolled in Arm 2 by the time amendment 3 was put into effect.  
Therefore, the total sample size of Phase II at the end of the trial is projected to 
be approximately 70 patients.  
Baseline characteristics as well as the obs erved safety, tolerability, and 
preliminary signs of anti -tumor activity will be summarized for each arm.

Confidential    Page: 7  The anti -tumor activity will be evaluated on an exploratory basis and will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics or graphics. Patient response  will be 
assessed based on standard RECIST 1.1, as well as mRECIST for patients with 
HCC.  Data listings and summaries of tumor markers, imaging results, and 
similar data may be generated.  Kaplan -Meier estimates of overall survival and 
progression -free su rvival will be generated.   
Phase Ib and Phase II:   
Anti-tumor activity will be summarized by arm.  Patients in a given study arm 
who have received at least one cycle of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) 
and who have had at least one disease assessment following the initiation of 
therapy will be considered evaluable for response.  
The anti -tumor activity will be evaluated on an exploratory basis and will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics or graphics. Patient response will be 
assessed based on sta ndard RECIST 1.1, as well as mRECIST for patients with 
HCC.  Data listings and summaries of tumor markers, imaging results, and 
similar data may be generated.  Kaplan -Meier estimates of overall survival and 
progression -free survival will be generated.  
 
Phase II 
There is no statistical hypothesis testing in the Phase 2 part and the sample size 
of Phase 2 part is considered to be clinically adequate to assess tolerability, 
safety, and preliminary anti -cancer activity of the study drugs of interest. 
Estimation  and 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the proportion of 
patients with grade 3 adverse events by treatment, as well as for the proportion 
of patients that are alive and progression free 4 months (PFS -4) after 
randomization for each arm.

Confidential    Page: 16 1 PRECLINICAL SUMMARY AND STUDY RATIONALE  
1.1 Brief Scientific Background  
Recent studies have uncovered the presence of cancer stem cells (CSC s, also called tumor initiating cells , 
or cancer stem -like cells) which have self -renewal capability and are consid ered to be fundamentally 
responsible for malignant growth, relapse , and metastasis.  Importantly, CSCs are inherently resistant to 
conventional therapies.  Therefore, a targeted agent with activity against cancer stem cells for cancer 
patients is being exp lored (Clevers, 2011: Singh and Settleman, 2010; Lobo, Shimono et al . 2007; Boman 
and Wicha, 2008; please also find a list of reviews on CSCs in all major cancer types in the special issue of 
Journal of Clinical Oncology on cancer stem cells (J Clin Oncol.  2008 Jun 10;  26(17)).  
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary signs of activity of two different 
investigational agents designed as cancer stem cell inhibitors, BBI608 and BBI503, each administered in 
combination with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  Sorafenib is an 
oral agent currently approved for the treatment of advanced HCC .  A combination regimen which targets 
the cancer stem cell population  in addition to the bulk tumor cells (non -stem c ancer cells)  may be an  
approach for this disease.   
The study agents, BBI608 and BBI503, are discussed subsequently .  Brief introductions to both agents are 
followed by pre -clinical efficacy data and updates from  clinical development to date.  Additional 
information is available in the Investigator Brochures (IB) for both compounds.   
1.1.1 BBI608 
BBI608 is a small molecule that is hypothesized to affect multiple oncogenic cellular pathways, including 
inhibition of the STAT3 pathway, which has been im plicated in cancer stem cell viability.   
1.1.2 BBI503  
BBI503 is the product candidate selected from our BBI5600 program designed by BBI to target CSCs. 
BBI503 may target cancer through inhibition of kinases that may be responsible for cancer stemness 
properties.   
1.2 Preclinical Efficacy  
1.2.1 BBI608  
Cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant (more than 5 to 10 -fold than other tumor cells ) to 
chemotherapeutic drugs. BBI608 has activity (~100 to 500 nM) against cancer stem cells in vitro .  At the 
same time, BBI608 spares  normal hematopoietic stem cells (IC50 not reached at 30 μM)  in vitro .  
BBI608 has demonstrated in-vitro  activity in a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines derived from 
both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (IC50 ~100 nM to 500 nM).  
Further pre -clinical work in HCC cell lines has shown  that BBI608  is active in vitro against both bulk tumor 
cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) derived from HCC cell lines .  Moreover,  there is evidence that  BBI608 
may act synergistically with sorafenib in vitro.   Figure 1 below demonstrates in vitro activity of BBI608 
and BBI608 with sorafenib against bulk tumor cells, whereas Figure 2 shows that  BBI608 and BBI608 
with sorafenib re duces the ability of CSC s to form characteristic spheres in non -adherent stem cell media  
in vitro . 
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018

Confidential    Page: 18 and the cells remain viable.   Cancer stem cell markers such as CD133 and CD44 are reduced after treatmen t 
with BBI503.  Treatment with the combination of BBI503 + Sorafenib has also shown in vitro activity 
against CSC derived from HCC cell lines.   
 
Figure 3: BBI503 &  Sorafenib Sphere Form ation   
Single CSC cells were grown in suspension for 48 hrs. 
1µM BBI503 and 2 µM Sorafenib were added for 24 
hrs. Drug was removed, and cells were cultured another 
24 hours. DIC images were taken for the CSC sphere. 
Note: BBI503 compound is bright yellow, and is 
accumulated in CSC cells; blue is from Trypan Blue 
indicating dead cells.  
 
 
Additional  studies were performed on bulk cancer cells derived from HCC cell lines .  Compared with the 
CSC -enriched sphere culture, bulk cells contain mainly (~ 98%) non -CSCs. In Figure 4 below, t he 
combination of BBI503 and sorafenib may be synergistic in -vitro.  
Figure 4: BBI503 & Sorafenib Colony Formation  
 
Using Hep3B and Huh7 cell lines, 1000 cells per well were seeded in  6-well plate s. The n ext day, 
the cells were treated with BBI503 0.3 µM, sorafenib 2 µM, or the combination of both for 24 
hours.  After 24 hours,  the remaining cells were cultured in  fresh  medium  for 7 -10 days until 
visible  colonies formed . 
1.3 Safety and Antitumor Activity in Phase I  
1.3.1 BBI608  
A phase 1 dose escalation study (BBI608 -101) in adult patients with advanced cancer was initiated to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2  dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics and preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of napabucasin. A modified Simon accelerated titration scheme was used for dose 
escalation, with a cycle consisting of twice -daily oral administration of napabucasin for 4 weeks, and was 
repeated every 4 weeks (28  days) until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other 
discontinuation criteria were met.  

Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 19  
The dose of napabucasin was escalated from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day, and MTD was not reached  according 
to the protocol definition .  However, further dose escalation beyond 1000 mg/day was limited by pill burden 
and gastrointestinal adverse events. In the 87 patients the most common adverse events (regardless of 
reported causality) included diarrhea (83%), fatigue (62%), abdominal pai n (59%), nausea (56%), vomiting 
(52%), and anorexia (51%).  Grade 3 events included diarrhea (16%), fatigue (14%), abdominal pain (6%), 
dehydration (6%), and anemia (6%).  The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined to be 500 
mg twice daily (1000 m g total daily dose).   The plasma concentration of napabucasin reached a mean 
maximal concentration of 843 ng/mL.  
BBI608 has also been combined with several chemotherapeutic agents to date.  The current safety and 
efficacy data are available in the IB  (version 6.3) .   
1.3.2 BBI503  
A phase 1 dose escalation study  (BBI503 -101) in adult patients with advanced cancer has been initiated to 
determine the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics , and preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of BBI503. A modified Simon accelerated titration scheme was used for dose escalation , 
in which BBI503 was administered orally, once daily, twice daily, or three times daily in continuous 28 -
day cycles. Cycles were repe ated until progression of disease, unacceptable adverse events, or anther 
discontinuation criterion was  met.  
The dose of BBI503 has been escalated  from 10 mg to 600 mg total daily, and a MTD has not been reached  
according to the protocol definition .  Howe ver, f urther dose -escalation was limited by pill burden or 
gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, diarrhea).  BBI503 plasma concentration reach ed the in -vitro IC 50 
and pharmacokinetic parameters maximized at 300 mg to 400 mg total daily.  The putative re commended 
phase II dose for once daily dosing is 300 mg once daily and the putative recommended phase II dose for 
twice daily dosing is 200 mg twice daily (400 mg total daily).   
BBI503 observed adverse events have been predominantly mild to moderate gastr ointestinal disturbances.  
The most common events have been CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2 abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and nausea.  
Non-gastrointestinal events have included fatigue. Grade 3 events considered possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to protoc ol therapy have included diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and abdominal cramping.  
Adverse events can be managed with supportive care such as intravenous fluids and pharmacologic 
measures  targeting the specific symptom .  Dose -modification or hold ing of dosing until symptoms improve 
and/or resolve is recommended for moderate to severe symptoms .   
Please refer to the Investigator Brochure for additional clinical data .   
In summary, BBI503 has shown an manageable safety profile, favorable pharmacokinetics, and preliminary 
signs of antitumor activity.   
1.4 Combination Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Advanced HCC remains a clinical challenge .  This is due to several factors, including the chemoresistant 
nature  of the disease, the toxicit y profile of currently available systemic chemotherapeutic agents , and the 
general poor health and  underlying liver dysfunction  of HCC patients (Kelley, R 2013).  The Sorafenib 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Protocol (SHARP) trial  remains the only randomized contr olled trial 
of a systemic chemotherapeutic agent to demonstrate a statistically significant survival benefit in patients 
with advanced, unresectable HCC  (Bruix , J 2012; Llovet , JM 2008) .  In that study, 602 patients were 
randomly assigned to receive sorafe nib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo . A median Overall Survival  (OS) 
of 10.7 mo nths was observed in the treatment arm  compared to 7.9 mo nths for placebo .  Time to Tumor 
Progression (TTP) for the sorafenib and placebo arms was 5.5 months and  2.8 mo nths, resp ectively .   
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 20 The benefits achieved with sorafenib monotherapy are important, but modest  in magnitude  (2.8 months 
increase in median survival) .  Many patients do not experience disease control, and disease control can be 
short -lived in those that do  achieve it with therapy.  Unfortunately, however, no other agent has proven 
more effective.  Recent phase III trials with other regimen s (FOLFOX, brivanib, sunitinib and linifanib; 
Qin, S et al, 2012; Johnson, PJ et al, 2013, Cheng, A et al 2011; Cianap, C et al, 2012 ) have all failed to 
demonstrate a statistically significant  improvement in OS when compared to treatment with sorafenib .   
There have also been multiple studies of combination therapy using sorafenib plus an additional agent  or 
regimen .  Few combinations, however, have progressed  for further evaluation in the phase III, pivotal 
setting.  Those that have been evaluated in phase III trials , such as Brivanib , FOLFOX,  and Erlotinib, have 
failed to  demonstrate superiority to sorafenib alone.  Incre ased toxicity and poor quality of life were  
observed in the BRISK -FL study , and an increased incidence of hand -foot syndrome has been observed in 
combination studies with 5 -FU or 5 -FU derivative therapies [ Dig Dis Sci. 2012 May; 57(5): 1122 –1129 ].  
An unme t medical need exists for active systemic therapies in HCC.

clinically significant cardiac enlargement or hypertrophy, new bundle branch block, or signs of 
active ischemia.  Patients with evidence of prior infarctio n who are NYHA functional class es II, 
III, or IV are excluded, as are patients with marked arrhythmia s such as Wolff Parkinson White 
pattern or complete AV dissociation*.    
*Patients with complete or incomplete AV dissociation who have a pacemaker may be eligible for enrollment 
provided they are NYHA functional class I: “No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity 
does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea (shortness of breath).”  
3.3 Number of Patients  
The number of patients enrol led on this study depends on the number of cohorts enrolled  in phase Ib  and 
the adverse events observed.  It is expected that approximately 6 to 12 patients will be enrolled in each arm  
during phase Ib dose-escalation, for 12 to 24 patients  total in phase Ib. After RP2D is determined for BBI608 
in combination with sorafenib and for BBI503 * in combination with sorafenib, enrollment to a randomized 
phase II portion of the study will begin.  A total of approximately 90 patients will be randomized to one of 
three study arms: sorafenib  in combination with BBI608 , sorafenib  in combination with BBI503 , or 
sorafenib alone , so that approximately 30 patients per arm  will be enrolled . Patient accrual will occur over 
a period of time dependent upon the enrollment rat e.  *Once the amendment 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in the 
Phase II portion will be closed for enrollment due to BBI503 portfolio priorities and to increase efforts in 
enrolling patients on to Arms 1 and 3 .  When  amendment  3 was in effect, there were approximate ly 10 
subjects enrolled in each of the three arms, and approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in each of the 
two open arms  (70 total for phase II) . 
The sample size for the phase II portion provides for an evaluation of tolerability, safety, and prelimi nary 
anti-tumor activity (see Section 10 and Section 10.5 for details).  Briefly, e nrollment will support an  
evaluation of the proportion of patients treated with combination therapy or with sorafenib alone who 
experience a grade 3 adverse event.  Enrollment a lso supports an evaluation of the proportion of patients 
treated with combination therapy or with sorafenib alone who a re alive and without progression at 4 months 
(16 weeks) after randomization . 
Non-evaluable patients for reasons unrelated  to the treatment will be replaced, such as subjects with 
exclusion criteria inadvertently randomized or subjects who withdraw for personal reasons .

Confidential    Page: 25 4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is an open -label  Phase Ib /II study of oral study drug (BBI608 or BBI503) administered in combination 
with sorafenib to adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  The study will proceed 
initially as a phase Ib dose -escalation study, in which patients will be randomized  to receive escalating 
doses of either  BBI608 in combination with sorafenib  [phase Ib Arm 1],  or escalating doses of BBI503 in  
combination with sorafe nib [phase Ib Arm 2].  The phase Ib portion of the study is d esigned to determine  
the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for BBI608 plus 
sorafenib and of BBI503 plus sorafenib .   
When putative RP2D is determined fo r each study drug in combination with standard sorafenib  dosing  
according to the criteria for determination of dose -escalation and dose limiting toxicity per -protocol, the 
phase II portion of the study will begin.   
The phase II portion is a randomized, 3 -arm, open -label controlled study designed to compare the safety, 
tolerability , and preliminary anti -tumor activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
randomized to receive treatment with  either sorafenib  plus BBI608 [phase II Arm 1], sorafenib  plus BBI503  
[phase II Arm 2], or sorafenib alone [p hase II Arm 3 ].  In the phase II portion, BBI608 and BBI503 will be 
administered at their respective RP2D dose levels for administration with standard sorafenib  dosing  which 
were determined durin g the phase Ib portion  of the study .  Sorafenib will be administered at standard dose 
for both the phase Ib and phase II portions of this study.   
Note:  
Once the amendment 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion will be closed for enrollment due to 
BBI503 portfolio priorities and to increase efforts in enrolling patients on to Arm 1 and 3 .  
When  amendment  3 being in effect,  there were  approximately 10 subjects enrolled in Arm 2.  
Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in each of the two open remaining arms  (70 total for phase II) .   
During both the Phase Ib and Phase II portions of this study, objective (i.e. radiologic) disease assessments 
are required.  A baseline objective disease assessment is required  within 14 days of starting protocol 
therapy . Per -protocol objective disease assessments will be performed every eight weeks (56 days), as 
calculated according to the date of the first dose of protocol therapy on study .  A window of ±7 days is 
allowed when scheduling radiologic disease assessm ents (applies to each scan individually).  Clinically 
indicated radiologic evaluations outside of this schedule are allowed (see Section 5.7, Tumor Evaluation 
Visit s)  
4.2 Design  - Phase Ib  
Patients will be randomized  into available enrollment slots in either Arm 1, BBI608 in combination with 
sorafenib , or in Arm 2, BBI503 in combination with sorafenib .  Protocol therapy for each arm will consist 
of daily oral administration of either BBI608 or BBI503 in combination with a fixed dose of sorafenib .  
Prior to initiation of combination therapy  for an individual patient , sorafenib will be administered as 
monotherapy for 14 days.  Dose -adjustment of sorafenib is allo wed according to the approved product label .  
The combination regimen  of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) plus sorafenib  will be administered in 
continuous 28 -day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation 
criterion is met.  
Sorafenib will be administered at a fixed dose of 400 mg twice daily (800 mg total daily dose).  This dose 
of sorafenib will be the same for each arm and for each dose -level cohort.  Sorafenib should be taken on an 
empty stomach, one hour prio r to or two hours after meals.  Sorafenib should not be taken with study drug, 
and at least 2 hours should separate a dose of sorafenib from a dose of study drug.

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 26 Dose -escalation, determination of dose -limiting toxicity, and determination of RP2D will occu r 
independently in each study arm.   
Arm 1:  
BBI608 will be administered orally, twice daily . The first dose of BBI608 should be administered 
shortly after waking in the morning . The second  dose of BBI608 should be taken before bed , and 
approximately  12 hours should separate the two  BBI608  doses .  BBI608  should not be taken with 
sorafenib.    
BBI608 should be administered before the first dose of sorafenib. A dose of BBI608 should be separated 
from a dose of sorafenib by at least 2 hours. It is recommende d to take both BBI608 and sorafenib 
around the same time every day.  
Example s of dosing schedule s consistent with these instructions can be found in the accompanying 
study manual .  The dose of BBI608 to be administered will depend on the assigned dose -level cohort 
as follows in the table below : 
BBI608 Dose Level  BBI608 Dose & Schedule  
BBI608 Dose -Level I  160 mg Twice Daily  
BBI608 Dose -Level II  240 mg Twice Daily  
Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled at BBI608 Dose -Level 1.  Dose -escalation will proceed with cohorts 
of three to six patients according to the Criteria for Dose Escalation and Criteria for Determination of 
Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT).  
Intermediate or additional dose-levels are permitted upon  agreement  with the Principal Investigator  and 
medical monitor for the Sponsor . The RP2D determined for BBI608 in combination with standard 
sorafenib dosing during the phase Ib portion of the study will be the starting dose for the BBI608 plus 
standard sorafenib a rm of the randomized phase II portion of t he study.   
Arm 2:  
BBI503 will be administered orally, daily. The daily dose of BBI503 will be administered before bed.  
BBI503 should not be taken with sorafenib.  
BBI503 is taken 1 hour prior to meals or 2 hours after.  A dose of BBI503 and a dose of sorafenib 
should be separated by at least 2 hours.  
The dose of BBI503 to be administered will depend on the assigned dose -level cohort as follows in the 
table below:  
BBI503 Dose Level  BBI503 Dose & Schedule  
BBI503 Dose -Level I  100 mg Once Daily  
BBI503 Dose -Level II  200 mg Once Daily  
Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled at BBI503 Dose -Level 1.  Dose -escalation will proceed with cohorts 
of three to six patients according to the Criteria for Dose Escalation and Criteria for Determination of 
Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT).

Confidential    Page: 27 Intermediate or additional dose-levels are permitted upon agreement with the Principal Investigator  and 
medical monitor for the Sponsor .  The total daily dose of BBI50 3 may be divided into sub -doses.  The 
RP2D determined for BBI503 in combination with standard sorafenib dosing during the phase Ib 
portion of the study will be the starting dose for the BBI503 plus standard sorafenib arm of the 
randomize d phase II portion of the study.    
RP2D Determination  
In both Arm 1 and Arm 2, d ose escalation will proceed with the purpose of determining a recommended 
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) .  Dose escalation will proceed in each arm independent of the other arm.  The goal of 
dose escalation in Arm 1 is to determine RP2D of BBI608 in combination with sorafenib .  The goal of 
dose-escalation in Arm 2 is to determine RP2D  of BBI503 in combination w ith sorafenib.  In both arms, if 
a patient discontinues study participation for reasons other than DLT, that patient may be replaced so that 
the safety of the dose -cohort can be fully evaluated.  
For both arms, t he decision to escalate  the dose of study dr ug in combination with sorafenib is based on the 
adverse events observed and the criteria for determination of dose-escalation (dose -escalation decision 
rules ) in Table 1 below .  The criteria for determination of dose -escalation will be applied independently to 
each arm.

Number of Subjects with 
DLT at a Given Dose Level   
Escalation Decision Rule  
 
0 out of 3   
Enter 3 subjects at the next dose level  
 
> 2  
Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be 
declared the maximally administered dose (highest dose 
administered).  Three (3) additional subjects will be entered 
at the next lower dose level if only 3 subjects were treated 
previously at that dose.  
 
1 out of 3   
Enter at least 3 more subjects at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 subjects experience DLT,  proceed to the 
next dose level  
• If 1 or more of this group experience  DLT, then dose 
escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared the 
maximally administered dose.  Three (3) additional 
subjects will be entered at the next lower dose level if 
only 3 subjects were treated previously at  that dose.  
 
<1 out of 6 at highest dose level 
below the maximally 
administered dose   
This is the maximally tolerated dose.   RP2D will not exceed 
MTD.   
For each arm, t he DLT and Escalation Decisi on Rules outlined  in Table 1 apply to a given administration 
schedule independently.   The recommended phase II dose will be determined based on the clinical safety 
and tole rability observed, as well as on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  of the dosing cohort .   
The determination of RP2D in each study arm will not be based solely on DLT observed during the DLT 
observation period.  The determination of RP2D will include a n assessment of Grade 2 adverse events of 
long duration as well as toxicities beyond the first cycle.

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 28 Once  a putative  recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined , up to 6 additional patients 
evaluable for determination of dose -escalation may be e nrolled  to confirm safety and tolerability .  A 
putative RP2D determination may be updated.   
The phase Ib portion of the study will be declared to be completed o nce RP2D for BBI608 in combination 
with sorafenib and RP2D for BBI503 in combination with sorafenib are both  determined .    
The principal investigator and study staff at all study sites will be notified when the phase Ib portion of the 
study has ended.  Receipt of this notification must be confirmed.  Once the phase Ib portion has ended, 
further enrollment will be in the randomized phase II portion.  As such, during the informed consent process  
for the phase II portion of the study , potential study patients must be made aware of the possibility of being 
randomized to receiv e standard of care (sorafenib) alone .    
4.3 Design – Phase II  
The phase I I portion of the study will begi n when RP2D is determined for each agent in combination with 
sorafenib.  Patients enrolled into the phase Ib portion will not be eligible for enrollment into the phase II 
portion.   
The primary aim of the phase II portion is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and preliminary anti -tumor 
activity in patients randomized to each  arm above.  Sorafenib is the current standard of care for patients 
with advanced HCC.  The evaluation of safety and activity planned for the phase II portion of this study 
will inform the design of further trials.  (see Section 10.5 in Section 10 for further details).   
The phase II portion of the study will require patients to meet the same inclusion and exclusion requirements 
as the phase Ib portion, which are outlined in Section 0 and in Section 3.2.  After completing all screening 
tests and ensuring all criteria are met, s tudy sites will submit a randomization request for those patients who 
are eligible for enrollment.  Patient s will be centrally randomized in an open label fashion in a 1:1:1 ratio  
to one of the following three arms outlined in Table 2 below : 
Note:  
Once the amendment 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion will be closed for enrollment due to 
BBI503 portfolio priorities and to increase efforts in enrolling patients on to Arm 1 and 3 .  
At the time of the amendment  3 there were  approximately 10 subjects enrolled in Arm 2,  therefore a total 
of approximately 70 patients will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study, or  approximately 30 
patients will be enrolled in each of the two open remaining arms .

Phase II Arm 2  Sorafenib  400 mg Twice Daily  BBI503  Phase Ib RP2D  
Phase II Arm 3  Sorafenib  400 mg Twice Daily  - - 
Once randomized, patients are to begin protocol therapy within 72 hours of randomization.  There are only 
slight differences in the patient visit schedule and schedule of assessment for patients enrolled onto the 
phase II portion of the study.  The  study visit schedules are outlined in section  5.   
The schedule of administration  for protocol therapy is the same in both the phase Ib and phase II portions 
of the study.  In addition, for both phase Ib and phase II, the backbone chemotherapy  is the standard dosing 
of sorafenib . 
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 29 For patients enrolled to the phase II portion of the stu dy, p er-protocol objective (radiologic) disease 
assessments (see Section 5.7.2 ) should occur every 8 weeks (56 days) until disease progression is 
documented according to RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST for HCC.  Protocol therapy may be continued in an 
open -label fashion until th e investigator determines that the patient is no longer deriving clinical benefit.  
If sorafenib is discontinued for any reason, study drug (BBI608 or BBI503) may be continued.  If a patient 
is randomized to Phase II Arm 1 or Phase II Arm 2, and study drug is permanently discontinued, patients 
will begin the follow -up portion of the  protocol  assessment schedule  (see Section 5.10), and may receive 
any further treatment  as determine d by the treating investigator, including sorafenib.   Objective (radiologic) 
disease assessments  should continue to be obtained every 8  weeks in these patients until progression is 
documented according to RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST for HCC.       
If RP2D for either BBI608 or BBI503 in combination with sorafenib is updated during the course of the 
phase II portion of the study, then patients randomized to that study arm will be administered study drug at 
the updated RP2D.  If needed, u p to 30 patien ts total may be enrolled in a study  arm at a given dose of study 
drug during the phase II portion of the study.   
 
 
 
4.4 Rationale for Study Design  
HCC is a global disease with a marked unmet medical need for effective systemic therapy.  The s cientific 
literature suggests that cancer stem cells may play a role in resistance to effective chemotherapies. Th us, 
there is a strong rationale to clinically evaluate the addition of an agent which targets cancer stem cells to 
a therapy such as sorafenib which has  proven effectiveness in HCC.  
In addition to clinical safety and tolerability, p harmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will be collected 
on this trial in order to establish the optimal dosing regimen for both BBI608 and BBI503 in combination 
with sorafen ib. The phase II portion will establish a body of evidence on which to base further clinical 
development.     
 
4.5 Selection of Dose  
The starting dose s of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) for phase Ib are based on clinical experience 
during the monotherap y phase I evaluation of both agents.  Doses were selected which were well tolerated 
as monotherapy, and which were well below the maximally administered dose for each agent.   
For the phase Ib portion, t he starting dose of BBI608 in combination with sorafe nib is 160 of BBI608  taken 
twice daily .  This is 33% of the BBI608 monotherapy RP2D  (480 mg twice daily, 960 mg total daily dose) , 
and 16 .7% of the maximally administered dose during the monotherapy phase I trial  (1000 mg twice daily, 
2000 mg total daily dose) .  Of note, MTD was not determined in the BBI608 monotherapy phase I dose -
escalation trial.  
The starting dose of BBI503 in combination with sorafenib is  100 mg once daily.  This is 33% of  the 
BBI503 monother apy once daily RP2D  (300 mg once daily) , and 16.7% of the maximally administered 
dose during the monotherapy phase I trial  (200 mg three times daily and 300 mg twice daily, or 600 mg 
total daily dose) .  Of note, MTD was not determined in the BBI503 monothe rapy phase I dose -escalation 
trial.   
The dose of BBI608 and of BBI503 * for the phase II portion of the study will be determined during the 
phase Ib portion of the study.  The sta rting dose for phase II Arm 1 ( sorafenib  plus BBI608 ) will be the 
RP2D of BBI608 in combination with sorafenib as determined during dose -escalation of phase Ib Arm 1.  
The starting dose for phase II Arm 2 ( sorafenib  plus BBI503 ) will be the RP2D of BBI503 in combination 
with sorafenib as determined during dose -escalation of phase I b Arm 2.

Confidential    Page: 30 * Once the amendment 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion will be closed for enrollment.  
 
4.6 Criteria for Dose Escalation and Determination of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Patients are considered evaluable for determination of DLT and for determination of dose -escalation  if they 
have been exposed to at least 28 days of continuous daily administration of study drug (BBI608 o r BBI503 ) 
in combination with sorafenib at a compliance level of at least 80%  for the combination regimen .   
Compliance  for study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) and sorafenib is calculated by dividing  the number 
of pills ingested by the total number of pills assigned to be ingested  (see Section 7.4) .  The assigned dose 
of BBI608 or BBI503 is that determined by the dose -level cohort  into which the patient is enrolled .  The 
assigned dose of sorafenib is the dose administered at the start of combination therapy , as determined during  
the 2 -week run -in period .  The starting dose of sorafenib is 400 mg twice daily, and dose -reductions 
according to standard of care are allowed .  Events meeting  DLT definition that occur during the sorafenib 
run-in period will not be considered DLT s.  Events occurring at any time that are determined to be due 
solely to sorafenib will not be considered DLT s.   
Enrollment at the next  dose level of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI03) and/or enrollment of additional 
patients into the ongoing cohort will be based on the tolerability and sa fety observed in evaluable patients, 
according to criteria described below:  
• If zero treated patients experience a DLT (defined below) by Day 28 of continuous daily dosing, 
then dose escalation will occur.  
• If one treated patient experiences a DLT (defined below) by Day 28 of continuous daily dosing, 
then an additional three patients will be enrolled for a total of six patients treated at the same dose 
level.  Escalation will occur if no additional DLTs are seen in that cohort (one of six patients).  
• If two o r more treated patients at a dose level experience a DLT  (defined below)  by Day 28 of 
continuous daily dosing, this will be the maximally administered dose.     
Once the maximally administered dose is determined, a  total of six patients will be treated at the previous 
dose level .    
The BBI medical Monitor and Principal Investigator  will review all significant combination therapy related 
toxicities to determine if the dose escalation schedule requires modification.  Intermediate  or additional  
dose level s or an alternate administration schedule  may be assigned to a cohort after agreement between 
the BBI Medical Monitor and the Principal Investigator .  
 
4.7 Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as the occurrence of any of the following toxicities possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) or to study drug in combination 
with sorafenib during the first 28 days of combination therapy, unless there is a clear alternative 
explanation:   
• CTCAE (Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 4 hematological  toxicity.  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the presence of active bleeding . 
• Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological toxicity, except for Grade 3 nausea/vomiting/anorexia, diarrhea, 
or fatigue , symptoms that will be considered DLT s only if they persist more than seven (7) days 
despite optimal medical management .  Grade 4 toxicity will be considered DLT.   
Alopecia will not be considered  a DLT.  Assessment of DLT s will occur during the first 28 days of BBI608 
or BBI503 therapy in combination with sorafenib.  DLT s will be determined from both adverse events  and 
changes from baseline in physical examination findings and laboratory parameters.

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 31 The criteria for determination of DLT s will apply to a given administrat ion schedule independently.  
Patients who discontinue protocol therapy for a reason other than  a DLT may be replaced in order to fully 
evaluate a given dose -level.   
 
4.8 Study Duration  
For both the phase Ib and phase II components of the study, p atients will receive treatment with combination 
therapy (either BBI608 or BBI503 * in combination with sorafenib)  until the investigator has determined 
that the patient is no longer likely to receive clinical benefit due to progression of disease, unaccepta ble 
toxicity , or another discontinuation criteri on (see Section 5.9).  It is expected that most patients will receive 
between one and four cycles of combination th erapy for a treatment period of 4 to 16 weeks.  It is expected 
that patient accrual for both the phase Ib and phase II portions of the trial will occur over a period of 12 -18 
months, with an additional 12 months to complete  follow -up.   
* Once the amendmen t 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion will be closed for enrollment.

Confidential    Page: 32 5 STUDY VISITS  
5.1 Overview  
For the phase Ib portion of the study, s tudy visits will consist of a Pre-Study Evaluation , during which the 
patient will be  evaluated to determine eligibility for entry into the study; a Cycle 1,  Day 1 Visit  at the start 
of the sorafenib monotherapy run -in period;  a phone call to patients on Cycle 1, Day 8 , which is  the 
approximate mid -point of the 14 -day sorafenib monotherapy  run-in period; a Cycle 1, Day 1 5 Visit, which 
is the  start of combination therapy ; a Cycle 1, Day 22 visit ; and then regular evaluations  every 2 -weeks 
starting on Cycle 2, Day 1.   
For the phase II portion of the study, study visits will also involve  a Pre-Study Evaluation .  Cycle 1 visits 
will include  a brief visit on Cycle 1,  Day 1  (the start of the sorafenib monotherapy run -in period ); a phone 
call to patients on Cycle 1, Day 8 ; a full visit on Cycle 1, Day 15  (the start of combination therapy ); and a 
visit on Cycle 1,  Day 22 .  In Cycle 2 , there will be visits on Cycle 2, Day 1 and on Cycle 2, Day 15 .   Starting 
in Cycle 3, the only required in -person visit is on the first day of the study cycle  (i.e., Cycle 3, Day 1; Cycle 
4, Day 1, etc.).   
During the  phase II portion, an in -person visit on Cycle 3, Day 15 is optional, and is optional on Day 15 of 
each subsequent cycle, provided patients are stable.  If the in person visit is not performed on Cycle 3, Day 
15 or on Day 15 of a subsequent cycle, study st aff are to reach out to the patient with a phone call.   
For both phase Ib and phase II, a n End-of-Study Evaluation  will also be completed between 14 and 30 days 
after the last dose of  protocol therapy ; See Section 14 for a schedule of Assessments).   
In general, unless otherwise noted, a window of ± 2 days is allowed when scheduling protocol visits and 
evaluations.  If , due to unforeseen circumstances , frame -shifting of a study cycle or patient visit schedule 
occurs  beyond the allowable window of ± 2 days, the medical monitor for the Sponsor  should be notified  
of the alternate schedule .  The protocol window  of ± 2 days may then be applied to the frame -shifted 
schedule.   
Unscheduled clinical assessments during a study cycle are allowed, but should not replace a per -protocol 
study visit unless it is within the ± 2 day window.  During the phase II portion of the study, an unscheduled 
visit during Cycle 3 or  beyond will satisfy the requirement for Day 15 patient contact provided it was +/ - 7 
days from Day 15 of a given cycle , using the date of the start of the cycle as reference .   
5.2 Informed Consent  
Patients who agree to participate will sign the approved info rmed consent and will be provided a copy of 
the signed document.   
Informed consent should be obtained within approximately one month prior to Run-In Day 1 .  An 
appropriate informed consent must be completed prior to undergoing any laboratory or radiologic  
evaluations that are specific ally being performed for the  purpose of screening for this study .  However , 
assessments  or laboratory evaluations  that have been performed as a part of standard of care (and not 
specifically for this study) may be used to qual ify for enrollment .  All screening procedures should be 
performed within the time frames indicated in the sections below.   
The treating investigator must verify that  the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion c riteria.  The patient is 
considered enrolled into the study when he or she  begin s Cycle 1, Day 1 .   
A log will be kept of all patients who sign informed consent.  This “screening log” will indicate whether 
the consented patient was enrolled; if the patient was not enrolled , then the log will indicate the reason for 
non-enrollment .  Recording of official study data on Case Report Forms (CRFs) is only required for those 
patients who enroll in the study (who begin Run -In Day 1).

otherwise been performed should be recorded.  
5.3 Pre-Study Evaluations (Baseline)  
After written informed consent is obtained according to ICH -GCP and local regulations, the patient will be 
evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria according to the eligibility criteria listed in Section 3.   
The Pre -Study evaluation may be held up t o 5 days ( +2) prior to the first dose of sorafenib and/or study 
drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) .  The following evaluations will be obtained (unless otherwise obtained as 
a part of standard of care).   
• Medical history, including resolved medical/surgical co nditions, active concurrent medical 
conditions/adverse events, concurrent medications, as well as detailed history of current cancer 
diagnosis, treatment, and response to treatment (see Section 6.1). 
• Vital signs (weight, temperature, blood pressure, height, respiration and pulse)  and P hysical 
examination, including documentation and measurement of any external or palpable subcutaneous 
lesions (see Sections 9.1.2  and 9.1.3 ) 
• ECOG performance status  (see Section 16) 
• Hematology (see Section 6.3) 
• Blood chemistry (see Section 6.3);  
• Urinalysis (see Section 6.3)  
• Serum pregnancy test (if applicable)  
• Serum AFP le vel* (see Section 6.3) 
• Electrocardiogram * 
• Assess Child Pugh Class  
• Optional t umor biopsy, if applicable * (see Section  6.5.2 ) 
• Tumor lesion measurement and staging according to RECIST 1.1 as well as modified RECIST for 
patients with HCC [computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with tri -phasic 
liver scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast plus a 
CT scan of the chest without contrast in case of allergic reaction to CT scan contrast despite 
appropriate pre -treatment] * * 
*These do not need to be repeated if they were done  within  7 days of this visit           
**Imaging obtained that meets these specifications  can be used as the baseline assessment if it was  obtained  
within two weeks  ± 7 days  of Cycle 1, Day 1.   
Note:  
After  the amendment 3 was in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion was closed for enrollment due to BBI503 
portfolio priorities and to increase efforts in enrolling patients on to Arm 1 and 3 .  
At the time of the amendment  3 being in effect,  there were  approximately 10 subjects en rolled in Arm 2  
and approximately 30 patients  remains to be the targeted sample size  in each of the two open remaining 
arms , therefore, the total actual sample size in Phase II in the end is projected to be approximately 70 
patients after the amendment 3.   
 
5.4 On-Study Evaluation & Assessment Schedule │ Cycle 1  
The patient will be administered sorafenib monotherapy for the first two weeks of Cycle 1, which can also 
be termed “sorafenib run -in”.  The goal of the run-in period is to establish the tolerability of sorafenib prior 
to initiating combination therapy with study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503).   
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 34 Sorafenib will be obtained by the patient during this study as a standard -of-care medication; sorafenib will 
not be p rovided by study Sponsor.    
Time required for the patient to initially obtain sorafenib should be taken into consideration when 
scheduling screening evaluations.  Throughout the study , sorafenib will be supplied as a standard of care 
medication, guided by institutional and manufacturer policy.   
5.4.1 Cycle 1,  Day 1  │ Start of Sorafenib Run -In 
• Patient begins sorafenib dosing at  400 mg twice daily (800 mg total daily dose).    
• Schedule radiologic assessments for 8  weeks ( 56 days) from the date of Cycle 1, Day 1 (a 
scheduling window of ± 7 days is allowed for each radiologic assessment ) * 
• Vital signs ( temperature, blood pressure, respiration and pulse ) and weight  
• AE assessment  
• Review c oncomitant medications  
 
*Radiologic eva luations do not need to correlate with study cycles.  The per -protocol assessments should 
be performed every 8  weeks regardless of study cycle count.  As such, per -protocol radiologic assessments 
should be scheduled in advance once the first dose of sorafe nib is administered on  Cycle 1, day 1 ( Run-In 
Day 1 ).         
5.4.2 Cycle 1,  Day 8  │ Mid Run-In (Phone Call  is allowed)  
• Phone call to patient to assess adverse events with  sorafenib monotherapy  
• Review concomitant medications  
• If visit is held in person, assess vital signs  
5.4.3 Cycle 1, Day 1 5 │Start of Combination Therapy  
The assessments on Cycle 1, Day 1 5 may be  performed before , after, or both before and after  the 
administration of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  as indicated below .  Assessments performed before 
the administration of study drug are to characterize any objective effects of sorafenib monotherapy prior to 
the initiation of combination therapy.    
For the phase Ib portion of the study, both sorafenib and study drug should be administered in clinic to 
accommodate pharmacokinetic evaluations .  The administration schedule is according to study arm  and is 
outlined in the study procedure manual.    
For both the phase Ib and phase II portion s of the study, the following C1D1 5 assessments should be 
performed  prior to the first dose of study drug  for patients randomized  to receive either BBI608 or BBI503 
in combination with sorafenib .  If patients in Phase II have been randomized to receive sorafenib alone 
[Arm 3 ], the following labs are still required but  may be obtained at any time  on C1D15 (either before or 
after dosing with sorafenib on that day) : 
• Physical exam (including vital signs, weight)  
• ECOG performance status (see Section 16) 
• Hematology (see Section 6.3) 
• Blood chemistry (see Section 6.3) 
• Urinalysis (see Section 6.3)  
• Electrocardiogram  prior to first dose of study drug  
• Serum AFP

After the above assessments are performed, study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) may be initiated  for 
those in the phase Ib portion of the study and for thos e in the Phase II portion who have been randomized 
to either  [Arm 1 ] or [Arm 2 *].  For those patients administered a dose of study drug (either BBI608 or 
BBI503), t he following assessments should be performed after  receiving the dose : 
• Phase Ib Only:  Blood samples for pharmacokinetics  (see Section 6.4). 
• Phase Ib Only:  Electrocardiogram pre dose and approximately  3.5 hours after the first dose of study  
drug (either BBI60 8 or BBI503 ) dispense 14 -day supply of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  
• Dispense two (2) days of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  dosing to be kept as “extra doses” 
by patient during study in case of loss or issues with visit scheduling (see Pharmacy Manual)  
The procedures above do not apply to those in the phase II portion who have been randomized to [ Arm 3 ], 
sorafenib alone.

phone  in order to assess adverse events and record concomitant medication.  Vital signs and weight need only be 
obtained if there is an in -person visit.   
5.7 Tumor Evaluation Visits  
5.7.1 Baseline  
Baseline radiologic evaluation of chest, abdomen, and pelvis of sufficient quality to determine presence of 
disease according to RECIST and mRECIST for HCC is required prior to starting protocol therapy.  This 
is defined as computed tomography (CT) with in travenous contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with 
tri-phasic liver scan.  For those with an allergic reaction to intravenous CT contrast despite appropriate pre -
treatment measures, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis with gad olinium plus a 
non-contrast CT scan of the chest is required.   
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 37 Radiologic assessments satisfying the above requirement s that are obtained within 14 days of the first dose 
of sorafenib ( Cycle 1,  Day 1) may be used as baseline imaging.   
5.7.2 Per-Protocol  
Per-protocol radiologic assessments will be performed every eight weeks (56 days), as calculated according 
to the date of the first dose of the sorafenib run -in period.  A window of ±7 days is allowed when scheduling 
radiologic disease assessments (applies to ea ch scan individually).  Per -protocol radiologic assessments are 
defined as a computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with 
tri-phasic liver scan.  For those with an allergic reaction to intravenous CT contrast de spite appropriate pre -
treatment measures, per -protocol evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and 
pelvis with gadolinium plus a non -contrast CT scan of the chest is required .   
Additional radiologic evaluations when clinically indi cated are allowed.  However, evaluations obtained 
for clinical indications cannot be substituted for per -protocol radiologic assessments unless they also satisfy 
the above per-protocol definition of radiologic assessment.    
Per-Protocol radiologic evaluations should be performed every 8  weeks (56 days) until radiologic disease 
progression is observed according to both RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST for patients with HCC.   If 
protocol therapy is permanently discontinued for any reason without documen tation of PD per RECIST 1.1 
and mRECIST for HCC, per -protocol imaging evaluations should continue every 8 -weeks until criteria for 
disease progression are satisfied according to both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST for HCC.   
Patients with an imaging assessment whi ch meets criteria for either complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR)  according to RECIST 1.1 or mRECIST  should have a repeat, confirmatory, radiologic 
assessment approximately 4 weeks after the assessment in which CR or PR criteria were met.  After  the 
confirmatory  image, radiologic assessments return to the every 8  week schedule.   
If, at any time, a determination is made for a study subject to discontinue protocol therapy, the treating 
investigator should determine the likelihood that the patient will be able to attend the next scheduled 
radiologic assessment.  If the treating investigator feels it is unlikely that a patient will be able to obtain the 
next scheduled per -protocol radiologic assessment, a per -protocol radiologic assessment should be obtained 
as soon as possible (a minimum of 4 weeks , however, should elapse  between per -protocol assessments).   
Tumor response will be evaluated using the guidelines for Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1) and modified RECIST for pati ents with HCC.  Highlights of these guidelines are contained 
in Section 9.  
In general, for each radiologic imaging assessment obtained during the study, the following information 
and documentation is required:  
- Completed RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST for HCC works heets  (provided by Sponsor) that document  
lesion measurements and descriptions  
- De-identified, dictated, radiology report of the image (see Section 5.7.4 ) 
De-identif ied digital images and/or complete copies of the digital imaging study may be requested from 
study sites (see Section 5.7.4 ).   
5.7.3 Patient Disposition & RECIST Criter ia 
RECIST criteria serve to categorize clinical radiologic images.  RECIST categorization alone should not 
determine continuation or discontinuation of protocol therapy in a patient.  Given that both study drugs 
(BBI608 and BBI503) have a unique mechanism of action that target s cancer stem cells, study drug therapy 
may be continued in a patient who is clinically well but who meets criteria for “Progressed Disease” per 
RECIST (either RECIST 1.1 or modified RECIST for patients with HCC).  Continuation of study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503) therapy in this context is allowed provided that no further standard, approved 
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 38 treatment options exist , and provided that the investigator concludes  that the potential benefit to the patient 
outweighs the  potential risk.   
5.7.4 Documentation and Digital Files  
Clinical site staff will be responsible for collection and documentation of those lesion measurements 
required to complete response assessments according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines  and modified RECIST 
guidel ines for patients with HCC.  Worksheet s will be provided on which measurements for target and non -
target lesions  using both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST for HCC can be documented.  Please refer to Section 
9 for further information on definitions and RECIST guidelines.   
Quantitative image measurements and qualitative image characteristics according to RECIST guidelines 
will be documented in study Case Report Forms (CRFs).  For exploratory purposes, the Sponsor  may collect 
additional information from patient radiologic ima ges.  Examples of additional information include but are 
not limited to : de-identified radiology reports or dictations , digital copies of de -identified radiologic images , 
and/or complete de -identified image files.    
5.8 End of Study Evaluation  
For both phase Ib and phase II, a ll patients should be seen 14 to 30 days after discontinuation of protocol 
therapy .  This is the End of Study (EOS) visit.  The following assessments will be made during the end of 
study visit:  
• Physical examination  
• ECOG  performance status   
• Vital signs  (weight, temperature, blood pressure, respiration and pulse)  
• Hematology (see Section 6.3) 
• Blood chemistry  (see Section 6.3)  
• Urinalys is (see Section 6.3) 
• Serum AFP  (see Section 6.3) 
• Assess Child Pugh Class  
• Tumor measurements and staging if radiologic progression has not yet been documented on study.  
That is, if a patient discontinues protocol therapy due to radiologic progression of disease, an End 
of Study imaging  assessment is not required.   
• Assess adverse events  
• Record concomitant medications  
Patients who are identified at the EOS visit as having persistent adverse events related to study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI5 03) should continue to be followed on a monthly basis (or more frequently if clinically 
indicated) until resolution of study drug - related adverse events or until the AEs are deemed irreversible.    
Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur up to 30 da ys after the last dose of study drug (either BBI608 
or BBI503) will be reported to the Sponsor  regardless of assessed causality (also see Section 8.2).   
5.9 Discontinuation from Study  
Patients may be removed from the study at any time if they meet any of the following criteria:  
• Progression of disease*  
• Noncompliance with any part of the study, as evaluated by the Principal Investigator  and Medical 
Monitor  
• Patie nt request  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Lost to Follow -up despite documented efforts at contact

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 39 • Clinically unacceptable adverse events despite optimal treatment or dose reduction.  
• Death  
*Since study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) targets cancer stem cells, patie nts may continue study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503) administration with or without sorafenib beyond progression per RECIST  if the 
investigator concludes that  the potential clinical benefits  outweigh potential risks.  
5.9.1 Dates Associated with Discontinuation from Study  
The following clarifies important dates at the end of study treatment:  
Date of Last Dose:  The date that the last dose of study medication is taken (either BBI608 or 
BBI503).  The Date of Last Dose  does not necessarily need to be the Date 
Off Active Study.    
Date Off Active Study:  The date when both the patient and the investigator/study team understand 
the patient to be off of active protocol treatment.  In most cases, this will be 
the same as the Date of Last Dose ; however, it does not need to be the case.  
In addition, the Date Off Active Study  may not coincide with a formal study 
visit.   
End of Study Visit:  A formal study visit held 14 to 30 days after the Date of Last Dose .   
5.10 Follow Up After Treatment Discontinuation  
For both the phase Ib and phase II portions of the study, the follow -up phase of the study will begin  after 
the EOS study visit has been completed .  Patients will be followed for specified clinical endpoints (both  
primary safety and secondary exploratory efficacy endpoint), and other important information such as post -
protocol therapy.    
As specified in Section 5.7.2 , per-protocol imaging (every 8 weeks/56 days) should continue until criteria 
for disease progression according to both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST for HCC are met.   
There are no further visits required specifically for the study after the EOS visit , with the exceptio n of 
radiologic assessments every 8 weeks until progression of disease is documented according to both RECIST 
1.1 criteria and mRECIST for patients with HCC criteria.    
The clinical parameters and endpoints for follow -up after a patient permanently discon tinues study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503) administration are specified in table below, as is the recommended follow up 
frequency.  Follow -up and information collection is intended to be accomplished through review of the 
local medical record system by si te study staff and/or study CRAs -Monitors.  Contact with the primary 
oncologist and/or primary care physician for a given patient may also be required.

Note:  
After  the amendment 3 was in effect, Arm 2 in the Pha se II portion was closed for enrollment due to BBI503 
portfolio priorities and to increase efforts in enrolling patients on to Arm 1 and 3 .  
At the time of the amendment  3 being in effect,  there were  approximately 10 subjects enrolled in Arm 2 
and approximately 30 patients remains to be the targeted sample size  in each of the two open remaining 
arms, therefore, the total actual sample size in Phase II in the end is projected to be approximately 70 
patients after the amendment 3.  
 
6.5 Pharmacodynamic As sessments  
Pre-clinical studies conducted at BBI have identified several biomarkers in tumor tissues whose levels 
either increase or decrease upon exposure to BBI608 or BBI503.  Tumor biopsy is an optional component 
of this study.  Provided  that the patien t has an accessible tumor, an optional tumor biopsy consent form will 
be made available to the patient.  In addition to biopsy, archival tissue will also be collected.   
The goal of the proposed biomarker study is to examine the response of biomarkers in p atients treated with 
study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503).  Subject tumor samples will be processed for determination of 
pharmacodynamic markers by histopathology and flow cytometry.  
Tumor biopsy may be collected from patients who consent to the optional p rocedure during the phase II 
portion of the study – including patients who are randomized to the sorafenib only arm.   
6.5.1 Archival Tissue  
Paraffin -fixed tumor tissue from a previous biopsy or resection is requested of all patients.  Release of tissue 
to BBI f or testing is required if tissue is available.  However, patients may still enroll on study if they do 
not have tissue available.  For those with tissue available, tumor blocks are preferred .  If archival tumor 
blocks are not available, then archival tumor -tissue cores are requested.  If tumor cores cannot be made, 20 
glass slides are requested .   
Site study staff and Sponsor -CRAs/monitors will aid in the coordination and shipment of archival tissue 
samples to BBI.  Remaining tissue blocks and/or slides wil l be returned to sites at the conclusion of testing, 
or at a time requested by the study site.

6.5.2 Tumor Biopsy  
Biopsy is an optional co mponent of  this study. Patients  identified by the Principal Investigator  as having a 
lesion amenable to biopsy  through  a minimal to low -risk procedure may be asked to review a separate 
biopsy -component consent form. Of note, image -guided biopsy of internal  or viscer al lesions may qualify  
as a low -risk procedure.  Patients can refuse the optional biopsy -component of this study and sti ll enroll in  
the main study.  
Patients may consent to one biopsy or to two biopsies.  If the patient consents to two biopsies, a tumor 
biopsy will be collected at some point prior to the administration of the first dose of sorafenib on study, and 
again on Cycle 2, Day 1 5.  Collection, storage, and shipping of tissue samples will be performed as 
described in the study Laboratory & Procedure Manual.  If a patient consents to only one biopsy, then either 
a baseline/pre -treatment biopsy will be obtained prior to the first dose of sorafenib on study, or an on -
treatment biopsy will be obtained on Cycle 2, Day 15.   
If the tumor biopsy is scheduled for a day other than when blood draws for pharmacokinetics are being 
obtained, then a single blood draw within 30 minutes of the time of the biopsy is required.

7.1 Sorafenib  
Sorafenib is to be administered at a starting dose of 400 mg twice daily, in accordance with the standard 
starting dose.  Sorafenib will be administered on an empty stomach, either 1 hour prior to a meal or 2 hours 
after a meal.  Sorafenib will be administered according to the product label.  Dose modification is allowed 
according to standard of care.  Patients must qualify for treatment with sorafenib and must be able to obtain 
sorafenib in order to be enrolled on study.  
Sorafenib will be dispensed during the study according to standard of care practices and in accordance and 
local site and manufacturer policies.     
During the phase Ib portion of the study, if sorafenib is discontinued for any reason, administration of st udy 
drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) may continue per protocol.   
During the phase Ib portion of the study, if study drug (BBI608 or BBI503) administration is permanently 
discontinued for any reason, the patient will be considered to have ended the active tr eatment component 
of the protocol.  The follow -up phase of the study will begin at that time (see Section 5.10), regardless of 
further treatment decisions made at the discretion of the investigator.     
During the phase II portion of the study, patients may continue to receive BBI608 or BBI503 if they are in 
[phase II Arm 1] or [phase II Arm 2] and if sorafenib is  discontinued for any reason.  Patients in [phase II 
Arm 3 ] who discontinue sorafenib will end the active treatment part of the protocol, and will begin the 
follow -up portion of the protocol – including radiologic assessments every 8 weeks (56 days) until  disease 
progression is determined per RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST for HCC.

7.3.2 Study Drug – BBI608 or BBI503  
The safety profiles of both BBI608 and BBI503 are well established.  The following dose -modification 
guidelines are based on clinical experience to date.   
During the dose-escalation  phase of the study , dose-modification of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) 
should adhere to the following guidelines:  
• For any intolerable Grade 2 or Grade 3 adverse events , the assigned dose of study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503) should be held.   
• If the adverse event  resolves to tolerable levels (must be ≤ grade 2 or at the baseline grade), dosing 
can resume at the assigned dose level with pharmacologic support measures administered .   
o Pharmacologic support measures for each study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) are 
provi ded in  Section  7.3.2.1  below.   
• If the adverse event takes longer than 5 days to resolve to tolerable levels (≤ grade 2 ) or to the 
baseline grade , or if the adver se event recurs upon resumed administration despite pharmacologic 
support, the dose may be reduced by one or more  dose level s.   
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 49 o If the assigned dose is the first dose -level and dose -reduction is required, a lower level can 
be determined by the Principal I nvestigator  and the medical monitor for the Sponsor .    
o A patient who requires dose -reduction is allowed to increase his or her dose back to the 
assigned dose -level with pharmacologic support.  
• Intra -patient dose escalation above the assigned starting dose -level is permitted, provided the 
increased dose -level has been determined safe according to the criteria for dose -escalation and 
determination of dose -limiting toxicity (Section 4.6).   
During the phase II portion of the study, and once RP2D is determined for a study drug (either BBI608 or 
BBI503) in combination with sorafenib, dose -modification can occur  according to the following guidelines:  
• For Grade 2 or Grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse events , or Grade 2 or Grade 3 fatigue , the assigned 
dose of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) may be reduced to a lower dose level with or without 
holding dose (a do se holiday).    
o When restarting study drug administration or when modifying to a lower dose -level, 
supportive pharmacology is to be administered as outlined in Section 7.3.2.1 .  
o For a given patient who has reduced his or her dose, and for whom the new dose -level is 
well tolerated, the dose may be increased slowly, as tolerated, with supportive 
pharmacology measures as outlined in Section 7.3.2.1  to a maximum dose of RP2D.     
• For all adverse events other than fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, or cramping, dose 
modification is based  on tolerability as follows:  
o Dosing should be held for intolerable Grade 2 or Grade 3 adverse events until the event 
resolves to tolerable levels (≤ Grade 2).   
o If the above criteria are met, dosing can resume at a lower dose level with appropriate 
pharmac ologic support measures, if applicable.   
o If the lower dose level is well tolerated, the dose can be increased slowly, as tolerated, with 
supportive pharmacology if indicated, to a maximum dose of RP2D.   
7.3.2.1  Specific Pharmacologic Recommendations - BBI608  and BBI503  
Recommendations for supportive pharmacology for adverse events that can be associated with BBI608 or 
BBI03 administration are outlined in Table 9 below, according to symptom.

Diarrhea & Abdominal Cramping   Nause a, Vomiting, or Anorexia1 
Dicyclomine  (e.g., Bentyl) : Recommended when 
the predominant issue is cramping or abdominal 
pain

steroid treatment for the management of adverse event observed with use of targeted agents. 
*Decisions on ADR management are at the discretion of the investigator and must adhere with local 
regul atory guidelines  
When study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) administration is resumed following dose -reduction or a dose 
hold, adverse events that were associated with study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) administration are 
typically improved.  As such, w hen a new dose -level of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) is tolerated 
for 4 to 7 days and pharmacologic support is administered, the dose can be re -escalated, as tolerated, in 
increments allowed by the capsule or tablet in use (e.g., 80 mg for BBI608 a nd 50 mg for BBI503  capsule 
or 100mg tablet ). The dose can be res -escalated up to either the assigned dose -level (if during dose -
escalation) or up to RP2D (if determined).     
7.4 Treatment Compliance  
A patient is considered compliant with the study protocol when each component of the assigned protocol 
therapy is taken at a compliance level of greater than 80%.  The components of protocol therapy assigned 
will depend on what study arm the patient is randomized to , and whether the patient is randomized  during  
the phase Ib or phase II portion of the protocol.   
Compliance with sorafenib will be calculated using the following equation:  
% Compliance = Number  of capsules  actually  ingested  in a given  time  peri od
Number  of capsules  that  should  have  been  ingested* ×100 
*During the phase Ib portion of the study, the denominator of the compliance equation (t he number of sorafenib 
capsules  that should have been ingested ) refers to the dose of sorafenib administered a t the start of combination 
therapy .  During phase II, for patients randomized the sorafenib only arm [phase II Arm 3 ], the denominator of the 
compliance equation will refer to the dose of sorafenib administered on Cycle 1, Day 15.   
Compliance with study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  will be calculated using the following equation:  
% Compliance = Number  of capsules  or tablets  actually  ingested  in a given  time  period
Number  of capsules  or tablets  that  should  have  been  ingested  per dose  level ×100

7.5 Blinding  
This is an open label study.  Neither the patient nor the investigator and site staff will be blinded to the 
treatment administered.  
7.6 Prior Treatment  
Reasonable efforts will be made to determine all prior anti -cancer treatments received by the patient, as 
well as all concurrent medications continuously or occasionally taken at the time of enrollment on study.  
All relevant information must be recorded on the patient's case report form (CRF). All surgical  procedure s, 
prior chemotherapy , and radiation therapy m ust be recorded on the appropriate CRF.   In addition to 
recording this information on the appropriate CRF, the information must also be reported to the Sponsor on 
the enrollment form in order to verify eligibility for the study with respect to prior treatm ents.   
7.7 Concomitant Medication  
7.7.1 Permitted Treatment  
All information regarding concomitant treatments (medications or procedures) must be recorded on the 
patient’s CRF (including the name of the medication or procedure and duration of treatment).  
Palliative  and supportive care for disease -related symptoms will be offered to all patients in this study.  
Patients may receive palliative radiation therapy.  
In addition, the following treatments are allowed:  
• Standard therapies for concurrent medical conditions  
• Epoetin alfa (Epogen®, Procrit®)  
• Hematopoietic growth factors, including filgrastim (Neupogen®) Thrombopoietin (e.g., 
Romiplostim (Nplate®), or other granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G -CSF), are permitted 
Prophylactic anti -emetics and/or anti -diarr heal agents may be administered according to standard 
practice  
• Megestrol acetate (Megace®) 
• Dexamethasone  
• Diphenhydramine  
• Cimetidine  
• Ranitidine  
• Bisphosphonate s 
• Denosumab  
7.7.2 Prohibited Treatment  
The following medications may not be administered to any patients while they are on study:  
• Alternate chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy  (not including corticosteroids) , and 
non-palliative radiotherapy  (radiotherapy with curative intent) .   
• Other investigational agents  
• Immunosuppressive therapies, except for corticosteroids  that are: 1)  used intermittently in an anti -
emetic regimen , 2) prescribed at a non -immunosuppressive dose for treatment of fatigue and low -
appetite, or 3) prescribed as part of a pre -defined steroid taper for post palliative XRT.       
If no alternative treatment option exists for the prohibited treatments, the situation of individual patient 
should be discussed with medical monitor to decide further course of action.

7.7.3.1  BBI608  
No clinically apparent drug -drug interactions have been identified in patients administered  BBI608 , 
although a dedicated drug interaction study is currently ongoing  in healthy human volunteers .   
Napabucasin is primarily metabolized by the CYP P450 isoform 1A2.  Therefore, caution should be 
exercised with drugs that are strong inhibitors or sensitive substrates of CYP1A2.  
Examples of strong 1A2 inhibitors and sensitive inducers are presented below:  
• Strong CYP 1A2 inhibitors: fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, zafirlukast  
• Sensitive CYP1 A2 substrates: alosetron, caffeine, duloxetine, melatonin, ramelteon, tasimelteon, 
theophylline, tizanidine  
Possible actions for investigators with patients taking medications as above include: discontinuing the 
medication entirely, continuing the medicat ion and monitoring for adverse effects, and continuing the 
medication at a reduced dose and monitoring for adverse effects.    
7.7.3.2  BBI503  
No clinically apparent drug -drug interactions have been identified in patients administered BBI503, 
although no dedicated studies have specifically evaluated potential interactions.  
 BBI503 was shown to have minimal in vitro  inhibitory activity against the individual CYP P450 isoforms 
1A2, 2D6, 2C19, 3A4, and 2C9 with IC 50s of ≥10 M for each isoform . In vivo inhibitory activity against 
these isoforms is expected to be > 1000 M, given that the majority of BBI503 (> 99%) is expected to be 
bound to plasma protein.  
In addition, in in vitro studies, BBI503 was not metabolized by any of the CYP P450 isofor ms tested ( 1A2, 
2D6, 2C19, 3A4, and 2C9 ).   
7.7.3.3  Sorafenib  
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers  on sorafenib  
Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, administered at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 5 days in combination 
with a single oral dose of Sorafenib  400 mg in healthy volunteers resulted in a 37% decrease in the mean 
AUC of sorafenib [see US approval label,  Clinical Pharmacology  Section  (12.3)] . Concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, 
rifabutin, and St. John’s wort , see Section 7.7.2  as well ) is prohibited in this study during the dose -
escalation phase because these drugs can decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib.  
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors  on sorafenib  
Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein, administered at a dose of 400 mg once 
daily for 7 days did not alter the mean AUC of a single oral dose of Sorafenib  50 mg in healthy volunteers. 
However, for this protocol, use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is prohibited during the dose -escalation phase 
(see Section 7.7.2 ). 
Effect of sorafenib on Levels of Other Drugs  
sorafenib  400 mg twice daily for 28 days did not increase the systemic exposure of concomitantly 
administered midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), dex tromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), and omeprazole 
(CYP2C19 substrate) ( see sorafenib product label).

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 53 Neomycin  
Neomycin administered as an oral dose of 1 g three times daily for 5 days decreased the mean AUC of 
sorafenib by 54% in healthy volunteers that had also been administered a single oral dose of sorafenib  400 
mg. The effects of other antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied (see 
sorafenib product label).  
Drugs that Increase Gastric pH  
The aqueous solubility of sor afenib is pH -dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. However, 
omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, administered at a dose of 40 mg once daily for 5 days, did not result 
in a clinically meaningful change in sorafenib single dose exposure. N o dose adjustment for sorafenib  is 
necessary  when administered with drugs that increase gastric pH .

8.1 Adverse Events  
8.1.1 Assessments  
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have enrolled in the study.  All 
AEs that are considered to be related to study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) or that occur  after any 
administration of study drug will be followed u ntil the event resolves.  AEs will be evaluated using the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE, Version 4.0, published 28  May 2009.  
Investigators are required to document all AEs that occur  during the clinical trial, commencing with the 
first dose  of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  and including the protocol -defined post -treatment 
follow -up period (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] §312.64[b]) , on designated CRF pages.   AEs that 
occur after signing of the informed consent but prior to the first do se on study  will not be reported as AEs *.  
It is also important to record all AEs , whether serious or non -serious,  that result in permanent 
discontinuation of the investigational product being studied . 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), as defined below, must be reported to Boston Biomedical Inc. or its 
representative within 24 hours of knowledge of their occurrence.  
*Unless they occurred as the result of a screening test that would not have otherwise been performed as a 
part of standard of care.   
8.1.2 Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient who is 
administered a pharmaceutical product ; the medical occurrence  does not need to have  a causal relationship 
to the pharmaceutical product .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, regardless of whether  it is considered related to the medicinal product.  
Laboratory data  are to be collected as stipulated in this protocol and toxicity trends will be analyzed utilizing 
objective toxicity criteria.  Clinical syndromes rather than  laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded when  
appropriate (e.g., diabetes mellitus instead of  hyperglycemia).   
Progression of disease is considered an efficacy outcome parameter and should not be captured as an AE.  
A non -serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not meet any of the criteria for SAEs as 
defined below.  
Patients should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the investigator.  Investigators should 
assess the patient for AEs at each visit.  AEs occurring during the clinical trial and the follow -up period 
should be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF.  To capture the most potentially relevant safety information 
during a clinical trial, it is important that investigators  use accurate AE term inology  on CRFs.   
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and sy mptoms 
should be identified by the investigator and recorded on the CRF.  However, if an observed or reported sign 
or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the investigator, it should 
be recorded as a separate AE on the  CRF.  
Appropriate CTCAE term s for AEs should be used whenever possible.  If an appropriate CTCAE term is 
not available, then the verbatim term should be documented.

8.2.1 Definitions  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse experien ce occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization , except for events that are 
clearly disease related  
• A persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events may be considered an SAE based upon appropriate medical judgment of the 
investigator and medical monitor for the Sponsor .   
Under this protocol, scheduled hosp italizations or elective surgical procedures will not be considered SAEs.  
Prolongation of a scheduled hospitalization can be considered an SAE.  Complications associated with 
scheduled procedures are considered an AE.  
8.2.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, including death, that occurs during this investigation or in the 30 days following the last dose of 
study drug, regardless of assessed causality, must be reported to the Sponsor  immediately (not to exceed 
24 hours) by telephone, email, or facsimile.  The event must be completely described on the SAE report 
form provided by the Sponsor .  The SAE form should be sent to the Sponsor  by email and/or facsimile to 
the contact listed in Table 10 below:

The SAE should also be entered as an Adverse Event on the Adverse Event CRF, with the fact indicated 
that it was an SAE (checkbox provided on the CRF).  
Follow -up SAE reports are required when there is a significant development in the case.  Examples of 
significant developments include: updates from diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing, new information 
from specialist co nsultation, or a change in the clinical status of the patient (either improved or worsened).  
Follow -up reports for significant developments are required until the case is considered to be concluded (as 
indicated by resolution of the event such that it is no longer “serious” or as indicated by other means (i.e., 
patient discharge, patient death )).

Confidential    Page: 56 9 ASSESSMENT OF ANTI -TUMOR ACTIVITY  
Radiologic images obtained on study will be assessed according to both  RECIST 1.1 criteria and the criteria 
outlined in Modified RECIST  (mRECIST) Assessment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.  mRECIST for HCC  
was developed in 2010 by R. Lencioni and JM Llovet to address the poor correlation between conventional 
methods of response assessment  and the clinical benefit observed with the then -available treatment 
modalities for HCC.  The modified approach specifically takes into consideration the level of arterial 
enhancement within a HCC lesion when determining response.   
As BBI608 and BBI503 ta rget cancer stem cells, it is not clear whether clinical benefit will be correlated 
with the response assessment made using RECIST 1.1 criteria, or with that made using mRECIST for HCC 
criteria --or correlated with neither set of criteria.  As such, it is r ecommended that the patient be treated 
clinically and that decisions regarding continuation or discontinuation of protocol therapy be made mainly 
based on clinical assessment; radiologic imaging should inform, but not be the primary determinant of, the 
decision to continue or discontinue therapy.  
Both sets of guidelines are briefly summarized in this section.  For a complete overview, please refer to the 
original publications.  Patient imaging while on study will be categorized according to both RECIST 1.1  
criteria and mRECIST for HCC criteria, when possible.   
In order to be eligible for enrollment, patients must have measurable  disease per RECIST 1.1 definitions 
(outlined in Section 9.1.1 ).  For that lesion to then qualify as measurable according mRECIST, the lesions 
must also show intratumoral arterial enhancement on contrast -enhanced CT or MRI.   
Patients may enroll if they have at least measurable  disease per REC IST 1.1.  Please note, however, that 
since exploratory estimates of time to event endpoints such as TTP and PFS will be summarized using both 
methods, all patients should continue to be assessed on -study using both criteria (as progression according 
to mRE CIST can be documented even if there is no disease measurable per mRECIST at baseline).   
9.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)  
The definitions and criteria from Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST 1.1, Eisenhauer 
et al. 2009]1 are briefly summarized below.  These criteria should be used to categorize on -study images.   
9.1.1 Basic Definitions for RECIST 1.1  
Measurable disease  - the presence of at least one measurable lesion.  
Measurable lesions  - lesions that can be accuratel y measured in at least one dimension with longest 
diameter 10 mm using conventional techniques or 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Malignant lymph nodes 
must be 15 mm in the shortest diameter.  
Non-measurable lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm with 
conventional techniques, <10 mm with spiral CT scan or  lymph nodes  10 mm to <15 mm in short axis) . 
These small lesions can include bone lesions, ascites, pleural/pericardial effus ions, cystic lesions , and 
abdominal  masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques.  
• All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique should b e used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
• External l esions  identified on physical exam  will be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes)  and when they ar e ≥ 10 mm when 
measured using calipers .  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography 
and a measurement with a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 57 9.1.2 RECIST 1.1 Methods of Measurement  
• CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed 
with contiguous slices of 10 mm or less.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5-mm 
contiguous reconstruction algor ithm.  
• All imaging methods should be performed according to institutional standards , and  each 
patient should have a consistent method from baseline through the course of the study.  
9.1.3 RECIST 1.1 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions  
• All m easurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total with a maximum of 2 lesions 
per organ, representative of all involved organs , should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinical assessments).  
• A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions  (for lymph nodes, use short -axis) 
will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used 
as the reference from  which to characterize the objective tumor response.  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required but the 
presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
• Importantly, pre -study images should be assessed by either a member of the clinical 
investigativ e team at the study site or by a radiologist who is familiar with RECIST 
guidelines.  The image report is not sufficient for identification of lesions per RECIST.  
The images themselves should be assessed at baseline for measurable disease that can 
qualify  as target lesions.   
9.1.4 Response Criteria  and Classification for RECIST 1.1  
The criteria for response categorization of radiologic imaging assessments per RECIST are highlighted in 
Table 11 and Table 12 below.   
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 58 Table 11: RECIST 1.1 Categorization & Evaluation of Target Lesions  
RECIST Response Category  Description  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis 
of <10mm  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increa se in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started.  In addition to the increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.   The 
appearance of one or mor e new lesions is also considered 
progression  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started  
 
Table 12: RECIST 1.1 Categorization & Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
RECIST Response Category  Description  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological 
in size (<10mm short axis)  
Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of ex isting non -target lesions  
9.1.5 Evaluation of Overall Response  for RECIST 1.1  
The overall response at any time -point is determined from the assessment and categorization of target 
lesions, non -target -lesions, and new lesions as indicated in the Table 13 below:  
 
Table 13: RECIST 1.1 Overall Response

PR Non-PD or not all evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all evaluated  No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
The best overall response per RECIST 1.1 is determined from review of each overall response recorded 
from the start of the treatment until disease progression.

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 59 9.2 Modified RECIST Assessment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (mRECIST)  
The definitions and criteri a from mRECIST (R Lencioni, JM Llovet, 2010) are summarized below.  On -
study images should be categorized according to the definitions and descriptions outlined.   
9.2.1 Basic Definitions for mRECIST  
Only  intrahepatic  target lesions that are well -delineated and demonstrate arterial enhancement can be 
selected for mRECIST for HCC.  Poorly demarcated lesions or those that show atypical enhancement, 
possibly as a result of previous interventions, cannot be selected as target lesions  according to mRECIST .  
In order t o qualify as measurable according to  mRECIST for HCC, a target lesion  must meet the following 
criteria:  
• The lesion can be classified as a RECIST measurable lesion (i.e., the lesion can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension as 1 cm or more).  
•  The lesion is suitable for repeat measurement.  
•  The lesion shows intratumoral arterial enhancement on contrast -enhanced CT or MRI.  
When measuring the diameter of  viable tumor  for a potential target lesion according to mRECIST, the 
measurement should not inclu de major intervening areas of necrosis.  
If there are more than two lesions that meet mRECIST criteria for target lesions, then the two largest or 
best demarcated ones should be followed as target lesions, while the others can be considered non -target 
lesio ns. 
9.2.2 Image Acquisition for mRECIST  
In order to  maximize contrast between viable vascularized tumor tissue and non -enhancing necrotic tissue , 
mRECIST requires bi -phasic or tri -phasic imaging techniques.  This protocol specifies bi -phasic or tri -
phasic liver scan.   
In both bi -phasic and tri -phasic scans, the intra -venous contrast material administration should be timed so 
that high -quality arterial -phase imaging is obtained throughout the liver on the first run.  Subsequently, on 
the second run, high -quality portal venous -phase imaging should be obtained.  In tri -phasic scans, delayed 
imaging obtained in the equilibrium phase.   
9.2.3 Response Criteria and Classification  for mRECIST  
The response categorization of target and non -target lesion  observations according to mRECIST is 
summarized in Table 14 and Table 15 below.

RECIST Response Category  Description  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all

Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable 
(enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions  
Progressive Disease (PD):  An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters  of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the  smallest sum 
of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target  lesions recorded 
since treatment started  
Stable Disease (SD):  Any cases that do not qualify f or either partial response or 
progressive disease

Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions  
 
For further guidance and details on specific clinical scenarios, please consult Lencioni and Llovet, 2010.  
9.2.4 Evaluation of Overall Response  in mRECIST  
The determination of o verall response  at a given time -point for mRECIST is identical to the determination  
of the overall response at a given time -point in RECIST 1.1, and is highlighted again in Table 16 below.

CR Not evaluated  No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all evaluated  No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD

The best overall response is determined from all overall responses recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression .

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 61 9.3 Assessment of New Lesions  
As outlined in Table 13 and in Table 16, the appearance of a new lesion by either RECIST or mRECIST 
declares progression as the overall response at that imaging time -point regardless of the response assessed 
in target or non -target lesions.  Given the significant impact this has on determination of time -to-progression 
endpoints, care must be taken to ensure new l esions are recorded accurately.  
Determination of new lesions in HCC can often be complicated because of the   underlying diagnosis of 
cirrhosis in most patients.  As such, a newly appearing lesion must meet certain conditions in order to 
qualify as a “New  Lesion” for the purpose of response assessment.  These conditions for both RECIST 1.1 
and for mRECIST are outlined below in Section 9.3.1  and Section 9.3.2 .  
9.3.1 New Lesions in RECIST 1.1  
New lesions should be unequivocal and not attributable to differences in imaging modality or techniques. 
Findings from processes not directly r elated to tumor progression should also be excluded.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, or uncertain as to etiology, protocol treatment should continue until a 
subsequent radiologic image is obtained at least 4 weeks later. If repeat imaging confirms the origi nal 
diagnosis of new lesion, then the original scan date should be used for the radiologic diagnosis of 
progressive disease.  
9.3.2 New Lesions in mRECIST for HCC  
The approach to a potential new lesion when assessing response according to mRECIST for HCC is 
outlined below:  
• A newly detected hepatic nodule will be classified as HCC  if its longest diameter  is at least 1 cm 
and the nodule shows the typical vascular pattern of HCC on dynamic imaging .  
• Liver lesions larger than 1 cm that do not show a typical vascu lar pattern can be diagnosed as 
HCC if repeat radiologic imaging shows at least 1 -cm-interval growth.  
• If repeat imaging confirms the original diagnosis of new lesion, then the original scan date should 
be used for the radiologic diagnosis of progressive di sease.

Confidential    Page: 62 10 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 Analysis Populations  
The study populations for subsequent analyses below will be defined for phase Ib, phase II, and overall.   
Enrolled Patients:  A patient is considered enrolled upon receiving the first dose of 
sorafenib on Cycle 1, Day 1.  
Study Drug Safety Population:  Defined by all patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503).  
Pharmacokinetic Population:  Defined as those patients who have completed all pharmacokinetic 
assessmen ts.   
Dose -Escalation Population:  Patients are considered evaluable for the determination of dose -
escalation if they:  
a) Experience dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  
b) Complete 28 -days of combination dosing at the assigned 
dose-level  
Population Evaluable for 
Response:  The e valuable population is those patients who have received at 
least one cycle of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  and who 
have had at least one objective disease assessment following the 
initiation of therapy.  
Intent to Treat Population:  All randomized  patients, regardless of receiving a dose of 
sorafenib or study drug.  
10.2 Phase Ib Randomization   
Randomization is appropriate for this portion of the study as, once all inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
the study have been met, there are no absolute or relative medical contraindications specific to either 
BBI608 or BBI503.  The adverse event profiles for the agents are similar and there is no differe nce between 
the agents at this time with respect to the balance of relative clinical risk and potential clinical benefit of 
combination therapy with sorafenib.  Patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible 
for randomization.   
A central randomization will be performed whereby patients will be assigned to Arm 1 (BBI608 plus 
sorafenib) or Arm 2 (BBI503 plus sorafenib) using block randomization.  Each block will be considered a 
cohort with 3 subjects on Arm 1 and 3 subjects on Arm 2.   After the first cohort for an Arm is complete, 
the dose level for the next cohort will be determined by the dose escalation rules.  It is therefore possible 
that Arm 1 and Arm 2 will have different dose levels for a given cohort.   
Eligible patients will  be assigned to a study arm according to the first available patient slot on the 
randomization list (determined a -priori).  Slots on the randomization list will be available or unavailable 
based on the status of dose -escalation for a given study arm.

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 63 10.3 Phase II Randomization  
Approximately 90 patients (30/arm) were planned to be randomized in  a 1:1:1 ratio into three treatment 
arms: Arm 1 (sorafenib plus BBI608), Arm 2 (sorafenib plus BBI503), and Arm 3 (sorafenib alone) before 
Amendment 3 was in effect. After amendment 3 was in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portion was closed for 
enrollment  and r andomization is now conducted in a 1:1 ratio in the two remaining treatment  arms: Arm 1 
and Arm 3. The targeted sample size remain s 30 for Arm 1 and 30 for Arm 3. There were  approximately 
10 subjects already enrolled in Arm 2 by the time amendment 3 was in effect. Therefore, t he total actual 
sample size in Phase II in the end is projected to be approximately 70 patients  after amendment 3 .  
10.4 Primary and S econdary Study Objectives  
10.4.1  Primary Objectives  
Phase Ib:  
The primary objective  of the phase I b portion of this study is  to determine  the safety and tolerability of each 
study drug in combination with sorafenib in order to define a recommended phase II dose f or BBI608 plus 
sorafenib as well as for BBI503 plus sorafenib.  Safety analysis is defined further in Section 10.5.     
Phase II:  
The primary objective of the phase  II portion of this study is t o evaluate the tolerability, safety. and 
preliminary anti -tumor activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma randomized to receive 
treatment with sorafenib in combination with BBI608, sorafenib in combination wi th BBI503 *, or sorafenib 
alone , with BBI608 and BBI503 administered at their respective RP2D dose levels for combination 
administration with sorafenib which were determined during phase Ib .   
*Once the amendment 3 is in effect, Arm 2 in the Phase II portio n will be closed for enrollment . 
10.4.2  Secondary Objectives  
Other key study objectives include the evaluation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (when 
biopsy is possible), and the evaluation of preliminary anti -tumor activity of each agent in combination with 
sorafenib.  The activity of sorafenib alone will a lso be evaluated in this study.     
Preliminary anti -tumor activity will be explored using different efficacy parameters.  Efficacy parameters 
which  involve disease progression as an endpoint will be generated twice: once using disease progression 
as defin ed by RECIST 1.1, and again using disease progression defined by mRECIST for HCC.  This is 
because the two response evaluation criteria are different, and will produce different results for a given 
efficacy parameter.  The data accumulated on this trial wi ll help to determine whether the use of one 
approach over the other may be preferred in future trials of either BBI608 or BBI503 in hepatocellular 
carcinoma.   
Proportional efficacy parameters will be defined for both phase Ib, phase II, and combined accor ding to 
study arm.  The following parameters will be calculated for all  randomized patients and  for patients 
evaluable for response: Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with best response 
of complete response (CR), Partial Res ponse (PR), or stable disease (SD) ; and O bjective response rate 
(ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) .  As above, DCR and ORR will be defined according to RECIST 1.1 and, in a separat e analysis, 
according to mRECIST for HCC.     
The following time -to-event parameters will also be evaluated: time -to-progression (TTP), defined as the 
time from initiation of therapy until disease progression; and progression free survival (PFS)  defined as  
time from the initiation of therapy until disease progression or death from any cause .  Also,  as above, disease 
progression in both PFS and TTP will be defined according to both RECIST 1.1 and, in a separate analysis, 
Boston Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 64 according to mRECIST for HCC criteria .  Estimates for PFS and TTP will be generated using  Kaplan -
Meier curves.     
Since  BBI608 and BBI503 both affect cancer stem cells, Disease -Specific Survival (DSS) and o verall 
survival (OS)  will also be evaluated.  DSS is defined as the time from initiat ion of therapy until death from 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  Overall survival is  defined as time from initiation of therapy until death from 
any cause.  Estimates of DSS and OS for each cohort will be displayed using Kaplan -Meier curves.   
Other evidence for  anti-tumor activity will be evaluated on an exploratory basis and will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics or graphics.  These may include but are not limited to: a summary of tumor 
marker values over time , a description of the duration of response  or duration of disease control, and 
summaries of the  proportion  with PFS, TTP, DSS, and OS,  at 3, 4, 6, and /or 12 months.    
The potential effects of baseline demographic,  clinical, and biologic factors on study outcomes will also be 
explored.  Examples in clude evaluating the effect of baseline performance status, comorbidities, estimated 
portal pressure, or plasma IGF -1 levels on measures of clinical activity such as time to progression or 
progression free survival.   
10.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Phase Ib:   
The sample size for this study was determined by clinical rather than statistical considerations.  With cohort 
sizes of three to six patients  during phase Ib , if the true underlying rates of DLT at a given dose -level are 
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, ther e will be 91%, 71%, 49%, 31%, and 17% chances, respectively, of escalating 
to the next full dose.  
Phase II:  
There are no statistical hypothesis testing and the sample size is considered to be clinically adequate to 
assess tolerability, safety, and prelimin ary anti -cancer activity of study drug of interest .  Estimation and 
95% confidence intervals will be provided for the proportion of patients with grade 3 adverse events by 
treatment, as well as for the proportion of patients that are alive and progression free 4 months (PFS -4) after 
randomization for each arm.  Other anti -cancer activity parameters will also be estimated  
10.6 Safety Analysis  
Safety and adverse events will be summarized for all enrolled patients in the phase Ib portion, phase II 
portion, and for t he study overall.  In addition, a ll patients receiving at least one dose of study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503)  will be considered in the study drug safety population .  Safety and adverse events will 
be summarized for the study drug safety population of p hase Ib, phase II, and overall.   
During the phase Ib portion of the study, adverse events will be summarized by dose -level and overall by 
arm.  The numbers of patients enrolled, number with DLT, and number evaluable for determination of dose -
escalation at  each dose -level by arm will be reported.  In addition to the evaluation and categorization of 
adverse events, listings of laboratory test results collected at baseline and during the study will be generated.  
Descriptive statistics summarizing the changes  in those laboratory tests over time will be presented.  
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0.  The incidence of adverse events 
will be evaluated for each cohort .  Patients will be followed for adverse events for at least 30  days after the 
last dose of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) , or until they have recovered from all related study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503)  adverse events.  
Safety and adverse events will be reported by study arm for the intent to treat populatio n and for all enrolled 
patients during the phase II portion of the study.

subject will be enrolled into the study when the subject re ceives the  first dose of protocol therapy .  
Registration and enrollment forms a s well as  faxing/emailing instructions will be provided.  The site is 
required to maintain a log of all subjects who sign consent, and the log must indicate whether the subject 
was enrolled (received a dose of protocol therapy ).  The reason for disqualification should be noted in the 
log. 
11.3 Removal, Replacement, or Early Withdrawals of Subjects  
If a subject exits the study prior to receiving four weeks of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) for 
reasons other than a DLT, and is not evaluable for dose -escalation then another subject may be enrolled to 
replace the patient in order to fully evaluate safety and tolerability of a given dose -level.  
If a subject exists the study after rec eiving four weeks of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503), but before 
receiving an on -study objective disease assessment (and is therefore not evaluable for response), then that 
subject may be replaced.

Confidential    Page: 67 12 GCP COMPLIANCE AND E THICAL CONSIDERATION S 
12.1 Instituti onal Review Board  
  The protocol, any protocol modifications, the informed consent form that will be used, and, if applicable, 
the permission to use private health information , must be approved by the Investigator’s IRB or Independent 
Ethics committee (IEC) (compliant with federal regulations 21 CFR 56) before the study is initiated.  
Documentation of this approval (i.e., a copy of the document showing IRB/IEC approval including  the 
chairperson’s signature and the date of approval) must be provided to B BI or its designee and made 
available during an inspection by loco-regional regulatory  agency inspectors.  The Investigator will submit 
to BBI: 
- A list of the names, occupations, and affiliations of the members of the IRB  
- Documentation that the IRB is duly constituted or a General Assurance Number  
No patients may be enrolled until the IRB has given written approval of the protocol and informed consent 
and B BI has received copies of  the approvals . 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to:  
- Submit to the IRB/IEC for review any advertisements that will be used to recruit subjects  
- Submit progress reports to the IRB (if required ) and request study review during the co urse of 
the st udy 
- Report, in writing, to the IRB all SAEs that occurred during the study or SAEs reported in other 
studies using study drug, per local IRB regulations  
- Inform the IRB of any changes in the protocol and obtain documented IRB approval of the 
changes  
- Maintain a file of study -related information, including all correspondence with the IRB/IEC  
 
- Provide the IRB with a final report on the study  within 3  months of study completion  
12.2 Compliance with Good Clinical Practice and Ethical Considerations  
This study must be conducted in compliance with IRB/IEC informed consent regulation and the ICH GCP 
Guidelines.  In addition, all local regulatory requirements will be adhered to, in particular those which 
afford greater protection to the safety of the trial particip ants. 
This study will be conducted according to the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki (Revised 
Edinburgh, Scotland, 2000) and with local laws and regulations relevant to the use of new therapeutic 
agents in the country of conduct.  
Before initiating a trial, the Investigator/institution should have a written and dated approval/favorable 
opinion from the IRB/IEC for the trial protocol/amendment(s), a written informed consent form, patient 
recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements) and written information to be provided to patients.  
Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion prior to implementation, 
except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients.  
 
12.3 Informed C onsent and Permission to Use Private Health Information  
The Investigator, or designee, is responsible for the content of the informed consent form, but the content 
must be submitted and approved by B BI prior to submission to the IRB.  Before the start of r equired study 
procedures, the Principal Investigator or associate must obtain informed consent from each study participant

document “Guidance for Indu stry – E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance” dated April 1996.  
The informed consent form should also include any additional information required by local laws relating 
to institutional review.  
Informed consent must be obtained from the subject  before any screening activity, washout of medication, 
or treatment (that is not part of routine care) is undertaken.  Informed consent will be obtained by discussing 
with the subject the purpose of the study, the risks and benefits, the study procedures, options other than 
study participation, and any other information relevant to the subjects.  
The subject or his/her legal representative will document their informed consent by signing the current 
version of the written, IRB -approved, informed consent form in the presence of a witness.  
The person who conducted the informed consent discussion with the subject and/or guardian must also sign 
the informed consent form.  The subject should be given a copy of the informed consent form with all of 
the appropriate s ignatures.  
The Principal Investigator  will ensure that a copy of the signed consent is kept with the Clinical Trial Master 
File. 
Before enrolling a subject into the study, t he Investigator or designee must explain to the patient subject 
that for evaluation  of study results, th e subject’s private health information obtained during the study may 
be shared with the study Sponsor, regulatory agencies, and ECs/IRBs . It is the Investigator’s (or designee’s) 
responsibility to obtain permission to use private healt h information per HIPAA from each subject, or if 
appropriate, the subject’s parent or legal guardian.

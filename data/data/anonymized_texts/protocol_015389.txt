Title Characterizing and Predicting Drug Effects on Cognition  
 
Short Title  Drug Effects on Cognition  
Protocol Number   
Phase  R01 
Methodology  Parallel group, r andomized, double -blind, cross -over design with 
placebo  
Study Duration  Five (5) years  
Study Center(s)  Single -center  
Objectives  Our primary objective is to eluci date the relationship among drug  
exposure as measured by plasma drug levels, its 
neurophysiological effects measured by EEG, and consequent effects on the cog nitive processes observable in everyday 
language use. Using topiramate (TPM) as a prototype, we apply 
the tools of clinical pharmacology, computational linguistics, neuroscience, and engineering to the design and execution of  
parallel group, randomized, double blind,  crossover studies using 
three (3) single, low doses of TPM  and a placebo. In order to 
isolate the cognitive effects of TPM from those possibly arising from an underlying medical condition, subjects will be healthy adults. We will capitalize on an innovative system for automated language and speech analysis (SALSA) developed in our laboratory, to quantify the effects of TPM administration on effective language use, a crucial component of normal day -to-day 
functioning.  
Number of Subjects  Three parallel groups of 24 (12 men; 12 women; total n=72; 
enrollment target = 84 to account for dropouts),  
Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria  Healthy volunteers native English- speaking (necessary for 
language analysis), ages 18- 50

Methodology  Neuropsychological and speech data will be analyzed on both the 
group and individual level.  For each individual neuropsychological 
and speech measure, the two baseline scores will be averaged to correct for any practice effects associated with repeated testing across the entire study. This average is then used in a change score, for each measure for each participant, associated with drug conditions, computed as (drug session score - average baseline 
score)/average baseline score.  Neuropsychological and speech change scores will each be summarized by drug group at each collection time (0. 5, 2.5, 6  and either 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours post 
dose) with means and standard deviations. Change scores at 2.5 hours post dose are our primary outcome; change scores at 0. 5 
and 6 hours post dose will be used in exploratory analyses.  Change scores will each be independently taken as the outcome in a repeated measures ANOVA with drug group (TPM, LZP, PLA) as the primary factor of interest. The Tukey -Kramer procedure will 
be used to adjust type I error rates for the multiple comparisons among the three drug groups. All ANOVAs will be adjusted for treatment order and session number, and include a random effect for participant to control for within- person correlation across the 
three sessions. Separate ANOVAs will examine the three TPM dose groups compared to each other. As exploratory work, we will also examine whether age or gender modify any of the drug effects.  
 Each TPM dose will be used in a three- way crossover 
study with 24 participants. Detectable differences are based on pilot data estimates of within- person and between- person 
variability in each of the outcomes shown; in general, within-person correlation was weak, well below 0.5. Our budget allows  
for recruiting 4 extra participants per dose study in case of dropout.  
 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic analyses : Separately for the 
three TPM doses and for LZP, neuropsychological and speech data change scores will each be used as the outcome in a linear  
regression with the three pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, trough, maximum) as the primary predictors of interest. If AUC, trough, and maximum are highly collinear, we will consider them one at a time. With 24 participants per drug/dose combination, and t wo-sided p=0.05, we will have power 75% to detect a 
correlation of size ≥0.5, 90% power to detect a correlation of size ≥0.6, and 98% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.7. All regressions will be adjusted for session number, age, and gender. We will also compare the R -square from the model with AUC as predictor to 
the R-square from the model with dose as predictor. Population 
pharmacokinetic modeling will be used to calculate individual 
measures of exposures.

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
accordi ng to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 or 812 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Cognit ive impairment is a widely reported side effect of many commonly used drugs. 
Even a mild, untoward effect on an essential function such as linguistic behavior, a directly observable product of complex cognitive processes, is disruptive to daily life.  Neve rtheless, the mechanisms underlying a drug’s impact on cognition are poorly 
understood.  This lack of understanding impedes our ability to predict both the effects of drugs in development and the degree to which an individual is vulnerable to the cognitive  impact of a particular agent.  Topiramate (TPM), a second- generation 
antiepilepsy drug (AED) is, with increasing frequency, being prescribed for a range of conditions including migraine prophylaxis, obesity, and pain.  Moreover, it is a prime example of a  drug that causes speech and language problems  severe enough in some 
patients to result in discontinuation of therapy.  However, unlike many newer AEDs, and for reasons not well understood, TPM has a poorer cognitive profile than many of the older AEDs.   While the number and magnitude of adverse cognitive side effects have been attributed, in part, to the effects of titration rate and maintenance dose in both patients and healthy adults, these factors do not capture all inter -individual variability in 
the cognitive response to TPM.  Our rationale  for this project is that our investigations 
will offer insight into the mechanisms underlying drug- induced cognitive deficits.  It will 
also lay the foundation for a new line of research that will further delineate these 
mechanisms and provide methods to predict individual patient response.  In this study 
we compare the cognitive effects of TPM to that of the benzodiazepine, lorazepam , as 
well as to a non- active placebo.  A majority of the preliminary data for this s tudy were 
collected under UMN IRB Study # 0805M33321 and published in a peer reviewed 
journal (Marino et al, 2012).

A 2mg dose of lorazepam was chosen since that is the most common dose that has 
been used in studies of the cognitive/memory effects of this drug in healthy volunteers [9, 10].  The doses of 100mg, 150mg and 200 mg of topiramate chosen for this study  
are much lower than those used in the classical studies of the cognitive effects of this agent on cognition and language.  In their EEG study, Salinsky et al ( 2007) titrated  
healthy volunteers to a maximum dose of 400mg/day whereas Werz et al (2006)  used a 
dose of 300 mg/day of topiramate in their study comparing the cognitive effects of TPM to lamotrigine in healthy volunteers.  Since there is evidence that the titration rate of TPM is proportional to the cognitive complaints attributable to TPM use (Meador et al, 2001),  we expect that even the relatively low doses used here will produce an effect 
since the subjects are receiving the entire dose  all at once.  
2  Study Objectives  
Primary Objective:  Our primary objective is to elucidate the relationship among drug 
exposure as measured by plasma drug levels, its neurophysiological effects measured by EEG, an d consequent effects on the cognitive processes observable in everyday 
language use. We have three (3) Specific Aims:  
Specific Aim #1: Characterize TPM -induced effects on linguistic behavior. Our 
working hypothesis  is that TPM has distinct, measureable eff ects on the fluency and 
content of spontaneous speech. We will test this hypothesis by measuring speech and language characteristics with SALSA from speech audio- recorded during a 
neuropsychological assessment that includes tests of verbal, memory and exec utive 
functions.  
Specific Aim # 2: Determine the neurophysiological mechanisms of TPM’s action 
on executive function. Our working hypothesis is that TPM -induced effects on 
language use are partly attributable to disrupted frontal executive function. We wil l test 
this hypothesis by recording EEG during a verbal working memory task. We predict 
altered frontal lobe activity and frontotemporal interactions, manifesting as changes  in 
event -related potentials (ERP) and EEG coherence.  
Specific Aim #3: Predict individual vulnerability to TPM -induced impairments in 
linguistic, memory, and executive functions. Our working hypotheses are 1. The 
extent of drug- induced  impairments in these functions is proportional to systemic drug 
exposure, as measured by plasma drug levels.  The area under the time- concentration 
curve (AUC), trough, and maximum drug concentration will be explored. 2. Drug 
exposure is a better predictor than dose of the degree of individual impairment.  
.   
3 Study Design 
3.1 General Design 
This study uses  a parallel group, double- blind, randomized, crossover design to test  
neurocognitive functioning including natural language comprehension and production  in 
people exposed to TPM and LZP. Healthy volunteers will be exposed to one of three (100mg, 150mg or 200mg)  single low doses of TPM. Healthy volunteers rather than

effects of the underlying disorder. In order to explore the differentially sensitivity  to the 
cognitive effects of drugs from different classes, we chose LZP  as an active comparator 
since unlike TPM, it is a benzodiazepine and produces its cognitive effects via a mild 
generalized sedation versus the more focal frontal lobe dysfunction of TPM. Moreover, LZP is not associated word- finding or fluency difficulties.  
 Each crossover study (using one dose of TPM) will consist of five (5) sessions with at least a two- week washout period in between sessions.  Sessions 2, 3, and 4 will each be 
followed up by a visit at approx imately 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours post drug administration.  
First and last sessions are baseline sessions with no drug administered and no blood 
sample drawn  during session 1. During both sessions 1 & 5, subjects will be 
administered a single brief neuropsychological assessment (see details below) (approximately 1 hour). However, during session 1, subjects will also be required to perform a verbal memory task while having their EEG recorded (approximately 2 hours).  
 For the treatment sessions (sessions 2, 3, and 4), the sequence in which TPM, LZP, and PLA will be assigned to the three middle sessions will be determined according to a Latin square design balanced for first -order carry -over effects (6 possible sequences). A 
neuropsychological battery consisting of tests of verbal working memory capacity including the reading span test  (Session 1 only)  (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; 
sentence comprehension), tests of executive behaviors drawn from the NIH Common Data Elements for Epilepsy (www.commondataelements.ninds. nih.gov/Epilepsy.aspx), 
two discourse -level language/verbal tests and one discourse- level memory test 
(described in the next section) , as well as an assessment of postural sway ( AgiliSway  
System, Agile Medicine, Minneapolis MN:  www.agilemedicine/agilisway.com
) will be 
administered 0. 5, 2.5, 6 and either 24, 48, 72  or 96 hours after dosing for each of the 
three treatments, as well as once during each of the two baseline sessions (sessions 1 & 5).   Alt ernate versions of each test will used during each session to reduce practice 
effects.  Each testing battery is expected to take approximately 45- 60 minutes to 
complete.  A portion of t he test battery will be audio- recorded for speech analysis using 
SALSA.  A single, trained examiner will administer all tests for one subject.   Blood 
samples will be collected for pharmacoki netic -pharmacodynamics analysis.  
 Pharmacoki netic (PK) -pharmacodynamics(PD) analysis:  Blood samples will be 
collected from all participants at all  3 treatment sessions   in the three parallel three-way 
crossover studies (one for each TPM dose: 100, 150, and 200 mg). Blood sam ples will 
be collected immediately prior to drug administration (time 0),  5 additional times after 
dose and at 1 time in the post -absorption phase (at  either  approximately 24, 48,  72, or 
96 hours - randomly assigned).  Preliminary results that include intensive PK sampling 
in healthy volunteers during the whole dosing interval enables the use of sparse sampling in order  to limit the burden of additional sampling on subjects.  The time of 
drug administration and the time of each blood draw will be recorded.  Samples will be immediately centrifuged and the plasma frozen until analysis.  TPM plasma levels will be measured by a simultaneous LCMS assay, developed by Subramanian, Birnbaum

laboratory.  
 
In one session only, an d with separate subject consent , a sample will be drawn from 
part of the  collected blood samples for subsequent genetic testing with the primary  
hypothesi s, related to  Specific Aim 3,  that inter -individual differences in plasma drug 
concentrations may be due to polymorphisms in metabolic genes . 
 
EEG:  EEG recording will immediately follow the completion of the  neuropsychological 
testing battery  in session 1 and after the battery  administered approximately 2.5 hours 
after drug dose  in sessions 2, 3, and 4. EEG recording will be conducted in an 
acoustically and electrically shielded chamber in the UMN Center for Neurobehavioral  
Development.   Subjects will be seated in a comfortable non- metal chair in the chamber 
and instructed to     attend to a CRT monitor during recording.  EEG will be recorded using a 128- channel Sensor Net System. EEG will be recorded during the presentation 
of the working memory paradigm.      
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
Our primary end point  is a composite measure of disfluency comprised of the following 
measurements:  
a. spoken discourse fluency  
i. speaker normalized duration and frequency of silent and filled pauses  
ii. speaker normalized frequency of repetitions  
iii. speaker normalized frequency of false starts  
iv. speaker normalized speaking rate (syllables per second)  
 Our secondary end points will consist of the following characteristics: 
 
For spoken samples, we will examine the following measures of linguistic fluency:  
 Average fundamental frequency fluctuations/variability

contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory.  Any damaged or unusable study drug in a given shipment (active drug or comparator) will be documented in the study files.  
5.8.2  Storage 
Both TPM and LZP  will be stored in the University of Minnesota Investigational 
Pharmacy according to the stated FDA requirements.  
5.8.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
         Only one dose  per subject per test session will be dispensed.  
5.8.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug 
 At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated,  resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused 
study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
6 Study Procedures  
6.1 Session  1 (Baseline)  
After being consented for the study, a brief demographic, medical and medication history will be taken during the first session to assure that subjects are not currently on 
any drugs that can interact with either TPM or LZP  or potentially interfere with cognitive

below) (Week 1- baseline) after which they will perform a working memory task while 
having their EEG recorded, and be randomly assigned to a study treatment  sequence 
(TPM or L ZP).   
6.2 Session  2 
The first drug testing session will be conducted approximately 14 days after the baseline 
testing. At that time, an in travenous catheter  will be inserted  (left arm) after which he or 
she will be given either one of three doses of TPM (depending on whether they have 
been assigned to thee 100mg, 150mg or 200mg group),OR  2mg LZP  OR  placebo. Six 
blood samples will be drawn between 0 – 6 hours  after dose.  Vitals signs will also be 
recorded .  One (1)  additional sample (using a single needle stick)  will be drawn either at 
(approximately ) 24, 48, 72, or  96 hours postdose(randomly assigned) to capture a 
sampling in the post -absorption phase as well as limiting the burden of additional 
sampling on subjects. Neurocognitive and postural sway  assessments will be collected 
at times  approximately  0.5, 2.5, 6 an d either 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours after treatment 
administration. Alternate test forms will be used for each time point.  After the 2.5 hr blood draw and assessment are complete, the subject will be fitted with electrodes for the EEG portion of the study, af ter which he or she will return to the CTSI for  the 
remaining blood samples and another  neuropsychological test administration. A 
separate visit is required for collection of the post -absorption blood sample and testing. 
 
6.3 Session  3 
Participants will re turn approximately two (2)  week s later in order to repeat the testing 
protocol after switching drugs.  
 
6.4  Session  4 
The fourth session will occur approximately two (2) weeks  after the second drug 
administration for the third drug (or placebo) treatment.   
 6.5   Session  5 (Post baseline)  
The last session  will occur approximately two (2) weeks  after the third drug or placebo 
administration. Participants will not be given any drug at this session . One blood sample 
will be drawn to determine if any drug from  the previous session is still present. The 
entire test battery will be administered. The baseline and postbaseline scores will be 
averaged in order to correct for any practice effects that might have occurred across the 
four testing sessions.  This average will be used to compute the change score of each test administered under drug conditions.  Oral samples in all tests will be audiotaped.
 
  Neuropsychological Battery 
 
We will employ a battery of neuropsychological tests that includes measures from our cognitive Anti -Epileptic Drug (AED) protocol as well as additional language-specific 
measures:  
Verbal Working Memory :  
  Page 12 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the s tudy sponsor  1. Reading Span: Subjects read aloud a set of unrelated sentences, and then at the end 
of the set they recall the last word of each sentence in the set (see Daneman & 
Carpenter, 1980, 1983). As in the speaking span test, subjects are presented with increasingly longer sets until all sentences have been presented. Reading span is the total number of correct sentence- final words recalled.  This test will only be administ ered 
during the first baseline session (session 1).  
 
Executive function, processing speed, and word- level language/verbal tests : 
 1. Phonemic generative verbal fluency will be evaluated using the COWA test. COWA 
requires the subject to generate words other than proper names or numbers beginning with a specific letter of the alphabet; three 60- second trials are obtained, using three 
different letters, usually F -A-S or B -H-R.  
2. Semantic generative verbal fluency will be evaluated using the Animal Fluency test. Subjects are asked to generate as many different animal exemplars as they can within 60 seconds. The primary dependent measure for both phonemic and semantic generative fluency is the number of correct words meeting scoring criteria normalized to individual (averaged) baseline.  
3. Trails A and B will be used to assess visual search, mental flexibility, and task alternation. The subject is required to draw lines between circles in ascending order (“connect the dots”). Trail Making Part A requires the patient to connect the numbers from 1 -25. Trail Making B requires subjects to alternate between numbered and lettered 
circles in ascending numerical/alphabetical order (e.g., 1-A-2- B, etc.) The primary 
dependent measure is time of c ompletion.  
4. Digit span subtest from the WAIS -IV will be used to assess immediate attention. It 
tests forward and backward digit span, includes a sequencing trial in which the subject is the repeat back the digits in ascending order.  
 5. Symbol Digit Modalities Test will be used to generate the Processing Speed Index 
(primary dependent measure). These are timed tasks that measure the ability to rapidly transcribe symbols that are paired with numbers (Coding).  
 
Computerized psycholinguistic assessment. Spontaneous speech will be elicited using 
two discourse level verbal tasks:  
1. In the picture description task, the subjects will be asked to describe a simple 
picture (e.g., The “Cookie Theft” stimulus from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Goodglass & Kaplan 1983).  
2.  Memory will be tested using a third discourse level task, the MCG Story Recall 
task, where subjects will recall a short but detailed description of a situation verbally presented to them (Meador et al 1993; Meador et al 1995).  
3. Spontaneous  narrative.  Subject will be asked to speak on one of four (4) themes 
(adapted from the Trier Test) for two minutes.   
 
Working Memory Paradigm:  A modified Sternberg working memory task (Sternberg, 
1969) will be presented to each subject during EEG recording to test the effect of TPM on verbal and executive brain functions.   A set of English (nonsense) syllables of comparable length will be presented on a CRT monitor for 1.5  seconds, followed by a 
5s retention period, followed by the probe syllable.  S ubjects will be instructed to press a 
“Yes” or “No” button to indicate whether or not the probe stimulus belonged to the 
  Page 13

paradigm consists of six blocks of 60 trials/block ( 360 trials in total). Presentation of the 
syllables and the memory loads will be randomized (12 0 trials/memory load).  A practice 
block  of 60 trials  will be presented prior to testing and a one- minute break will be 
provided between each block to reduce fatigue effects.  The main advantage of this 
paradigm over the classical Sternberg task, where the items are presented sequentially rather than all at once, as was done in our preliminary studies, is that the periods of encoding, retention, and recall are all well separated in time to permit the study of both the temporal and spatial development of neural activity during the different stages of the working memory process.    
 
Postural Sway Assessment:   Postural sway: Sway will be measured by the AgiliSway 
System (Agile Medicine, Minneapolis MN:  www.agilemedicine/agilisway.com ) 
The dependent measures are total distance, medial/lateral distance, and anterior/posterior distance swayed.  
 A patient’s center of pressure is measured using a force platform, in this case a modified Wii balance board, that records the pressure on each of four sensors once every 100 milliseconds. Prior to recording the patient data, 10 seconds of calibration data are recorded. After obtaining these readings, subjects are asked to stand on the board for 10 sec in each of three positions:  with 1. feet together, 2. one foot raised and 3. in a tandem position, while several different measures of sway are calculated, including total dis tance, medial/lateral distance, and anterior/posterior distance swayed 
(all in centimeters). With additional computation, other measures such as average/maximum velocity of sway can also be calculated.  
The calculations for measuring distance swayed are:  
      P(tl) = Pressure top left (TopLeft - CalAvgTopLeft)  
      P(tr) = Pressure top right (TopRight - CalAvgTopRight)  
      P(bl) = Pressure bottom left (BottomLeft - CalAvgBottomLeft)  
      P(br) = Pressure bottom right (BottomRight - CalAvgBottomRight)  
      
      Total (T) = P(tl) + P(tr) + P(bl)  + P(br)  
 
 
 
7 Statistical Plan 
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Each TPM dose will be used in a three- way crossover study with 24 participants. Table 
1 below shows the magnitude of group differences that will be detectabl e for 24 
participants with 90% power, two- sided alpha =0.05, using Tukey -Kramer adjustment for 
multiple comparisons among the three drug groups. Detectable differences are based 
on pilot data (collected as part of IRB study # 0805M33321) estimates of withi n-person 
and between- person variability in each of the outcomes shown; in general, within-
person correlation was weak, well below 0.5. Our budget allows for recruiting 4 extra 
participants per dose study in case of dropout.

7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Statistical Analysis  
Aim 1 Statistical considerations: Neuropsychological and speech data will be 
analyzed on both the group and individual level.  For each individual neuropsychological and speech measure, the two baseline scores will be averaged to correct for any practice effects associated with repeated testing across the entire study. This average is then used in a change score, for each measure for each participant, associated with drug conditions, computed as (drug sessio n score - average baseline score)/average 
baseline score.  Neuropsychological and speech change scores will each be summarized by drug group at each collection time (0. 5, 2.5, and 6 hours post dose) with 
means and standard deviations. Change scores at 2.5 hours post dose are our primary outcome; change scores at 0. 5 and 6 hours post dose will be used in exploratory 
analyses.  Change scores will each be independently taken as the outcome in a repeated measures ANOVA with drug group (TPM, LZP, PLA) as the pri mary factor of 
interest. The Tukey -Kramer procedure will be used to adjust type I error rates for the 
multiple comparisons among the three drug groups. All ANOVAs will be adjusted for treatment order and session number, and include a random effect for participant to control for within- person correlation across the three sessions. Separate ANOVAs will 
examine the three TPM dose groups compared to each other. As exploratory work, we will also examine whether age or gender modify any of the drug effects.  
 
Aim 2 (EEG) Statistical considerations: Behavioral data (error rate) and 
electrophysiological summary data will be analyzed in a repeated measures ANOVA 
with a 3x5 factorial for memory load (1, 3, 5 syllables ) by drug (TPM, LZP, PLA, two 
baselines). The Tukey -Kramer procedure will be used to adjust type I error rates for the 
multiple comparisons among the drug groups at specific memory loads, and across memory loads. ANOVAs will adjust for treatment order and session number, and include a random effect for participant to control for within- person correlation across the three 
sessions. Electrophysiological measures (amplitudes, peak latency, will be analyzed separately with repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance (RM -MANOVA; 
  Page 15 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the s tudy sponsor  maximum -likelihood analogs  may be used if missing data are non- trivial) with factors 
and adjusting variables as above. Correlations between ERP difference (e.g., TPM vs 
PLA) and drug concentration (collected as part of Aim 3, below) will be computed. With 24 participants per drug/dose combination, and two- sided α=0.05, we will have power 
75% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.5, 90% power to detect a correlation of size ≥0.6, and 98% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.7.   
 
Aim 3 (Pk/PD) Statistical considerations: For PK analyses, variables are added and a 
model chosen using a forward selection process (cutoff of p<.005), followed by a 
backward elimination process (cutoff of p<.001) to avoid type I errors due to multiple statistical tests. The estimation step of a Nonlinear Mixed Ef fects Model (NONMEM) will 
be implemented using first order conditional estimation with an interaction term. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) Bayesian post -hoc estimates of each individual’s PK 
parameter will be used to derive measures of drug exposure (e.g., AUC, steady -state 
concentrations) using standard PK equations. PD modeling will investigate if a relationship exists between outcomes of interest contained in the neuropsychological battery.  
Separately for the three TPM doses and for LZP, neuropsychological and speech data change scores will each be used as the outcome in a linear regression with the three pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, trough, maximum) as the primary predictors of interest. If AUC, trough, and maximum are highly collinear, we will consider them one at a time. With 24 participants per drug/dose combination, and two- sided p=0.05, we will 
have power 75% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.5, 90% power to detect a correlation of size ≥0.6, and 98% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.7. All regress ions will be 
adjusted for session number, age, and gender. We will also compare the R -square from 
the model with AUC as predictor to the R -square from the model with dose as predictor. 
Population pharmacokinetic modeling will be used to calculate individual measures of exposures (i.e., AUC, trough, and maximum drug concentration) to be used in the analyses above.  
 
 
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
• We will be using a protocol -compliant population consisting of healthy volunteers, 
18-50 years of age.  
 
Safe ty and Adverse Events 
7.4 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops 
or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or 
  Page 16 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the s tudy sponsor  injuries should be regarded as adverse events.   Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to fur ther diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse 
event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment  of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typically be considered serious.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious adverse events.  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined 
as 30 days following the last administration of study treatment.   
Preexisting Condition A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that m eet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct 
  Page 17 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the s tudy sponsor  each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any 
one of the following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to 
confirm  the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization 
should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for the study.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it  is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital 
admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.  
7.5 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnos tic procedures results should recorded in the 
source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has 
  Page 18 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the s tudy sponsor  been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious 
adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
7.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
7.6.1  Study Sponsor Notification by Investigator 
A ser ious adverse event must be reported to the study sponsor by telephone 
within 24 hours of the event.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form must be completed by the investigator and faxed to the study sponsor within 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy  of this SAE form on file at the study site.  
Report serious adverse events by phone and facsimile to:  
 Susan E Marino PhD              612- 501-8626 (cell)      612 -626-0148 (fax ) 
John Rarick          612 -626-2170 (phone)  
Ilo Leppik MD                          612 -625-7139 (phone)  
 At the time of the initial report, the following information should be provided:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• Current status  • Whether study treatment was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the 
association between the event 
and study treatment  
 
Within the following 48 hours, the investigator must provide further information on the serious adverse event in the form of a written narrative.  This should include a copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event form, and any other diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of the event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to 
the study sponsor  
7.6.2  IRB Notification by Investigator 
Reports of all serious adverse events (including follow -up information) must be 
submitted to the IRB within 10 working days if it falls under the UPIRTSO guidelines.  Copies of each report and  documentation of IRB notification and 
receipt will be kept in the Clinical Investigator’s binder.  
7.6.3  FDA Notification by Sponsor 
The study sponsor shall notify the FDA by telephone or by facsimile transmission of any unexpected fatal or life- threatening experience associated with the use of 
  Page 19 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the s tudy sponsor  the drug as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the 
sponsor’s original receipt of the information.  
 If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit the criteri a for reporting, the study sponsor will submit the adverse event in a 
written report to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from the time the determination is made.  
7.7 Unblinding Procedures  
Subjects who experience any serious adverse event, including what appears to be an allergic reaction or an expected, negative cognitive effect will be unblinded by the researcher who will call the Investigational Pharmacy for the necessary information.  
This information will be noted in the documents and the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  Any necessary medical treatment will be delivered and subject will be followed up for at least 24 hours to make sure there are no continuing medical problems.   
7.8 Stopping Rules  
If there are any adverse effects reported by the subject or detected by the nurse or 
study coordinator, subjects will be asked to supply details regarding the nature of the adverse effect and its severity. Dr. Leppik (see 7.9) will determine the course of follow -
up and whether or  not the subject requires further medical care or should be 
discontinued from further participation in the study. Participation in the study would also be discontinued if, during the course of the study, the subject develops a significant medical condition or is initiated on medication that can be expected to interact with any 
of the study drugs. The subject has the option of discontinuing their participation at any time for any reason. Any adverse effects not commonly associated with the drugs under study or any serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB.  
7.9 Medical Monitoring 
Dr. Leppik, who is a co- investigator and Medical Director of this project, will be 
responsible or monitoring adverse events. At each visit subjects will be asked whether they are experiencing any side effects. Vital signs are also monitored befor e and after 
drug administration. Dr. Leppik is an epileptologist with first hand knowledge of TPM in epilepsy patients. He is also the study physician on the preliminary TPM/LZP/PLA studies performed by this research group. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 
Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular 
assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.

8.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
8.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activit ies in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source data are contained in source documents   Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments involved in the 
clinical trial.  
 Data generated by the methods described in the protocol will be recorded in the subjects' medical records and/or study progress notes. Data may be transcribed legibly on CRFs supplied for each subject or directly inputted into an electronic system or any combination thereof.  
8.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If th e item is not applicable to the individual case, write 
“N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO

entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
8.4 Records Retention 
 
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least 2 
years after the last approval of a marketing application in their country and until there 
are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in their country or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by an agreement with the sponsor.  In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the spon sor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no 
longer need to be retained.  
 
9 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
9.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored according to FDA/GCP guidelines.  The investigator will 
allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure 
that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. phar macy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
9.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB, 
the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.

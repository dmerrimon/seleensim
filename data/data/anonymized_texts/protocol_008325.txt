Version dated 1-AUG- 2019   1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, radiographic examination and other medical or diagnostic 
procedures on the colon, it is important that the colon be thoroughly purged and cleansed. In 
particular, it is essential that as much fecal matter as possible be removed from the colon to 
permit adequate visualization of the intestinal mucosa.  
 
Large volume (e.g. 4L) orally administered compositions have been developed for use as 
gastrointestinal “washes” for diagnostic purposes. Such orally administered preparations are 
usually formulated as dilute or isotonic solutions of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG-3350) and 
electrolyte containing salts such as sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and 
potassium chloride1. These orally administered compositions are useful in the rapid cleansing of 
the colon for diagnostic purposes.  However, due to the large volume of poorly tasting fluid that 
must be ingested, patient compliance is often poor. 
 
One attempt to answer this problem has been to reduce the volume of preparation and improve 
its palatability. To this end, a sulfate-based bowel preparation known as BLI800 was evaluated 
in clinical studies2 and proven to be safe and effective. BLI800 was approved by FDA in 2010 
as SUPREP ® Bowel Prep Kit (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) Oral 
Solution. SUPREP requires the patient to consume two separate administrations of this oral 
sulfate solution (OSS).  Each administration purges the colon of fecal material.  The colon is 
cleansed after the second administration. Each administration is followed by 946 ml 
supplemental water to prevent dehydration.  The total volume of fluid intake (including 
SUPREP) is about 3L.  SUPREP was specifically formulated to prevent fluid and electrolyte 
disturbances, unlike the phosphate preparations3.   
 
W
hile preparation compliance with SUPREP in clinical trials is very high (> 99% preparation 
completion)3,4, limited data has been collected on patient satisfaction and preference for the 
preparation. The goal of this study is collect this patient preference and satisfaction data to 
inform future development.  
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the patient satisfaction and preference of BLI800 
(SUPR
EP) in adult patients undergoing colonoscopy.

Study procedures are described as follows and depicted graphically in Section 4.4, below. 
4
.1. Visit 1 
At the screening visit, the following procedures will be undertaken: 
 S ubject is fully informed about the study and gives written agreement to study 
participation in the form of a signed informed consent form (refer to Section 4.1.1) and 
assign a subject number 
 Assess eligibility, including collection of medical history and concomitant medications 
 A urine pregnancy test will be performed on female subjects of childbearing potential 
(see Section 4.6). Subjects meeting all entry criteria will be eligible for enrollment. 
 
4.1.1.  Informe
d Consent 
Following the informed consent process, study subjects will sign a current IRB approved 
consent form. No study procedures may be performed prior to the subject providing informed 
consent. The subject’s original signed and personally dated Informed Consent Form (together 
with any subsequent IRB approved amended versions) must be retained by the Investigator in 
the subject’s file.  A copy of the original signed and dated Informed Consent Form must be 
given to the subject. 
4.1.2.  Bowel Preparation Assignment 
Eligible subjects will be assigned a SUPREP kit in sequential order. Subjects will self-
admi
nister the study preparation starting on the day prior to their scheduled colonoscopy 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -491 Page 8 of 20 
 
Version dated 1-AUG- 2019   according to the instructions on the commercial product label. Subjects will be instructed to 
bring the used preparation components when they return for colonoscopy.  
4.1.3.  Dietary Restrictions  
Subjects may have a light breakfast on the day before colonoscopy, followed by clear liquids 
unti
l the colonoscopy is completed the following day.  
Examples of acceptable clear liquids are provided below: 
 Water 
 Strained fruit juices (without pulp) including apple, orange, white grape, etc. 
 Limeade or lemonade 
 Gatorade/ Powerade 
 Ginger ale 
 Coffee or tea (do not use any dairy or non-dairy creamer) 
 Chicken broth 
 Gelatin desserts without added fruit or topping 
Note: Purple/Red liquids, Milk and Alcoholic beverages are not permitted. 
 
Non-compliance with the dietary restrictions will be documented, but will not require separate 
reporting as a protocol violation. 
 
 
4.1.4.  Subject Questionnaires 
 
Subjects will be provided with a Preparation Questionnaire and Dietary Questionnaire to 
document their preparation and dietary intake (refer to Appendix A  for full questionnaires), 
a
nd to note any episodes of vomiting that may occur during the preparation. Subjects will 
c
omplete these questionnaires starting on the morning they are scheduled to take their first 
dose of each preparation (Preparation Day 1) until they return to the study center the following 
day (Preparation Day 2). The time of food/fluid ingestion will be recorded. Site staff must 
review the descriptions and times recorded on the questionnaire at Visit 2 to confirm that 
subjects were compliant with the dietary restrictions outlined in Section 4.1.3. 
4.2. Bowel Preparation Administration 
On the day prior to their appointment, subjects will begin following the protocol specified 
dieta
ry restrictions (as outlined in Section 4.1.3 ) and completing their Preparation and Dietary 
Questionnaires (refer to Appendix A). In the evening, subjects will begin consuming their 
bowel preparation according to the instructions provided by the study center (refer to product 
label ). Subjects will take the second dose of bowel preparation the following morning 
a
ccording to the product label. 
4
.3. Visit 2 
Subjects will return to the study center for colonoscopy following completion of the 
preparation. Subjects will bring back their preparation questionnaires and study personnel will 
review the questionnaires for completeness so that any missed responses can be captured. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -491 Page 9 of 20 
 
Version dated 1-AUG- 2019   Subjects will complete a preference questionnaire (refer to Appendix A). Any violations of the 
dietary restrictions must be confirmed with the subject. Subjects will be queried for occurrence 
of a
dverse events.  
 
The colonoscopy will be performed by a physician according to the site’s standard procedures 
and evaluated on a 4-point scale, as shown in Section 4.5. Endoscopists should limit the use of 
wa
ter flush to that necessary to achieve the cleansing required to achieve adequate visualization. 
Water immersion and/or exchange technique should be avoided unless it is medically indicated. 
 
4.3.1.  Drug Accountability 
Subjects will be instructed to bring the used preparation components when they return for 
colonoscopy to determine compliance. Failure of a subject to return preparation components does 
not constitute a protocol violation. The staff members will perform drug accountability by 
c
ounting used and unused preparation components.  
 
Returned study preparation materials must be accounted for on the drug inventory log and will be 
returned to the Sponsor at the completion or termination of the study, unless instructed otherwise 
by the Sponsor.

4.5 Physician Assessments 
4.5.1.  Segmental Cleansing Assessment 
The colonoscopist will rate each colon segment (proximal, mid, distal) using the following scale, 
fa
ctoring in the amount of effort required during both insertion and withdrawal. 
Score  Grade  Description  
1 Poor  Large amounts of fecal residue, additional 
bowel preparation required  
2 Fair Enough feces even after washing and suctioning 
to prevent clear visualization of the entire 
colonic mucosa.  
3 Good  Feces and fluid requiring washing and 
suctioning, but still achieves clear visualization 
of the entire colonic mucosa.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -491 Page 11 of 20 
 
Version dated 1-AUG -2019     4 Excellent  No more than small bits of feces/fluid which 
can be suctioned easily; achieves clear 
visualization of the entire colonic mucosa  
 
4.5.2. Ov erall Cleansing Assessment 
Following completion of the procedure and after each segment has been rated, the colonoscopist 
will provide a global rating of preparation quality for the entire colon (inclusive of their 
perception of all segments) using the scale outlined in Section 4.5.1.   
 
4
.6. Pregnancy 
Subjects that are female and of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test done at 
screening. A positive result will rule out the participation of the subject in the study. 
 
Female study subjects must be surgically sterilized or use oral contraceptives, depot 
contraceptives, double-barrier method, intrauterine device, or testify that she is monogamous 
with a vasectomized partner, or practices abstinence and will continue to do so during the 
duration of study. Subjects practicing abstinence must agree to use an acceptable form of birth 
control should they become sexually active during the study. Women who are post-menopausal 
(as defined in this section), or have had a partial or total hysterectomy or tubal ligation are not 
considered of child bearing potential. 
 
Oral contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections should be stable for at least 1 month 
before the study, until completion of the study.  Subjects are not allowed to change their birth 
control method during the course of the study. 
 
Menopausal status is defined when menses have been absent for 12 months in a woman of 
appropriate age (usually 45 to 55 years) who has no other suspected or identified cause of 
amenorrheaas. 
 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject must be removed from the study and 
followed until one month after the end of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy will not be recorded as an 
adverse event.  
 
5. ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -491 Page 12 of 20 
 
Version dated 1-AUG -2019     symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
Reports of vomiting on the Preparation Questionnaire must be reported as adverse event 
(multiple episodes of vomiting should be reported as a single adverse event in the Case Report 
Form). Colonoscopy and biopsy findings are not considered adverse events unless considered by 
the investigator to be related to the preparation or colonoscopy procedure. 
Adverse event collection will commence at the time the patient provides informed consent and 
will conclude with the completion of Visit 2. 
 
Subjects will be instructed to promptly report adverse events to the Investigator. The Investigator 
will record date/time of report, date/time of onset, description of the adverse event, severity of 
adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, action(s) taken regarding study 
participation, duration of adverse event, and the Investigator's assessment of relationship of 
adverse event to study preparation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Investigator should assess the severity of each adverse event using the following categories: 
Grade  Severity  Description  
1 Mild  Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
causing some limitations of usual activities  
3 Severe  Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
Activities  
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death, Life threatening or disabling  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event)  
5 Fatal  Causes death of the participant  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event)   
 
The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event using the 
following categories: 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -491 Page 13 of 20 
 
Version dated 1-AUG -2019     Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely . 
DEFINITE  There is clear  evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out . 
5.2 Expected Adverse Events 
The most common adverse reactions  occurring after administration of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit 
were overall discomfort, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headache.  
 
6. SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DISCONTINUATION 
OF STUDY 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in at least one 
of the following outcomes: 
 
- Results in death 
- Is life-threatening 
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or 
damage 
 
 SAE collection will coincide with the patient providing informed consent to participate in 
the study and will conclude with the completion of Visit 2. Pre-scheduled surgeries or 
e
lective surgeries (that do not represent a worsening of a pre-existing condition) will not 
be considered serious adverse events. Should a serious and/or unexpected adverse event 
occur, the Investigator will notify Braintree Laboratories immediately or no later than 24 
hours after gaining knowledge of the event.  The Investigator will make a decision regarding 
continuing study participation, and may request input from Braintree Laboratories. The 
Investigator will be responsible for recommending or providing the patient with appropriate 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI800 -491 Page 14 of 20 
 
Version dated 1-AUG -2019     medical therapy. All patients experiencing serious adverse events will be followed until 
clinically stable.  
  
Braintree Laboratories must be kept apprised of all follow-up information related to serious adverse 
events. In addition, Investigators must comply with the SAE reporting requirements of the 
Institutional Review Board with oversight of the study.  
 
Any serious and/or unexpected adverse events that occur during the study will be reported to 
Braintree Laboratories as follows:

 Subject chooses to withdraw from the study, for whatever reason. 
 S ubject is lost to follow-up.  
 The  Sponsor initiates an early discontinuation of the study. 
 The  subject is withdrawn at the discretion of the Investigator. 
 
Braintree should be contacted if possible prior to discontinuation of any subject. 
9. DATA ANALYSIS 
Since this is an uncontrolled study, no statistical testing will be performed. Demographic data 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
9.1. Study Endpoints - Preference 
Preference Questionnaire data will be summarized and presented categorically by individual 
question.  
9.2. Study Endpoints - Efficacy 
Overall preparation success or failure is the primary efficacy endpoint for this study. The 
following
 definition of preparation success and failure will be used: 
 
De
finition of successful preparation:  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment by the colonoscopist ( Section 4.5.2) of “Excellent” or 
“
Good” and does not satisfy any of the following failure criteria.    
 
Definition of failed preparation:  
1. Ove rall Cleansing Assessment of “Fair” or “Poor” by the colonoscopist. 
2. Any subject who did not have a colonoscopy based on the Investigator’s 
assessment of the cleansing (insufficient fecal output, unclear fecal discharge, 
etc.) or due to preparation related adverse events. 
3. An y subject for whom cleaning was not adequate for evaluation.

Version dated 1-AUG -2019     Unevaluable Patients: 
Subjects who were dispensed a kit but withdrew from the study prior to taking any preparation 
are excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses. Any subject who completely or partially took 
study preparation but did not have a colonoscopy due to non-preparation related reasons (e.g. 
lack of insurance, inability to return for colonoscopy) will not be included in the efficacy 
analyses. All treated subjects will be included in the safety analysis. 
 
Segmental cleansing scores will be summarized and presented categorically.  
9.3. Study Endpoints - Safety 
Adverse Events: 
All subjects who took preparation in any amount will be included in the safety analysis. All 
adverse events will be summarized based on the principle of treatment emergence. A sign or 
symptom will be regarded as treatment-emergent if it was present prior to the first dose and 
subsequently worsened in severity, or was not present prior to the first dose but subsequently 
appeared. 
 
In order to define treatment emergence for events with missing start or stop dates the following 
additional criteria will be used: 
 if both t he onset and resolution dates for a particular event are missing, then the 
e
vent is considered treatment-emergent; 
 if the  onset date for an event is missing and the resolution date falls after the 
initiation of the first dose, then the event is considered treatment-emergent; 
 if the  onset date for an event falls after the initiation of the first dose and the 
resolution date is missing or  present, then the event is considered treatment-
e
mergent; and 
 if the  onset date for an event falls before the initiation of the first dose and the 
stop date is missing or  present, then the event is not considered treatment-
e
mergent. 
 
Adverse events will be collected using MedDRA category designations for body system and 
preferred term. The number and percent of subjects who experienced each adverse event will be 
presented in a tabular form.   
 
9.4. Sample Size  
Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled and treated in the study.  This size was chosen 
be
cause of the pilot nature of this study.

At the conclusion of the study, all drug materials will be accounted for.  Federal law requires 
that, at the conclusion of the study, all drug materials must be returned to the study sponsor or 
destroyed according to local regulations.  
11. STUDY MONITORING 
 
A Braintree Laboratories Study Monitor or qualified designee will visit each study center prior to 
the commencement of the study and periodically during the course of the study in accordance 
with federal guidelines governing the sponsorship of studies. 
12. DOCUMENTS AND NOTIFICATIONS 
12.1. Informed Consent 
Written informed consent will be obtained from the subjects by study personnel and will be kept 
on file at the study center. Documentation of the consent process should be noted in the study 
source documents. 
12.2. Institutional Review Board 
Peer review and approval of the protocol by an appropriate Institutional Review Board is 
required prior to commencement of enrollment.  Amendments to the approved protocol must also 
be submitted to the Institutional Review Board and approved prior to their implementation.  
 
12.3. Amendments to the Protocol 
If Braintree Laboratories determines that there is need for an amendment, it will be produced in 
writing by Braintree Laboratories and will be made a formal part of the protocol following its 
submission and approval from the IRB.    
12.4. Data Records 
Braintree Laboratories will provide data collection forms for each subject. Subject medical 
records will be reviewed to verify all other data points, including potential adverse events.  
Copies of subjects’ colonoscopy and pathology reports (if applicable) may be collected for 
Braintree Laboratories after subject identifiers have been redacted by site staff. Colonoscopies 
will be recorded (if site has recording capability) and transmitted to Braintree Laboratories. The 
Investigator should retain copies of the subject consent forms and other study documents for a 
period of two years following the date of approval of a New Drug Application or supplement for 
BLI800, or, if the application is not approved, for two years after the drug investigation program 
is discontinued. The study investigator will notify Braintree Laboratories of their intent to 
dispose of the study records and allow Braintree to take possession of such records. Study 
records will be made available at reasonable times for inspection and copying if requested by a

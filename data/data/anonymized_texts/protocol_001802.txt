Summary of Changes from Previous Version: 
Affected 
Section(s) Summary of Revisions Made Rationale 
Sections 1.1, 
1.3, 4.1, 4.4, 
and 9.3  The at-home testing through the public 
health intervention will be 3 times a week 
for 4 weeks, instead of testing twice a 
week for 5 weeks.  More frequent testing is better suited to 
diagnosing asymptomatic/pre-
symptomatic disease and prevent 
spread. 
Section 1.3 Questionnaires/surveys will be 
administered only on baseline and weeks 
1, 3, 5, 13, and 21. The Schedule of Events 
table has been updated to reflect these 
timepoints.    To reduce participant burden, 
questionnaires/surveys will only be 
administered on baseline and weeks, 1, 
3, 5, 13, 21.  
Section 1.3  The survey on knowledge of prevention 
approaches will be administered on weeks 
5 and 21 instead of weeks 13 and 21. Administering this questionnaire at 
week 5 and week 21 allows for a better 
perceptive to see how the participant
knowledge has changed over time.  
Section 1.3 The survey on feasibility of at-home testing 
has been removed from week 21. It will 
only be administered at week 5. To reduce participant burden, this 
survey will only be asked once after the 
testing phase. 
Section 1.3 Survey questions on Beliefs were added to 
the protocol for weeks 1, 5, and 21.  No new questions were added. The 
survey questions on Belief were already 
included in the questionnaire. It has now 
been specified as a new category of 
questions within the protocol.  
Section 1.3 Anthropometrics (weight) was added as a 
measure to be taken at Baseline and week 
5. Anthropometrics (height) was added as 
a measure to be taken at Baseline.  Socio-Demographic Data was already 
planned at Screening and Enrollment 
(now called Baseline). For additional 
clarity, anthropometrics have now been 
specified at Baseline. Height will be 
taken at Baseline. Since weight 
fluctuates, it will be taken at Baseline 
and week 5.   
National Institute of Health   Protocol  
SARS-CoV-2 Test   RADx-UP HoT 
Section 1.3 Contact information will be collected 
during the Screening and Enrollment 
phase. It has been added to Schedule of 
Events table under Baseline.  Contact information was already 
planned to be collected. For additional 
clarity, it has now been added to the 
Schedule of Events table.  
Sections 3 
and 9.4.4 The method used for the exploratory 
objective to measure participant mobility 
was changed from mobile phone 
geotracking  to surrogates of mobility 
including activity tracker. The method of mobility tracking was 
updated since the smartphone 
application for this study is expected to 
be able to access activity tracking 
functions of the phones on which the 
application is installed.

Title:  Rapid Acceleration for Diagnostics in Underserved Populations : Home 
Testing (RADx-UP HoT) 
Study Des cription : This observational, cohort sub-study  is embedded within a larger public 
health intervention that distributes at-home, self-administered,  SARS-
CoV-2 antigen testing kits to households within pre-selected communities 
through the CDC. Within this sub-study, we will evaluate the socio-
behavioral mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission, including 
social interactions, health behaviors, healthcare utilization, knowledge, 
disease burden, and feasibility of at-home testing.  The study hypothesis is 
that positive at-home test results will be associated with altered self-
reported social interactions and altered health behaviors compared to 
negative test results. Surveys and questionnaires will be completed by 
participants through the smartphone app or via call center phone calls 
according to the schedule of events. Questionnaires will collect data on 
demographic characteristics, medical history and health status, COVID 
testing and symptoms, social interactions, knowledge of prevention 
strategies, infection risk, and attitudes towards vaccines.

2  INTRODUCTION 
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
 
The public health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on across the US. Novel mitigation 
strategies and community level public health interventions are critical to stop the spread of this virus. 
One of these interventions is frequent, low-cost, rapid-result, at-home viral screening of asymptomatic 
and symptomatic individuals. The goal of frequent home testing is to identify SARS-CoV-2 index cases 
early, trigger isolation and quarantining precautions, and ultimately decrease community transmission. 
 
National Institute of Health   Protocol 
SARS-CoV-2 Test  RADx-UP HoT 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template  v1.0 7 Apr 2017  5 The Centers for Disease Control, through coordination with public health departments, is conducting a 
public health intervention of frequent home testing, completed in a timeline needed to address the 
pressing need in high-risk communities. This intervention of home testing requires intentional 
engagement and a clear recognition of risk. Within pre-selected communities, CDC will distribute at-
home, self-collect/self-test SARS-CoV-2 tests with instructions to complete regular testing irrespective of 
symptoms or exposure history.  Previous at-home testing studies have generated inconclusive results, in 
part due to multiple factors including inadequate community engagement strategies to promote uptake 
and consistent testing in the target population as well as limited testing and prevention knowledge, 
attitudes and behavior. 
 
This cohort sub-study in a subset of the population will explore the community and human behavior 
factors in response to at-home testing. Participants in the public health intervention who meet eligibility 
criteria will be invited to participate in the sub-study, consented, and asked to complete questionnaires 
aimed at evaluating self-reported social interactions, behaviors, and health system utilization in 
response to results from the at-home SARS CoV-2 antigen test. This sub-study will provide participant 
level behavioral information essential to understanding the relationship between large scale at-home 
testing and community transmission during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and relevant for implementation 
of public health interventions in future pandemics.      
 2.2 BACKGROUND  
 
In the US, > 4 million people have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and >400,000 died. Infections 
and deaths, however, have disproportionally affected historically marginalized populations. Early in the 
pandemic the focus has been on testing to identify symptomatic individuals to reduce morbidity and 
mortality from infection.  As public health measures have scaled up mitigation strategies are increasingly 
being considered to reduce community spread of infection. The availability of rapid tests for detecting 
SARS-CoV-2 presents opportunities for rapid, frequent and low-cost at-home testing in asymptomatic 
populations as part of a broader mitigation strategy that includes protective measures (masking, social 
distancing, increased hygiene) and contact-tracing and isolation. With 50% or more of infections 
resulting from pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission, at-home testing may offer an effective 
option for screening and for breaking chains of transmission. Rapid antigen tests are relatively 
inexpensive and therefore can be used frequently for detecting infected individuals who are 
asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-21. However, 
even with antigen tests, the implementation of community level testing will be challenging, with an 
impact that is still to be determined2. 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
Study-related risks include potential loss of confidentiality  but steps will be undertaken to minimize this 
risk. There are no interventions involved in this study.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
 
This is an observational, direct-to-participant, nested cohort, sub-study embedded within a public health 
intervention that distributes at-home, self-administered, SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing kits. Adults and 
children over 8 years of age living within the pre-identified communities will be included. This sub-study 
focuses on gathering participant-level data to evaluate behavioral determinants of home testing and 
socio-behavioral mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.   
 
The smartphone application developed by CareEvolution, called MyDataHelps, will be used for this 
study, and it is free of charge on Apple or Android devices3. As part of the public health intervention, 
households will receive test kits and included in them will be information about the app and a QR code 
to facilitate access. Only after the participants have received information about the public health 
intervention and received the testing kits, will they be offered the option to participate in this sub-study. 
Once registered, if the participant wants to be a part of the sub-study, eligibility criteria will be verified 
and e-consent will be obtained through the app. The smartphone app includes instructions to administer 
at-home tests, for all participants in the public health intervention. Push notifications will be 
programmed with messaging to promote adherence including personalization, context, and timing for 
all pariticipants in the public health intervention. Additionally, participants will have an option to opt-in 
to reminders for testing 3 times a week at a time of their preference. For participants who provide 
consent to the sub-study, the app will also feature the ability to report the results of their test results 
(upload images of test trips), track testing history, respond to surveys and questionnaires, and access 
As an alternative to the app,  participants can participate in the study 
via phone interviews conducted by a centralized study call center. Home test kits will include a QR code 
for the public health intervention app which will link to DCRI call center/eConsent for those interested in 
participating. Using scripted interview guides, call center staff will be ready to explain study 
participation, obtain verbal consent, administer study questionnaires including soliciting test results, and 
issue phone reminders for participants who chose not to use the study app. 
National Institute of Health   Protocol 
SARS-CoV-2 Test  RADx-UP HoT 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template  v1.0 7 Apr 2017  9 Using PhenX and Common Data Element (CDE) measures, the surveys and questionnaires will collect 
data on demographic characteristics, medical history and health status, SARS-CoV-2 testing and 
symptoms, social interactions, knowledge of prevention strategies, and infection risk, and attitudes 
towards vaccines.  
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
 
This study involves a direct-to-participant approach that minimizes participant burden and accelerates 
translation of study findings into daily life settings. This study designs bypasses the traditional settings 
within healthcare environments, and instead brings A 
direct-to-participant approach minimizes risks by leveraging the public health intervention community 
engagement, recruitment, and intervention dissemination efforts, and maximizes rewards by selectively 
complementing study data with participant specific information on behaviors and clinical outcomes 
associated with frequent at-home testing.  
 
The objective of the study is to gather participant level information about social behaviors in response 
to at-home test results during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, a direct-to-participant design, 
which maximally integrates assessments into participaccurate representation of behaviors.  
There are certain limitations to this study design. A slow enrollment is the greatest challenge to any 
prospective cohort study. By nesting the sub-study within the public health intervention, the sub-study 
leverages the multimodal community engagement and kit dissemination strategies of the public health 
intervention. Non-compliance with study procedures is a risk for community based and direct-to-
participant studies, where traditional health care visits are not available to perform procedures or 
reinforce compliance. Participation will be facilitated by creating two participation pathways, app and 
call center enabled.  
As a result of these efforts, the goal is to establish a systematic approach combining community 
engagement and at-home testing to decrease transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as inform public 
health interventions for future pandemics. 
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE 
 
There is no study specified administration of a test product. The SARS-CoV-2 test is being self-
administered as part of the public health intervention, and is not part of this sub-study protocol.4.4 END OF STUDY DEFINITION 
 
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed the active testing 
period (at-home testing 3 times a week for 4 weeks) along with the questionnaires/surveys during those 
4 weeks. Questionnaires/surveys will continue to be offered during the follow-up period (up to 17 
weeks). Any amount of testing data and survey responses completed will be acceptable and analyzed.

behavior during a community level at-home testing program. Eligible communities receiving will be 
selected per criteria in the public health intervention.  
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE 
 
Push notifications will be programmed in the app along with text messaging to promote adherence to 
the at-home testing schedule as well as the survey and questionnaire schedule as part of the public 
health intervention The app also includes a personal tracker of participant test history. Phone call 
reminders will be provided for participants who choose not to use the app. Deviations to the public 
health intervention will not be tracked.

7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time. The reason for participant 
discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be collected on the app or through phone call via call 
center. Participants who provide consent, and subsequently withdraw, will not be replaced. 
 
7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW-UP 
 
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to complete the at-home testing and 
scheduled questionnaires/surveys and is unable to be contacted by the call center.  
 
The DCRI call center will attempt to contact the participant and counsel the participant on the 
importance of maintaining the assigned study schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be 
considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
 
The questionnaires/surveys will assess patient-report outcomes related to social behaviors, healthcare 
utilization, knowledge of SARS CoV-2 prevention approaches, and the feasibility of at-home self-
administered testing. Adherence to the at-home testing and questionnaire/survey schedule will also be 
assessed.  
 
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
 
The healthcare utilization questionnaire will be routinely administered during the treatment and follow-
up phase, and it will ask about any emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admission 
related to SARS COV-2 evaluation or treatment.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Additional details of the planned statistical analyses will be provided in a separate statistical analysis 
plan.  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
 
The proposed analysis is primarily descriptive rather than inferential, as it designed to provide a general 
assessment of participant level behaviors in the context of a community testing intervention. An 
exploratory hypothesize is that positive at-home SARS-CoV-2 antigen test results will lead to altered self-
reported social interactions and altered health behaviors compared to negative test results. 
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 
 
A formal power calculation is not performed for this observational cohort study. However, a sample size 
in the ranges of 1000 to 10,000 participants would be sufficient to estimate positive test incidence and 
prevalence, describe behavioral changes associated with test results, and conduct multivariable 
modeling to inform understanding of the causal chain between frequent testing and community burden 
of disease. To illustrate this, suppose the proportion of participants who adhere to social distancing is 
50%. In that case, a sample size of 5,000 participants will be sufficient at a confidence level of 95% to 
estimate the prevalence with a margin of error of 1.5%. Additional examples of estimate precision at 
varying sample sizes are provided below. Overall, even with a sample size of 1000 participants and for 
an endpoint with a 50% proportion, there will be a 95% chance that the real value of this proportion is 
within 3.1% of the observed value.

9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES 
 
The following populations are also defined: 
 
Population  Description  
Evaluable Population - Per 
protocol (PP) Per protocol population will be those that report adhering  to the 
following: 
1. Self-administer the at-home test three times a week for 4 
weeks 
2. Complete questionnaires/surveys during the 4 week testing 
period  
Modified per-protocol  Will include any participant who performed at least one at -home test  
Second modified per -
protocol  Will include any participant who completed at least one survey  
All analyses will be conducted in the PP. A subset of analyses will be repeated in the modified PP 
populations as applicable.  
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
 
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH 
 
The approach to analysis will be primarily descriptive. Demographics, questionnaire data, and testing 
results will be reviewed and summarized using graphical techniques and summary statistics. Where 
applicable, exact method confidence intervals will be computed around point estimates. Trends over 
time will be evaluated graphically. The proportion of participants adhering to social distancing guidelines 
after a positive vs. negative test result will be compared using tests of proportion clustered by 
participants with various levels of intra-participant correlation. Stratified analyses by test or week 
number will also be performed. We will explore the associations between positive test results and 
critical behavioral measures using mixed modeling techniques to account for the participant and

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template  v1.0 7 Apr 2017  15 household correlations. Analyses will be conducted using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary NC) and R with R 
Studio (R-project). 
 
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S) 
 
Point estimates with 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  The analysis will be done for applicable 
study populations as described above, and stratified by participant demographics of interest (e.g., age, 
gender). There will be a comparison of the proportion of participants that report adhering to social 
distancing guidelines after positive vs. negative test result.  
 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
The first secondary objective is to assess change in self-reported behaviors before and 
following SARS CoV-2 at-home test result over the study period. This will be measured via 
Precaution Adoption Process Model Assessments of self-reported data on awareness of the 
issue, engagement, decisions to act, action, and maintenance. The proportion of 
respondents that decide to act on precautionary behaviors after a test result will be 
analyzed for the entire study cohort and stratified by participant demographics of interest 
(e.g., age, gender).  
 
The second secondary objective is to assess the impact of at-home testing regimen on self-
reported healthcare utilization for SARS CoV-2 treatment. This will be measured via self-
reported Emergency Department visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admission for SARS CoV-2 
evaluation or treatment. The proportion of respondents that decide to act on precautionary 
behaviors after a test result will be analyzed for the entire study cohort and stratified by 
participant demographics of interest (e.g., age, gender).  
The third secondary objective is to assess knowledge of SARS CoV-2 prevention approaches 
over the study period. This will be measured via self-reported data on perceptions and 
prevention of risks of contracting SARS CoV-2 infection. The proportion of respondents that 
are knowledgeable of precautionary measures to prevent infection will be analyzed for the 
entire study cohort and stratified by participant demographics of interest (e.g., age, gender). 
 
The fourth secondary objective is to assess prevalence of positive test result for SARS CoV-2. 
This will be measured via self-reported results of self-administered SARS CoV-2 antigen test. 
The prevalence of positive test results will be analyzed with 95% confidence for the entire 
study cohort and stratified by participant demographics of interest (e.g., age, gender). 
 
9.4.4 ANALYSIS OF THE EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
The first exploratory objective is to assess the feasibility of at-home self-administered SARS 
CoV-2 antigen tests. This will be measured via self-reported data on acceptability, 
practicality, integration, penetration, and demand of at-home self-administered antigen 
test. The proportion of respondents that find at-home self-administered antigen test 
acceptable will be analyzed for the entire study cohort and stratified by participant 
demographics (e.g., age, gender).  
 
National Institute of Health   Protocol 
SARS-CoV-2 Test  RADx-UP HoT 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template  v1.0 7 Apr 2017  16 The second exploratory objective is to assess participant mobility following SARS CoV-2 at-
home test results over the study period. This will be evaluated using surrogate of mobility, 
including activity trackers.  
 
The third exploratory objective is to assess attitudes towards SARS CoV-2 vaccination over 
the study period. This will be measured via Health Belief Model Assessments using self-
reported data on perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and cues to action 
related to SARS CoV-2 vaccination. The d
CoV-2 vaccination will be analyzed for the entire study cohort and stratified by participant 
demographics (e.g., age, gender).

10.1.6 SAFETY OVERSIGHT 
 
Since there are no medications or interventions being prescribed as part of the study, and due to the 
minimal risk of the survey data only the study will not have a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). 
Instead, the DCRI PI will serve as the medical monitor. 
 
10.1.7 CLINICAL MONITORING 
 
As a direct-to-  
formal monitoring of the study. Study personnel will still ensure that the rights and well-being of study 
participants are protected, that the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that 
the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol, International 
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and with applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  
 
 
10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 
The DCRI will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, documentation 
and completion.   
 
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC 
checks that will be run on the database. The study team will be responsible for monitoring data 
collected via the mobile application to ensure that the reported study data are accurate, and complete, 
reported in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).

10.1.9 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
10.1.9.1 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
Using PhenX and RADx-Up CDE measures, the questionnaires/surveys will collect data on demographic 
characteristics, medical history and health status, SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptoms, social interactions, 
knowledge of prevention strategies, and infection risk, and attitudes towards vaccines. All data capture 
will be electronic for participants who choose to participate using the MyDataHelps app. The app 
platform will be the technology that underpins data collection and management. The mobile application 
functions as a communication platform between the participants, investigators, and the study team. It 
supports daily reminders, seamless data collection, surveys/questionnaires, and data exchange between 
participants and the study team. In addition to its function as a communication platform, it is also a 
source documentation platform that is used to record, document, and store all information collected by 
the study team. All source data entered into the application has an audit trail, which documents who 
completes data entry and when, with all data legibly recorded. Study team members entering source 
data into the application do so in real time as they are collecting the data. For those participating via the 
phone calls, the data provided by the participant will be documented into the app by the call center 
member.  
 
10.1.9.2 STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study intervention. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed 
without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform 
the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.

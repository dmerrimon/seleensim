 CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 5  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to adjust the sample size for Part B based on the 
results of Part A of the study, and to add an additional database lock after all patients in Part A 
complete study week 52 of Part C. Other changes were made for cl arification and consistency. 
The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the rationale.  
Description of Change  Rationale  Section Changed  
Decreased the required sample size for 
Part B from 345 patients to 210 
patients (70/arm) based o n the sample 
size re -estimation for Part B, as 
previously outlined in Section 10.2 
Justification of Sample Size.   
 This sample size re-
estimation for Part B 
was based on results 
from Part A of the 
study in which a larger 
treatment effect on the 
Dysphagia S ymptom 
Questionnaire (DSQ) 
was observed than in a 
phase 2 study with 
budesonide, 
previously used for 
sample size 
estimation.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis:

 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 4  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to protect patient safety and data integrity during the 
COVID -19 pandemic by allowing for ce rtain study procedures to occur at delayed time points 
and/or outside of the clinic environment. All temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations 
from planned study procedures are to be documented as being related to COVID -19 and will 
remain in effect onl y for the duration of the public health emergency. The following table 
outlines the changes made to the protocol and the rationale.  
Description of Change  Rationale  Section Changed  
Added provisions allowing study 
procedures to occur at delayed 
timepoints and/or outside of the clinic 
environment.  
• Biopsy with endoscopies may be 
delayed for visit 11/week 24, visit 
19/week 52, early termination, 
and before initiating rescue 
treatment  
• At-home study drug dosing is 
permitted for all visits except for 
visit 3/day 1 and visit 11/week 24  
• If the endoscopy with biopsies 
cannot occur due to COVID -19 
restrictions, rescue treatment 
should be initiated without delay 
and these patients will be eligible 
to participate in Part C  
• Safety and laboratory procedures 
(vital signs, weight, PK/ADA 
sample collection, hematology 
and chemistry urine sample 
collection) may be delayed or 
occur at -home when possible  
• The patient -reported outcome 
questionnaires that are intended to 
be completed during clinic visits 
may be conducted via phone 
interviews after visit 3/day 1  To protect 
patient safety

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 3, Randomized, 3 -Part Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Dupilumab in Adult and Adolescent Patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis 
(EoE)  
Site Location(s)  Global  
Objective(s)  Primary Objectives  
This study consists of three parts:  Part A and Part B are 24 -week treatment, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study phases and Part C is a 
28-week, extended active treatment phase that will enroll patients from Part A 
and Pa rt B. 
The primary objectives by study part are:  
• Part A: To determine the treatment effect of dupilumab compared 
with placebo in adult and adolescent patients with EoE after 24 weeks 
of treatment as assessed by histological and clinical measures and to 
inform/confirm the final sample size determination for Part B.  
• Note:  Patients enrolled in Part A may not participate in Part B.  
• Part B: To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab treatment compared 
with placebo in adult and adolescent patients with EoE afte r 24 weeks 
of treatment as assessed by histological and clinical measures.  
• Part C: To assess the safety and efficacy of dupilumab treatment in 
adult and adolescent patients with EoE after up to 52 weeks of 
treatment as assessed by histological and clinical  measures.  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
dupilumab treatment for up to 52 weeks in adult and adolescent 
patients with EoE  
• To explore the relationship between dupilumab concentration and 
responses in adult and adolescent patients with EoE, using 
descriptive analyses  
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on transcriptomic signatures 
associated with EoE and type 2 inflammation  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab treatment compared to 
placebo after 24 week s and 52 weeks of treatment in adult and 
adolescent patients with EoE who have previously received 
swallowed topical corticosteroids  
Study Design  Part A  
Screening (Up to 12 Weeks)  
After obtaining informed consent/assent, patients will initially be assessed for 
study eligibility at visit 1.  
Study participants are required to have a conﬁrmed diagnosis of EoE which 
may be established either by a prior historical biopsy or by biopsies performed 
during the screening period.  
All patients meeting clinical and laboratory eligibility criteria will undergo 
endoscopy with biopsies at visit 2 to establish a baseline reference measure . For 
patients without a historical biopsy, the visit 2 biopsies will serve as both 
confirmation of EoE diagnosis and the baseline reference measure . All biopsies 
                                        VV-RIM-00127522-1.0 Approved - 05 Nov 2020 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  performed during this study will be evaluated by pathologists at a central 
pathology laboratory who will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
After confirmation of EoE diagnosis, patients will be given an electronic diary 
(eDiary) to begin recording dysphagia symptoms on a daily basis.  
Randomization  
At the baseline visit (visit 3), patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria 
will enter the 24 -week placebo -controlled, double -blind treatment period and 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dupilumab 300  mg once weekly (QW) or 
placebo administered subcutaneously (SC).  
Placebo -Controlled Double -Blind Treatment Period (24 Weeks)  
The co -primary endpoints will be assessed at week 24, one week after the last 
dose of study drug du ring the double -blind treatment period to inform/confirm 
the final sample size determination for Part B.  
At the end of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24), eligible patients in 
Part A may enter a 28 -week extended active treatment period (Part C) . Patients 
not participating in Part C will enter a 12 -week follow -up period.  
Patients enrolled in Part A will not be eligible to participate in Part B.  
Part B  
Enrollment for Part B will begin immediately after the last patient is enrolled 
in Part A.  
Screeni ng (Up to 12 Weeks)  
The screening procedures for Part B are identical to those described above for 
Part A.  
Randomization  
At the baseline visit (visit 3), patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria 
will enter the 24 -week double -blind treatment perio d and will be randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to dupilumab 300 mg QW, dupilumab 300 mg once every two 
weeks (Q2W), or placebo administered SC.  
Placebo -controlled Double -Blind Treatment Period (24 Weeks)  
Procedures for Part B are identical to those for Part A.  
At the end of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24), eligible patients in 
Part B may enter a 28 -week extended active treatment period (Part C) . Patients 
not participating in Part C will enter a 12 -week follow -up period.  
Part C (28 -Week Extended Active  Treatment Period)  
At the end of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24), eligible patients in 
Part A and Part B may enter a 28 -week extended active treatment period where 
all patients will receive active treatment with dupilumab but only patients in 
Part B will be blinded to treatment regimen in Part C.  
Patients from Part A who are randomized to placebo during the double -blind 
treatment period will receive dupilumab 300 mg QW during Part C . Patients 
from Part A who are randomized to dupilumab 300 mg QW during the 
double -blind treatment period will continue to receive dupilumab 300 mg QW 
during Part C.  
Patients from Part B who are randomized to placebo during the double -blind 
treatment period will be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dupilumab 300 mg QW 
or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W .  
Patients randomized to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W will also receive matching 
placebo administered Q2W alternating with dupilumab doses so the injection 
frequency will match the other group for regimen -blinding purposes . All other 
                                        VV-RIM-00127522-1.0 Approved - 05 Nov 2020 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  patients will remain on the same dupilumab dose regimen to which they are 
randomized during the double -blind treatment period.  
Follow -up Period (12 Weeks)  
All patients will be followed up for an additional 12 weeks after completing 
Part C or, if ineligible for Part  C, immediately following Part A or B.  
Rescue Treatment  
If medically necessary, rescue medications (systemic and/or swallowed topical 
corticosteroids) or emergency esophageal dilation are allowed in study patients 
in Parts A, B and C . An endoscopy with bi opsies will be performed prior to the 
initiation of rescue therapy unless COVID -19 restrictions prohibit this 
procedure. If the endoscopy with biopsies cannot occur due to COVID -19 
restrictions, rescue treatment should not be delayed, and these patients wi ll be 
eligible for Part C . Part C treatment will be initiated per the schedule of events 
and only at an in -clinic visit . Patients receiving rescue therapy may continue to 
receive study drug . They will remain blinded and will be asked to return to the 
clinic for all remaining study treatment visits and participate in all study 
assessments according to the schedule of events . However, they will not 
undergo any scheduled endoscopy/biopsies subsequent to the date of rescue.  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for a patient (excluding the screening period) is 
approximately 64 weeks . This includes participation in the double -blind and 
extended active treatment part, and the follow -up period . For patients not 
entering Part C, the duration of the study is approximately 36 weeks.  
End of Study Definition  The end of study is defined as the last visit of the last patient in the study.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Part A:   Approximately 80 patients (40 per treatment group) . Patients may be 
adults ≥18 years of age or adolescents ≥12 and <18 years of age.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Both co -primary and all secondary endpoints will be assessed at week 24 
and w eek 52 in in adult and adolescent patients with EoE who have 
previously received swallowed topical corticosteroids.  
Procedures and Assessments  Efficacy assessments  include the following:  
• Esophageal endoscopy with biopsies:  Biopsies will be obtained for 
histologic assessments including intraepithelial eosinophil count and 
EoEHSS (EoE Grade Score and EoE Stage Score) . Biopsies will be 
evaluated by pathologists at a central pathology laboratory who will be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  
• For Part A enrolle d patients, EoE -EREFS scoring will only be performed at 
the time of the endoscopies in Part A and Part C by the investigators who 
are performing the endoscopies (prior to biopsies) . For Part B enrolled 
patients, EoE -EREFS scoring will be performed by both the investigators 
who perform the endoscopies in Part B and Part C as well as a centralized 
reading center. The centralized reading will be used for analysis, if available. 
If the centralized reading is not available, the EoE -EREFS performed by the 
investi gator will be used for analysis.  
• For all endoscopies, the investigators will assess minor esophageal features 
including mucosal inflammatory and remodeling features. DSQ will be 
completed daily by patients in the eDiary to assess the frequency and 
severity  of dysphagia.  
• The EoE -IQ, a disease -specific measure of health -related QOL in EoE 
patients, will be completed by patients at specified time points.  
• The EoE Symptom Questionnaire, a questionnaire measuring the frequency 
and severity of symptoms other than dysphagia and swallowing pain, will 
be completed by patients at specified time points.  
• The endolumenal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP) procedure 
to measure esophageal distensibility may be performed during the 
esophagogastroscopy procedures at se lected North American sites in 
approximately 150 adult patients.  
Safety and tolerability  will be assessed by physical examinations, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, and clinical evaluations . 
Patients will be asked to repor t all adverse events (AEs) experienced from the 
time of informed consent until their last study visit.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) :  Serum samples will be collected at specified time 
points for assay of dupilumab concentration.  
Anti -drug antibody (ADA) :  Serum s amples will be collected at specified time 
points for assay of ADA and exploratory analyses.  
Statistical Plan  Sample Size   
Part A:   The planned sample size for Part A is approximately 40 patients in 
each treatment group.  
Part B:   Based on the Part A study results, the planned sample size for Part B 
is approximately 70 patients in each treatment group such that for the 
comparison of each dupilumab dose regimen to placebo:  
• This sample size will yield >99.9% power to detect a treatm ent difference 
of 55.4%  in the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 between placebo 
(5.1% ) and the dupilumab treatment group ( 59.5% ) at a 2 -sided 
significan ce level of 5% using Fisher’s exa ct test.

Clinical Study Protocol   R668 -EE-1774 Amendment 5  
 
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 19 of 113 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • This sample size will provide >99.9% power to detect a treatment 
difference of -12.3 points in the mean change from baseline in the total 
DSQ score to week 24 at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% using a two -
sample t -test, assuming a common stand ard deviation (SD) of 15.0 13.0. 
Therefore, the sample size of  70  patients/arm will provide an overall power 
of >99.9%  (99.9% × 99.9%) for the co -primary endpoints, assuming no 
negative correlation between the two endpoints. In Part B, the same treatment 
effect for the two 300 mg dupilumab dose regimens (ie, QW and Q2W) is 
assumed.  
Efficacy Analysis Sets  
For Part A and Part B, the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the 
study -part-specific full analysis set (FAS) that includes all randomized patients 
in the corresponding study part.  
The efficacy endpoints in Part C (the extended active treatment period) will be 
summarized for all patients who received any extended active treatment study 
drug in that part.  
Safety Analysis Set  
For Part A and Part B, the study -part-specific safety analysis set (SAF) includes 
all randomized patients who received any study drug in the corresponding study 
part; it is based on the treatment received (as treated) . Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety vari ables will be analyzed 
using the SAF.  
For safety analyses of the Part C extended treatment period, only a subset of 
SAF will be included, which is defined as those patients who received at least 
1 dose of Part C study drug.  
Statistical Analysis  
All statis tical analyses will be conducted separately for Part A and Part B.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis (Part A and Part B):  
The co -primary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving a histologic 
response of peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at 
week  24 will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test to 
assess the difference in the proportion of responders in the FAS, adjusting for 
the randomization stratification factors.  
The co -primary endpoint of absolute change from ba seline in the DSQ total 
score at week 24 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model for the FAS with treatment group, randomization stratification factor, 
and relevant baseline measurement as covariates included in the model.  
To accoun t for use of rescue treatment in the primary analysis, for peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf, patients will be 
considered as non -responders after the use of rescue treatment. For absolute 
change from baseline in the DSQ total s core, data will be imputed using 
multiple imputation (MI) for all time points subsequent to the use of rescue 
treatment.  
If a patient has missing value for the  histological response (peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf) at week 24,  the patient will be 
classified as a non -responder at week 24.  
If a patient has missing value for the DSQ total score at week 24, the missing 
data will be imputed by MI based on similar patients who remained in the trial 
with observed values relevant to an alysis. Similarity is based on randomized 
                                        VV-RIM-00127522-1.0 Approved - 05 Nov 2020 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  treatment group, baseline value, stratification factors, and available post -
baseline values.  
Sensitivity analyses will assess alternative methods to impute missing data. For 
the eosinophil responder analysis, sensi tivity methods may include utilizing 
peak eosinophil values from imputations to determine responder status. 
Sensitivity analyses will also include an analysis without setting data 
post-rescue to missing.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis (Part A and Part B):  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the same fashion as the 
co-primary endpoints depending on the type of data, unless otherwise specified.  
For continuous efficacy data that are scheduled to be measured only once 
post-baseline at week 24, mis sing values at week 24 will be imputed with 
patient’s baseline value or the available post -baseline value, whichever is 
worse, ie, a worst observation carried forward (WOCF) approach.  
Subgroup analysis (eg, by age group) will also be performed.  
Secondary E fficacy Analysis (Part C):  
Efficacy endpoints in Part C will be summarized with descriptive statistics by 
treatment received in Part C. Inferential statistics will only be provided as 
needed.  
Multiplicity Considerations:  
Part A and Part B will have separa te and independent 2 -sided alpha level of 
0.05.  
Part A:  Statistical significance of the co -primary endpoints at the 2 -sided 
Type  I error rate of 5% will be required before drawing inferential conclusions 
about any secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Part B:  T he co -primary endpoints will be tested for the comparison of 
dupilumab QW dose regimen to placebo first and if both endpoints are 
statistically significant, the testing will proceed to the co -primary endpoints of 
dupilumab Q2W, or the secondary endpoints o f dupilumab QW, with the exact 
order to be specified in Part B statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety analysis will be based on the SAF. This includes reported 
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) and other safety data (ie, clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, and 12 -lead ECG results). A descriptive summary of 
safety results will be presented by treatment group for each study part.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, inflammatory, allergic/immune -mediated disease of 
the esophagus . The disease is characterized by local eosinophilic inflammation leading to 
symptoms of esophageal dysfunction (Furuta, 2017 ) (Liacouras, 2011 ) (DeBrosse, 2011 ) 
(Falk,  2014 ). Although considered a rare disease, the current prevalence is estimated at 22.7 per 
100,000 worldwide  (Arias, 2016 ) and appears to be on the increase  (Dellon , 2014a ). Eosinophilic 
esophagitis has been reported in all ages; however, most cases are in children and adults younger 
than 50 years (Dellon, 2014a ) (Dellon, 2014b ) (Dellon, 2007 ) (Kapel, 2008 ) (Liacouras, 2011 ) 
(Spergel, 2009 ). Gender differences in EoE have been consistently reported, with males affected 
3 to 4 times more often than females  (Dellon, 2014a ), but there are no gender -related differences 
in the clinical symptoms (Kapel, 2008 ) (Prasad, 2009 ) (Veerappan,  2009 ) (Hruz, 2011 ) 
(Ally, 2015 ). 
The primary clinical manifestations of EoE in both adults and children over 10 years of age are 
dysphagia and food impaction (Lucendo, 2017 ). These symptoms lead to substantially impaired 
quality of life (QOL) (DeBrosse, 2011 ) (Falk, 2014 ) (Straumann, 2008 ) (Straumann, 2003 ). 
Endoscopic findings are related to the inflammation in the esophagus and consist of fixed or 
transient concentric rings, longitudinal furrows, white plaques, reduced mucosal vascularity, 
fragile or crepe -like mucosa, and strictures . Rings  and furrows are the most common, seen in nearly 
half of patients (Singla, 2016 ). 
Growing evidence suggests that a Type 2 cytokine -mediated immune response plays an important 
role in the development of EoE . This is thought to occur by  provoking chronic eosinophil, mast 
cell, T cell, and lymphocyte -induced inflammation via cytokines known to regulate eosinophilic 
accumulation in the esophagus, such as interleukin (IL) -4, IL -5, IL -13, and eotaxin -1, -2, and -3 
(Abonia, 2010 ) (Abonia, 2012 ) (Blanchard, 2006 ) (Blanchard, 2008 ) (Blanchard, 2010 ) 
(Bullock,  2007 ) (Mishra, 2003 ) (Mishra, 2009 `) (Straumann, 2001 ). Th2 cells are a subgroup of 
the T cells that regulate the activity of other immune cells by releasing Type 2 cytokines . IL-13 
has been found to be upregulated in the esophageal epithelium of EoE patients  (Blanchard, 2007 ). 
The induction of eotaxin -3, an eosinophil chemoattractant, is thought to be an important factor in 
EoE pathogenesis (Blanchard, 2006 ) (Blanchard, 2007 ). The 2 most up -regulated genes in 
esophageal biopsies from EoE patients (compared to normal controls) encode eotaxin -3 and 
periostin, another protein induced by Type 2 cytokine s and thought to promote inflammation and 
remodeling (Blanchard, 2006 ) (Blanchard, 2008 ). Furthermore, esophageal biopsies and blood 
samples of patients with active EoE have increased levels of cy tokines and chemokines associated 
with Type 2 inflammation, including IL -4 and IL -13, thymic and stromal lymphopoeitin (TSLP), 
and eotaxin -3 secreted by the typical cells involved in allergic inflammation:  T cells, mast cells, 
basophils, invariant natural  killer T cells (iNKTs), and esophageal epithelial cells . Mutations in 
the eotaxin -3 and TSLP genes, whose functions propagate Type 2 inflammation, have been 
associated with EoE risk  (Cianferoni, 2016 ). 
Impaired barrier funct ion of the esophageal epithelium is thought to play a role in EoE 
pathogenesis . Several genes in the epidermal differentiation complex, known to be down -regulated 
by Type 2 cytokines with resultant barrier dysfunction of the skin, are also down -regulated i n 
primary esophageal epithelial cells in vitro . Furthermore, decreased mRNA expression of the 
epidermal differentiation complex gene filaggrin (FLG), and the esophagus -specific esophagin

 CONFIDENTIAL  (small proline -rich protein 3 [SPRR3]), was observed in esophageal bi opsies from EoE patients 
compared to normal controls (Blanchard, 2010 ). The increased frequency at which FLG null alleles 
were found in EoE patients compared to controls provides further evidence of the barrier 
hypothesis in E oE (Blanchard, 2010 ). It is also known that FLG mRNA expression is directly 
suppressed by IL -4 and IL -13 in keratinocytes  (Howell,  2007 ). The data suggest that Type 2 
cytokines may be driving not only an inflammatory response, but also epithelial barrier 
dysfunction in the esophagus.  
Consistent with the Type 2 -mediated inflammation observed in esophageal tissue, patients with 
EoE have high rates of comorbid allergic diseases which are also associat ed with enhanced IL -4 
and IL -13 signaling, especially food allergies, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis 
(Arora, 2012 ) (Assa’ad, 2008 ) (Liacouras, 2011 ) (Moawad, 2010 ) (Roy-Ghanta, 2008 ) 
(Weinbrand -Goichberg, 2013 ).  
The inflammatory damage to the esophageal epithelium results in symptoms of esophageal 
dysfunction, such as d ysphagia . Chronic inflammation of the esophagus may also lead to 
remodeling, stricture formation, and fibrosis (Hirano, 2014 ). The fibrotic aspect of progressed 
disease is not well understood, and whether or not this can be re versed  with treatment is unknown.  
Current therapeutic approaches include chronic dietary elimination, swallowed topical formulation 
corticosteroids (not approved for the treatment of EoE outside the European Union [EU]), and 
esophageal dilation . Emergency endoscopy for prolonged and/or painful food impaction is 
associated with a risk of severe esophageal injury and does not alter the underlying pathogenesis 
or progression of the disease . Although swallowed topical corticosteroids have been reported in 
clinical trials to induce partial clinical responses and histologic remission, they are not uniformly 
effective and can be associated with fungal infections as well as disease recurrence after 
discontinuation.  
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin  G4 (IgG4) antibody (Ab) that inhibits IL -4 
and IL -13 signaling by specifically binding to the IL -4 receptor alpha (IL -4Rα) subunit shared by 
the IL -4 and IL -13 receptor complexes . Blocking IL -4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL -4 and IL -13 
Type 2 cytokine -induced responses, including the release of pro -inflammatory cytokines, 
chemokines, and IgE . Additionally, preclinical data demonstrate that treatment with dupilumab 
prevents infiltration of eosinophils into tissues . For these reasons, dupilumab was evaluated in 
adult patients with EoE in a phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled 
study (R668 -EE-1324), where it demonstrated substantial improvements in clinical, histologic, 
and endoscopic aspects of the disease . Dupilumab was well toler ated in the study, with safety data 
generally consistent with other dupilumab studies in AD patients and no particular safety signal 
associated with use in the EoE patient population . The results support the phase 3 evaluation of 
dupilumab in EoE.

3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE   
3.1. Hypothesis  
In adult and adolescent patients ≥12 years of age with EoE, treatment with dupilumab will result 
in a statistically significant benefit compared to treatment with placebo, as measured by:  
• Relief of dysphag ia, assessed by change in the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire 
(DSQ) score.  
• Reduction in eosinophilic esophageal infiltration, assessed by change in esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count  
• Improvement in endoscopically identified esophageal mucosal infl ammatory and 
remodeling features, assessed by change in the Eosinophilic Esophagitis -Endoscopic 
Reference Score (EoE -EREFS)

 CONFIDENTIAL  3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
The study is divided into 3 parts:   
• Part A consists of a screening period of up to 12 weeks, followed by a randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, 2 -arm, parallel -group, 24 -week treatment period . 
Patients who complete Part A will either enter Part C or continue to a 12 -week follow -
up period (for patients who do not go on to Part C).  
• Part B c onsists of a screening period of up to 12 weeks, followed by a randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, parallel -group, 24 -week treatment period . 
Patients who complete Part B will either enter Part C or continue to a 12 -week follow -
up period (f or patients who do not go on to Part C) . Enrollment in Part B will begin 
immediately after the last patient has been randomized in Part A.  
• Part C is an extended active treatment period and consists of a 2 -arm, 28 -week 
treatment period . Patients who complet e Part C will continue to a 12 -week follow -up 
period.  
The co -primary endpoints selected for Parts A and B of the study (proportion of patients achieving 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/high power field [hpf] at week 24 and 
change  in DSQ score from baseline to week 24) assess important clinical and histological measures 
of dysphagia symptoms and disease activity and progression . Eosinophilic infiltration of the 
esophageal mucosa is the hallmark of the disease and, in conjunction wi th characteristic clinical 
symptoms of esophageal dysfunction (solid food dysphagia, food impaction), is considered 
pathognomonic for EoE.  
Solid food dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom of EoE and food impaction 
necessitating endoscopic bolus removal occurs in 33% to 54% of adult EoE patients 
(Dellon,  2013 ). The DSQ is a daily patient -reported outcome (PRO) measure that has been 
validated for the measurement of dysphagia frequency and severity in patients with EoE  
(Dellon,  2013 ) (Hudgens, 2017 ). The questions ask whether solid food has been eaten; whether 
food has gone down slowly or become stuck; and what, if any, measures have been taken to achieve 
relief. 
Since the gross appearance of the esophageal mucosa assessed by endoscopy reflects both the 
inflammatory and fibrotic nature of the disease, EoE -EREFS is a key secondary endpoint . The 
EoE-EREFS is a validated classiﬁcation and grading system designed to standardize nomenclature 
for the major endoscopically identiﬁed esophageal features of EoE (edema, rings, exudates, 
furrows, and strictures) (Hirano, 20 13). Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical relevance 
of endoscopic severity assessment in EoE . The severity of each of the EoE -EREFS subscores has 
been shown to be associated with patient -reported global symptom activity (Schoepfer, 2014 ). The 
use of a visual endoscopy score is consistent with the emphasis on endoscopic mucosal healing as 
a primary endpoint of therapeutics in inflammatory bowel disease, peptide ulcer disease and 
GERD (Hirano, 2017 ).

Clinical Study Protocol   R668 -EE-1774 Amendment 5

 CONFIDENTIAL  The study will include adolescents ≥12 years of age . The primary clinical manifestation of EoE in 
children and adolescents ≥10 years of age is dysphagia and food impaction, similar to adult patients 
(Lucendo, 2017 ). In addition, the disease appears to have the same underlying pathophysiology 
regardless of age; similar high rates of atopy as well as a genetic predisposition have been 
demonstrated in both the pediatric and adult populations . A unique genetic signature for EoE has 
been identified that is conserved in all patients with the disease, suggesting the biological 
manifestations of disease are the same across all age groups  (Blanchard, 2006 ). Additional work 
demons trated that a transcriptome of 96 genes in EoE patients was similar between both adults and 
children  (Wen, 2013 ). 
Study treatment will be administered for approximately 24 weeks in the double -blind, placebo -
controlled phase to adequat ely assess the risk/benefit profile of a drug intended for chronic use . In 
the phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study in patients with EoE 
(R668 -EE-1324), a plateau in clinical effect had not been observed by week 12 with a dose of 300 
mg once weekly (QW) . An additional 28  weeks of extended active treatment in Part C for an 
overall exposure of approximately 52 weeks will provide data on the long -term efficacy and safety 
of dupilumab in patients with EoE.  
There are several j ustifications for the inclusion of a placebo control group in this study . Although 
there is an approved swallowed topical steroid treatment for EoE in the EU, it is only indicated for 
short -term use in adults, not for chronic treatment or treatment of pedi atric patients  (EMA Jorveza 
Assessment Report, 2017 ). Furthermore, it is only approved in this region and thus considered 
inappropriate for use in a global study . Studies show that patients with EoE frequently relapse, 
even while maintained on long -term topical steroid therapy  (Eluri, 2017 ). Furthermore, although 
studies have shown that a prolonged delay in the diagnosis and treatment of EoE increases the risk 
of stricture formation in a time -dependent manner, the median delay in EoE diagnosis in these 
studies was 6 years, and duration of follow -up was over 20 years (Schoepfer, 2013 ). It is unlikely 
that a 24 -week period of untreated disease will lead to irreversi ble stricture formation . Hence, 
while allocation to a placebo arm may result in temporary continuation of symptoms, it should not 
impact a patient’s long -term prognosis . In addition, rescue treatment (including swallowed steroids 
and dilation) is allowed f or any patient who experiences intolerable symptoms during the study . 
Finally, study patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the 28 -week extended active 
treatment phase, thus offering some potential for direct benefit, even for patients initially enrolled 
in the placebo treatment arm.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Patients in Part A will receive either 300 mg dupilumab or placebo QW administered 
subcutaneously (SC) . In the phase 2 study R668 -EE-1324, dupilumab 300 mg QW was 
demonstrated t o be efficacious with clinically significant improvements in histologic, endoscopic, 
and patient -reported symptoms after 12  weeks of treatment . Dupilumab was well tolerated with a 
favorable profile with no particular safety signal associated with use in th e EoE patient population .  
Patients in Part B will receive 300 mg dupilumab SC once every two weeks (Q2W), 300 mg 
dupilumab SC QW or placebo SC QW . The 300 mg Q2W was chosen to provide dose -ranging 
information . Based on pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations,  this dose is expected to achieve 
target -saturating concentrations over the dosing interval, and hence provide clinical benefit . The 
approved dose regimen for treatment of AD is 300 mg Q2W . In addition, this dose regimen 
                                        VV-RIM-00127522-1.0 Approved - 05 Nov 2020 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  provided significant benefit in pha se 3 studies of dupilumab for the treatment of adults and 
adolescents with moderate -to-severe asthma, and is currently being tested in adults with nasal 
polyposis . Dosing regimens with inter -dose intervals longer than Q2W have been suboptimal in 
AD and ast hma and are not proposed for this trial, as the end of interval concentrations would be 
expected to be below those required for target saturation, and hence may not yield optimal benefit 
in patients with EoE.  
Both dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W have a well un derstood and favorable safety profile . 
Approximately 2500 AD patients were exposed to dupilumab; 645 AD patients have been exposed 
to 300 mg QW for ≥364 days, and 58 have been exposed to 300 mg Q2W for ≥364 days as of the 
27 April 2016 biologics license ap plication cut -off. In completed/unblinded Phase 2/3 studies of 
dupilumab in asthma patients (as of 30 September 2017), 2649 asthma patients were exposed to 
dupilumab; 1035 of these patients have been exposed to 300 mg Q2W for ≥1 year, 662 have been 
exposed  for ≥1.5 years, and 473 have been exposed for ≥2 years.  
In both the AD and asthma programs, as is typical for monoclonal antibodies, body weight was 
found to be the most significant covariate affecting the PK of dupilumab, with patients of a lower 
body we ight achieving higher concentrations of dupilumab . In the pivotal phase 3 studies in AD 
(R668 -AD-1334, R668 -AD-1416, and R668 -AD-1224), adults with body weights of 41 kg or more 
received dupilumab doses of 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW, which were found to be w ell tolerated 
for 16 to 52 weeks . In Study EFC13579, 33 adolescent patients with asthma (median age of 
14 years with a range of 12 to 17 years; median weight 55 kg) received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W; 
a similar PK profile was observed between adolescent and adult patients with asthma.  
As dupilumab 300 mg QW has not been studied in lighter patients, subjects (adults or adolescents) 
with body weight <40 kg will be excluded from the study.  
3.2.3.  Risk/Benefits of Participating in the Study  
Recognizing that the “Coronav irus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on 
the conduct of clinical trials, the sponsor does not intend to screen any new patients in this study 
unless the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic is deemed manageable and no longer interfering 
with the conduct of trials at individual sites, and patients can safely participate in this study. Until 
then, the sponsor plans to obtain approvals from health authorities/ethics committees to enable 
continuation of study sites for this study, as allowed by local laws and regulations.  
3.2.3.1.  Benefits  
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults with EoE were evaluated in a phase 2, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled study (R668 -EE-1324) . Treatment with weekly dupilumab 
300 mg SC for 12 weeks in patients with EoE reduced the frequency and intensity of dysphagia, 
the cardinal symptom of EoE . Improvement in clinical symptoms was accompanied by endoscopic 
and biopsy histologic evidence of reduced esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil infiltration, 
esophageal mucosal inflammation, and improved esophageal distensibility . Study patients could 
potentially benefit from dupilumab treatment, including patients randomized to receive placebo in 
Parts A and B, as all patients have the opportunity to receive dupilumab in  the extended active 
treatment Part C of the study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.3.2.  Risks  
As of  28 March 2020 , over 8000 subjects have been enrolled into the dupilumab development 
program for the indications of AD, asthma, chromic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp s (CRSwNP) , 
grass allergy,  peanut allergy, bullous pemphigoid, and EoE (Investigator's Brochure Version 14). 
Based upon currently available data, 1 important identified risk, “Systemic Hypersensitivity 
(including those events associated with immunogenicity),” has been established . One serious case 
each of serum sickness and serum sickness -like reaction (both associated with high anti -drug 
antibody [ADA] titers) were reported in adult AD studies, however none were seen in the asthma 
development program . Additionally, there has been o ne report of anaphylaxis considered related 
to study drug by the Investigator in an asthma study.  Based on the review of post -marketing data, 
signals of anaphylactic reaction and angioedema were confirmed and considered as adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs).  
A higher incidence of Injection Site reactions (ISRs) has been observed in the dupilumab -treated 
subjects, consistent with the SC injection of a protein biologic . Most ISRs were mild to moderate 
in intensity, and less than 2% were severe or led to treatment discontinuation . The proportion of 
patients experiencing ISRs diminished over time during the treatment period.  
Conjunctivitis, Conjunctivitis Allergic, Conjunctivitis Bacterial, Blepharitis, Dry Eye, Eye 
Pruritus, Herpes Simplex (primarily mucocutaneous i n nature), and Oral Herpes have been 
identified as adverse drug reactions for the AD indication . There was no increase in incidence of 
these events observed in the completed asthma study. Conjunctivitis was also observed in the 
completed CRSwNP studies but  with lower incidence than in the AD studies and without keratitis 
or increase in other ophthalmic events. Most events were mild in intensity and transient in nature, 
and did not necessitate treatment discontinuation.  Based on the post -marketing safety dat a, events 
of angioedema, arthralgia, keratitis and ulcerative keratitis are now considered as ADRs.  
The purpose of protocol amendment 4 was to account for the COVID -19 pandemic and to 
minimize the risks to the patients in the trial as well as healthcare pr oviders by allowing flexibility 
in the visit schedule while social distancing suggestions are in place. Allowing for this flexibility 
does not increase the risk of participating in this trial as there will be continued contact between 
the patients and stud y personnel despite postponement of in -person clinic visits.  
3.2.3.3.  Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
The safety data available to date across multiple indications in conjunction with the clinical benefit 
of dupilumab demonstrated in the phase 2 EoE study support a favorab le benefit -risk profile for 
dupilumab.

This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adult and adolescent patients 
with EoE . The study will consist of 3 parts and a follow -up period:  Part A and Part B (each 
consisting of a 24 -week double -blind treatment period), Part C (a 28 -week extended active 
treatment period), and a 12 -week follow -up period following the end of the extended active 
treatment period for patients who enter into Part C or following the end of Parts A and B of the 
double -blind tr eatment period for patients who do not enter Part C.  
Approximately 80 patients (40 per treatment group) are planned to be enrolled in Part A . 
Approximately 210 patients (70 per treatment group) are planned to be enrolled in Part B . At least 
10% of patients  enrolled in Part B will be adolescents ≥12 years of age and at least 30% of patients 
enrolled in Part B must have a history of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids . At the end 
of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24) of Part A or Part B, el igible patients may enter Part  C.

Note: If there are restrictions to the clinical study as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, it may 
be necessary to adjust the visit schedule, convert in -person visits to telephone contacts, and 
postpone study procedures until the next available in clinic study visit . It is necessary that the 
randomization visit (V3) and the first visit of Part C (V11) occur in the clinic . Endoscopies with 
biopsies are required at approximately week 24 and week 52 . If it is not possible to complete the 
endoscopies with biopsies due to COVID -19 restrictions and provided there are no specific safety 
concerns for the patient, patients may continue their current study medication regimen until the 
endoscopies with biopsies can be performed. All temporary mecha nisms utilized, and deviations 
from planned study procedures are to be documented as being related to COVID -19 and will 
remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency. Once COVID -19 conditions 
resolve, all study visits and procedures  should follow the schedule of events as specified in Table  1, 
Table  2, and Table  3.

 CONFIDENTIAL  5.1.1.  Part A  
5.1.1.1.  Screening (Up to 12 Weeks)  
After adult patients provide informed consent and adolescent patients and/or their legal 
parents/legal guardians provide informed consent and informed assent (as appropriate), patients 
will be assessed for study eligibility at visit 1 .  
Study participants are required to have a conﬁrmed diagnosis of EoE which may be established 
either by a prior historical biopsy showing ≥15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high -power ﬁeld 
(eos/hpf) from at least one esophageal region after at least 8 weeks of treatment with a high -dose 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) using any approved PPI or by biopsie s performed after approximately 
8 weeks of high -dose PPI treatment initiated prior to screening or during the screening period, 
which demonstrate ≥15 intraepithelial eos/hpf in at least 2 out of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, 
mid, and distal); see Figure  3 for endoscopy/biopsy procedure flow chart . Patients who are on PPIs 
during the screening period and are eligible to enroll in the study must continue  a high -dose PPI 
regimen during the study (see details in Section  7.2). Patients are allowed to switch among the 
approved background therapy options for high -dose PPI use during the study.  
All patients who meet the other clinical and laboratory eligibility criteria will undergo endoscopy 
with biopsies at visit 2 (day -21±7) to establish a baseline reference measure . For patients without 
a historical b iopsy, the visit 2 biopsy will serve as both confirmation of EoE diagnosis and the 
baseline reference measure.  
All biopsies performed during this study will be evaluated by pathologists at a central pathology 
laboratory who will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
Note:  Biopsy specimens from the stomach and/or duodenum will be obtained in all patients 
<18 years of age to rule out alternate etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia . Targeted, stomach, 
and/or duodenal biopsies will be obtained in adults only in the event of abnormal endoscopic 
findings (other than typical EoE findings) or clinical suspicion of alternate etiologies . All 
randomized patients found to have stomach and/or duodenal abnormalities at baseline will have 
follow -up stomach and/or duodena l biopsies at week 24 and week 52.  
After confirmation of EoE diagnosis, patients will be given an electronic diary (eDiary) to record 
dysphagia symptoms on a daily basis during the 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit (visit 3).  
Patients may be re -screened once if they fail the screening evaluation, unless the reason for screen 
failure is related to histologic or clinical disease severity inclusion criteria. The baseline endoscopy 
with biopsy and EoE -EREFS scoring will not be repeated for re -screened patient s. These results 
will continue to be valid baseline data . Re-screening must occur within 6 months of the screen 
failure.  
For patients whose DSQ diary compliance does not meet eligibility requirements within the 21 -day 
interval between Visit 2 and Visit 3 ( at least 11 daily entries during the 14 days immediately 
preceding the planned randomization date), randomization may be postponed as long as the total 
duration of the screening period does not exceed the 85 -day maximum.

At the end of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24), eligible patients in Parts A and B may 
enter an approximately 28 -week extended active t reatment period where all patients will receive 
active treatment with dupilumab but only patients in Part B will be blinded to treatment regimen 
in Part C . The eligibility criteria for Part C are provided in Section  6.2.3 . 
Patients from Part A who are randomized to placebo during the double -blind treatment period will 
receive dupilumab 300 mg QW during Part C . Patients from Part A who are randomized to  
dupilumab 300 mg QW during the double -blind treatment period will continue to receive 
dupilumab 300 mg QW during Part C.  
Patients from Part B who are randomized to placebo during the double -blind treatment period will 
be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dupilumab 300 mg QW or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W . Patients 
randomized to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W will also receive matching placebo alternating with 
dupilumab doses so the injection frequency will be identical for both groups for regimen -blinding 
purposes . All oth er patients will remain on the same dupilumab dose regimen to which they are 
randomized during the double -blind treatment period . Treatment assignment in Part C will be 
managed by an interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) to maintain blinding of  
treatment assignment in Part B.

unreasonable risk for the patient  
2. Patients who, during the double -blind treatment period , were prematurely withdrawn 
because of a protocol violation, poor compliance, or inability to complete required study 
assessments  
3. Patients who became pregnant during the double -blind treatment period  
4. Patients who are prematurely discontinued from study dr ug due to an AE (patients who are 
prematurely discontinued from study drug due to lack of efficacy are eligible to enter 
Part C) 
5. Patients who did not undergo endoscopy with biopsies prior to receiving rescue treatment  
Note: If the endoscopy with biopsies c annot occur due to COVID -19 restrictions, 
rescue treatment should be initiated without delay and these patients will be 
eligible to participate in Part C when the patient can next return to the clinic.  
6. Systemic hypersensitivity to dupilumab or the excipie nts of the drug product based on 
participation in Part A or Part B  
6.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right  to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow s tudy 
procedures) . An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patient who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as  described in Section  8.1.2 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in 
Section  7.4.2 . 
6.4. Replacement of Patient  
Patient prematurely discontinued from study/study drug will not be replaced.

 CONFIDENTIAL  7. STUDY TREATMENTS   
7.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
Dupilumab drug product is supplied for this study in the following concentration:   
• Dupilumab 150 mg/mL:  Each 2.0 mL single -use prefilled glass syringe with snap -off 
cap delivers 300  mg of study drug (2.0 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution)  
Placebo matching dupil umab is prepared in the same formulation without the addition of protein 
(ie, active substance, anti -IL-4Rα monoclonal Ab).  
In the double -blind placebo -controlled Parts A and B, as well as Part C, all patients will receive 
QW SC injections . For the dupilum ab 300 mg SC Q2W group, in order to maintain the blind, there 
will be an SC injection of placebo in between dupilumab doses so the injection frequency will 
match the other 2  groups (dupilumab QW and placebo) (see randomization/treatment assignment 
in Secti on 5.1.1.2  for Part A, Section  5.1.2.2  for Part B, Section  5.1.3  for Part C, and Section  7.5). 
In the extended active treatment Part C, patients wil l receive dupilumab injections at the frequency 
(QW or Q2W with matching placebo alternating with  dupilumab doses so the injection frequency 
will be identical for both groups for regimen -blinding purposes) per their treatment assignment 
(see Section  5.1.3  and Section  7.5). 
Study drug will be ad ministered by SC injections . Subcutaneous injection sites of study drug 
should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist 
areas), upper thighs, and upper arms so that the same site is not injected for 2  consecutive  
administrations.  
Instructions on dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
7.2. Background Treatment  
Patients who undergo a trial of high -dose PPI therapy initiated prior to screening or during the 
screening period of Part A or Part B must remain o n a dosage regimen listed below for the duration 
of the 52 -week treatment period . A high -dose PPI regimen is defined as follows:  
• omeprazole 40 mg once a day (QD) or 20 mg twice a day (BID)  
• esomeprazole 40 mg QD or 20 mg BID  
• lansoprazole 60 mg QD or 30 mg B ID 
• dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD  
• rabeprazole 40 mg QD or 20 mg BID  
• pantoprazole 80 mg QD or 40 mg BID  
Patients who present at the initial screening visit with current use of PPIs must also remain on the 
same or similar approved dosage regimen for the duration  of the 52 -week treatment period . 
Patients may change to a different approved PPI medication during the study . PPI therapy is 
prohibited for all other patients.

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.3. Rescue Treatments  
If medically necessary (eg, for treatment of intolerable EoE symptoms), rescu e medications 
(systemic and/or swallowed topical corticosteroids) or emergency esophageal dilation are allowed 
for study patients in Parts  A, B, and C . An endoscopy with biopsy will be performed prior to the 
initiation of rescue therapy . Patients who under go an endoscopy with biopsy due to the initiation 
of rescue therapy will not undergo the scheduled end of treatment visit endoscopy/biopsy at weeks 
24 and 52 . Patients who receive rescue treatment during the double -blind period of the study will 
not be eli gible for the extended active treatment period unless an endoscopy with biopsy is 
performed prior to the initiation of rescue treatment. However, if the endoscopy with biopsies 
cannot occur due to COVID -19 restrictions, rescue treatment should not be delay ed, and these 
patients will be eligible for Part C. Part C treatment will be initiated per the schedule of events and 
only at an in -clinic visit .  
Patients receiving rescue therapy may continue to receive study drug . They will remain blinded 
and will be as ked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits for the double -blind treatment 
period and the follow -up period, and participate in all assessments for these visits according to the 
schedule of events specified in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3, except for endoscopy/biopsy, as 
noted above . For the purpose of efficacy analyses, patients who receive rescue treatment during 
the study will be considered treatment failures.  
7.4. Dose Modifica tion and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.4.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed .  
7.4.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug during the double -blind treatment period 
will be a sked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits for the double -blind treatment 
period and follow -up period per the visit schedule.  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug during the extended active treatment period 
will be asked to  return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit, per Section  8.1.2 . 
7.4.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction deemed related to study drug  
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin . Patient must be withdrawn for these lat ter 
malignancies if they cannot be adequately treated by local resection.

Clinical Study Protocol   R668 -EE-1774 Amendment 5  
 
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 54 of 113 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • Any infection that is opportunistic, such as TB and other infections whose nature or 
course may suggest an immunocompromised status  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities assessed as relate d to study drug:  
− Neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 103/µL 
− Platelet count ≤50 × 103/µL 
− ALT and/or AST values >3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN, excluding 
confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome  
− Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN (for more than 2 weeks)  
7.4.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing may be temporarily discontinued in the event of:  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section  7.4.2.1 ) where a causal 
relationship to study drug can be reasonably excluded, (ie, an alternative cause is 
evident):  study drug will be discontinued but may be resumed when the laboratory 
abnormality is sufficiently normalized . At minimum, the laborat ory value(s) must 
return to a level that no longer meets the specified criteria for discontinuation, as 
defined in Section  7.4.2.1 . A decision to re sume study treatment will be made jointly 
by the investigator and medical monitor (medical monitor’s written approval is 
required).  
• An infection that requires parenteral treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, 
antiparasitic, or antiprotozoal agen ts, or requires oral treatment with such agents for 
longer than 2 weeks  
• Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery which could, in the opinion of the 
investigator, present an unreasonable risk to the patient as a result of his/her continued 
participatio n in the study  
After the condition leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study treatment may 
resume at the discretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor.  
A decision to temporarily discontinue study dru g and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be 
discussed with the medical monitor . The investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, 
even without consultation with the medical monitor if the urgency of the situation requires 
immediate action and  if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest . However, the medical 
monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of study drug discontinuation . 
Resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation requires consultation  and 
agreement between the investigator and the medical monitor.

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
In Part A, approximately 80 patients (40 per group) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
dupilumab 300 mg QW or placebo according to a central randomization scheme provided by an 
IVRS/IWRS to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee) . 
In Part B, approximately 210 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 
300 mg QW, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W,  or placebo (approximately 70 patients per group) according 
to a central randomization scheme provided by IVRS/IWRS to the designated study pharmacist 
(or qualified designee).  
Randomization for both Part A and Part B will be stratified according to age at the time of the 
screening visit (≥12 to <18 years of age vs. ≥18 years of age) and use of PPI at randomization (yes 
vs. no).  
For patients entering Part C from Part B, those who are randomized to placebo during Part B will 
be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio t o receive dupilumab 300 mg QW or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
(with matching placebo alternating with dupilumab doses so the injection frequency will be 
identical for both groups for regimen -blinding purposes) in Part C, and those who are randomized 
to one of the dupilumab dose regimens in Part  B will remain on the same dupilumab dose regimen 
in Part C . Patients who received 300 mg Q2W in Part B will also continue with matching placebo 
alternating with dupilumab doses so the injection frequency will be identical fo r both groups for 
regimen -blinding purposes . Treatment assignment in Part C for all patients from Part B, regardless 
of their previously assigned treatment in Part B, will be managed by IVRS/IWRS to maintain 
blinding.  
7.5.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study . The blinded Regeneron Medical/Study Director, 
Study Monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research organization (CRO) perso nnel who 
are in regular contact with the study site will remain blinded to all patient randomization 
assignments.  
All study personnel will be blinded to data during each study part until the respective database 
lock. Part A will be unblinded while Part B i s ongoing.  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used . In order to 
maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to 
individuals involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody , drug concentration results, and any post -treatment tissue eosinophil counts 
and histologic results, and biomarker results (eotaxin -3, thymus and activation -regulated 
chemokine [TARC], total IgE and allergen -specific IgEs) will not be communicated to the sites, 
and the sponsor’s blinded operational team will not have access to results associated with patient 
identification until after the database is locked for the respective study part .

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.5.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient  may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg, pregnancy).  
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
− Only the affected patients will be unblinded.  
− The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator . If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the patient.  
− The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the patient.  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency . In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
7.5.3.  Unblinding for Regulatory Reporting Purposes  
Treatment assignments for certain patients may be unblinded to Pharmacovigilance personnel for 
the purpose of regulatory reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) 
to health authorities in accordance with local regulations.  
7.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
7.6.1.  Packaging, Lab eling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used to label blinded investigational study drug . Lists 
linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups (or 
companies) responsible for study drug packaging . In or der to maintain the blind, these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
7.6.2.  Supply and Disposit ion of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study . At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site clos e-out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by the site monitor, all opened and unopened study drug will be returned to the sponsor or designee 
for destruction, unless it’s specified that the site may perform their own destruction.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.1.  Foot notes for the Schedule of Events Tables  
8.1.1.1.  Footnotes for Table 1  
1. For patients without a satisfactory prior endoscopy/biopsy (eg, histological criteria were 
not met, or the biopsy was not performed while patient was on at least 8  weeks of high -dose 
PPI treatme nt), the screening period will be extended for up to 12  weeks (day  -85) to allow 
for at least 8 weeks of high -dose PPI treatment prior to the screening endoscopy/biopsies . 
For all other patients, the screening period will be shorter, with sufficient time t o allow 
screening assessments and laboratory test results to be available prior to the baseline 
endoscopy/biopsies.  
2. The endoscopy/EoE -EREFS /biopsy procedures should be performed after all other 
efficacy and safety assessments.  
a. The baseline endoscopy with b iopsies should be performed at approximately 
day -21±7  days to allow for availability of the intraepithelial eosinophil count result 
from the central pathology laboratory prior to day  1. For patients without a 
satisfactory prior historical endoscopy/biopsy , the baseline endoscopy/biopsies must 
be performed after at least 8 weeks of high -dose PPI . Patients may be randomized as 
soon as their endoscopy/biopsy results are available and DSQ eDiary entries are 
completed.  
Note:  Biopsy specimens from the stomach a nd/or duodenum will be obtained in all 
patients <18 years of age to rule out alternate etiologies . Stomach and/or duodenal 
biopsies will be obtained in adults only in the event of abnormal endoscopic findings 
(other than typical EoE findings) or clinical suspicion of alternate etiologies.  
b. For patients who receive rescue treatment during the double -blind treatment period, 
the endoscopy/EoE -EREFS /biopsy procedures will be performed prior to the 
initiation of rescue treatment . Patients undergoing endoscopy/bi opsy prior to rescue 
will not undergo the scheduled endoscopy/biopsy at week 24  
Note:  All randomized patients found to have stomach and/or duodenal abnormalities 
at baseline will have follow -up stomach and/or duodenal biopsies at week 24 and 
week 52.  
c. The EndoFLIP procedure to measure esophageal distensibility may be performed 
during the esophagogastroscopy procedures at selected North American sites in 
approximately 150 adult patients.  
3. Assessments indicated for this week 24 (end of treatment) visit should be performed for all 
patients in Parts A and B . For patients who will enter Part C, there are additional events 
listed in week 24 visit in Table  2 for P art C.  
4. Patients may be re -screened once if they fail the screening evaluation, unless the reason for 
screen failure is related to histologic or clinical disease severity inclusion criteria. The 
baseline endoscopy with biopsy and EoE -EREFS scoring will not be repeated for re -
screened patients . These results will continue to be valid baseline data . Re-screening must 
occur within 6 months of the screen failure.

at home should be administered 1 week after the prior dose of study drug . Study drug 
administration that occurs in clinic should occur per the Schedule of Events in Table  1 and 
Table  2. Patients will be closely monitored at the study site at visits 3 to 6 for a minimum 
of 30  minutes after the administration of study drug . In addition to the predose assessments, 
AEs and vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate) will 
be assessed at 30  minutes  (±10  minutes) post -dose.  
a. If COVID -19 restrictions  limit the availability of staff or the patient to have in -clinic 
visits, after visit 3/day 1 patients/caregivers may be dispensed study drug for at -home 
dosing . Additionally, if the visit 11/week 24 endoscopy with biopsies is delayed due 
to COVID -19 restr ictions, extended blinded dosing of study drug is allowed until this 
visit can occur . If extended dosing of the study drug occurs beyond week 23, the

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.2. Study Procedures  
8.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determini ng study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population:  serum follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) (for 
confirmation of menopausal status) and serology tests (HIV Ab, HBsAg, HBcAb, HCV Ab, and 
TB). Tuberculosis testing will be performed on a country -by-country basis according to local 
guidelines if required by regulatory authorities or ECs . 
8.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
8.2.2.1.  Endoscopy with EoE-EREFS  and Biopsies, and Photographs  
During the endoscopy procedure, EoE -EREFS and biopsies will be performed in the  listed order . 
Training will be provided to study sites on performing this procedure . All biopsies performed 
during this study will be evaluated by a qualified central histology laboratory . Photographs and/or 
video may be taken as part of the endoscopic pr ocedure and biopsy collection. For Part B enrolled 
patients, video imaging should be collected for EoE -EREFS analysis and scoring by a centralized 
reading center.  
The endoscopy/EoE -EREFS/biopsy procedure will be performed per the Schedule of Events in 
Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3. 
EoE-EREFS  
The EoE esophageal characteristics will be analyzed based on the EoE -EREFS, a validated scoring 
system for inflammatory and remodeling features of disease using  both overall scores and scores 
for each individual characteristic  (Hirano, 2013 ). The proximal and distal esophageal regions will 
be scored separately; the score for each region ranges from 0 to 9 and the overall score ranges  from 
0 to 18 . The major esophageal features include:   
• Edema (absent, present)  
• Rings (absent, mild, moderate, severe)  
• Exudates (absent, mild, severe)  
• Furrows (absent, mild, severe)  
• Stricture (absent, present)  
EoE-EREFS should be completed by the investiga tor before biopsies for all patients are performed. 
For Part B enrolled patients, EoE -EREFS will be performed by both the investigators who perform 
the endoscopies as well as a centralized reading center who will provide EoE -EREFS analysis and 
scoring from  endoscopy imaging. The centralized reading will be used for analysis, if available. If 
the centralized reading is not available, the EoE -EREFS performed by the investigator will be used 
for analysis. A copy of the EoE -EREFS is provided in the study regula tory binders.

 CONFIDENTIAL  In addition to the major features above, data for the following minor features will also be captured 
by the physician performing the endoscopy procedure:  
• Crepe paper esophagus (mucosal fragility or laceration upon passage of diagnostic 
endosc ope): absent, present  
• Narrow caliber esophagus (reduced luminal diameter of the majority of the tubular 
esophagus): absent, present  
• Stricture diameter  
Mucosal changes associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease will also be recorded using the 
Los Angeles classification system for erosions (No Erosions or Grade A, B, C, or D).  
Biopsies  
Biopsies will be obtained by endoscopy at the second screening visit (visit 2, day -21 ± 7), week  24 
and week 52 visits, and immediately prior to start of rescue medi cation or procedures during the 
double -blind treatment period . The screening endoscopy should be performed at a time during the 
screening period that will allow results to be available prior to day -1 for assessment of eligibility . 
A total of 9  mucosal pin ch biopsies will be collected at each time point from 3 esophageal regions:  
3 proximal, 3  mid, and 3  distal . Two samples from each region will be used for the histology 
(needed for study inclusion criteria, as well as endpoint assessment) and other tissue  analyses (may 
include but not limited, to immunohistochemistry [IHC], RNA scope (in situ hybridization), and 
RNA sequencing) . To participate in the study, patients must have a peak intraepithelial eosinophil 
count ≥15 eos/hpf (400×) in at least 2 of the 3  esophageal regions sampled . Any remaining tissue 
blocks will be banked for exploratory research . The third sample from each region will be 
processed for RNA analyses .  
In addition, biopsy specimens from the stomach and/or duodenum will be obtained at visi t 2 in all 
patients <18  years of age to rule out alternate etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia . Targeted, 
stomach and/or duodenal biopsies will be obtained in adults only in the event of abnormal 
endoscopic findings (other than typical EoE findings) or c linical suspicion of alternate etiologies . 
Gastric biopsy samples should include 2 samples from the antrum and 2 samples from the body . 
Duodenal biopsy samples should include 2 bulb samples and 2 from another portion of the 
duodenum . All randomized patients found to have stomach and/or duodenal abnormalities at 
baseline will have follow -up stomach and/or duodenal biopsies at week 24 and week 52.  
Biopsy samples will be sent to a central pathology laboratory for processing and analysis . If 
required by the investigator institution, biopsy samples will be processed and analyzed by the local 
laboratory, and the processed specimen will be sent to the central pathology laboratory for central 
reading . These samples will be assessed for peak eos per hpf and Eo E Grade Scores and Stage 
Scores will be assigned . EoE Grade and Stage Scores evaluate eight features: eosinophil density, 
basal zone hyperplasia, eosinophil abscesses, eosinophil surface layering, dilated intercellular 
spaces, surface epithelial alteration , dyskeratotic epithelial cells, and lamina propria fibrosis 
(absent/present). Additional analyses on these data may also be performed.  
Assessment of lamina propria fibrosis may not be possible if the esophageal biopsy specimens do 
not contain adequate amo unts of subepithelium lamina propria and then will not be included in the 
overall EoE Grade and Stage Scores. Severity (grade) and extent (stage) of abnormalities will be

procedure will be performed the same way at all scheduled visits.  
Histology results will be interpreted by a pathologist at a central pathology reading center who will 
be blinded to the treatment assignment . Detailed instructions for biopsy sample collec tion and 
handling will be provided in the study regulatory binders.  
EndoFLIP  
A substudy of esopohageal distensibility utilizing the endolumenal functional lumen imaging 
probe (EndoFLIP, Medtronic, USA) may also be performed at selected North American sites  in 
approximately 150 adult patients, with measurements taken as part of the esophagogastroscopy 
procedure performed at screening, week 24 and week 52. The EndoFLIP procedure must be 
performed before biopsies are collected. Procedural order should be: EREF S/imaging, EndoFLIP, 
then biopsies . The EndoFLIP device is a catheter -based procedure that measures the cross -
sectional area at multiple sites along the esophagus with simultaneous intraluminal pressure 
recordings during volumetric distension of the esopha gus. The analyses of cross sectional area 
versus pressure relationships of the esophagus allow for determination of esophageal compliance 
as well as the distensibility plateau. The distensibility plateau has been shown to be significantly 
reduced in adult patients with EoE compared to healthy controls ( Kwiatek, 2011 ). Moreover, the 
esophageal distensibility has been associated with outcomes of both food impaction and need for 
esophageal dilation ( Nicodème, 2013 ). De tails of the EndoFLIP procedure will be provided in the 
study regulatory binders.  
Photographs and/or Video  
Photographs and/or video may be taken by the site as part of the endoscopic procedure and biopsy 
collection . A copy of these photographs and/or video  will be requested from the study sites . Details 
for collecting and sending these photographs and/or video will be provided in the study regulatory 
binders. For Part B enrolled patients, video imaging should be collected for EoE -EREFS analysis 
and scoring by a centralized reading center.  
8.2.2.2.  Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) - Patient -reported Outcome (PRO)  
The DSQ is a validated PRO that has been used in clinical studies to measure the frequency and 
intensity of dysphagia ( Hudgens, 2017 ). For patients  who respond “No” to Question 1 (“Since you 
woke up this morning, did you eat solid food?”), a modification was made to the DSQ by asking 
a follow -up question to probe if patients avoided solid food due to their problems with swallowing 
solid food . This mo dified DSQ will be completed by the patient daily using an eDiary from 
screening through end of study or ET visit . A copy of the DSQ is provided in the study regulatory 
binders.  
The DSQ uses a daily recall period and comprises 3 questions on the presence a nd severity of EoE 
dysphagia . All patients respond to questions 1 and 2 and are required to have eaten solid foods 
(‘Yes’ to question 1: “Since you woke up this morning, did you eat solid food?”) in order to 
proceed with the questionnaire . If a patient ans wers “No” to question 1, the remaining items on 
the DSQ are not scored . Patients who respond “No” to question 2 (“Since you woke up this 
morning, has food gone down slowly or been stuck in your throat?”) are given a score of zero, and 
do not go on to answe r question 3 (the diary is recorded as completed for that day) . Those who

 CONFIDENTIAL  respond ‘Yes’ to questions 1 and 2 move on to question 3, which is scored on a 5 -point scale that 
infers severity of dysphagia based on the patient’s action to alleviate symptoms, ra nging from no 
action to seeking medical attention . The DSQ scoring algorithm is therefore constructed from the 
responses to questions 2 and 3, to ensure that the final score is driven by the frequency and severity 
of dysphagia . To calculate the DSQ score, a minimum of 8  diary entries is required for each 14 -day 
period to derive a standardized total score based on the cumulative scores through 14 days . DSQ 
scores can theoretically range from 0 to 84, with a lower score indicating less -frequent or less -
severe  dysphagia.  
Although Question 4 related to pain was included in the DSQ, it is considered as a standalone item 
for exploratory analysis.  
8.2.2.3.  EoE Impact Questionnaire (EoE -IQ) 
The EoE -IQ is a disease -specific measure of health -related QOL in EoE patients deve loped by the 
sponsor . The EoE -IQ measures EoE impact on emotional, social, work and school, and sleep

[RQLQ(S)+12]  
Standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire for ages 12+ [RQLQ(S)+12] is a 
self-administered questionnaire to measure health -related QOL in those 12 years of age and above, 
as a result o f perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis . There are 28 items on the RQLQ(S) in 
7 domains:  activity limitation, sleep problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, non -nasal/eye 
symptoms, practical problems, and emotional function . The RQLQ(S)+12 responses are based on 
a 7-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled) . The 
overall RQLQ(S)+12 score is the mean of all 28 responses and the individual domain scores are 
the means of the items in those domains . Higher scores  indicated more health -related QOL 
impairment (lower scores were better) . A change of 0.5 point or more in total score is considered 
to be clinically meaningful.  
The RQLQ(S)+12 will be performed per the Schedule of Events in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3.

asthma control . The ACQ -5 score is the mean of the scores of the 5 items and ranges from 0 (totally 
controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled) . Scores less than 1.0 reflect adequately controlled asthma, 
and scores 1.0 or greater reflect inadequately controlled asthma . Highe r score indicates lower 
asthma control . The recommended change of 0.50 is a reasonable threshold to define a meaningful 
individual -level change . The ACQ -5 will be administered only to patients with a documented 
history of asthma and who fluently speak a la nguage in which the questionnaire is presented (based 
on availability of validated translations in participating countries) . The ACQ -5 will be completed

IgG4s will be collected at time points according to Table  1 and Table  2. The biomarkers studied 
are believed to be relevant to the pathophysiology of EoE, response to treatment (ie, assessment 
of type 2 inflammation) and baseline predictor s of response and dupilumab mechanism of action.  
8.2.6.1.  EoE Diagnostic Panel and Type 2 Inflammation Transcriptomics  
The differential gene expression profiles of esophageal biopsies of EoE patients compared to 
healthy controls is the EoE disease transcriptome ( Sherrill, 2014 ). This disease gene expression 
signature was further refined to a smaller gene set to be used as an EoE diagnostic panel (EDP) 
(Dellon, 2017 ). A gene signature representing type 2 inflammation  has been curated from the 
literature, preclinical experiments performed at Regeneron, and dupilumab response signatures 
from atopic dermatitis and a phase 2 study of EoE (Regeneron unpublished data). The gene lists 
comprising the EDP and type 2 transcript omes can be found in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP).

 CONFIDENTIAL  In a phase 2 study of EoE (R668 -EE-1324), dupilumab significantly decreased the disease, EDP, 
and type 2 transcriptome signatures (Regeneron unpublished data).  
Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) ref lects the degree to which the activity level of a set of 
transcripts is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked list of transcripts 
within a sample and is normalized by accounting for the number of transcripts in the set 
(Subramanian, 2005 ) (Barbie, 2009 ). NES scores will be calculated for each transcriptome 
signature for each sample for statistical analyses, collected as part of procedures in Table  1, 
Table  2, and Table  3. 
8.2.6.2.  Type 2 Inflammatory and Disease -Related Circulating Biomarkers  
Eotaxin -3, Thymus and Activation Regulated Chemokine (TARC), and IgE (total and specific) are 
measures of type 2 inflammation, and are known pharmacodynamic markers for dupilumab in AD, 
asthma, and nasal polyposis.  
8.2.6.2.1.  Eotaxin -3 
Eotaxin -3 (also known as CCL26), an eosinophil chemokine, is up -regulated in esophageal mucosa 
of EoE patients relative to controls (Blanchard, 2006 ), and variants in the gene have been 
associated with disease risk . Eotaxin -3 mRNA expression in skin is down -regulated by dupilumab 
in AD (Hamilton, 2014 ). Circulating concentrations have been shown to decrease in asthm a and 
nasal polyposis patients treat ed with dupilumab . Eotaxin -3 will be measured in heparinized plasma 
from samples collected at time points indicated in Table  1 and Table  2. Modulation of eotaxin -3 
is an exploratory measure . Data analysis will be described in the SAP and the results will be 
provided i n the clinical study report (CSR).  
8.2.6.2.2.  Thymus and Activation Regulated Chemokine (TARC)  
TARC is a type 2 chemokine for Th2 cells and other inflammatory cells expressing the CCR4 
receptor . TARC expression is regulated by IL4 and IL13, and rapidly decreases upo n dupilumab 
treatment in AD, asthma, and nasal polyps . Serum TARC will be measured at time points indicated 
in Table  1 and Table  2. Modulation of TARC is an exploratory measure . Data analysis will be 
described in the SAP and the results will be provided in the CSR.  
8.2.6.2.3.  Total an d Allergen -Specific IgEs  
IL4 and IL13 regulate B cell class switching to, as well as production of, IgE . Dupilumab has been 
shown to suppress IgE (total and allergen -specific) in AD, asthma, and nasal polyposis patients . 
Serum concentrations of IgE (total and a panel of allergen -specific) will be measured at time points 
indicated in Table  1. Modulation of IgE is an exploratory measure . Data analysis will be described 
in the SAP and the results will be provided in the CSR.  
8.2.6.2.4.  Allergen -Specific IgG4s  
Allergen -specific IgG4s have been found to be elevated in esophageal tissue and in circulation of 
EoE patients . Because the factors driving histological abnormalit ies and symptoms are unclear, 
IgG4 has been proposed as a pathological driver in the disease (Clayton, 2014 ) (Wright, 2016 ). To 
evaluate the potential role of IgG4 in EoE pathogenesis, as well as  whether or not dupilumab

collected at times indicated in Table  1 and Table  2. Modulation of allergen -specific IgG4s is an 
exploratory measure . Data analysis will be described in the SAP and results will be provided in 
the CSR.  
8.2.7.  Future Biomedical Research  (FBR) Serum/Plasma (Optional)  
Patients/parents or legal guardians who agree to participate in the future biomedical research 
(FBR) substudy will be required to consent to this optional substudy before FBR samples are 
collected and banked in long -term stor age. The unused biomarker samples for study -related 
research, as well as unused PK and ADA samples, will be stored for up to 15 years after the final 
date of the database lock. The FBR samples may be utilized for future biomedical research of EoE 
and related diseases, and the effects of dupilumab on target pathway modulation . Additional 
samples will be collected for future biomedical research according to Schedule of Events in 
Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3. After 15 years, any residual samples will be destroyed . The results 
of these future biomedical research analyses will not be presented in the CSR. Patients are not 
required to participate in  the FBR substudy in order to enroll in the primary study.  
8.2.7.1.  Genomics Substudy (Optional)  
Patients/parent or legal guardians who agree to participate in the genomics substudy will be 
required to consent to this optional substudy before collection of the samp les. Patients are not 
required to participate in the genomics substudy in order to enroll in the primary study.  
Whole blood samples for DNA extraction should be collected on day 1/baseline (predose), but can 
be collected at a later study visit . Whole blood  samples for RNA extraction will be collected at 
time points according to Table  1. 
DNA and blood RNA samples will be collected for the pharmacogenomics  analyses to understand 
the genetic determinants of efficacy and safety associated with the treatments in this study, and the 
molecular basis of EoE and related diseases . These samples will be single -coded as defined by the 
International Council on Harmoni sation (ICH) guideline E15 . Samples will be stored for up to 
15 years after the final date of the database lock.  
The purpose of the pharmacogenomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical or 
biomarker response to dupilumab, other EoE cl inical outcome measures, and possible AEs . In 
addition, associations between genomic variants and prognosis or progression of EoE as well as 
related allergic/atopic diseases may also be studied . These data may be used or combined with data 
collected from o ther studies to identify and validate genomic markers related to the study drug or 
EoE and related diseases.  
Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions . Other me thods, including whole -exome 
sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, DNA copy number variation, and transcriptome 
sequencing (or other methods for quantitating RNA expression) may also be performed . The list 
of methods may be expanded to include novel methodo logy that may be developed during the 
course of this study or sample storage period . Results from the genomic analyses will not be 
reported in the CSR.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING  
9.1. Obligations of Investigator  
The investigator must promptly  report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/EC all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to patients/subjects, according to local regulations . This 
may include death from any cause and all SAEs related to the use of the study drug . It is 
recommended t hat all SAEs be reported to the IRB/EC, according to local regulations.  
9.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (SUSAR), to the health 
authorities, ECs/IRBs as appropriate, and to the investigators (in a b linded manner).  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Reference Safety Information section of the 
Investigator’s Brochure will be considered as unexpected . Any worsening of or new onset of 
symptoms related to EoE during the screening period prior to study drug administration will be 
considered expected.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the CSR to health authorities and ECs/IRBs as appropriate.  
9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Advers e Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug . Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), sy mptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing co ndition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event . This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might  have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours . Prolongation of existi ng hospitalization 
is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event,

or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or ho spitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events . See Section  9.4 for more 
information on recording and reporting SAEs.  
9.3.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate . Such an event might warrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it . Depending on the nature of the 
event, rapid communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be 
warranted (Section  9.4.3 ). 
9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of study . Refer to the study regulatory binders for the procedures to be 
followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.6 . Laboratory, vita l signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Section  9.4.5 . 
9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of c ausal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours . Refer to the study regulatory binders for the procedure to 
be followed.

 CONFIDENTIAL  In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
• SAE with  an onset within 30 days of the end of study or within 84 days (12 weeks) of 
last study drug administration if the patient early terminated from the study – the SAE 
will be reported to the sponsor . The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
• SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study or ET visit – only 
fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs will be 
reported  to the sponsor . The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up 
information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following ev ents also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic wi ndow, if 
associated with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female study patient , during the study or within 
12 weeks of the last dose of study drug . Any complication of pregnancy affecting 
a female study patient and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must 
be reported as an SAE . Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the 
sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:  All AESI, serious and non -serious, must be reported within 
24 hours of identification using the same reporting process as for SAE reporting, 
per Section  9.4.2 . Adverse events of special interest for this study include the

9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
Medical/Study Director within 30 days.  
Refer to the study regulatory binde rs for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.5.  Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• The test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, sig nificant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact the Medical/Study Director in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding 
should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeatin g an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assesse d according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be followed up until the event is resolved or considered 
chronic and/or stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level . It 
may be an annoyance . Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may 
be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:   Produces some  impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health . It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment . Treatment for symptom may be needed.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the subject’s hea lth. Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of ISRs will b e graded according to the following scale (semi -colon indicates “or” 
within description of grade):  
Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of erythema or 
induration that does not interfere with activity  
Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or interferes 
with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or induration or induration 
that interferes with activity  
Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narco tic pain reliever or that prevents daily activity; 
significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily activity; requires ER 
visit or hospitalization; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis  
9.5.2.  Evaluation of Causality  
Relationship of Adve rse Events to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the blinded investigator, and will be a 
clinical decision based on all available information . The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study drug?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the study drug.  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been cau sed by the study 
drug.  
The investigator should justify the causality assessment of each SAE.  
A list of factors to consider when assessing the relationship of AEs to study drug is provided below . 
Please note that t his list is not exhaustive.  
Is there a reas onable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?  
No: 
• Due to external causes such as environmental factors or other treatment(s) being 
administered  
• Due to the patient’s disease state or clinical condition  
• Do not follow a reasonable temporal sequence following the time of administration of 
the dose of study drug  
• Do not reappear or worsen when dosing with study drug is resumed

The relationship of AEs to study procedure (eg, endoscopy or biopsy) will be assessed by the 
investigator, and will be a clinical decision based on all available information . The following 
question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the procedure?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the procedure.  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the 
procedure.  
The sponsor will request information to justify the causality assessment of SAEs, as needed.  
9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the req uirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion . The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites . The Medical/Study  Director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management (PVRM); Biostatistics and Data Management) . Safety 
monitoring will be performe d on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
In addition, the DMC will conduct safety reviews for all dupilumab studies (see details in 
Section  5.3.1 ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigati onal drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the reference 
safety information in the Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal 
relationship to the study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the SAPs for the study . The part -specific SAP(s) may be revised 
during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes 
to adapt to unexpected issues in study  execution and data that may affect the planned analyses . 
The final SAP(s) will be issued before the database is locked for respective part.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
Results from different parts of this study will be summarized and/or analyzed separately unless 
otherwise specified.  
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
For comparisons of each of the 2 d upilumab treatment groups to  placebo,  the fol lowing hypotheses 
of the co-primary endpoint s will be tested, where pd is the true proportion of patients achieving 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6  eos/hpf at week 24 and μ d is the true mean 
change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 in each of the dupilumab group ; and p p 
and μp are the corresponding true values in the placebo group.  
• Null hypothesis (H 0):  p p = p d or μp = μ d, ie, the proportion of patients achievi ng peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf at week  24 OR the mean 
change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 is the same between the 
dupilumab group and the placebo group.  
• Alternative hypothesis (H 1):  p p ≠ pd and μp ≠ μd, ie, the proportion of patients 
achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 
AND  the mean change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 is different 
between the dupilumab group and the placebo group.  
10.2. Justifi cation of Sample Size  
The assumptions used in sample size calculations for Part A are based on results from a phase 2 
study of dupilumab (R668 -EE-1324) and reported data of a phase 2 study of budesonide 
(Dellon,  2017 ) in patients  with EoE as follows:  
• In the study of dupilumab, a treatment difference of 65.2% was observed in the 
proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 
≤6 eos/hpf after 12 weeks of treatment (placebo 0% vs. dupilumab 65.2% ). DSQ was 
not assessed in this study . The overall dropout rate was 8.5% during the 12 -week 
treatment period.

 CONFIDENTIAL  • In the study of budesonide oral suspension, a treatment difference of 36% was observed 
in the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal int raepithelial eosinophil count 
of ≤6 eos/hpf after 12 weeks of treatment (placebo 3% vs. budesonide 39%) . The mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) of change from baseline in DSQ total score at week 12 
was -7.5 (10.7) in placebo and -14.3 (13.0) in the budesonide group, corresponding to 
a treatment group difference of -6.8. The overall dropout rate was 6.5% during the 
12-week treatment period.  
With the consideration that a higher dropout rate may be observed for a longer treatment period, a 
dropout rate of 15% is a ssumed for all sample size calculations provided below.  
Part A  
The planned sample size for Part A is approximately 40 patients in each treatment group such that 
for the comparison of each dupilumab dose regimen to placebo:  
• This sample size will yield >99% power to detect a treatment difference of 62% in the 
proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 
≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 (placebo 3% vs. dupilumab 65%) at a 2 -sided significance level 
of 5% using Fisher’s exact test .  
• With respect to the treatment group difference in the mean change from baseline in 
DSQ total score, assuming a common SD of 13.0, this sample size is expected to 
generate a 95% confidence interval whose half -width is 5.7 . If the true treatment 
difference is -9.0 points, the statistical power for the co -primary endpoint of DSQ will 
be 80% using a two -sample t -test. 
Part B  
The study includes two double -blind placebo -controlled randomized parts: Part A and Part B . An 
objective  of Part A was to evaluate the Part B sample size. Part A database lock occurred on 
20 May 2020 and the study results for the co -primary endpoints from Part A are below:  
• The proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count 
of ≤6  eos/hpf at 24 weeks was 5.1% in placebo group and 59.5% in dupilumab 300mg 
QW group with a treatment difference of 55.4%  
• The mean (standard deviation [SD]) of change from baseline in DSQ total score at week 
24 was -9.6 (15.2) in placebo and -21.9 (14 .6) in the dupilumab 300mg QW group with 
a treatment group difference of -12.3.  
Based on the Part A study results, the planned sample size for Part B is approximately 70 patients 
in each treatment group such that for the comparison of each dupilumab dose regimen to placebo:  
• This sample size will yield >99.9% power to detect a treatment difference of 55.4% in 
the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 
≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 between placebo (5.1% ) and each dupilu mab treatment group 
(59.5%) at a 2 -sided significan ce level of 5% using Fisher’s exact test.  
• This sample size will provide >99.9% power to detect a treatment difference of -12.3 
points in the mean change from baseline in the total DSQ score to week 24 at a 2-sided 
significance level of 5% using a two -sample t -test, assuming a common SD of 15.0.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Therefore, the sample size of 70  patients/arm will provide an overall power of >99.9% (99.9% × 
99.9%) for the co -primary endpoints, assuming no negative correlatio n between the two endpoints. 
In Part B, the same treatment effect for the two 300 mg dupilumab dose regimens (ie, QW and 
Q2W) is assumed.  
Sample size calculations were made using nQuery Advisor 7.0.  
10.3. Analysis Sets  
10.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
Part A and Part B  
For Part A and Part B, the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the study part -specific full 
analysis set (FAS) that includes all randomized patients in the corresponding study part . Efficacy 
analyses for these 2 parts will be based on the treatment al located by the randomization and carried 
out separately for each part . Analysis on the FAS will be considered to be primary.  
The study -part specific per protocol set (PPS) will include all patients in the corresponding FAS 
except for those who are excluded due to important protocol violations.  
All efficacy endpoints will be evaluated on the FAS; the co -primary endpoints will also b e 
evaluated on the PPS .  
Part C  
The efficacy endpoints in Part C (the extended active treatment period) will be summarized for all 
patients who received any extended active treatment study drug in that part.  
10.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
For Part A and Part B, the s tudy part -specific safety analysis set (SAF) includes all randomized 
patients who received any study drug; it is based on the treatment received (as treated) . Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables will be analyzed using the SAF.

Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment gro up, 
and by all patients combined .  
10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
10.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The co -primary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving a histologic response of esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 visit will be analyzed using the Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test to assess the difference in the proportion of responders in the FAS 
adjusting for the randomization stratification factors . In anticipation of sparse responders in the 
placebo group, the Fisher’s exact test will  be performed as a supportive analysis to confirm the 
results from the CMH test.  
The co -primary endpoint of absolute change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 will 
be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model for the FAS with tre atment group, 
randomization stratification factor, and relevant baseline measurement as covariates included in 
the model . The cumulative proportion of responders over the entire range of possible cut -off points 
will be graphed to present the between -treatm ent-group differences at any responder level.  
The intercurrent events, strategies, and the corresponding missing data handling approaches for 
the primary estimands of interest for the co -primary endpoints are provided in Table  4.

 CONFIDENTIAL  If a patient has missing value for the histological response (peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf)  at week 24 visit due to reasons not related to COVID -19, the 
patient will be classified as a non -responder at week 24. Multiple imputation (MI) will be used for 
missing histological response due to COVID -19. 
If a patient has missing value for the DSQ tota l score at week 24, their missing data will be imputed 
by multiple imputation (MI) based on similar patients who remained in the trial with observed 
values relevant to analysis . Similarity is based on randomized treatment group, baseline value, 
stratificat ion factors, and available post -baseline values . To account for the uncertainty in the 
imputation, missing data at week 24 will be imputed 50 times to generate 50  complete datasets by 
using the MI procedure in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) .  
MI will follow the 2 steps below using a random seed number of 6681774 in both steps:  
• Step 1:  Use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fill in intermittent 
missing values (ie, those missing values followed by observed values at subsequent 
visits) so that  a monotone missing pattern will be formed.  
• Step 2:  Using the datasets from step 1, missing data through week 24 will be imputed 
using the regression method with treatment group, randomization stratification, 
relevant baseline measurement, and post -baseline measurement up to week 24 included 
in the  regression model.  
Once imputations are made, the week 24 data of each of the complete datasets will be analyzed 
using ANCOVA . The results from the 50 analyses on the complete datasets will be combined to 
generate a valid overall statistical inference acc ording to Rubin’s formula (Rubin, 1987 ) using the 
SAS MIANALYZE procedure.  
Sensitivity analyses will assess alternative methods to impute missing data under the assumption 
of missing at random or missing not at random . For the esophageal -intraepithelial -eosinophil 
responder analysis, alternative methods may include utilizing peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count values from imputations to determine responder status . For the analysis of change 
from baseline in the DSQ total score, alternative methods may include mixed -effect model for 
repeated measures (MMRM), last observation carried forward (LOCF), and tipping point analysis . 
Sensitivity analyses will also include an analysis without setting data post -rescue to mi ssing. 
Sensitivity analyses may include but are not limited to the methods specified above. Details will 
be specified in the SAP.  
Handling of missing data or delayed procedures due to COVID -19 and any additional analyses 
required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 to understand estimated treatment effect will be 
detailed in the SAP.

10.4.3.2.1.  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in Part A and Part B  
Binary endpoints:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints that measure binary responses at week  24 will be analyzed in the 
same fashion as the co -primary endpoint of histologic response of peak esophageal intraepithelial

 CONFIDENTIAL  eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf, including the method to handle missing data and planned 
sensitivity analyses.  
Continuous endpoint s: 
For Part A enrolled patients, EoE -EREFS assessed by investigators will be used in the analysis (no 
centralized readings available). For Part B enrolled patients, the primary analysis of EoE -EREFS 
will be based on centralized readings, if available. If t he centralized reading is not available, the 
EoE-EREFS performed by the investigator will be used for analysis.  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints at week 24 will be analyzed using ANCOVA in a similar 
fashion to the co -primary endpoint of change from baseline in the DSQ total score.  
For continuous efficacy data that are scheduled to be measured repeatedly post -baseline up to week 
24 (eg, percent change in DSQ score from baseline to week 24), missing data will be imputed by 
MI as described in the prima ry efficacy analysis of the DSQ co -primary endpoint . Sensitivity 
analyses similar to those specified for the DSQ co -primary endpoint will be conducted.  
For continuous efficacy data that are to be measured only once post -baseline up to week 24 
(eg, percent change in peak eos/hpf from baseline to week 24), missing values at week 24 will be 
imputed with patient’s baseline value or the available post -baseline value, whichever is worse, 
ie, a worst observation carried forward (WOCF) approach . MI approach is not suitable for 
handling missing data in this case due to the fact that the complete case patients will not have 
measurements available at the time points when measurements are obtained for ET patients 
(designed to be at their ET visits) to enable the imputat ion of week 24 missing values for early 
terminated patients . A sensitivity analysis, using the LOCF approach to impute missing values at 
week 24, will be performed.  
To account for use of rescue treatment, data will be imputed by MI for continuous endpoints  
repeatedly measured or by WOCF for continuous endpoints measured only once up to week 24 
visit after the use of rescue treatment.  
For the four key secondary endpoints, the primary estimand and details about the intercurrent

groups is statistically significant. P -values will be reported.  
10.4.3.2.2.  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in Part C  
Efficacy variables measured in Part C will use the last non -missing value prior to the first dose of 
extended active treatment study  drug as their baseline assessments . These efficacy variables will 
be summarized with descriptive statistics by received treatment in Part C . Inferential statistics will 
only be conducted as needed.  
10.4.3.3.  Multiplicity Considerations  
Part A and Part B will be car ried out as 2 separate sub -studies with no overlap in patients. 
Therefore, each study part will have separate and independent 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05. In the 
event that sample size of Part B is changed based on observed data from Part A, there will be no 
alpha adjustment as data from Part A are considered external information to Part B.  
To demonstrate efficacy for a dupilumab dose regimen, both of the individual co -primary 
endpoints need to be statistically significant at the 2 -sided 0.05 level for that  dose regimen.  
Part A : Statistical significance of both co -primary efficacy endpoints will be required before 
drawing inferential conclusions about any secondary efficacy endpoints . The hierarchical order of 
secondary endpoints will be specified in Part A  SAP.  
Part B : Type I error rate will be controlled using a hierarchical testing procedure . The co -primary 
endpoints will be tested for the comparison of dupilumab QW dose regimen to placebo first and if 
both endpoints are statistically significant, the tes ting will proceed to the co -primary endpoints of 
dupilumab Q2W, or the secondary endpoints of dupilumab QW, with the exact order to be 
specified in Part B SAP.  
As Part C data will be summarized using descriptive statistics, there is no multiplicity issue.

10.5. Additional Sta tistical Data Handling Conventions  
The following analysis and data conventions will be followed:  
Definition of baseline:  
• The baseline assessment for each study part will be the latest, valid predose assessment 
available for the corresponding study part, r espectively  
General rules for handling missing data:  
• If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is incomplete or missing, it will 
be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an 
incomplete date (eg, month and  year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to 
treatment . If the partial date indicates the same month or year of the intake of study 
medication date, then the start date by the study medication intake date will be imputed; 
otherwise, the missing  day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed.  
• No imputations for missing laboratory data, ECG data, vital sign data, or physical 
examination data will be made.  
Unscheduled assessments:  
• Extra assessments (laboratory data or vital signs  associated with non -protocol clinical 
visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will be included in 
listings and summaries . If more than 1 laboratory value is available for a given visit, 
the first observation will be used in summ aries and all observations will be presented 
in listings .

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Page 103 of 113 
 CONFIDENTIAL  14.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB/EC . A copy of the IRB - or EC -approved ICF and documentation 
of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipp ed to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each adult patient, and written informed consent or assent from 
each adolescent patient and written informed consent from his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s), 
prior to patient’s participation in the study and after the aims, methods, objectives, and potential 
hazards of the study have been explained to the patient and adolescent patient’s parent(s) or  legal 
guardian(s) in language that he/she can understand . The ICF should be signed and dated by the 
adult patient, and the ICF/IAF by adolescent patient and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and 
by the investigator or authorized designee who reviewe d the ICF/IAF with the patient/patient’s 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) .  
For adolescent patients, local law must be observed in deciding whether the consent of 1 or both 
parents/guardians is required . If only 1 parent or guardian signs the consent form, t he investigator 
must document the reason the other parent or guardian did not sign . The patient may also be 
required to sign and date the ICF, as determined by the IRB or EC and in accordance with the local 
regulations and requirements.  
• Patients/parents/gu ardians who can write but cannot read will have the ICF/IAF read 
to them before signing and dating the ICF/IAF.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF/IAF 
read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF/IAF 
to confirm that informed consent/assent was given.  
The original ICF/IAF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and 
a copy of the signed ICF must be given to the adult patient, or to the adolesc ent patient and his/her 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF/IAF 
must be reviewed and updated appropriately . All study patients (and adolescent patients’ parent[s] 
or legal guardian[s]) must be informed of the new information and provide their written 
consent/assent if they wish to continue in the study . The original signed revised ICF/IAF must be 
maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to t he adult patient, and the 
adolescent patient and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
14.3. Patients Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient will be maintained . Patients should be identified by a patient identification number only, 
on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor . Documents that will not be submitted to 
the sponsor (eg, signed ICF/IAF) must be kept in strict confidence.

unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patient, in which 
case the IRB or EC  should be informed as soon as possible  
• Ongoing studies on an annual basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk  
In addition, the IRB or EC should be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of patients 
or the continued conduct of th e clinical study.  
A copy of the IRB or EC approval letter with a current list of the IRB or EC members and their 
functions must be received by the sponsor prior to shipment of drug supplies to the investigator . 
The approval letter should include the study number and title, the documents reviewed, and the 
date of the review.  
Records of the IRB or EC review and approval of all study documents (including approval of 
ongoing studies) must be kept on file by the investigator.

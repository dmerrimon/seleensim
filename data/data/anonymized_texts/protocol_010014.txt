PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  1 PREFACE  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for Oral Desensitization to Egg with Subsequent Induction of Sustai ned 
Unresponsiveness for Egg -Allergic Children using Baked Egg or Egg Oral Immunotherapy (OIT)  describes 
and expands upon the statistical information presented in the protocol.  This trial is sponsored by the NIAID  
and was designed and implemented at NIAID funded CoFAR sites . The Emmes Corporation serves as the 
SACCC for CoFAR.  
This document describes all planned analyses and provides reasons and justifications for these analyses. A 
listing of tables, listings, and figures planned for the final analyses  are provided in a separate document . 
Regarding the final analyses and Clinical Study Report (CSR), this SAP follows the International Conference 
on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) 
Guidelines, as i ndicated in Topic E3 (Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports), and more generally is 
consistent with Topic E8 (General Considerations for Clinical Trials) and Topic E9 (Statistical Principles for 
Clinical Trials). The structure and content of the SAP provides sufficient detail to meet the requirements 
identified by the FDA and ICH, while all work planned and reported for this SAP will follow internationally 
accepted guidelines published by the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statisti cal So ciety for 
statistical practice.  
This document contains three sections: (1) a review of the study design, (2) general statistical 
considerations, and (3) comprehensive statistical analysis methods for efficacy and safety outcomes. Any 
deviation from t his SAP will be described and justified in protocol amendments and/or in the CSR, as 
appropriate. The reader of this SAP is encouraged to also review the study protocol for details on conduct of 
the study and the operational aspects of clinical assessments . 
2 INTRODUCTION  
The overarching goal of this study is to advance the development of safe and effective treatments for egg 
allergic pa tients. Previous research has shown efficacy for administration of egg oral immunotherapy (eOIT) 
in this population. This st udy compares the efficacy and safety of eOIT vs administration of baked egg in 
baked egg tolerant participants. The section below provides more detail on the purpose of the analysis.  
2.1 Purpose of the A nalyses  
The purpose of this trial is to assess the effica cy and safety of eOIT compared to baked egg in egg allergic 
but baked egg tolerant participants . This is a n unblinded  multicenter randomized trial  without a placebo 
control .  Baked egg tolerant p articipant s were randomized to receive either eOIT or baked e gg daily . An OFC 
will be performed at Year 2 to assess desensitization followed by an OFC off -therapy with an open feeding to 
assess sustained unresponsiveness (the primary efficacy endpoint).  In addition , 40 baked egg intolerant 
participants were enrolled  and assigned to eOIT to facilitate comparison of the efficacy and safety of eOIT in 
baked egg tolerant compared to baked egg intolerant participants. Secondary endpoints address safety and 
alternate measures of efficacy as well as immunologic comparisons . The timing of the analyses are defined 
in Section 6.2.  
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS  
This section focuses on protocol -specified study objectives (Section 3.1), protocol -specified endpoints 
(Section 3.2) and operational definitions for those endpoints (Se ction 3.3). Throughout the SAP, successfully 
consumed dose (SCD) refers to the cumulative dose consumed without dose limiting symptoms.

PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  Throughout this document, the doses of egg white solid for Egg OIT are given in milligrams of egg white 
solid, not egg w hite protein. It is estimated that 1 mg egg white solid is equivalent to approximately 0.70 mg 
of egg white protein.  
3.1 Study  Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to determine in baked -egg tolerant, but egg -allergic, children whether 
daily baked egg therapy vs. daily oral administration of egg white solid escalated to a maximum of 2500 
mg/day, increases sustained unresponsiveness as measured by a 7444 mg egg white protein OFC performed 
8-10 weeks after therapy discontinuation by the 2 year time poi nt. 
Secondary objectives are to:  
1. Determine the percentage of subjects who can successfully consume without dose limiting 
symptoms at least 4444 mg egg white protein of a 7444 mg egg white protein OFC after the initial 
desensitization phase of approximately  1 year of the study and at 2 years.  
2. Determine the incidence of all serious adverse events.  
3. Characterize unrestricted egg consumption after conclusion of treatment via long term follow -up. 
Tertiary (mechanistic) objectives include testing the following hyp otheses:  
1. The development of clinical sustained unresponsiveness to egg is associated with a reduction in 
allergen -specific Th2 effector cells, an increase in allergen -specific T regulatory (Treg) cells, and an 
induction of allergen -specific T follicular he lper (Tfh) cells.  
2. The development of the desensitized state to egg is associated with the down -regulation of 
basophils.  
3. The persistence of egg allergy is associated with an epitope -specific IgE antibody profile that is 
distinct from persons who lose their clinical allergy to egg.  
4. Sustained unresponsiveness will be associated with a predictive transcriptional signature detectable 
in whole blood or allergen restimulated PBMCs.   
While the above objectives have been framed in terms of the randomized comparison that is central to this 
study, individuals who comprise the Egg OIT assignment gro up will have endpoints similar t o the randomized 
cases. The assignment group will be compared to the randomized arms and evaluated for sustained 
unresponsiveness, desensitiza tion, safety and immune system function. It is anticipated that this group will 
have less desensitization and sustained unresponsiveness  success than the randomized Egg OIT subjects. If 
supported by the results, it will be an objective to determine if immu ne parameter studies can help explain 
the differences.

PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  3.2 Endpoints  
The primary clinical efficacy endpoint is the development of sustained unresponsiveness to egg consumption 
at 2 years as assessed with a 7444 mg egg white protein OFC and open feeding,  
8-10 weeks after discontinuing therapy.  
The secondary endpoints  are as follows:  
 The development of desensitization to ≥4444 mg egg white protein at 1 year and 2 years.  
 Incidence of all serious adverse events during the study.  
 Changes in egg -specific IgE and IgG4, changes in PST mean wheal diameters, basophil reactivity, 
CD154+ CD4+ Th2 cells, Tregs, and Tfh cells as descr ibed further in Sections 3.3 and 11 .  
 Unrestricted consumption of unbaked egg as reported on the annual long term questionnaire.  
3.3 Study Definitions  and Derived Variables  
The primary endpoint of the study will be the development of sustained unrespon siveness  to a 7444 mg egg 
white protein OFC followed by open consumption of a whole egg, 8 -10 weeks after discontinuing 2 years of 
daily Baked Egg or Egg OIT. OFCs will be conducted in a supervised setting and safety parameters will be 
carefully monitored. Individ uals off therapy for 8 -10 weeks, successfully demonstrating consumption of 7444 
mg egg white protein during OFC without dose -limiting symptoms followed by an open feeding of a meal -
sized portion of egg are considered successes ; those not receiving the open feeding of a meal-sized portion 
of egg due to site error are also considered successes. Individuals who do not attempt this off therapy OFC 
or do not successfully consume 7444 mg egg white protein for this off therapy OFC  will be considered 
“failures” wit h respect to this endpoint.  
For the desensitization e ndpoint, all individuals with an  SCD ≥ 4444 mg egg white protein will be considered 
successes All others will be considered “failures” with respect to this endpoint.  
For safety endpoints, the pre -define d secondary endpoint is the incidence of serious adverse events. 
Additional safety endpoints of interest include the incidence of adverse events related to dosing which will be 
estimated from the dosing symptom logs. For the first 12 months on therapy , or for the time until reaching 
the maximum maintenance dose if this occurs after 12 months , all dosing symptom logs are required to be 
submitted . Otherwise , only doses with reactions or missed doses have dosing symptom logs reported  in the 
data system. All no n-reported doses are assumed  to have been successfully administered without reaction or 
treatment required. To estimate the number of doses administered, the following algorithm will be used:  
Through Week 52 : Date of last dose is  calculated as the minimum of the completion date of the Week 52  
OFC, the drug discontinuation date and the study withdrawal date minus one day. It is assumed that a  dose 
would  not occur on the day of Week 52  OFC.

PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  The number of expected doses will be calculated as days from treatme nt initiation to date of last dose and 
the percent of doses administered will be calculated as administered doses/expected doses.  
After Week 52 : For subjects who discontinued dosing or withdrew from the study, the d ate of last dose is 
calculated as the min imum of the drug discontinuation date and the study withdrawal date minus one day. 
For subjects who did not discontinue dosing or withdraw, the date of last dose is calculated as the maximum 
of the date of last study visit and the  day before the ir Year 2 d esensitization  OFC. Doses without dosing 
symptom logs that are to have occurred after 12 months but  before the date of last dose are counted as 
doses that were administered with no symptoms. It is assumed that a dose would not occur on the day of 
the Year 2 desensitization OFC.  
The number of expected doses will be calculated as days from the day after the Week 52  OFC through the 
discontinuation above.  The percent of doses administered will be calculated as administered doses/expected 
doses.  
Derived variabl es for mechanistic data are as follows:  
1. % antigen -specific IgE = (antigen specific IgE / total IgE ) X 100  
Egg-specific IgG4/IgE : The egg specific IgG4/IgE ratio was calculated by converting IgG4 level from mgA/L 
to ng/mL and converting IgE level from kUA/L  to ng/mL with the formula (IgG4 × 1000) ÷ (IgE × 2.4).  
2. Activated Basophils  = % CD63+ cells  
3. Frequency and phenotype of egg -responsive T cells:  
From 6 hour flow cytometry data:  
a. CD154+CD3+CD4+ cell count (per million CD3+/CD4+)

4.1 Overall  Study Design and Plan  
To effectively address the Primary and Secondary Objectives of this interventional study, we will enroll 
subjects, age 3 through 16 years, either sex, any race, any ethnicit y with a serum IgE [UniCAPTM] to egg of 
> 5 kU A/L [determined by UniCAPTM within the past 12 months]. All subjects will have documented consent 
and assent as is appropriate. Females of childbearing age will use appropriate birth control. These subjects 
will be recruited from 5  sites. All eligible subjects will receive the double -blind placebo controlled baked egg 
OFC. Approximately the first 40 individuals who do not pass this initial baked egg food challenge will be 
assigned to Egg OIT. Enrollment in this group will be capped at approximately 40 individuals though those 
consented but not yet challenged when this group reaches 40 will be allowed to proceed and if they fail the 
baked egg challenge will be assigned to the egg OIT assignment group. This may res ult in slightly over 40 
cases in this group which is acceptable. Individuals who pass the baked egg OFC will then have an initial egg 
OFC. Those who have dose -limiting symptoms at a cumulative dose of < 1444 mg egg white protein will be 
randomized 1:1 to B aked Egg or Egg OIT. Those who successfully consume more than 1444 mg of egg 
white protein on the OFC will not be eligible for the study and will be followed per local standard of care.  
Those assigned or randomized to Egg OIT will escalate the dose of egg white solid to achieve the desired 
maintenance dose of 2500 mg. Those randomized to the Baked Egg group will continue on the baked egg 
product for the remainder of the study.

PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  For the purposes of this study, clinical details and blood samples will be collected at specified intervals. If a 
subject is removed from therapy because of failing escalation or build -up, a blood sample for mechanistic 
studies will be obtained within approximately 1 week of removal from  therapy.  
The Baked Egg Group  
The Baked Egg group will use approximately 2 gm of baked egg as a daily dose throughout the study as 
described below.  
Baked egg therapy will consist of a muffin or equivalent (1/3 of egg in serving, approximately  
2 gm).  
Home b aked products will have no more than 2 eggs per batch of recipe (yield 6 servings). Serving size is 
indicated by the yield of the recipe. Products will be baked for 25 -50 minutes at 325 -425 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Recipes will be provided. The daily dose can b e administered at a single sitting or divided throughout the 
dosing day. Adjustments in the daily dosing may be made at the investigators discretion based on symptoms 
experienced by the subjects in the baked egg group.  
Dietary information will be provided to the subject regarding allowed consumption of various commercial 
foods consistent with approximately 2 gm of baked egg per daily dose. Subjects in this arm will be 
encouraged to ingest “safe” commercial products in addition to their daily 2 gm intake of baked egg protein. 
These foods will be recorded on the daily logs.  
The Egg OIT Group s 
The egg OIT  (eOIT)  treatment is administered  in 2 treatment groups , eOIT -Randomized and eOIT -Assigned,  
that may experience different paths for OIT treatment. The group ra ndomized to receive eOIT treatment 
that have  passed the baseline baked egg OFC (eOIT -Randomized) and the group assigned to receive eOIT  
(eOIT -Assigned)  that have failed the baseline baked egg OFC . The group that fails the baked egg challenge 
may be more se nsitive to egg dosing, and may experience more reactivity and adverse reactions. These 
subjects will stop at 12 mg egg white solid on the initial day escalation and thereby have a slightly slower 
escalation time course.  
The egg OIT treatment is comprised o f an initial escalation day, an initial build -up phase to last a maximum 
of 44 weeks, and followed by at least 8 weeks of daily therapy at the maximum achieved dose (350 mg - 
2500 mg egg white solid).

month of a subject’s planned 2 year 7444 mg egg white protein OFC.  
Follow -up OFCs  
At 1 year:  
Those subjects still on active treatment (baked egg or egg OIT) will have a  7444 mg egg white protein OFC 
on therapy  at 1 year to identify desensitized individuals.  
At 2 years:  
Those subjects still on active treatment ( baked egg or egg OIT) will have a 7444 mg egg white protein OFC 
on therapy at 2 years. Those subjects still on active therapy, but escalating doses, will discontinue escalation 
for 1 month prior to their 2 year 7444 mg egg white protein OFC and will be maintained on their highest 
tolerated dose. Those who pass the 2 year egg 7444 mg egg white protein OFC on therapy will have a 
repeat 7444 mg egg white protein OFC after 8 -10 weeks off therapy to test for sustained unresponsiveness. 
If they pass this OFC off therapy (including open fee ding), they will add egg to their diet and will be followed 
at 3 months by phone and at 6 months in clinic to assess their egg diet history and reactivity status to egg.  
If they fail the 2 year 7444 mg egg white protein OFC on or off therapy, they will sto p therapy and the study 
physician will review treatment options.  
4.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
The design considers important safety issues:  
 All dose escalations will be supervised in the clinic.  
 The Egg OIT assignment group (that failed the baked egg challenge) will only escalate to 12 mg egg 
white solid maximum during the initial escalation on Day 1.  
 OFC can delineate individuals who can ingest egg safely in a supervised setting.   
 The relationship of egg -specific IgE t o OFC results is unknown in individuals consuming baked egg or 
350 - 2500 mg of egg white solid daily for up to a year. Thus, after long -term therapy, an egg OFC 
will be needed to determine sustained unresponsiveness irrespective of their egg -specific IgE level, 
and this will be performed safely in a supervised setting.  
In addition, study enrollment will be suspended pending expedited review of all pertinent data by the NIAID 
DSMB if the following occurs:  
 Any death related to Baked Egg or Egg OIT dosing.  
 More than 1 severe anaphylactic reaction (see Appendix 3  of the protocol ) related to Baked Egg or 
Egg OIT dosing at any stage of the protocol.  
 More than 3 treatment -related non -anaphylaxis severe adverse events (including EoE).  
 More than 1 serious suspected adverse reaction occurs (serious and related).  
 More than 3 subjects who require more than 1 injection of epinephrine for a single study product 
related allergic reaction during the study therapy.

4.4 Treatments  
4.4.1 Treatments Administered  
Two treatments wi ll be administered daily for this study , egg oral immunotherapy (eOIT) for participants in 
the eOIT -Randomized and eOIT -Assigned groups,  and baked egg  for participants in the Baked Egg group . 
Baked egg therapy will be prepared using commercially available food ingredients and prepared according to 
pre-specified recipes, cooking temperatures, and times to administer consistent doses of baked egg.  
Baked egg therapy will consist of a muffin or equivalent (1/3 of egg in serving or approximately 2 gm of 
protein) . Home baked products will have no more than 2 eggs per batch of recipe (yield 6 servings). Serving 
size is indicated by the yield of the recipe. Products will be baked for 25 -50 minutes at 325 -425 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Recipes will be provided. The daily do se can be administered at 1 sitting or divided throughout 
the dosing day. These methods are outlined in the manual of procedures and instructions for the subjects 
and their families.  
Study drug (commercially available egg white solid) will be centrally pac kaged, stored and distributed by 
EMINENT Services Corporation. Central manufacturing will consist of weighing individual doses of the egg 
white solid into vials or capsules and providing bulk egg white solid for use with scoops. A 37% egg white 
solid blend ed product as described in the manufacturing section of the IND will be used to provide specified 
dose levels  in capsules whereas 100% egg white solid will be used to provide specified dose in vials or in 
bulk product . 
Initial day dose escalation will be p ackaged in individual vials with each dose weighed. Initial day escalation 
kits will have 2 doses of each vial up to 25 mg egg white solid. Individual dose level kits will have 21 vials 
per kit. Kits will be used until a dose of 50 mg egg white solid is ac hieved. Starting at doses of 50 mg, the 
egg white solid doses will be packaged in pull -apart capsules with the appropriate dose in each capsule. One 
capsule will be used for each day’s dose. Capsules will be packaged in bottles of 21.  
Starting at doses of 350 mg egg white solid, bulk powder will be dispensed with a dose -specific scoop. 
Subjects will be instructed to use 1 scoop per day that is leveled across the top of the scoop. The bulk 
product will be in a supply of 500 gm.

THIS IS A PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  
PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  All study product will be pack aged at the central manufacturer. Study drug will be shipped by the central 
manufacturer to the site pharmacist for distribution to the site study personnel. The site pharmacist will 
dispense study drug in a manner consistent with the current dose level an d treatment assignment.  
All study drug will be labeled at the central manufacturer and shipped to the local pharmacy for distribution 
to the study subjects. The product will be labeled with the numbered dose level and package number.  
Every attempt to use a  single lot of commercially available egg white solid will be made. If a new lot is 
required, and any subject is in an escalation phase of the study, they will have a single observed in clinic 
dose reduction with the new lot. Escalation to their previous d ose may occur in 1 week if the subject has the 
same or fewer symptoms than those occurring with the previous lot.  
4.4.2 Method of Assigning Participant s to Treatment Groups (Randomization)  
Randomization was performed using an online data system  with participants  allocated in a 1:1 fashion to 
eOIT or baked egg  consumption stratified by site. The first 40 participants to fail the initial baked egg 
challenge w ere assigned to receive eOIT. Further baked egg OFC failures w ere considered screen failures 
and not enrolle d. 
4.4.3 Blinding  
This study is unblinded.  
5 SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS  
The sample size target for the randomized portion of the study is 96 individuals with 1:1 random assignment 
to Baked Egg and Egg OIT. The sample size was selected to determine whether a differ ence exists between 
the treatment groups in the primary endpoint rate for the sustained unresponsiveness -focused portion of the 
study. Specifically, the sample was designed to have 85% power to detect with a two -sided 5% level test, a 
difference between a 40% and 70% sustained unresponsiveness rate. While a small dropout rate may occur, 
we will use all randomized cases who initiate treatment in the intent -to-treat analysis of the primary 
endpoint; failures associated with noncompliance are include in the de nominator for event rates above.  This 
sample size is sufficient to address the secondary endpoint of the desensitization components of the study 
for event rate differences of comparable size.  
The subset of individuals who are not baked egg tolerant at base line comprise a selected group of 
individuals where Egg OIT will be examined. The size of the group will be capped at approximately 40 
subjects. The study cohort should be useful for both clinical and mechanistic study with approximately 40 
such individual s enrolled. The 2 year sustained unresponsiveness rate will be compared to historical 
experience as well as the protocol’s randomized Egg OIT arm. Mechanistic studies will be examined to 
determine if baseline immune system responses are similar in both Egg  OIT groups. Immune parameter

THIS IS A PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  
PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  changes will be examined to determine if tolerant and non -tolerant cases have response profiles that are 
parallel for the 2 strata.  
6 GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 General Principles  
All continuous variables will be summari zed using the following descriptive statistics: n (non -missing sample 
size), mean, standard deviation (or median and interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate) , maximum and 
minimum. Transformations of immune results may be required and appropriate transform ations will be 
applied (e.g. , log 10 transform). The frequency and percentages (based on the non -missing sample size) of 
observed levels will be reported for all categorical measures. Where appropriate,  summary tables will be 
structured with a column for e ach treatment and assignment group in order ( Baked Egg, eOIT – Randomized 
and eOIT - Assigned ) and will be annotated with the total population size relevant to that table/treatment, 
including any missing observations.   
6.2 Timing of Analyses  
The primary analys is will take place when all participants have completed the appropriate Year 2 OFCs  and 
the OFCs have been appropriately monitored . The final analysis will take place when the last long term 
follow -up questionnaire is completed (targeted September 2018).  
6.3 Analysis Populations  
The efficacy analysis population will consist of randomized participants  who initiate treatment  as well as all 
participants enrolled in the eOIT – Assigned group  who initiate treatment . The safety population may vary 
based on time perio d and will consist only of treated participants. Mechanistic analyses will consider those 
with available samples.  
6.4 Covariates and Subgroups  
As this is a small Phase II trial, analysis of covariates may be limited in scope. Mechanistic analyses will focus 
on temporal changes as well as using mechanistic factors as predictors of clinical response. Age will be 
considered as a possible covariate as previous studies have shown differential results based on age.  
Key subgroup comparisons will include the compariso n of the eOIT – Randomized to eOIT – Assigned to 
determine if the efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity of eOIT differs based on tolerance to baked egg.  
6.5 Missing Data  
Missing data for primary and secondary endpoints has been described in Section 3.3. At the c urrent time, no 
other adjustments for missing data are currently planned. If upon analysis, missing data issues are identified

THIS IS A PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  
PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  then appropriate methods based on the pattern and frequency of missing data will be applied. All methods 
and results will be prov ided to allow for sufficient interpretation of the results.  
6.6 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
The DSMB will convene to review safety data periodically.  Given the relatively small total sample size for the 
study and the interest in precise treatment -specific endpoint estimates (in addition to the treatment contrast 
results), no formal efficacy -focused early stopping guidelines or plans are proposed.  The DSMB will receive 
regular reports on accrual, dose escalation success, dose -limiting adverse events, OFC-related adverse 
events, and other adverse events.  The DSMB may request additional analyses.  
6.7 Multicenter Studies  
Five sites participate in this study and randomization occurs within site . Site effects are not anticipated but 
demographics and baseline c haracteristics  will be reported by site to assess  unanticipated site differences . 
6.8 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
A two -sided significance level of 0.05 will be used for primary, secondary, and safety endpoints.  For planned 
mechanistic analyses (e.g. , temporal changes, differences between responders and non -responders) a p -
value of 0.01 will be used to control for the multiplicity of tests . 
7 STUDY PARTICIPANT S 
7.1 Participant  Disposition  
Participant  disposition will be described in tables by site and treatment  group.  
A CONSORT diagram will describe the participant  disposition and loss to follow -up through the course of the 
study.  
7.2 Protocol Deviations  
Participant -specific protocol deviations will be described by individual, treatment group and site. Site specifi c 
deviations will be described by site.  Listings will include a description of the deviation and any action taken 
as a result.  
8 EFFICACY EVALUATION  
8.1 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be described by  site and treatment group . Demographics 
include gender, age, and ethnicity . Baseline characteristics include  medical history (i.e ., asthma, other food 
allergies, etc .), mechanistic characteristics (i.e. , egg IgE, egg SPT, etc .), and baseline SCD  for the ba ked egg 
and egg white challenges . Continuous variables will be summarized using appropriate measures (means and

frequencies  and percentages. If the frequen cy of an individual category is low, the categories may be 
collapsed for display or analysis purposes.  
8.1.1 Concurrent Illnesses and Medical Conditions  
History of allergies, asthma, and atopic dermatitis are collected at baseline and at protocol scheduled follo w-
ups. These factors will be described at baseline and atopic dermatitis will be described at follow -up 
timepoints . 
8.1.2 Prior and Concurrent Medications  
Prior and concurrent medications will be collected by self -report. Medications will be WHO  Drug Dictionary 
coded , and described app ropriately . 
8.2 Measurements of Treatment Compliance  
Missed doses are captured on the dosing symptom logs . Number of expected doses and percentage of doses 
not administered will be calculated as described in Section 3.3 . Participants wh o withdraw early will also be 
reported and described.  
8.3 Efficacy  Analyses  
The clinical efficacy endpoints are  based on  oral food challenge results. Mechanistic efficacy analyses are 
described in Section 11 below. The primary efficacy endpoint is based on the  Year 2 sustained 
unresponsiveness OFC.  
8.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is binary. This endpoint is based on passing the Year 2 sustained 
unresponsiveness  OFC followed by a successful open feeding . The proportion of partici pants passing the 
Year 2 SU OFC will be compared between the Baked Egg and eOIT – Randomized groups using a two -sided 
5% level chi -square test (or Barnard’s exact unconditional test as appropriate).  
A secondary  analysis of the primary endpoint will compare  the eOIT -Randomized group to the eOIT -
Assigned group using a two -sided 5% level chi -square test (or Barnard’s exact unconditional test as 
appropriate).  
8.3.2 Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint  Analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
1. Desensitization ≥4444 mg egg  white protein at 1 year and 2 year  OFC

PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  This endpoint will be described by group via frequencies and proportions and compared between  the 
Baked egg and eOIT – Randomized group using a two -sided 5% level chi -square test (or Barnard’s 
exact unconditional tes t as appropriate). A secondary comparison will compare the eOIT -
Randomized and eOIT -Assigned using a similar method.  
2. Unrestricted consumption of unbaked egg at long term follow -up 
This endpoint will be assessed on the long term follow -up questionnaire (LFQ ). Frequencies and 
proportions will be described by group and compared between the Baked egg and eOIT – 
Randomized group using a two -sided 5% level chi -square test (or Barnard’s exact unconditional test 
as appropriate). A secondary comparison will compare the eOIT -Randomized and eOIT -Assigned 
using a similar method.  
8.3.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Although not specified in the protocol, changes in SCD from baseline to each protocol OFC are of scientific 
interest . The change in SCD will be compared between tre atment using the  Wilcoxon Rank Sum  test to do 
pairwise comparisons between treatment groups . Effects of age will also be explored.  
Analyses will also consider participants who successfully passed the desensitization OFCs to 7444 mg of egg 
white protein at  the Week 52  and Year 2 OFCs. Comparisons between groups will be assessed in a similar 
fashion to the secondary endpoints above.  
Clinical and immunological predictors of sustained unresponsiveness are of great scientific and medical 
interest. Of particular  interest is the effect of age on treated effect and clinical outcomes. Logistic regression 
may be used to identify predictors of clinical response (i.e. , desensitization and/or sustained 
unresponsiveness). Predictors will be incorporated into models adjus ting for treatment where possible. 
Transformations will be implemented as appropriate and model fit will be assessed using the Hosmer -
Lemeshow goodness of fit test. Area under the curve  (AUC)  may be used as an assessment of predictor 
strength. If the numbe r of successes permits, multivariable models may be fit and stepwise regression 
techniques applied to identify important predictors or combinations of predictors.  
9 SAFETY EVALUATION  
The primary safety endpoint is incidence of all serious adverse events . An exploratory comparison will assess 
dosing symptoms as reported on the specific dosing symptom CRF. Note that as described above no 
adjustment for multiple comparisons will occur here as these are safety outcomes and detection of any 
potential signal is of interest.

THIS IS A PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION  
PREPARED BY THE EMMES  CORPORATION  9.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events are collected on all participants throughout the course of the study. Participants are provided 
a daily diary card  (called a dosing symptom log)  to record treatment -related events which are captured on 
specific dosin g symptom CRFs . Adverse events related to OFCs are captured on a specific CRF as are 
adverse events related to accidental (or purposeful) food ingestion (i.e. , food allergy episodes or  FAEs).  
9.1.1 Solicited Adverse Events and Symptoms  – Dosing Symptoms  
Symptoms  reported on the dosing symptom CRFs are considered treatment related for the purpose of 
analysis. Systemic symptoms are recorded as mild, moderate or severe.  
The key outcome of interest is symptom free doses (defined as no oral pharyngeal  or systemic symp toms). 
Exclusion of oral pharyngeal symptoms will also be considered. Other safety outcomes of interest include 
doses with moderate and/or severe reactions. Finally, doses requiring t reatment will also be described with a 
focus on doses requiring epinephri ne. 
Symptoms will be reported per dose, per participant, and proportion of doses per participant. The latter will 
be calculated by dividing the number of doses with each symptom by the total number of doses the 
participant received. Formal comparisons of s afety outcomes will occur on this measure  although significance 
testing may be performed on other measures if warranted . Proportion of doses  with symptoms  per 
participant will be compared using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to do pairwise comparisons between 
treatment groups . 
Finally, tables will be broken down by treatment, location , and timing (pre -Week 52  vs. post-Week 52 ) to 
illustrate potential dose level and temporal treatment effects.  
9.1.2 Other  Adverse Events  
As described above, non-treatment related adver se events are captured separately and described below . 
9.1.2.1 OFC Symptoms  
At each OFC the dose limiting symptoms and severity are captured on a specific CRF . Symptoms will be 
reported for each OFC by initial randomization group. Treatment administered during the  OFC (especially 
any epinephrine use) will be described.  
9.1.2.2 Food Allergy Episodes  
Food exposure related reactions are captured on the  food allergy episode  (FAE) CRF. The frequency, 
severity, and epinephrine use during such reaction will be described,  as well as eliciting allergen, and shown 
by treatment group. Further details on egg related exposures will be provided as necessary.

Frequency, severity and resolution of other treatment emergent adverse events will be descr ibed by 
treatment group, system organ class and preferred term.  
9.2 Deaths, Serious Adverse Events and other Significant Adverse Events  
The proportion of participants experiencing a SAE will be estimated within each group. Pairwise  comparisons 
between treatmen t group s will be performed using Barnard’s exact unconditional test  at the two -sided 5% 
level. If multiple SAEs are observed within a participant, alternate methods to account for the multiple 
events will be considered. If SAEs are infrequent (e.g. 1 or 2 events throughout the study), then hypothesis 
testing may not be performed. SAEs will also be described by relatedness to study product or procedure.  
9.3 Pregnancies  
Given the age of the study population, pregnancies are unlikely to be observed. Any participan t becoming 
pregnant will immediately terminate study treatment.  Descriptive information about any pregnancies that 
occur will be provided.  
9.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
No safety laboratory results will be systematically collected as part of this trial.  
9.5 Vital Signs and Physical Evaluations  
No data on vital signs will be systematically collected.  Height and weight are collected as part of the study 
and may be considered as potential factors if of scientific interest.  
9.6 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant m edications will be collected and described.  
10 PHARMACOKINETICS  
No pharmacokinetics will be analyzed in this study.  
11 MECHANISTIC ANALYSES  
11.1 Skin Prick Test  
SPTs are performed at baseline, Week 52  and Year 2 . SPT results and changes from baseline will be 
reported at each of these timepoints by treatment group  and by Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status . 
Change from baseline at Week 52  and Year 2 will be  compared between treatment groups  and by Year 2 
sustained unresponsiveness status using the Wilcoxon Ra nk-Sum test  to do pairwise group comparisons .

models).  
11.2 Immunoglobulin Results  
Egg specific IgE, IgG4, and total IgE are measured at baseline, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52 , Month 16 , 
Month 20 , Year 2, Month 26 and Month 30 . Percent  egg-specific IgE and IgG4/IgE ratio will be calculated as 
described in Section 3.3 above. Immunoglobulin results and changes from baseline will be reported at each 
of these timepoints by treatment group  and by Year 2 sust ained unresponsiveness status .  
Change from baseline will be compared between treatment groups and by Year 2 sustained 
unresponsiveness status using the Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test to do pairwise group comparisons. A repeated 
measures model will be fit using th e post-baseline timepoints  except for  the Month 30 visit (which is after 
the final OFC)  and adjusted for baseline  value, treatment or Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status, and 
visit to assess any treatment effect  or Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness ef fect on immun oglobulin  
measures. An appropriate covariance structure will be selected (with preference given to unstructured 
models).  If there are too few subjects who have completed the Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness OFC to 
allow for a reasonable model  fit, the model may be adjusted accordingly.  
11.3 Activated Basophil Analysis  
Activated b asophil outcomes will be constructed as described in Section 3.3. Activated b asophils will be 
measured at baseline, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52 , Month 16, Month 20, Yea r 2, Month 26 and Month 30 . 
Activated b asophil results for each stimulation level and changes from baseline will be reported at each of 
these timepoints by treatment group  and by Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status .  
Change from baseline will be compa red between treatment groups and by Year 2 sustained 
unresponsiveness status using the Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test to do pairwise group comparisons. A repeated 
measures model will be fit using post-baseline  timepoints except for the Month 30 visit (which is aft er the 
final OFC) and adjusted for baseline  value, treatment  or Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status  and visit 
to assess any treatment effect or Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status effect on basophil  measures. An 
appropriate covariance structure w ill be selected (with preference given to unstructured models).  If there are 
too few subjects who have completed the Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness OFC to allow for a reasonable 
model fit, the model may be adjusted accordingly.  
For each of the egg stim ulant levels within each treatment group, a Signed Rank test will be done for the 
egg value minus IL -3 (negative control) , the anti-IgE value  (positive control)  minus IL-3, and the anti -IgE 
value minus the egg value  at each time point to see if these value s are significantly different  than zero . A 
significant difference for egg minus IL -3 or anti-IgE minus IL -3 would indicate a response to egg  or to beads, 
respectively. A significant difference for anti -IgE minus egg would indi cate that the response was 
significantly different for anti -IgE than for egg.

Flow cytometry outcomes will be constructed as described in Section 3.3. Results will be measured at 
baseline, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52 , Year 2, Month 26 and Month  30 and changes from baseline will be 
reported at each of these timepoints by treatment group  and by Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status .  
Change from baseline will be compared between treatment groups and by Year 2 sustained 
unresponsiveness status u sing the Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test to do pairwise group comparisons. A repeated 
measures model of delta egg minus media (value for media  stimulant subtracted from value for egg 
stimulant) will be fit using the post-baseline timepoints except for the Month 30 visit (which is after the final 
OFC) and adjusted for baseline  value, treatment  or Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status,  and visit to 
assess any treatment effect or Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness status effect on flow cytometry  measures. 
An appropri ate covariance structure will be selected (with preference given to unstructured models).  If there 
are too few subjects who have completed the Year 2 sustained unresponsiveness OFC to allow for a 
reasonable model fit, the model may be adjusted accordingly.  Within each treatment group, a Signed Rank 
test will be done for delta egg minus media , delta beads minus media (value for media  stimulant subtracted 
from value for beads stimulant) , and delta beads minus egg (value for egg stimulant subtracted from value  
for bead s stimulant)  at each time point to see if these delta values are significantly greater than zero . A 
significant difference for delta egg minus media or delta beads minus media  would indicate a response to 
egg or to beads , respectively . A significa nt difference for beads minus egg would indicate that the response 
was significantly different for beads than for egg.  (Note that media is the negative control and beads is the 
positive control for the assay.)  
Additionally, correlations with egg specific immunoglobulin results will be explored. Spearman rank 
correlations may be estimate d. Immunoglobulin measures may also be considered as covariates in the 
repeated measures models to assess the contemporaneous associations.  
12 OTHER ANALYSES  
The planned analys es are described above. Some mechanistic objectives and endpoints may be described 
further as data become available. Other analyses may be requested by investigators or scientific reviewers. 
Such analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis gener ating and will be described in detail at the 
time of analysis.

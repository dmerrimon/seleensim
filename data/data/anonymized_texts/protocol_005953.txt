 1. Project Summary  
We plan a randomized clinical trial comparing four user -friendly, non -invasive topical pain 
treatments , including a novel thermomechanical distraction technique,  for breast cancer 
patients undergoing radiotracer injection for sentinel lymph node mapping. There is 
significant variability in how practices approach minimizing pain with radiotracer injection.  
Patients have identified this procedure as partic ularly painful out of all the procedures they 
undergo related to breast cancer treatment . To date, no best practice approach has been 
identified that is easily implemented into clinical w orkflows across practice types. Our 
objective is  to identify a practi cal and widely adoptable soluti on to this persistent problem  
and improve the experience of breast cancer patients starting their treatment trajectory 
within the health system . 
2. Significance  
Each year, over 270,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, making it 
the most common non- cutaneous malignancy in this population (1). The majority of these 
women have localized disease and will undergo sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for 
cancer staging, as the presence of axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors for early stage breast cancer. Unfortunately, preoperative 
radiotracer injection for axillary SLN mapping can be extremely painful for some breast 
cancer patients, the pain of which is often severely underestimated by physicians (2) . 
Indeed, radiotracer injection has been identified by some patients as the most painful 
experience in the operative day including surgery itself (3). The field of breast surgery has 
made large strides in improving patient expe riences of breast surgery, including improving 
localization methods for breast conservation and incorporating regional blocks for the 
operative procedure. However, the pain with preoperative radiotracer injection remains 
distressing for patients. In order to enhance the experience of already anxious patients 
facing breast surgery, it is imperative that we identify methods to optimize pain control. Patient experience is an important component of the overall quality of health care and is 
essential for building positive relationships between patients and providers (4) . These 
experiences and relationships are especially critical for breast cancer patients who are often 
only starting their treatment trajectory within the healthcare system.   
 
3. Background 
3.1 Periareolar radiotracer injection is the preferred method for SLN identification in breast cancer patients (5) but is extremely painful. In current practice, there i s wide 
variability on pain management for radiotracer injection with no clear gold- standard. 
Intraoperative injection after initiation of surgical anesthesia would likely minimize pain the 
most. However, although some centers have successfully incorporated  intraoperative 
injection of radiotracer into clinical flow (6 –8), there are significant implementation 
challenges with this approach, including constraints associated with handling of radioactive 
material and coordination with nuclear medicine staff. For most centers, pre -operative 
injection is a necessity (8).  
 
3.2 Prior studies have demonstrated that the injection of local anesthetic such as 
lidocaine significantly reduces pain associated with subsequent or concomitant radiotracer injection (9–11) but may also reduce success of lymphatic mapping 
(Table).  While the reduction in pain scores with lidocaine inj ection is encouraging, studies 
have reported mixed results regarding success of SLN identification (9 –11). The largest and 
most recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated markedly lower mapping rates for 
patients receiving lidocaine injections. Furthermore, some of the studies ut ilized special 
preparations of lidocaine along with the radiotracer, something not feasible for many 
3 
 practices. As a result, many nuclear medicine radiologists and surgeons are uncomfortable 
using injectable lidocaine and instead rely on topical anesthesia for the radiotracer injection 
(12).

3.3 No topical anesthetic has been proven to be superior for controlling pain associated 
with radiotracer injection.  Topical anesthetics such as lidocaine- prilocaine cream ( EMLA) 
have limited benefit compared to placebo (13– 16). To date, there have been no studies 
investigating the efficacy of an anesthetic patch (e.g. 5% lidocaine) or non -pharmacologic pain 
management for this procedure. Thus, there is still a need to investigate a practical, effective, 
and broadly adoptable intervention that will reduce the distress associated with preoperative 
radiotracer injection in breast cancer patients.  
 
3. 4 Preliminary observations  
Options for topical anesthetic: Institutionally and in the literature, EMLA cream does not appear 
to reduce pain with radiotracer injection (13–15). The nuclear medicine department at our 
institution discontinued the use of EMLA due to perceived lack of efficacy and workflow 
challenges associated with implementing EMLA application into pract ice (which may have 
impacted effectiveness).  
The current standard of care at our institution is application of ice to the breast before radiotracer injection. Application of ice to the breast has not been directly studied in the setting 
of radiotracer inj ection, but ice and topical vapocoolant sprays have been found to reduce the 
pain of procedures such as venous and arterial cannulation in adults (17– 20). According to 
breast cancer providers at our institution, patients continue to report significant pain with the procedure when ice is used as the topical anesthetic.  
4 
 Lidocaine patches, in contrast to EMLA, are easier for patients and providers to apply and have 
demonstrated efficacy in neuropathic pain as well in aesthetic procedures (21 –23). This 
represents a potential option for a topical anesthetic.  
Novel intervention for procedural pain: Topical high frequency vibration combined with topical 
cooling is a novel method to alleviate acute pr ocedural pain. It has been studied and 
implemented largely in the pediatric population. It is thought that mechanoreceptor and noxious 
thermal inhibitory stimulation alter normal pain conduction pathways and offers better pain 
control than cooling alone (24). This combined approach has been found to significantly reduce 
the pain and distress of venipuncture (25). This intervention is the most commonly used non -
pharmacologic intervention for venipuncture pain within our institution’s Children’s Hospital with 
good anecdotal success in reducing pediatric pain. The literature in the adult population of 
combined vibration and cold therapy is much scarcer, but preliminary data suggests  that this 
intervention is beneficial especially in those with greater pre- procedural anxiety and is superior 
to cooling alone (24). A combination of vibration and cooling has not been widely implemented 
in our adult population for any acute procedural pain, making it an underexplored and promising 
area of study. Our initial observations are that application of thi s type of vibration to the 
periareolar breast and even nipple areolar complex is tolerable.      
4. Study Objective and Specific Aims  
Primary Objective: To test the effectiveness of four alternative approaches to topical anesthesia 
on pain associated with radiotracer injection for women diagnosed with breast cancer 
undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping.  
 
Secondary Objectives : 
1. To assess patient satisfaction with pain control  modality  for radiotracer injection.  
2. To identify barriers to implementation of the dif ferent pain control  interventions.  
 
5. Research Design and Methods  
5.1 Study Overview  and Schema  
This is a randomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness of four alternative approaches to topical anesthesia for radiotracer injections for women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing 
sentinel lymph node mapping. We will test two types of topical anesthetic (ice and lidocaine 
patch) with and without the addition of a topical high frequency vibration device (always combined with cooling). Ice is our control group as it reflects current standard of care at our 
institution.

5.3 Screening and recruitment:  
Screening:  
Introduction of the study:  Patients being cared for by breast surgeons within the UW Breast 
Center will be eligible for consideration. Clinic schedules will be reviewed in advance by the 
study team to screen for patients meeting eligibility criteria. Breast surgeons will identify 
additional eligible patients and confirm eligib ility of  patients identified on study team screening.  
Potential participants  will be informed about the study by a member of their clinical care team at 
a standard of care visit or during a standard care phone call. Those interested in learning more 
will be contacted by a member of the study team to further discuss  the study.    
Recruitment:  
The study team will offer all interested patients a study information packet (study information 
sheet, consent form, and baseline Wong -Baker FACES pain rating scale). Interested patients 
can receive the packet via  email, mail, or in -person at a UWHC visit, according to their 
preference. Only study team members will provide these materials to interested patients and/or 
conduct in -depth discussion of the study. The study team will only email a link or electronic 
information packet after discussion of the inherent risks of email transmission of information and 
the patient has verbally consented to email receipt of this information.  
Patients will be informed that final study eligibility will be determined based on the final 
scheduling of their surgical procedure, specifically whether the radiotracer injection is the same day as the surgery.  
7 
 The study team will review the operating room schedules to identify patients undergoing 
standard preoperative radiotracer injection for sentinel lymph node mapping on the same day as 
breast surgery.  
Interested patients who are fully eligible will be contacted by study team members to further 
discuss the study and consent . 5.4 Consent process:  
5.4.1 Patient consent  
We request  a waiver  of signed consent  and alteration  of HIPAA authorization such that 
participant  signature  is not required for consent  and authorization.  Informed  consent  will be 
verbally  obtained and documented  prior to any research activities. After  a patient  expresses  
desire to enroll,  informed  consent  will be obtained.  Patients  will have already  received  a copy  of 
the informed  consent  and authorization document.  If a new copy  is required,  this will be emailed 
or mailed  to the patient  based on their preference.  If the patient will be at the hospital  or clinic  
for another  reason,  they can also obtain a copy  of the consent  and authorization from the study  
team  at that time.  As much  time as needed will be given for potential  subjects  to decide whether  
or not to participate  in this study. Subjects  will be informed that they are not obligated to 
participate  in the study.    
 
Waiver of signed consent:  
The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no 
procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. Use 
of lidocaine patches and the Buzzy device for local pain control are not procedures that require 
written consent under non- research settings. Similarly, the surveys in this protocol present low 
psychological risk and would not require written consent under a non- research setting.  The 
waiver of signed consent will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects. The 
research cannot be practicably carried out without waiver  of signed consent . Not all participants  
will enroll  at the time of initial clinic  visit. For patients  who choose  to enroll  remotely  over the 
phone,  the short  time between surgical  scheduling and surgery  date impedes  their ability  to 
return  a signed consent  before  their surgery  date and therefore  formally  enroll  in the 
study.  Subjects will be provided with a consent document to guide the informed consent process  
and will be given the opportunity to have all questions answered.     
 Alteration of HIPAA Authorization:  
The use of protected health information involves no m ore than minimal risk to the privacy of 
individuals . Data privacy practices will protect identifiers from improper use and disclosure  (see 
11 Records to be kept, Privacy, and Confidentiality ). Identifiers  will be destroyed at the earliest 
opportunity consistent with research conduct. Participants will receive a consent and 
authorization document for their records detailing how protected information will not be reused 
or disclosed. Research cannot be practicably conducted without the alteration of HIPAA 
authorization. Not all participants  will enroll  at the time of initial clinic  visit. For patients who 
choose to enroll  remotely  over the phone,  the short  time between  surgical  scheduling and 
surgery  date impedes  their ability  to return  a signed authorization before  their surgery  date and 
therefore  formally  enroll  in the study. The research cannot be practicably conducted without 
access to and use of protected health information. Protected health information is required to 
access participant medical records for data elements of medical/surgical history and surgery 
data.     
 
8 
 Consent  can occur in one of the following ways:  
1) In-person in the breast center: If the patient agrees to participate in the study after 
discussing with the breast surgeon and would like to undergo informed consent at the 
time of their clinic consultation, informed consent will  be obtained in a closed, private 
room by a member of the study team at the Breast Center.  A verbal consent and 
authorization will be obtained and documented.  The patient will be given a copy of the 
consent form for their records.  Patients will be informed  that their final study eligibility will 
be determined after the surgery is scheduled and it is confirmed that the radiotracer 
injection will happen on the same day as surgery.   
2) In-person at another location in the hospital or clinic: If the patient agree s to participate 
and has another appointment at the UW hospital and clinic, the study team can meet 
with the patient to obtain informed consent. The consent would be obtained in a closed, 
private location by a member of the study team. A verbal consent and authorization will 
be obtained and documented. The patient will be given a copy of the consent form for their records.  
3) By telephone:  The study team will review details of the study with the patient. Patient identity will be verified by verbally stated full name and date of birth.  A verbal consent 
and authorization will be obtained and documented.  
 
 Subjects will receive a copy of the consent form and will be given contact information for study coordinator and PI for any additional questions.  
 
5.5 Randomization : 
After consent for enrollment has been obtained and eligibility confirmed , patients will be 
randomized to one of four intervention arms . Patients will be  strati fied by whether or not they are  
scheduled to undergo a breast radiology procedure (eg. wire localization, seed localization, elucent clip) prior to nuclear medicine injection.  Treatment group allocation will be 
communicated to nuclear medicine providers with a colored paper printout that travels with the 
patient on the day of surgery.  
 
5.6 Study procedures:  
Intervention Arms  
Intervention Group A (control and current standard of care )- Topical cooling:  An ice pack will be 
applied to the upper outer quadrant of the areola/breast for 1.5 minutes immediately prior to 
radiotracer injection(s ). 
Intervention Group B - To pical cooling plus vibration distraction device application:  An ice pack 
will be applied to the upper outer quadrant of the areola for 1.5 minutes immediately prior to 
radiotracer injection. For the last minute, the vibrating distraction device (Buzzy®) will be placed 
over the ice. The vibrating distraction device (Buzzy®) will be moved lateral at the time of the 
surgical prep but kept on the breast during the injection. In the event that a patient requires additional injections f or adequate mapping, as determined by the image interpreting staff, the  
Buzzy® and ice treatment will be repeated prior to each additional injection. 
Intervention Group C- l
 idocaine patch:  A 4% lidocaine patch will be applied in the preoperative 
holding area to the upper outer quadrant at least 1 hour prior to radiotracer injection. Lidocaine 
9 
 patches will be prescribed at the time of study enrollment . If a patient arrives for injection and 
does not have a lidocaine patch in place, they will be treated according to the standard of care  
(ice). In the event that a patient requires additional injections for adequate mapping, as 
determined by the image interpreting staff, the patient will receive the standard of care treatment 
(ice) prior to each additional injection. 
Intervention Group D- lidocaine patch along with topical cooling plus vibration distraction device:  
A 4% lidocaine patch will be applied in the preoperative holding area to the upper outer 
quadrant at least 1 hour prior to radiotracer injection. The patch will be removed and the ice pack will be applied for 1.5 minutes prior to prep. For the last minute, the vibrating distraction 
device (Buzzy®) will be placed over the ice. The vibrating distraction device (Buzzy®) will be 
moved lateral at the time of the surgical prep but kept on the breast during the injection. 
Lidocaine patches will be prescribed at the time of study enrollment.  If a patient arrives for 
injection and does not have a lidocaine patch in place, they will be treated with the Buzzy® and 
ice intervention prior to injection . In the event that a patient requires additional injections for 
adequate mapping, as determined by the image interpreting staff, the Buzzy® and ice treatment will be repeated prior to each additional injecti on.  
Device : 
Buzzy®: The Buzzy® device is IDE exempt under 21 CFR  Part 812.2(c)(2) as an approved 
device being investigated in accordance with its labeling.  Buzzy® has received FDA 510(k) 
clearance for pain control with injections.  Buzzy® is a battery -powered device that produces 
high frequency vibration and is to be combined with a cooling element (e.g. ice pack) when 
applied to the skin for pain control. Buzzy ® is thought to work by simultaneous stimulation of 
mechanoreceptor and noxious thermal inhibitory neurons  which together modulate the 
transmission of pain. (26) 
Drug : 
Lidocaine patch 4% OTC: The patch provides 4g of lidocaine per 100g pat ch and is  applied to 
the skin. This drug is exempt from IND 21 CFR Part 312.2(b)(1)  as a lawfully marketed drug 
used in clinical investigation. This study is not intended to identify  a new indication for the drug 
or for change in drug labeling. This investigation does not involve a route of administration or 
dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.  The 
dosage level used in the study is the standard dosage level of one patch of 4% lidocaine. The 
route of administration is the approved topical route of administration. The patient population in 
the study is not at increased risk from the drug related to any specific population factors.   
5.6.1  Surgical re -scheduling:  
If a participant is enrolled after meeting all eligibility criteria but the surgery is rescheduled, the 
participant’s surgery date eligibility will be re- evaluated. If the participant is rescheduled for 
surgery with same -day preoperative nuclear medicine injection, then study procedures will be 
carried out per protocol. If the participant is rescheduled for surgery with intraoperative nuclear medicine injection, she will be withdrawn from the study as she will be unable to undergo study procedures. If the participant is rescheduled for surgery with a day -before surgery nuclear 
medicine injection she will undergo study  procedures  only if she was originally  randomized to 
either  the ice (arm A) or the ice + buzzy  (Arm  B) arms. If the participant is rescheduled for 
10 
 surgery with a day -before surgery nuclear medicine injection she will be withdrawn from the 
study  if she was originally  randomized to either  the lidocaine patch (arm C) or the lidocaine 
patch + ice + buzzy  (Arm D) arms  as lidocaine patches  cannot  be administered the day before 
surgery  for logistical reasons.  
5.7 Data Collection:  
5.7.1 Patient -level data collection : 
Patient surveys : Patients wil l complete one brief pain assessment and one  survey  during the 
study period.  
Baseline pain assessment : Patients  will complete a baseline pain assessment at the time of 
enrollment using the Wong- Baker FACES pain rating scale (Appendix A). The patients will have 
been given the Wong- Baker FACES pain rating scale at the time of their initial clinic visit. They 
will be referred to this scale during the enrollment phone call, and baseline pain score will be 
recorded .  
Post-procedural survey: Patients will also complete a brief survey (<10 minutes) after the 
radiotracer injection but before initiation of anesthesia (Appendix B) . Patients should complete 
the survey within three hours of receipt  of radiotracer injection. T his will either occur in the 
nuclear medicine suite or in the preoperative holding area with an iPad device or paper/pen. This post -procedural survey has intentionally been kept brief to decrease patient burden, which 
is especially critical as it will be completed on the day of surgery.  
 
Chart review : We will record information including: age, race/ethnicity, medical history of chronic 
pain or fi bromyalgia (yes/no) , history of prior breast and axillary procedures (biopsy, surgery), 
history of prior breast cancer, active narcotic or other pain medication usage ( over the past 
week, use of narcotics including tramadol at least twice weekly and/or daily use of Tylenol, 
NSAIDs, gabapentin, and/or amitriptyline), breast cancer laterality, tumor histology , grade and 
size, clinical and pathologic AJCC 8th edition cancer stage, hormone receptor status (estrogen 
receptor, progesterone receptor, Her2neu), and receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Additionally, we will record any pain medications taken on the day of surgery prior to the arrival to nuclear medic ine (narcotics, Tylenol, NSAIDs, gabapentin, amitriptyline), the time of lidocaine 
patch application, breast radiology procedure prior to nuclear medicine injection, and sentinel lymph node identification on pathology report. We will also record type of radiotracer received.   
 5.7.2 Provider -level data collection: Nuclear medicine staff  surveys : Nuclear medicine 
technologists  will be asked to complete two sets of surveys.  Nuclear medicine faculty will be 
asked to complete the end- of-study survey only.  
Post-procedural survey: The first survey will be to assess the nuclear medicine technologist s’ 
immediate perception of the ease of administration of the intervention and the patient’s post 
procedural pain (Appendix D). Each post -procedural survey will be linked to the patient study ID. 
This will be completed by the technologist assisting with  each enrolled patient.   
 Nuclear Medicine Technologists will be providing ancillary and/or standard of care services  that 
are within their normal scope of clinical practice. As part of their normal scope of practice and standard of care, technologists assist Nuclear Medicine MD, DOs with radiotracer injections and 
associated pain control/pain mitigation procedures. Technologists who assist with study 
participants will b e included in the study team.  
 
11 
 End-of-study survey: We will also administer a brief survey at the end of the trial to the nuclear 
medicine faculty and technologists involved in the radiotracer injection and associated pain 
control for patients on the trial. The nuclear medicine faculty and  technologists will be the staff 
most consistently involved in the injections throughout the study time period and therefore would 
be most reliably able to reflect on implementation of the interventions. (Appendix E).  
Nuclear Medicine faculty are ultimately responsible for and supervise each radiotracer injection 
and associated pain control. They serve an integral role in the conduct of research- specific 
study procedures and are included in the study team.

7. MEAUSRES 
Primary  patient  outcome measure: The Wong -Baker FACES pain rating scale is a standardized 
10-point Likert scale that is validated and has utility for patients with lower health literacy  
(27,28) . It has been used in prior studies assessing pain with radiotracer injection for SLN 
mapping (9–11) (Appendix A) . 
Secondary  patient survey  outcome measures:   
• Short Form McGill questionnaire: This is a validated pain questionnaire taking an 
average of 2 -5 minutes to complete that captures subjective experiences of pain in 
both sensory and affective categories on a 4 -point Likert scale. A total score out of 45 
is calculated with sensory and affective sub-scores (29) and has been used in prior 
studies assessing pain with radiotracer injection for SLN identification (9–11) 
(Appendix B) . 
• We will ask questions to determine whether the patient received their intervention as assigned (Appendix B ). 
• Questions to assess patient experience and satisfaction were drawn from the following:  
o Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS ®) 
questions Surgical Care survey (30)  (Appen dix B).  
o The American Society of Anesthesiologists Satisfaction with Anesthesia 
Questions (31) (Appendix B). 
o Studies of patient experience/satisfaction with local analgesia using validated 
surveys (32–34)(Appendix B) 
• Recommendation of topical anesthetic option: We will ask patients whether they 
would recommend the topical anesthetic option that they received to others (yes/no) and inquire why or why not (open ended) (Appendix B).  
 
Secondary staff outcome measures : 
13 
 • Intervention usability and perceived patient pain:  
o The question to assess intervention usability is adapted from  the Single Ease 
Question developed for assessment of usability after the completion of a task 
(31). The question addressing perceived patient pain utilizes the Numeric 
Rating scale (NRS), a validated pain rating scale used previously in provider assessment of patient pain with radiotracer injection ( 2,32). (Appendix C) 
• End of study assessment:  
o The goal of the survey will be to assess experiences with implementing each 
arm of the study and any identified barriers. Nuclear medicine providers will 
be asked to rank order the usability and perceived efficacy of the different interventions. Space will be provided for open ended comments on benefits 
or barriers related to the interventions. (Appendix D) 
 
8. Statistical Considerations 
8.1 Analysis  
Data will be analyzed with intervention arms masked. All scales will be constructed in a manner 
consistent with scale development, including item non- response. We will compare mean post -
procedural pain scores (primary outcome) and other continuous secondary outcomes with ANOVA, testing the null hypothesis that mean post -procedural pain scores will not statistically 
differ between the control and intervention arms. Pairwise differences between each of the intervention arms and the control arm will be assessed with t -tests . Differences in  potential  
control meas ures between patients randomized to the control and intervention arms that arise 
by chance will be examined using a chi- square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical 
variables and analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal- Wallis test for continuous vari ables 
(depending on distribution), respectively. Should there be significant differences in control 
measures between arms, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess the 
primary outcome, including significant covariates. Differences in the secondary dichotomous 
measures (sentinel lymph node mapping, patient recommendation) will be assessed with Chi -
Square analysis. We will summarize  responses to open ended questions in the patient survey 
and adherence to intervention. All analyses will follow an intention to treat approach.  We will 
summarize  the responses from the nuclear medicine provider s/staff to determine what arm was 
perceived to be the most effective method for pain control and the easiest to administer.  
Secondary analysis will be performed on the type of radiotracer received and pain scores.  8.2 
Sample size  
Power is calculated for our primary outcome variable, the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale. We 
assume patients randomly assigned to the control arm will have a Wong -Baker score consistent 
with scores reported for breast cancer patients in prior studies (mean=6.0, standard 
deviation=2.6) (10)  and that the standard deviation across arms will be similar  (2.6). A 
difference in 2 points in the Wong -Baker score between the standard care /control  arm and the 
arm with the  greatest reduction in pain score is considered clinically significant (27,37,38) . A 
Monte Carlo power simulation of this one- way ANOVA design under an assumption of a sample 
with 40 patients per group, two point difference between usual care and the arm with the 
greatest difference, and alpha=0.05 yields 85% power to detect a difference of 2 points on the 
10-point pain scale. Based on prior experience, we assume an enrollment rate  of 60% 
(accounting for both declining  to participate and drop- out after randomization) and plan to 
approach 270 patients  and enroll 180 patients  to allow for drop out  to a target sample size of 
160 patients.  
9. Registration Procedures 
14 
 Summary accrual information will be entered directly into the UW Paul P. Carbone 
Comprehensive Cancer Center OnCore database by the Study Coordinator.  
 A description of the clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrial s.gov, as required by 
U.S. Law.  
 10. Risks and Discomforts to Research Subjects  
Patients  
Adverse reaction to pain control modality: Patients will be excluded based on presence of 
lidocaine or other local anesthetic allergy /contraindication. However, it is still possible that a 
patient develops an adverse reaction to placement of a lidocaine patch. Patients may also have 
a skin reaction or discomfort associated with other  intervention arm s. Currently, if patients do 
not tolerate ice pack application (the standard of care at the institution), it  can be promptly 
removed. Likewise, patients will be encouraged to communicate any discomfort or intolerance of 
intervention arm , at which time the intervention can be easily and promptly discontinued. We 
anticipate any skin reaction to be self -limited. 
Loss of patient confidentiality: This risk has been minimized through data protection efforts. These include storing data sheets used to collect the clinical information and paper questionnaires in a locked drawer within a locked office when not utilized. Data will ultimately be 
transferred into a password protected database stored on the Department of Surgery server. 
Only individuals  directly involved in the development and analysis of the research project will 
have access to the data.  After transfer of information from the data sheet to the database, all 
data sheets will be destroyed. No direct or identifying PHI will be included in the final analysis or final manuscript.  Patients who wish to sign electronic consent and receive an electronic copy of 
the signed consent will be educated regarding the security risks of transmitting information via email.  
Distress from survey questions: It is unlikely that patients will experience distress associated 
with the pain assessment or satisfaction/experience questions. However, patients will have the 
opportunity to contact study staff regarding any concerns that arise related to the survey questions.  
11. Records to be kept, Privacy, and Confidentiality 
All hard copy research files (including randomization lists, questionnaires, and data collection forms) will be kept in a secure, locked office in a locked filing cabinet and data will be transferred into a password protected computer and database stored on the Department of 
Surgery server. Only the minimum amount of patient and subject data that is necessary to achieve the aims of the research will be collected.   
Patients : Directly identifiable information will not be collected on patient study questionnaires. 
To better protect patient information, electronic study data will be kept in two separate spreadsheets . The first spreadsheet will be a master code that includes the subject’s name and 
medical record and an associated random study subject ID number . This subject ID will be kept 
in a password protected REDcap database on the Department of Surgery server (in a place 
separate from the data collection database). The data collection database will have the subject’s 
ID number only, without subject (patient or provider) identifying information. When questionnaire 
data is then transferred into the database, only the subject ID will be included (no identifying 
information) .  
 
15 
 Only approved study personnel will have access to the identifiers (personnel approved for 
identification and recruitment and interaction with subjects will need access to update the 
master code/spreadsheet). Those who will not be interacting with subjects and/or who are only 
helping with analysis will only have access to the coded study data.  
Nuclear medicine p roviders : Data from the nuclear medicine technologist post-procedure 
surveys will be linked to the patient subject ID. They will not contain additional patient -identifying 
information. These data will be stored on a password protected database on the Department of 
Surgery server . 
After data analysis of the questionnaires is complete and the manuscript has been accepted for 
publication, all hard copies of research files will be destroyed. Other research materials and 
data are maintained in on the secure Department of Surgery server for a minimum of 7 years 
post publication. Data from  this study will be stored for future research projects.  
 12. Data & Safety Monitoring 
The PI and study team will be responsible for data and safety monitoring.  
The PI  and/or  a member of the research team will be available to the patient for any questions 
or concerns related to the study.  Standard quality assurance will be conducted prior to data 
analysis.  
In accordance with federal regulations , the PI will monitor for, review, and promptly report to the 
IRB, appropriate institutional officials, sponsor, coordinating center and the appropriate regulatory 
agency head all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others that occur in the 
course of a subject’s participation in a research study (45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)(i) and 21 CFR 56.108(b)(1)), all AE reports will be reported per the UW IRB policies.
